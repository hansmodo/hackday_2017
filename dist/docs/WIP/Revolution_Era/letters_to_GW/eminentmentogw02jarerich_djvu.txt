FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Yorktown, 9 October, 1777. 

SIR, 

It is with the highest pleasure I comply with the 
order of Congress, in conveying to you the inclosed 
resolve, expressing the thanks of that body to you 
for the wise and well-concerted attack upon the enemy, near Germantown, on the 4th instant, and also 
to the officers and soldiers for their brave exertions 
on that occasion; and I must request you will communicate to them the distinguished mark of the approbation of their country. 

It is indeed true, that the best designs and boldest efforts may sometimes fail of success, through 
unforeseen incidents, yet is it a source of satisfaction 
to reflect, in such instances, that every thing has 
been done to insure success, that human wisdom 
could devise. Something must still be left to fortune. 
It is not in mortals to command success. But permit 
me to say, Sir, you have done more on this occasion ; 
you have deserved it. 

Wishing, with the utmost sincerity, that your great 
and virtuous exertions in the cause of freedom and 
your country may be crowned with victory, I have 
the honor to be, with perfect esteem and respect. Sir, 
Your most obedient, and very humble servant, 

JOHN HANCOCK, President.

FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS, 

Yorktown, 9 October, 1777. 

SIR, 

The absolute necessity of cutting oif all supplies 
and intelligence from the enemy, in and near the 
city of Philadelphia, and thereby preventing any 
intercourse between them and the disaffected in the 
State of Pennsylvania and elsewhere, has induced 
the Congress to adopt the inclosed resolves, in hopes, 
if possible, to put an effectual stop to a practice so 
extremely dangerous to the cause of America. They 
have, for this end, authorized you to sentence, by 
court-martial, any person convicted of either of the 
above-mentioned offences, or of acting as a guideor pilot, to suffer death, or such other punishment 
as may be thought adequate, provided he is taken 
within thirty miles of any town in Pennsylvania, Jersey, or Delaware, that is in possession of the enemy. 
They have also recommended to the good people of 
this and the other States to be vigilant in apprehending and securing all such persons as may be 
caught in the violation of the inclosed resolves, to 
which I beg leave to refer your attention. 

Your favor of the 5th instant was duly received, 
and immediately laid before Congress. I have the 
honor to be, with the greatest respect, Sir, 

Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
JOHN HANCOCK, President.

FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Yorktown, 12 October, 1777. 

SIR, 

I have nothing in charge from Congress, at this 
time, but to transmit the inclosed resolves, and to re 
quest your attention to them. 

The information that the enemy have, ai different 
times, compelled our troops, who are prisoners with 
them, to labor, and that a number are at this time 
actually engaged in throwing up some works at and 
near Kensington, is of such a nature that Congress 
think it incumbent on them to inquire into the truth 
of it. They have, therefore, directed that a flag be 
immediately despatched to General Howe, to know 
whether there is any foundation for the report; and 
I am to request you will send a flag for this purpose 
as soon as you conveniently can. M. Le Balme having desired leave of Congress to resign his commission as Inspector of the cavalry, they have accordingly complied with his request. I have the honor 
to be, with the utmost respect, Sir, 

Your most obedient and very humble servant, 

JOHN HANCOCK, President. 



FROM COLONEL CHRISTOPHER GREENE. 

Fort at Red Bank, 14 October, 1777. 
MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 

I arrived here on Saturday last with my regiment. 
They were much fatigued with the march, as I forced 
thirty-five miles one day. They are now in high 
spirits, and go to their duty with the greatest cheerfulness. The inclosed return shows our strength. I 
have found it necessary to contract the fort, but it is 
IIOAV too large for our numbers, as we have very lit 
tle to expect from the militia. 

I saw General Newcomb last evening. He informs 
me that the small number now on duty expect to 
return home in a day or two ; those that relieve them 
expect to be relieved in three days. The General 
thinks your Excellency s intentions were, for the 
militia only to help complete the fort ; after that, to 
fall on the rear of the enemy, in case of an attack. 
Should we be attacked, they must be so scattered as 
to be able to give us little or no assistance. 

The strength of the navy, and of Fort Mifflin, yourExcellency will have by the express who bears this, 
from the officers commanding them. They are certainly very w r eak for so important a post. I have 
already, and shall still give them all the assistance 
in my power. Could your Excellency give us the 
assistance of Colonel Angell s regiment, I doubt not 
this post would be secure, without dependence on 
militia. If they are to be relieved in the manner I 
understand they are, it is my opinion they will do 
us no service. General Newcomb gives very little 
encouragement of any to supply the place of those 
that are going off the ground. Could we be reenforced, we probably might frustrate the enemy s designs in three batteries they are erecting against 
Fort Mifflin, and so near as to do much injury when 
opened. 

I find it necessary, for the security of the post, to 
keep my men all on fatigue daily. This I doubt will 
cause them to be less spirited in action, if I should 
be under the necessity to continue it, which must be 
the case, unless I am reenforced. The post I have in 
charge I am determined to defend, with the small 
number I command, to the last extremity ; yet I 
doubt my number is much too small to answer yourExcellency s expectations. I am, with the greatest 
respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

CHRISTOPHER GREENE. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL PUTNAM. 

Fishkill, 1C October, 1777. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I have been honored with the receipt of your two 
favors of the 8th, and imagine before this you have 
received mine of the same date, containing the disagreeable intelligence of the loss of Fort Montgomery, 
after a most spirited defence, and of our evacuating 
Peekskill in consequence thereof. I congratulate you 
on the bravery of your troops in attacking and put 
ting to flight the British army, and regret the unfavorable circumstance that prevented its terminating 
in a complete victory. 

Last Monday, General Parsons, with about two 
thousand troops, marched down and took possession 
of. Peekskill and the passes in the Highlands. He 
has taken a number of cattle, horses, and sheep, that 
were collected by the enemy. The enemy have burnt 
the buildings and barracks at the Village,* and several 
dwelling-houses at Peekskill. They have demolished 
Forts Montgomery and Constitution, and are repairing Fort Clinton. Yesterday, about forty sail passed 
up the river, crowded with troops, and are now at 
anchor above Poughkeepsie, the wind not favoring. 
We were on our march after them, when I met the 
agreeable intelligence of the surrender of General 
Burgoyne and his army, as prisoners of war, a copy 
of which is inclosed ; and thereupon I do most sin 
cerely congratulate your Excellency. 

I have halted my troops, and am now considering 
what ought to be my next movement, I have sent 
to General Clinton for his opinion on the subject, 
and ordered General Parsons to spare no pains to 
find the situation and strength of the garrison at 
King s Bridge, in order to direct my future opera 
tions most advantageously. I have about six thou 
sand troops, who are chiefly militia. I understand 
that General Campbell was killed at Fort Montgomery/ and several field-officers, and others of inferior 
rank. 

The enemy s loss, by the last accounts I have been 
able to get, is very considerable ; not less than a 
thousand. The two Continental frigates, and the rowgalley which lay above Fort Montgomery, were burnt, 
to prevent their falling into the hands of the enemy, 
for which I am very sorry, as one, I believe, might 
have been saved. 

I have the unhappiness to inform you, that Mrs. 
Putnam, after a long and tedious illness, departed 
this life last Tuesday night. With the highest esteem 
and respect, I am, dear Sir, 

Your most obedient, humble servant, 

ISRAEL PUTNAM. 




FROM LIEUTENANT-COLONEL SAMUEL SMITH. 

Fort Mifflin, 16 October, 1777; 

5 o clock, P. M. 

The enemy have opened three batteries on us. One, 
in front of the pest-houses, which, with Precache s, 
rakes the whole garrison, from whence they throw 
red-hot balls, as yet without success. Another, in rearof our north-west block-house, in which they have 
some royals, an eight-inch howitzer, one piece of artillery, twelve-pounder. I believe, the other, in rearof the mud-battery, in which, as yet, they have but 
one eight-inch howitzer ; but it is lengthened so as 
to mount a pair of cannon. The large battery, on the 
height to the left of Guyer s house, is not yet opened ; 
they have staked out a large piece of work to the 
left of that, and thrown up some dirt. 

What their intentions are by that, I cannot tell; 
but I am of opinion they will not attempt any thing 
effectual until their shipping opens the chevaiix-de-frise, 
and then make the attack all together. My reason 
is, that they relieve the party here from time to 
time, which I am convinced is not more on Province 
Island than five hundred, and which agrees with the 
number said to have been sent from Germantown. 
Certain I am, we have a new set of men. Their men 
are so detached from each other that I think it would 
not be a difficult matter to raise our siege by the Blue 
Bell. One party, the largest, extends from Guyer s 
house, a quarter of a mile to our left, in barns; the 
other, opposite to our rear; and the other, about the 
pest-houses. We might make a diversion from this 
garrison. Could we once oblige them to raise the 
siege, I am persuaded they have met with so many 
difficulties, they would not again attempt it. 
The shipping are very busy endeavouring to raise 
the chevaux-dc-frise. What success they have had, we 
know not. However, if undisturbed (which is the 
case), it must at length be effected. Want of ammunition obliges us to leave them undisturbed ; else, per 
haps, we might dismount their pieces. When Colonel 
Angell comes, we shall be able to assist each other 
effectually. Colonel Greene s reenforcement of onehundred and fifty are on their way over now. I presume it will be sufficient, if the galleys give us the 
assistance in their power. I have the honor to be, 
Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

SAMUEL SMITH. 

P. S. I should be extremely obliged, if my letters 
from Maryland were forwarded. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Yorktown, 17 October, 1777.* 

SIR, 

It is now above twd years since I have had the 
honor of presiding in Congress ; and I should esteem 
myself happy to have it in my power to render further service to my country in that department ; but 
the decline of health, occasioned by so long and unremitting an application to the duties of my office, 
both in Congress and out of Congress, joined to the 
situation of my own private affairs, has, at length, 
taught me to think of retiring for two or threemonths ; and I have determined to take my leave 
the ensuing week, and set out immediately for Boston after this express returns. 

As the Congress will doubtless proceed to appoint 
a successor in my stead, on him, therefore, will devolve the business of the chair. It will fall within 
the line of his duty to keep up that connection and 
correspondence with you, which has heretofore been 
mine; and I sincerely hope he may do it, as well as 
discharge every other duty incident to the office, 
with more advantage than I have done. Upon the 
review, however, of the intercourse that has subsisted 
between us, I cannot avoid saying, that I feel a 
great degree of pleasure in having, to the utmost of 
my power, endeavoured to execute the business committed to my care, and in a particular manner with 
regard to the army under your command. I flatter 
myself my conduct, in this instance, will meet with 
your approbation. The politeness and attention I have 
ever experienced from you, in the course of our correspondence, will always be a source of the most pleasing satisfaction to me. 

As it is probable I shall meet with some difficulty 
in crossing the North River, and shall run a con 
siderable risk in passing through some Tory towns 
on the east side, I must ask the favor of you to 
give me authority to order a few light-horse from 
thence, to escort me through that part of the country. I apprehend I may safely go from hence to the 
North River, though I should be happy in having 
your opinion, and as to the best route. 

On my arrival in Boston, I shall think myself happy to be favored with any commands from you; and 
should any thing of a public nature occur, I will do 
myself the honor of letting you hear from me. 

With the most sincere wishes that you may soon 
triumph over the enemies of America, and meet with 
every public and private prosperity, and with the ut 
most respect, I am, Sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

JOHN HANCOCK.* 



FROM RICHARD HENRY LEE. 

York, 20 October, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

Your favor of the 17th I received yesterday, and 
was a good deal surprised to find you had been told 
that Congress had appointed General Conway a MajorGeneral. No such appointment has been made ; nor 
do I believe it will, while it is likely to produce the 
evil consequences you suggest. It is very true, that 
both within and without doors, there have been advocates for the measure ; and it has been affirmed that 
it would be very agreeable to the army, whose favor 
ite Mr. Conway was asserted to be. My judgment 
on this business was not formed until I received yourletter. I am very sure Congress would not take any 
step that might injure the army, or even have a ten 
dency that way; and I verily believe they wish to 
lessen your difficulties by every means in their power, 
from an entire conviction that the purest motives of 
public good direct your actions. 

The business of a Board of War is so extensive, 
so important, and demanding such constant attention, 
that Congress see clearly the necessity of constituting 
a new Board, out of Congress, whose time shall be 



* President Hancock took leave of Congress on the 29th of October. 
His address on the occasion may be found in the Journals, October 3lst. 
Henry Laurens, of South Carolina, was chosen his successor on the 1st 
of November. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. H 

entirely devoted to that essential department. It 
is by some warmly proposed that this Board shall 
be filled by the three following gentlemen; Colonel 
Reed, Colonel Pickering, the present Adjutant-General, and Colonel Harrison, your Secretary 5 and that 
General Conway be appointed Adjutant-General, in the 
room of Colonel Pickering. It is my wish, and I am 
sure it is so of many others, to know your full and 
candid sentiments on this subject. For my own part, 
I cannot be satisfied with giving any opinion on the 
point until I am favored with your sentiments, which 
I shall be much obliged to you for, Sir, as soon as 
your time will permit. It has been affirmed that 
General Conway would quit the service if he were 
not made a Major-General. But I have been told, in 
confidence, that he would leave it at the end of this 
campaign, if he was appointed, unless his word of 
honor were taken to continue for any fixed time. 
And it is a question with me, whether the advocates 
for General Conway will not miss their aim, if he 
should be appointed Adjutant-General, unless he has 
the rank of Major-General also. My reason for thinking so is, that I have been informed General Conway 
desires to retire to his family, provided he can carry 
from this country home with him a rank that will 
raise him in France.* 

It is very certain that the public good demands a 
speedy erecting and judicious filling of the new Board 
of War ; and I sincerely wish it may be done in the 
most proper manner. I do not imagine Congress 
would appoint Colonel Harrison without first knowing whether you could spare him; nor do I think 
that so important an office as that of Adjutant-General should be touched without maturest consideration. 

We every moment expect the express, with an ac 
count that will enable us to congratulate you on the 
surrender of General Burgoyne, and the remains of 
his shattered army. This will be one of the Prussian 
sixes, and I augur that the other will soon cast up 
upon the Delaware. 

I am, with sincerest wishes for your health and 
success, dear Sir, 

Your most affectionate and obedient servant, 

RICHARD HENRY LEE. 



FROM COMMODORE HAZELWOOD.^ 

Red Bank, 23 October, 1777. 
MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 

This will acquaint your Excellency that, early this 
morning, w r e carried all our galleys to action, and, 
after a long and heavy firing, we drove the enemy s 
ships down the river, except a sixty-four gun ship, 
and a small frigate, which we obliged them to quit, 
as they got on shoi*e ; and, by accident, the sixtyfour gun ship blew up, and the frigate they set on 
fire themselves, took the people all out, and quitted 
them. Our action lasted till twelve o clock, and ourfleet has received but very little damage. 

You will be informed of the glorious event of last 
night, by Colonel Greene. !" We, in our galleys, were

armed vessels in the Delaware.

event, written at the request of Colonel Greene, who commanded in the 
fort, may be seen in Washington s Writings, Vol. V. p. 112. 
of great use in flanking round the fort. As I am 
very much fatigued, I hope your Excellency will be 
satisfied with this short account of our affairs of the 
river and fleet. I have not, as yet, got a man to 
reenforce our fleet, for I thought it a pity to take 
them from the fort, as they wanted them more than 
the fleet ; and, God knows, we are very weakly 
manned. Being in haste, I hope soon I shall have it 
in my power to give you a better account of this 
action. Besides the sixty-four and frigate being burnt, 
the Roebuck, which lay to cover them, we damaged 
much, and drove off, and, had she laid fast, we should 
have had her in the same situation. We want ammunition, cartridges for muskets, for eighteen and twentyfour pounders. Having nothing to add, I am yourExcellency s 

Most obedient, and very humble servant, 

JOHN HAZELWOOD. 



FROM COLONEL WILKINSON. 

Easton, 24 October, 1777. 

Sm, 

I have this moment arrived here, on my way to 
Congress, with despatches from Major-General Gates ; 
and, being uncertain whether your Excellency is apprised of the fact, I think it my duty to congratulate you on Lieutenant-General Burgoyne s surrender 
to the American arms. This fortunate event took 
place on the 17th instant, and put us in possession 
of six General Officers, five thousand combatants, five 
thousand stands of arms, and twenty-seven pieces of 
well-sorted brass ordnance, with fixed ammunition, 
complete. 

VOL. n. 2 
I have the further pleasure to assure your Excel 
lency, that we have made, during the campaign, up 
wards of two thousand discretional prisoners, among 
whom are several field-officers, and a large proportion 
of subordinate ones. The most material article in the 
convention between Major-General Gates and Lieutenant-General Burgoyne, is, that the latter, with his 
army, is allowed to return to Great Britain, on parole 
not to bear arms against America during the present 
contest. 

The incendiary crew from New York continue to 
ravage the banks of the North River. The dwellings of Judge Livingston and Mrs. Montgomery have, 
among many others, shared the fate of [Kingston.]* 

I have the honor to be your Excellency s 

Obliged, obedient, and ready servant, 

JAMES WILKINSON. 



FROM THOMAS WHARTON. 

In Council, Lancaster, 24 October, 1777. 

SIR, 

I had the honor of receiving your favor of the 
17th instant, which was immediately laid before the 
Council. 

In consequence of this application we have ordered 
out two classes of militia, offering an exemption from 
their fines to such delinquents of the former classes 
as can be prevailed upon to join them, and have in 
vited all, of every class, to turn out as volunteers. 
The Lieutenants have orders, if they do not find 
these two classes turn out generally, to order to 
camp the next two succeeding classes. To encourage 
the people to exert themselves with alacrity, we 
have published an address, offering every motive we 
could suggest, to stimulate our constituents to their 
duty. What numbers may be drawn forth into service, in consequence of these measures, we cannot 
possibly ascertain with precision; but believe they 
will be more than we can possibly arm. If you 
should think proper to encourage our calling forth 
unarmed men, under the prospect of their finding 
arms at camp, we will endeavour to do more; but, 
from the view your letter presents of the want of that 
necessary article with you, we think it unnecessary 
to take further measures, at present, to draw forth a 
multitude of people who cannot afford any service. 

The other important subject, mentioned in yourletter, of taking measures for completing our Continental battalions, I shall communicate to the Legislature as soon as they meet. 

I have the honor to be, &c., 

THOMAS WHARTON, JR. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL PUTNAM. 

Fishkill, 25 October, 1777. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I have been honored with the receipt of your two 
favors of the 15th and 19th instant; and have the 
pleasure to acquaint you that, after a tedious march, 
we are returned to this place ; the fleet passed down 
by here yesterday, and did but little damage on their 
return. 

Some heavy artillery, and a reinforcement of Continental troops, I am informed by General Grates, are 
on their way to join me. By a deserter, and two of 
our people who escaped from the enemy at Yerplanck s Point, day before yesterday, I am informed 
that four regiments are gone from New York to ree nforce General Howe, which caused General Yaughan s 
hasty return down the river, probably to increase the 
reenforcement, as fifteen hundred of the York militia 
are ordered to be drafted, to supply their place at 
New York. I trust and hope the succour they are 
sending will arrive too late to relieve General Howe. 
We have collected twenty-three boats that escaped 
the enemy, some of which want repairing, besides the 
boats supposed to be left up Esopus Creek, and the 
new galley, which have not been reconnoitred. 1 
shall order the boats that want repairing to be re 
paired, and some new ones to be built immediately. 
With esteem and respect, I am, affectionately, 
Your most obedient, humble servant, 

ISRAEL PUTNAM. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL HEATH. 

Head-Quarters, Boston, 25 October, 1777. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

We find, by the destination of the prisoners of 
General Burgoyne s army to this neighbourhood, a 
wide and difficult field opens to us. To providequarters, provisions, fuel, &c., for five or six thousand 
men, will be no small task. The Assembly suppose 
them to be under my direction, and have advised 
that they be placed in the barracks on Prospect and 
Winter Hills, Cambridge, and Sewell s Point- and, 
indeed, I do not see where else they can be quartered, if they are to remain together, and near this 
place. I have applied for a thousand or twelve hundred men for guards and am determined, on the onehand, to treat them with politeness and humanity, 
and, on the other, with precaution and strict order. 
But I must entreat your Excellency s endeavours to 
facilitate their removal as soon as possible, as their 
continuance, for any considerable time, will greatly 
distress the inhabitants, both as to provisions and 
fuel, especially the latter. 

Wood is now twelve or fourteen dollars per cord, 
on the wharves, and the inhabitants cannot obtain a 
supply at that price. So many of the coasters are 
taken by the enemy s cruisers, that they are become 
very unwilling to run the risk of falling into their 
hands. I submit to your Excellency the propriety 
and expediency of obtaining a protection from Lord 
Howe for such a number of vessels as may be 
thought necessary to supply the prisoners, from the 
eastern country. If some such method cannot be devised, I do not at present see how it can be obtained. I have wrote to Congress on the subject, and 
would also request your Excellency s direction as 
soon as may be convenient .to you. As soon as the 
disposition of, and regulations for, the prisoners are 
made, I will transmit them to your Excellency. It 
will be necessary, if practicable, to convey a quantity 
of flour this way. I have the honor to be, with 
great respect, 

Your Excellency s obedient servant, 

WILLIAM HEATH. 



2* 
FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Yorktown, Pennsylvania, 25 October, 1777. 

SIR, 

I was duly honored with your favor of the 22d. 
and am much obliged by the expressions of politeness 
and friendship which it contains. A few months re 
laxation will, I hope, restore my health and constitution, and enable me still to contribute my feeble 
efforts, in some mode or other, to the advancement of 
the cause of freedom in America, If I should not 
return to Congress, it will be the height of my inclination, as it will also be in my power, to render 
some service to the general interest in my own native 
country. 

As I propose setting out on Monday, and shall go 
through Bethlehem, I must request that the escort of 
horse you so politely offered to attend me, may meet 
me there. Should I reach Bethlehem before them, I 
shall wait their arrival. In the present critical state 
of our affairs, I believe I should decline setting out 
for a few days ; but, having wrote to Mrs. Hancock 
to meet me at some distance from Boston, I am 
under a necessity of beginning my journey on Monday morning. I am, dear Sir, with great esteem and 
regard, 

Your most obedient and most humble servant, 

JOHN HANCOCK, President. 



FROM COMMODORE HAZELWOOD. 

On board the Chatham Galley, 26 October, 1777. 

SIR, 

By your Excellency s pressing, in your last letter, 
so much for my keeping up harmony with the fleet 
and army, I apprehended some letters had been wrote, 
as though a difference subsisted here. As to my 
own part, I can lay my hand on my heart, and declare, I have taken every step in my power to 
keep from the least shadow of a difference, and did 
not know that any one had the least complaint to 
make, among the Continental fleet or army, as I had 
not ever heard the least mention of any such thing, 
and perfect harmony always appearing. Calling on 
Captain Robinson, I found he had wrote a letter to 
your Excellency concerning a Council of War that 
was held, and I am sorry to find he had given such 
a representation of it; and beg leave to relate matters 
as they were. 

On the 19th day of October, I hoisted a signal for 
all Captains to come on board the galley in which 
the flag was hoisted. They came, among whom was 
Captain Robinson, and some other officers of the Con 
tinental fleet. Finding the galley too small, I desired 
the Captains to remove on board the floating battery, 
where we should have more room; and acquainted 
Captain Robinson that my design was to hold a 
Council. He- then replied, he supposed there was no 
occasion for him or his officers. I told him there 
was, and I expected him to attend ; but he left the 
galley, and did not come to the Council. This is 
the state of facts, which he represents as a partial 
and absurd Council ; and says, I knew he would 
not give his consent, when he, nor myself could possibly tell what the determination of the Council would 
be. 

Captain Robinson and myself have always had an 
exceeding good understanding ; but I am. astonished 
at his unkind treatment, in his letter to your Excel 
lency. But, as I look on him as a good officer, this 
shall not in the least interrupt that harmony I have 
hitherto kept with him. 

Your Excellency may be assured that every thing 
that tends to promote peace, good order, and friend 
ship, between me and the officers of the fleet and 
army, shall be done, to the utmost of my power. 

I wrote to your Excellency in my last, of the destruction of the enemy s ships. I shall now be more 
particular. On the 22d, while the fort at lied Bank 
was attacked, the Augusta, of sixty-four guns ; the 
Roebuck, of forty-four ; two frigates ; the Merlin, of 
eighteen, and a galley, came up through the lower 
chevaiix-de-frise, which were attacked by the floatingbatteries and some of the galleys, while the rest of 
the galleys were flanking the enemy that were attacking the fort, where the galleys did much execution. 
As soon as the enemy was repulsed at the fort, the 
ships, finding so hot a fire, endeavoured to fall down, 
but the Augusta and Merlin ran aground. Early next 
morning the galleys and floating batteries attacked 
them, when an incessant fire was kept up. About 
eleven o clock, I believe, one of our shot set the 
August;! on fire, and at twelve, she blew up, beingaground. The engagement still continued with the 
other ships ; and, at three in the afternoon, the Mer 
lin, we think, also took fire and blew up. Then 
the fire ceased on both sides. The Roebuck dropped 
down to the lower chcvaux-de-frisc., and went through. 
Yesterday, I went down to the wrecks, and I. find 
the guns of both ships may be got out, if the enemy s 
ships can be kept at a proper distance. We brought 
off two twenty-four pounders, and, as soon as possible, 
shall endeavour for the rest. 

This day we can see great numbers of the enemy 
crossing Webb s Ferry, and, we are told, they have 
large numbers of fascines with them, by which, I suppose, they intend a grand attack on Fort Mifflin. 
We are also assured, this day, that they landed a 
number of troops at Billingsport, so that we are apprehensive they intend to attack both forts at onetime. 

The fleet is now so poorly manned, and the con 
stant cry from Fort Mifflin is to guard that post, that 
I know not how to act without more assistance. 

Colonels Greene and Angell can spare no men, as 
they are afraid of being attacked ; and as to the 
vessels at Bordentown, I am informed they have not 
twenty private men on board, so that I expect no 
assistance from there. 

This night it blows hard, and I fear the galleys 
will not be able to lay near Fort Mifflin, as, when 
the swell is great, they must get under a safe place. 
Having nothing to add, I am your Excellency s 
Most obedient, and most humble servant, 

JOHN HAZELWOOD. 



FROM GOVERNOR HENRY. 

Williamsburg, 30 October, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

My great anxiety for the success of the American 
arms under your command, induces me to trouble you 
with this. Accounts from the camp are so various 
and contradictory that I know not what to rely on. 
If the weight of public affairs, under which you have 
so long labored, will permit, a few lines will be most 
welcome to me. 

Although it seems impossible to enlist Continental 
recruits here, yet the zeal of our countrymen is great 
and general in the public cause. I wish some proper 
exertions of that spirit were wisely directed to the 
general good. A hint from you may lead to some 
thing important,, at a time like this, when most people seem at a loss to fix on the most effectual means 
of prosecuting the war vigorously. The Assembly is 
now sitting, and I shall take pleasure in communicating to them any matter you judge proper for 
their attention. 

I beg leave to assure your Excellency, that with 
the most unfeigned respect, and the highest regard, 
I am, dear Sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

PATRICK HENRY. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL DICKINSON. 

Elizabctlitown, 1 November, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

Your Excellency s favor of the 27th October, I re 
ceived the 30th ; and should be happy, if I had it in 
my power, to inform you that I w r as preparing for my 
march to the Delaware. 

I mentioned to the Governor and Council the urgent necessity for the immediate compliance with 
your Excellency s request, but have yet received no 
answer ; nor do I believe the orders will be given in 
time to be of any service. There are not more than 
one hundred western militia now at this post; the 
supplies have been drawn from the eastern parts of 
this State. The reports of our intended march to 
Red Bank have lessened the numbers at this post ; 
the troops, being eastern men, not choosing to abandon (as they term it) this part of the State. Mr. 
Boudinot, who is here, and returns to camp in a few 
days, will inform your Excellency the prevailing opinion in East Jersey. Thus it is with militia. They 
will undertake to judge for themselves. Those are 
difficulties and inconveniences your Excellency has 
often had to contend with and submit to, for which I 
am sincerely concerned. Our Governor and Council 
seem inattentive to your request, perhaps from an 
inclination to keep the troops in their present situation. General Winds, with his brigade, has not yet 
returned ; they were at New Windsor by the last 
accounts. 

I would by no means presume to dictate to yourExcellency, but beg leave just to hint, that, if an or 
der was given to Generals Gates and Putnam, to raise 
a number of militia, and make an attack upon LongIsland and New York ; and myself, with what militia 
I could collect from this part of the State, to make 
a descent upon Staten Island, all at the same time, 
whether it would not answer a valuable purpose, 
although we should not all succeed. I have reason 
to believe it is an order that would be obeyed with 
great readiness ; the sooner the better, if it meets 
your Excellency s approbation. I should only require 
a few days notice, having boats now ready to transport five hundred men at a time ; and I am of opinion I could increase my present numbers (about six 
hundred men) to twelve hundred men, upon such an 
occasion ; and if I should be disappointed, I would 
make the attack with whatever numbers I could col 
lect, 

By information that may be depended upon (in my 
opinion), the enemy are embarking troops from New 
York to Staten Island to reenforce Mr. Howe. I 
could, within twenty-four hours, have intelligence conveyed to Mr. Skinner, if your Excellency thought 
proper, that something was intended against .New 
York, &c., which might prevent the re enforcements 
heing sent. 

I have a person now in New York ; he returns 
to-inorrow ; if he brings any thing material, it shall 
he instantly communicated to your Excellency. I 
have the honor to he, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

PHILEMON DICKINSON. 



FROM COLONEL HAMILTON.* 

Head-Quarters, Fishkill, 2 November, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

I lodged last night in the neighbourhood of New 
Windsor. This morning early, I met Colonel Morgan 
with his corps, about a mile from it, in inarch for 
head-quarters. I told him the necessity of making 
all the despatch he could, so as not to fatigue his 
men too much which he has promised to do. 

I understand, from Colonel Morgan, that all the 
Northern army were marching down on both sides the 
river, and would probably be to-morrow at New Wind 
sor and this place; and that General Putnam had 
held a Council for the general disposition of them, in 
which it was resolved to send you four thousand men. 
and to keep the rest on this side the river. I came 
here in expectation that matters were in such a train 
as to enable me to accomplish my errand without 
going any farther, unless it should be to hasten the 
troops that were on their march. But, on my arrival, I learn from Mr. Hughes, an Aid-de-camp of 
General Grates, that the following disposition of the 
Northern army had taken place. 

General Patterson s, Glover s, and Nixon s brigades, 
and Colonel Warner s Mountain Boys to remain in 
and about Albany; barracks building for them. 

General Poor s brigade, marching down this side of 
the river to join General Putnam, will probably be 
here to-morrow. General Learned s brigade, Morgan s 
corps, Warner s brigade of Massachusetts militia, and 
some regiments of New York militia, on their march 
on the west side of the river. 

I have directed General Putnam, in your name, 
to send forward, with all despatch, to join you, the 
two Continental brigades and Warner s militia brigade. 
This last is to serve till the latter end of this month. 
Your instructions did not comprehend any militia; 
but as there are certain accounts here that most of 
the troops from New York are gone to reenforce 
General Howe, and as so large a proportion of the 
Continental troops have been detained at Albany, I 
concluded you would not disapprove of a measure 
calculated to strengthen you, though but for a small 
time, and have ventured to adopt it, on that presumption. 

Being informed, by General Putnam, that General 
Winds, with seven hundred Jersey militia, was at 
King s Ferry, with intention to cross to Peekskill, I 
prevailed upon him to relinquish that idea, and send 
off an immediate order for them to march towards 
Red Bank. 

It is possible, however, unless your Excellency sup 
ports this order by an application from yourself, he 
may march his men home instead of to the place he 
has been directed to repair to. Neither Lee s [nor] 

VOL. II. 3 
Jackson s regiments, nor the detachments belonging 
to General McDougall s division, have yet marched. 
I have pressed their being sent, and an order has 
been despatched for their instantly proceeding. 

Colonel Hughes is pressing some fresh horses for 
me. The moment they are ready, I shall recross the 
river in order to fall in with the troops on the other 
side, and make all the haste I can to Albany, to get 
the three brigades there sent forward. 

Will your Excellency permit me to observe, that I 
have some doubts, under present circumstances and 
appearances, of the propriety of leaving the regiments 
proposed to be left in this quarter? But if my 
doubts on this subject were stronger than they are, I 
am forbid, by the sense of Council, from interfering 
in this matter. I have the honor to be, with the 
warmest esteem and respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 

P. S. General Poor s brigade is just arrived here. 
They will proceed to join you with all expedition. 
So strongly am I impressed with the importance of 
endeavouring to crush Mr. Howe, that I am apt to 
think it would be advisable to draw off all the Con 
tinental troops. Had this been determined on, General 
Warner s sixteen hundred militia might have been 
left here. 



FROM COLONEL HAMILTON. 

Albany, November, 1777. 



DEAR SIR, 
I arrived here yesterday, at noon, and waited upon 
General Gates immediately, on the business of my 
mission ; but was sorry to find his ideas did not correspond with yours for drawing off the number of 
troops you directed. I used every argument in my 
power to convince him of the propriety of the measure ; but he was inflexible in the opinion, that two 
brigades, at least, of Continental troops should remain 
in and near this place. His reasons were, that the 
intelligence of Sir Henry Clinton s having gone to 
join Burgoyne was not sufficiently authenticated to 
put it out of doubt ; that there was, therefore, a possibility of his returning up the river, which might ex 
pose the finest arsenal in America (as he calls the 
one here) to destruction, should this place be left so 
bare of troops as I proposed ; and that the w r ant of 
conveniences, and the difficulty of the roads, would 
make it impossible to remove the artillery and stores 
here for a considerable time ; that the New England 
States would be left open to the depredations and 
ravages of the enemy; that it would put it out of 
his power to enterprise any thing against Ticonderoga, which, he thinks, might be done in the winter, 
and which he considers it of importance to under 
take. 

The force of the reasons did by no means strike 
me, and I did every thing in my power to show 
they were unsubstantial; but all I could effect, was 
to have one brigade despatched, in addition to those 
already marched. I found myself infinitely embarrassed, and was at a loss how to act. I felt the importance of strengthening you as much as possible ; 
but, on the other hand, I found insuperable inconveniences in acting diametrically opposite to the 
opinion of a gentleman, whose successes have raised 
him into the highest importance. General Gates has 
won the entire confidence of the Eastern States. If 
disposed to do it, by addressing himself to the prejudices of the people, he would find no difficulty to 
render a measure odious, which, it might be said 
with plausibility enough to be believed, was calculated to expose them to unnecessary danger, notwithstanding their exertions during the campaign had 
given them the fullest title to repose and security. 
General Gates has influence and interest elsewhere ; 
he might use it, if he pleased, to discredit the measure there also. On the whole, it appeared to me 
dangerous to insist on sending more troops from 
hence, while General Gates appeared so warmly op 
posed to it. Should any accident or inconvenience 
happen in consequence of it, there would be too fair 
a pretext for censure ; and many people are too w^ell 
disposed to lay hold of it. At any rate, it might be 
considered as using him ill, to take a step so con 
trary to his judgment^ in a case of this nature. 

These considerations, and others which I shall be 
more explicit in, when I have the pleasure of seeing 
you, determined me not to insist upon sending either 
of the other brigades remaining here. I am afraid 
what I have done may not meet with your approbation, as not being, perhaps, fully warranted by 
your instructions ; but I ventured to do what I 
thought right, hoping that, at least, the goodness of 
my intention will excuse the error of my judgment. 

I was induced to this relaxation the more readily, 
as I had directed to be sent on two thousand militia, 
which were not expected by you, and a thousand 
Continental troops out of those proposed to be left 
with General Putnam, which I have written to him, 
since I found how matters were circumstanced here. 
to forward to you with all despatch. I did this for 
several reasons; because your reinforcement would 
be more expeditious from that place than from this; 
because two thousand Continental troops at Peekskill 
will not be wanted, in the present circumstances, 
especially as it was really necessary to have a body 
of Continental troops at this place for the security 
of the valuable stores here ; and I should not, if I 
had my wish, think it expedient to draw off more 
than two of the three brigades now here. This being 
the case, one of the ends you proposed to be an 
swered by leaving the ten regiments with General 
Putnam, will be equally answered by the troops here ; 
I mean that of covering and satisfying the Eastern 
States ; and one thousand Continental troops, in ad 
dition to the militia collected and that may be col 
lected there, will be sufficient in the * Highlands for 
covering the country down that way, and carrying 
on the works necessary to be raised for the defence 
of the river. 

The troops gone, and going, to reenforce you, are 
near five thousand, rank and file, Continental troops, 
and twenty-five hundred Massachusetts and New Hamp 
shire militia. These, and the seven hundred Jersey 
militia, will be a larger reinforcement than you ex 
pected, though not quite an equal number of Continental troops, nor exactly in the way directed. General Lincoln tells me the militia are very excellent; 
and though their times will be out by the last of 
this month, you will be able, if you think proper, to 
order the troops still remaining here, to join you by 
the time their term of service expires. 

I cannot forbear being uneasy lest my conduct 
should prove displeasing to you; but I have donewhat, considering all circumstances, appeared to me 
most eligible and prudent. I have the honor to be. 
with great esteem and respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 

P. S. Vessels are preparing to carry the brigadeto New Windsor, which will embark this evening. 
I shall, this afternoon, set out on my return to camp, 
and, on my way, shall endeavour to hasten the troops 
forward. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL PUTNAM. 

Fishkill, 7 November, 1777. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

Yours of the 31st October and 1st November, I 
have been favored with, and have taken the neces 
sary precautions that your army should be supplied 
with provisions. 

In my last, I informed you that General Warner s 
brigade were ordered to join you ; but, as they are 
raised only till the 1st of December, the officers and 
men think it exceeding hard that they should be 
obliged to make that long march, and their times out 
soon after they could reach you. I have, in conse 
quence of their request, detained them here, to make 
obstructions in the river. Governor Clinton and my 
self have been down to view the forts, and are both 
of opinion that a boom, thrown across at Fort Consti 
tution, and a battery on each side the river, would 
answer a much better purpose than at Fort Mont 
gomery; as the garrison would be reenforced by militia with more expedition, and the ground much 
more definable. 
All these circumstances considered, we have con 
cluded to obstruct the navigation at the former place, 
and shall go about it immediately. 

The cannon that were left at the forts are rendered entirely useless, except six twelve-pounders at 
Fort Constitution- and these are spiked, and the 
trunnions broke off, but may be stocked, so as to 
answer the purpose tolerably well. 

I yesterday received a letter from Colonel Hamil 
ton, dated at Albany, ordering me to send forward 
one thousand more Continental troops than was pro 
posed when he was here ; this will leave me with 
about three hundred Continental troops, and no mili 
tia except those whose times are out the first of De 
cember, to cover all this distressed country. I do not 
think I can justify myself in this, without first ac 
quainting you; and, if I then have your Excellency s 
orders, I will, with pleasure, immediately and prompt 
ly comply with them. 

I am sorry to inform you that, for want of pay, 
General Poor s brigade of Continental troops have 
refused to cross the North River. The troops mu 
tinied, the officers endeavouring to suppress them, 
and they so determined to go home, that a Captain, 
in the execution of his duty, ran a soldier through 
the body, who soon expired, but not before he shot 
the Captain through, who is since dead. I have got 
several of them in provost guard, and a general Courtmartial sitting for their trial. About twenty of them 
have made their escape, and gone home. I have sent 
off some light-horse, and officers of the brigade, to 
bring them back. In order to make peace, and reenforce you as soon as possible, I am endeavouring 
to borrow about one thousand or fifteen hundred 
pounds, to give them a month s pay. In the mean 
time they are curing themselves of the itch. As soon 
as this operation is over, they will march immedi 
ately. This, I acknowledge, is a bad precedent, but it 
is a worse one to keep troops ten months without pay. 
This department is absolutely in distress for money, 
and the necessary business cannot be carried on with 
out a supply is immediately sent. I am, dear General, 
very respectfully, 

Your most obedient servant, 

ISRAEL PUTNAM. 

P. S. I have just received information from Generals Dickinson arid Parsons, that Sir Henry Clinton 
has embarked about six thousand troops as a ree nforcement for General Howe ; they have not yet sailed. I shall go down to White Plains this afternoon, 
to make a show there. Possibly this will prevent 
their going so soon as they would otherwise, if at 
all. 



FROM COLONEL HAMILTON. 

New Windsor, 10 November, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

I arrived here last night from Albany. Having 
given General Gates a little time to recollect himself, 
I renewed my remonstrances on the necessity and 
propriety of sending you more than one brigade of 
the three he had detained with him, and finally prevailed upon him to give orders for Glover s, in addition to Patterson s brigade, to march this way. As 
it was thought conducive to expedition to send the 
troops by water, as far as it could be done, I pro 
cured all the vessels that could be had at Albany fit 
for the purpose, but could not get more than suffi 
cient to take in Patterson s brigade. It was embarked the 7th instant, and I expected would have been 
here before this, but the wind has been contrary, 
though they must, in all probability, be here to-day. 
General Glover s brigade marched at the same time 
on the east side of the river, the road being much 
better there than on this side. I am this moment 
informed that one sloop, with a part of Patterson s, 
is arrived, and that the others are in sight. They 
will immediately proceed by water to King s Ferry, 
and thence take the shortest route to you. 

I am pained, beyond expression, to inform your Ex 
cellency that, on my arrival here, I find every thing 
has been neglected and deranged by General Putnam, 
and that the two brigades, Poor s and Learned s, still 
remained here and on the other side the river at 
Fishkill. Colonel Warner s militia, I am told, have 
been drawn to Peekskill, to aid in an expedition 
against New York, which, it seems, is at this time the 
hobby-horse with General Putnam. Not the least at 
tention has been paid to my order, in your name, for 
a detachment of one thousand men from the troops 
hitherto stationed at that post. Every thing is sacrificed to the whim of taking New York. 

The two brigades of Poor and Learned, it appears, 
would not march for want of money and necessaries, 
several of the regiments having received no pay for 
six or eight months past. There has been a high 
mutiny among the former on this account, in which a 
Captain killed a man, and was shot himself by his 
comrade. These difficulties, for want of proper ma 
nagement, have stopped the troops from proceeding. 
Governor Clinton has been the only man who has 
done any thing towards removing them ; but, for want 
of General Putnam s cooperation., has not been able 
to effect it. He has only been able to prevail with 
Learned s brigade to agree to march to Goshen, in 
hopes, by getting them once on the go, to get them 
to continue their march. On coming here, I immedi 
ately sent for Colonel Bayley, who now commands 
Learned s brigade ; and have gotten him to engage 
for carrying the brigade on to head-quarters as fast 
as possible. This he expects to effect by means of 
live or six thousand dollars, which Governor Clinton 
was kind enough to borrow for me, and which Colonel 
Bayley thinks will keep the men in good humor till 
they join you. They marched this morning towards 
Goshen. 

I shall, as soon as possible, see General Poor, and 
do every thing in my power to get him along. I 
hope I shall be able to succeed. 

The plan I before laid having been totally deranged, a new one has become necessary. It is now 
too late to send Warner s militia. By the time they 
get to you, their term of service would be out. The 
motive for sending them, which was to give you a 
speedy reenforcement, has, by the past delay, been 
superseded. By Governor Clinton s advice, I have 
sent an order, in the most emphatical terms, to General 
Putnam, immediately to despatch all the Continental 
troops under him to your assistance ; and to detain 
the militia instead of them. 

My opinion is, that the only present use for troops 
in this quarter is to protect the country from the 
depredations of little plundering parties, and for carrying on the works necessary for the defence of the 
river. Nothing more ought to be thought of. It is 
only wasting time, and misapplying men, to employ 
them in a fancied parade against New York; for in 
this it will undoubtedly terminate. New York is no 
object, if it could be taken ; and, to take it, would 
require more men than could be spared from more 
substantial purposes. Governor Clinton s ideas coin 
cide with mine. He thinks that there is no need of 
more Continental troops here than a few to give a 
spur to the militia in working upon the fortifications. 
In pursuance of this, I have given the directions be 
fore mentioned ; if General Putnam attends to them, 
the troops under him may be with you nearly as 
early as any of the others (though he has unluckily 
marched them down to Tarrytown), and General Glo 
ver s brigade, when it gets up, will be more than suffi 
cient to answer the purposes of this post. 

If your Excellency agrees with me in opinion, it 
will be w r ell to send instant directions to General Put 
nam to pursue the objects I have mentioned; for I 
doubt whether he will attend to any thing I shall 
say, notwithstanding it comes in the shape of a posi 
tive order. I fear, unless you interpose, the works 
here will go on so feebly, for want of men, that they 
will not be completed in time ; whereas, it appears to 
me of the utmost importance they should be pushed 
with the utmost vigor. Governor Clinton will do 
every thing in his power. I wish General Putnam 
was recalled from the command of this post, and Go 
vernor Clinton would accept it. The blunders and ca 
prices of the former are endless. 

Believe me, Sir, nobody can be more impressed 
with the importance of forwarding the reinforcements 
coming to you, with all speed, nor could anybody 
have endeavoured more to promote it than I have 
done ; but the ignorance of some, and the design of 
others, have been almost insuperable obstacles. I am 
very unwell; but I shall not spare myself to get 
things immediately in a proper train; and, for that 
purpose, intend, unless I receive other orders from yon, 
to continue with the troops in the progress of their 
march. As soon as I get General Poor s brigade in 
march, I shall proceed to General Putnam at Peekskill. I have the honor to be, with much regard and 
respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 



FROM COLONEL HAMILTON. 

New Windsor, 12 November, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have been detained here these two days by a 
fever, and violent rheumatic pains throughout my 
body. This has prevented my being active in person 
for promoting the purposes of my errand; but I have 
taken every other method in my power, in which 
Governor Clinton has obligingly given me all the aid 
he could. In answer to my pressing application to 
General Poor, for the immediate marching of his bri 
gade, I was told they were under an operation for 
the itch, which made it impossible for them to pro 
ceed till the effects of it were over. By a letter, 
however, of yesterday, General Poor informed me he 
would certainly march this morning. I must do himthe justice to say, he appears solicitous to join you ; 
and that I believe the past delay is not owing to 
any fault of his, but is wholly chargeable on General 
Putnam. Indeed, Sir, I owe it to the service to say, 
that every part of this gentleman s conduct is marked 
with blunders and negligence, and gives general disgnst. 
Parsons s brigade will join you, I hope, in five or six 
days from this. Learned s may do the same. Poor s 
will, I am persuaded, make all the haste they can for 
the future ; and Glover s may be expected at Fishkill 
to-night, whence they will be pushed forward, as fast 
as I can have any influence to make them go. But, I 
am sorry to say, the disposition for marching, in the 
officers and men in general, of these troops, does not 
keep pace with my wishes, or the exigency of the 
occasion. They have unfortunately imbibed an idea 
that they have done their part of the business of the 
campaign, and are now entitled to repose. This, and 
the want of pay, make them averse to a long march 
at this advanced season. 

A letter from you to General Putnam, of the 9th, 
fell just now into my hands. As it might possibly 
contain something useful to me, I took the liberty of 
opening it, and, after reading it, immediately des 
patched it to him. If he has paid any attention to 
my last letters to him, things will be in a right train 
for executing the order in yours ; but whether he has 
or not, is a matter of doubt. In a letter from him, 
just now received by Governor Clinton, he appears to 
have been, on the 10th instant, at King Street, at 
the White Plains. I have had no answer to my last 
applications. 

The enemy appear to have stripped New York 
very bare. The people there (that is, the Tories) are 
in a very great fright. This adds to my anxiety 
that the reinforcements from this quarter to you are 
not in greater forwardness and more considerable. 

I have written to General Gates, informing him of 
the accounts of the situation of New York with re 
spect to troops, and the probability of the force goneto Howe being greater than was at first expected, to 

VOL. II. 4 
try if this will not extort from him a further reenforcement. I do not, however, expect much from 
him, as he pretends to have in view an expedition 
against Ticonderoga, to be undertaken in the winter; 
and he knows that, under the sanction of this idea, 
calculated to catch the Eastern people, he may, with 
out censure, retain the troops. And as I shall be 
under a necessity of speaking plainly to your Excel 
lency when I have the pleasure of seeing you, I 
shall not hesitate to say, I doubt whether you would 
have had a man from the Northern army if the 
whole could have been kept at Albany with any decency. Perhaps you will think me blainable in not 
having exercised the powers you gave me, and given 
a positive order. Perhaps I have been so ; but, deli 
berately weighing all circumstances, I did not, and 
do not, think it advisable to do it, I have the honor 
to be, with unfeigned esteem and regard, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL PUTNAM. 

Head- Quarters, North Street, 14 November, 1777. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I am favored with yours of the 4th, 5th, and 9th 
instant ; and you will see, by mine of the Vth, that 
I have detained General Warner s brigade. The New 
York regiments being annexed to General Poor s bri 
gade, they are exceeding unwilling to be separated ; 
and I, knowing the disadvantages that would arise 
from their being here, have presumed, in some measure, to deviate from your Excellency s orders. Those 
regiments are principally composed of men whose for 
mer residence was within the enemy s lines ; and, the 
little time they were down in this quarter last sum 
mer, there was upwards of one hundred deserters from 
them, mostly to the enemy. We should soon lose 
the principal part of them here. Add to this, they 
have lately got some clothes and money, which puts 
them in a much better situation to march than most 
of the other Continental troops here. Besides all this, 
they began their march before I received your letter. 
This, Sir, has induced me to let them continue their 
route, and, in their stead, I have detained Wyllys s 
and Meigs s regiments, whose situation will by no 
means admit of their inarching with that expedition 
which is necessary. Near one half of them without a 
shoe or stocking ; but a supply is soon expected. 

Colonel Charles Webb s regiment marched yester 
day. I have directed him to advise you of his route, 
by express, before he arrives. I shall be happy to 
find this step meets your Excellency s approbation. 

The inclosed is a copy of a letter from Colonel 
Hamilton to me, by which you will see that I am 
positively ordered to send all the Continental troops 
from here. This letter contains some most unjust and 
injurious reflections ; for I am conscious of having

speedily as possible.* 

I shall go to New Windsor this day to see Colonel 
Hamilton ; and, until I have your orders, I cannot 
think of continuing at this post myself, and send all 
the troops away. If they should go now, I am con 
fident General Howe will be further reenforced from 
this quarter. For, by deserters, spies, and every other 
corroborating intelligence, there is now on York Island

British, four regiments of Hessians, and one of Waideck Brown s, Fanning s, Byard s, Robinson s, Ilirlehy s, and Delancy s first and second battalions of new 
levies. Some say Fanning s is at Panlus Hook, though 
that is immaterial. On Long Island, there are nonebut militia, By information from General Dickinson, 
there are about one thousand on Staten Island. 

I had, previous to the receipt of your letter, wrote 
Governor Trumbull for a number of militia ; but I 
have my doubts whether they w T ill come or not, as 
they have been much fatigued this summer already. 
The Rhode Island expedition has been of no service 
to us. You have doubtless heard that it is dropped, 
and it is said about three thousand troops remain 
there. 

Mr. Colt has accepted his appointment as Deputy 
Commissary-General of Purchases. I have seen himthis day. He informs me there are a number of 
cattle purchased, which shall be immediately for 
warded to you. Since I came here we have had 
near fifty deserters, some from all corps. I am, dearGeneral, with much respect, 

Your most obedient servant,

FROM FRANCIS HOPKINS ON. 

Bordentown, 14 November, 1777. 

SIR, 

The intimacy of my connection with Mr. Duche 
renders all assurance unnecessary, that the letter, ad 
dressed by him to your Excellency on the 8th of 
October last, gave me the greatest concern. I flatter 
myself some undue means have been used to induce 
him to write such a letter, so incompatible with the 
amiable character he has ever maintained, and so 
fatal to his reputation. I could not forbear communicating to him some of my sentiments on the occasion. 
These I might probably have been able to convey to 
him by secret means ; but did not choose to risk the 
imputation of a clandestine correspondence. I have, 
therefore, taken the liberty to send the inclosed letter 
to your Excellency, unsealed, for your perusal; resting it entirely on your better judgment to cause it 
to be forwarded or not. 

I hope your Excellency will pardon my giving 
you this trouble. The occasion is a very interesting 
one to me. My friendship for Mr. Duche calls upon 
me to do all I can to warn him against the fatal 
consequences of his ill-advised step, that he may, if 
possible, do something to avert them before it is too 
late. 

I am, Sir, with the warmest wishes of my heart 
for your welfare, 

Your sincere friend, and very humble servant, 

FRANCIS HOPKINSON.* 



FROM COLONEL HAMILTON.

I arrived at this place last night, and, unfortunate

about, attending to the march of the troops, the day 
before yesterday I crossed the ferry, in order to fall 
in with General Glover s brigade, which was on its 
march from Poughkeepsie to Fishkill. I did not. 
however, see it myself, but received a letter from 
Colonel Shepherd, who commands the brigade, in 
forming mo he would be, last night, at Fishkill, and 
this night at King s Ferry. Wagons, &c., are pro 
vided on the other side for his accommodation, so 
that there need be no delay, but what is voluntary ; 
and, I believe, Colonel Shepherd is as well disposed 
as could be wished to hasten his march. General 
Poor s brigade crossed the ferry the day before yes 
terday. Tw 7 o York regiments, Cortlandt s and Livings 
ton s, are with them; they were unwilling to be sepa 
rated from the brigade, and the brigade from them. 
General Putnam was unwilling to keep them with 
him, and, if he had consented to do it, the regiments 
to replace them would not join you within six days 
as soon as these. 

The troops now remaining with General Putnam 
will amount to about the number you intended, 
though they are not exactly the same. He has detached Colonel Charles Webb s regiment to you. He 
says the troops with him are not in a condition to 
march, being destitute of shoes, stockings, and other 
necessaries ; but, I believe, the true reasons of his 
being unwilling to pursue the mode pointed out by 
you were, his aversion to the York troops, and his 
desire to retain General Parsons with him. I am, 
with much respect and esteem, 

Y r our Excellency s most obedient servant, 

ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 


FROM COLONEL GREENE. 

Red Bank, 17 November, 1777; 
4 o clock, P. M. 

SIR, 

Your Excellency, I dare say, has been informed of 
the evacuation of Fort Mifflin, and the gallant defence there made by Major Thayer. The evacuation 
of that fort, the removal of our navy, the movements 
of the British fleet, and our own situation at present, 
have put it wholly out of my power to answer those 
important purposes for which your Excellency was 
pleased to order me to this command. 

Our fleet here are now moving as fast as possible 
to Timber Creek. The river is so open to the enemy s shipping, that topsail and other vessels are now 
passing between Mud Island and Province Island to 
the Schuylkill, unmolested. Fort Mercer is tolera 
bly secure against a storm only. A bomb-proof ma 
gazine is nearly finished; no other security in the 
fort against shells. A strong breastwork partly fin 
ished on the bank, takes up a considerable part of 
the floor of the fort; and the magazine takes up so 
much, that the remainder of the floor is insufficient 
to spring tents on for more than one third of the 
garrison. 

The proposal for building a bomb-proof under the 
bank is now at an end, since Fort Mifflin is lost. 
The communication to Red Bank, by water, is nearly 
intercepted; and, should a party of the enemy in 
vest this fort by land, our whole supply would be 
cut off; and, should they erect bomb-batteries on the 
land side, they would be able to throw shells to 
us on all sides; from all of which I conclude, that 
an army investing us, sufficient to keep the field, 
will reduce the garrison, and make the survivors 
prisoners, as we could have no retreat. 

Thus, having given your Excellency what appears 
to me, with the unanimous voice of all the FieldOfficers of the garrison, a true state of our circum 
stances, and observations thereon, I wait your Ex 
cellency s particular commands and directions, for an 
invariable rule for me to pursue ; for which purpose 
Major Ward will wait on your Excellency, to whom 
I refer for a more particular account of matters here. 

With every sentiment of respect and esteem, I am, 
Your Excellency s humble servant, 

CHRISTOPHER GREENE. 



FROM RICHARD HENRY LEE. 

York, 20 November, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have no doubt of being excused by you for not 
sooner answering your favor of the 24th last, when 
you are informed that my ill state of health has prevented me from attending, as I ought, to the import 
ant matter it contains. I gave Mr. Jones the letter, 
that he might inform Congress of such parts as it 
imported the public they should be acquainted with. 
As it appeared, by the letters of General Mifflin, that 
he objected only to serve in the Quarter-masters De 
partment, that his health was returning, and that he 
was willing to continue his aid to the public cause, 
Congress appointed him one of the Commissioners of 
the new Board, because he is competent to the right 
discharge of its duties, because that would best suit 
his valetudinary state, and as showing a just sense 
of his uniform, vigorous, and well-founded patriotism. 
I have strong hopes that, by the skill and industry 
of this new Board, and from the right execution of 
business in that important department, you will, in 
future, find great relief. 

General Conway has not lately been mentioned in 
Congress, nor has there been much talk of an Adju 
tant-General, since it is not certainly known whether 
Colonel Pickering will accept his new appointment. 
Mr. Fleming s character stands very fair, and, so faras I am able to judge, he would answer well in this 
Commission. You will see, in the inclosed, what Mr. 
Sergeant says of him. j General Mifflin has proposed a 
plan for the Quarter-master s Department, that appears 
judicious, and well fitted to answer the purpose of 
good service and economy at the same time. He 
would divide this department into its military and 
civil branches ; the former to be filled by a person 
well qualified to discharge its duties, and the latter 
again to be divided into Commissaries of Teams, of 
Forage, of Tents, &c., to be governed in their purchases by estimates from the Quartermaster-General, , 
who is to touch no money but a moderate and suffi-/ 
cient salary. 

It is unfortunately too true, that our enemies pay 
little regard to good faith, or any obligations of jus 
tice and humanity, which renders the Convention of 
Saratoga a matter of great moment ; and it is also, 
as you justly observe, an affair of infinite delicacy. 
The undoubted advantage they will take, even of the 
appearance of infraction on our part, and the Ameri 
can character, which is concerned in preserving its 
faith inviolate, cover this affair with difficulties, and 
prove the disadvantage we are under in conducting 
war against an old, corrupt, and powerful people, who, 
having much credit and influence in the world, will 
venture on things that would totally ruin the reputa 
tion of young and rising communities like ours. 

The English, however, were not to blame in the 
business of Closter Seven. That Convention was left 
incomplete by the Commanders who made it. It was 
stipulated, particularly, that the Court of Versailles 
must ratify, and that within a certain time, which 
was not done until long after the time was elapsed, 
and before which ratification the troops of Hanover 
had returned to arms. Upon this occasion, the good 
faith of England is not impeached. 

It is greatly to be regretted that the situation of 
your army unfits it for vigorous action, because it is 
very obvious that the enemy s possession of Phila 
delphia this winter and the ensuing spring, may pro 
duce consequences extensively injurious. You well 
know, Sir, how weak and divided the people of this 
State are from various causes. Those of Delaware are 
still worse. In this condition, with the infinite arts 
of our enemies, pushed up almost to the centre of 
the above Governments, and aided by the powerful 
means of supplying the wants, fanciful and real, of 
the people, with all kinds of European goods and 
salt, it will be no great matter of surprise if we were 
to find a total revolution in Pennsylvania and Dela 
ware. Add to this, the ill condition of our finances, 
which totter upon every seeming success of the 
enemy. 

It is not to be supposed that, where so much is at 
stake, Great Britain will fail to make most potent 
efforts to recover her honor, and prevent her ruin. 
Upon this ground, we may expect considerable ree nforcements, and early as possible in the spring. With 
an army much strengthened, General Howe may effect 
purposes dangerous to America, It happens, too, unluckily for us, that, in order to support the credit of 
our money, the several States must, of necessity, impose large and immediate taxes. This is the most 
delicate and difficult of all Government operations, 
even in old and undisturbed states. Yet it is una 
voidable, and Congress have pressingiy requested that 
it may be quickly and extensively entered upon. 

It was most evident, to discerning men, that the 
change in the Commissariat, at the time it was adopted, would produce most mischievous consequences, 
yet such was the rage of reformation, that no en 
deavours to prevent the evil could avail 5 and now I 
feel the most anxious solicitude, for fear the conse 
quences may disperse our army even in face of the 
enemy. A Committee is appointed to confer with 
the Commissary-General, and to try what can be 
done to avert the evil. I wish they may be for 
tunate enough to hit upon a remedy. That there 
should be a want of flour amazes me, and proves 
great want of attention in the Commissary-General, 
because I well know that any quantity might have , 
been got in Virginia at a reasonable price. 

By our last despatches from the West Indies, it 
would seem as if a war between France and England 
was inevitable, unless the latter should restore all her 
captures made from the former without the limits 
prescribed by treaty, and which have been madeunder authority of an Act of Parliament. But the 
royal spleen against America is such, that every con 
sideration falls before the wish to subjugate this freecountry. Yet Mr. Bingham mentions, that the minis 
terial writings are calculated to rouse the national 
resentment against France. If so, it is evident they 
want to set Europe on fire, that the smoke may 
cover them from the eyes of their injured country. 
Mr. Carmichael writes that Dr. Lee was returning to 
Paris from Berlin, having finished his business success 
fully at the Prussian Court; and Mr. Bingham says 
it is certain that the King of Prussia has opened his 
ports to the United State s, and that Portugal has 
deserted the interest of England, and acceded to the 
family compact. This is all good news, and will, I 
hope, furnish employment quickly for our unprin 
cipled enemies.* 

My ill state of health will compel me to return 
home in a few days, where I shall continue ardently 
to pray for your health and success. 

I am, dear Sir, affectionately yours, 

RICHARD HENRY LEE. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GATES. 

Albany, 23 November, 1777. 

SIR, 

I am just now honored with the receipt of yourExcellency s letter of the 14th instant, from White 
Marsh. I have never entertained the smallest idea 
that General Burgoyrie should be permitted to ex 
change the port of embarkation, or that the least 
variation of the spirit and letter of the Convention 
would be indulged to the troops under his command. 
There is no doubt but the British regiments, upon 
their arrival in England, will be ordered to do duty 
there; but the Germans cannot, by the laws, serve in 
Great Britain or Ireland. 

If General Burgoyne has any sinister design, what 
I suggested to Congress in my letter of the 10th 
instant, a copy of which I conclude your Excellency 

* This intelligence was not confirmed. 
has received, will be a good method of delaying, if 
not finally preventing, the execution of his project. 

I shall write to-morrow, by the Boston post, to 
General Glover, who is charged with the embarkation 
of the prisoners under the Convention, and send hima copy of your Excellency s letter. I am, Sir, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant. 

HORATIO GATES. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL DICKINSON. 

Elizabethtown, 28 November, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

Having obtained the fullest information respecting 
the strength and situation of the enemy upon Staten 
Island, and made the necessary preparations, I called 
in many volunteers, whose numbers, in addition to 
those on duty at this post, amounted to about fourteen hundred men. With this detachment I landed 
yesterday morning, before day, upon the Island, from 
Halstead s Point. The whole strength of the enemy 
was drawn to this side of the Island, and extended 
from the Blazing Star to their former works. General Skinner, with five regiments of Greens, were 
quartered in different parts.* About three hundred 
Waldeckers, with General Campbell, lay at the works, 
in which were light cannon, with a company of artil 
lery, covered by a fifty-gun ship, and a sloop-of-war. 

I landed in three divisions (having the best guides), 
and intended to have marched in by-roads, in order 
to get in the rear of the Greens, and cut off their 
retreat. The divisions proceeded as far as was in
* Cortland Skinner had been Attorney-General of New Jersey be 
fore the war, and he now commanded a body of Loyalists, who were 
dressed in a green uniform. See Sabine s American Loyalists, p. 615. 

VOL. II. 5 
tended (seven miles), and then met at the appointed 
rendezvous ; but, to my great disappointment, they 
secured their retreat in the works by the most precipitate flight; General Skinner, Colonel Allen, and 
many other officers, having narrowly escaped. We 
drove in all their pickets, with little opposition, and 
now and then skirmished a little with them as they 
fled. I kept my design as secret as possible, not having communicated it to the Field-Officers until eight 
o clock the evening before ; but, notwithstanding all 
my precaution, Mr. Skinner received the intelligence 
at three o clock in the morning, which frustrated my 
plan. I flattered myself I should have had the plea 
sure of giving your Excellency a good account of 
the General and his Green brigade, which, undoubted 
ly, would have been the case, had he not unluckily 
received the above information. 

We made the following prisoners, namely; two 
Lieutenants (one Colonel Bushkirk s son), one Surgeon, one Commissary, and twenty privates (Mr. Hood, 
of Brunswick, among the number) ; and killed five or 
six Greens. Our loss was three men made prisoners, 
and ten slightly wounded. In justice to both officers 
and men, I must inform your Excellency they be 
haved well, and wanted nothing but an opportunity 
to have done honor to the State they belong to. 
Their expectations were great, and their spirits high. 
I was astonished that the enemy had not collected 
and formed upon some advantageous ground. This 
I expected would have been the case, and proceeded 
with caution. They came down in a body to play 
the old game upon our rear. This I expected, and 
was sufficiently prepared for, having thrown up a 
small work at Halstead s Point, and placed two fieldpieces in it, from which we kept up a brisk fire, and 
soon dispersed them. 
After remaining on the Island eight hours, and 
driving them within their works, we made an easy 
and secure retreat, not having lost a single man, 
horse, or boat. By a flag, just come over, I am in 
formed they say, in excuse for their gallant beha 
viour, that we were joined by two thousand Con 
tinental troops. Had it not been strong tide of 
flood, by which means they might have been easily 
reenforced from New York, as General Putnam only 
intended a feint there, and their having two gondolas, 
and an armed sloop lying in the Sound, I should have 
remained in possession of the Island for the day. 
Those considerations, and the troops being much fa 
tigued, as the night was very cold, and they obliged 
to march through much water, determined me to re 
turn, which reasons, I hope, will meet with your Ex 
cellency s approbation. 

I proposed to the Governor to march most of the 
men from this post to the southern part of this State, 
to serve out the remainder of their time, (indeed, the 
whole force should have marched long ago, but the 
Council would not consent). If I am not forbid, I 
shall take the liberty of sending on six hundred of 
the best troops early to-morrow morning, which detachment I shall accompany. The weather is very 
bad, but I hope it will clear up this evening. 

My indisposition, being much fatigued and very 
wet in crossing the river, prevented my giving yourExcellency the above information earlier. 

A fleet, consisting of twenty-five sail, is just arrived 
at the Narrows, said to come from England, and to 
have brought over some of the new raised Irish regi 
ments. I have the honor to be, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

PHILEMON DICKINSON. 
FROM GOVERNOR HENRY. 

Williamsburg, 6 December, 1777. 

SIR, 

Inclosed I have the honor to transmit you an ac 
count of necessaries sent off in nine wagons, for the 
Virginia regiments in Continental service. The goods 

& o o 

have been delivered to Colonel Finnic, the Quarter 
master, and he has put them under the escort of 
Lieutenant Mennis and a party of soldiers, who, I 
trust, will deliver them safely. It is my wish that 
the troops of Virginia shall have them. I also send 
a list of some other articles, chiefly linens, that will 
shortly set out from our public store, for the same 
uses. 

Added to this supply, fifteen thousand pounds 
worth of woollens, &c., proper for the soldiers, will 
set out from Petersburg in a few days. These last 
are procured under an act of Assembly, empowering 
me to seize necessaries for our troops wherever they 
may be found. I have given orders, in consequence. 
to proper persons in different parts of the State, which 
I expect will produce many necessaries, if not enough 
for the Virginia troops". Orders are sent to both Carolinas for blankets, particularly, and soldiers clothes ; 
and nothing, possible for me to effect, will be left undone, in getting whatever the troops are in want of. 

I should be more particular, as to the goods seized, 
but the Commissioners have as yet sent me no distinct account of their proceedings. If it happens that 
the wants of your army are supplied in any short 
time, I beg to know it, that the execution of the 
present law for seizing goods may be stopped. 

I take the liberty to send, under cover to yourExcellency, two letters from France, to the Marquis cle 
la Fayette. One of them is from his lady, I believe. 
I beg to be presented to him in the most acceptable 
manner. I greatly revere his person and amiable 
character. 

The lenity of your publications respecting deserters 
is very apparent. But, nevertheless, a great many of 
them are yet skulking on the Eastern Shore, and 
really I think their case peculiar. Their officers took 
up the general opinion, that their service would be 
confined to that shore, and promised them to remain 
there. Their desertion followed upon orders to march 
away. I beg leave to observe, that, if your Excel 
lency would offer them a pardon upon their enlist 
ment to serve this State, it would forward the general service by enabling us to spare so many more 
troops for the Grand Army. I beg leave to assure 
you of the highest esteem and regard, with which I 
have the honor to be, Sir, your Excellency s 
Most obedient, and very humble servant, 

PATRICK HENRY. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL PULASKI.* 

[December, 1777.] 

SIR, 

I make no doubt but your Excellency is acquainted with the present ineffective state of the cavalry. 
In this situation it cannot be appropriated to any 

* Count Pulaski was appointed by Congress a Brigadier-General in the 
service of the United States, on the 15th of September, upon the re 
commendation of General Washington, and assigned to the command of 
the cavalry. This branch of the army had hitherto been very imper 
fectly organized. See Sparks s Life of Count Pulaski, in the Library 
of American Biography, Vol. XIV. p. 416. 

5* 
other service than that of orderlies, or reconnoitring 
the enemy s lines, which your Excellency must be 
persuaded is not the only service expected from a 
corps, which, when on a proper footing, is so very 
formidable. Although it is the opinion of many, that, 
from the construction of the country, the cavalry can 
not act to advantage, your Excellency must be too 
well acquainted with the many instances wherein the 
cavalry have been decisively serviceable, to be of this 
opinion, and not acknowledge that this corps has more 
than once completed victories. To this end I would 
wish to discipline the cavalry ; and I flatter myself by 
next campaign to render it essentially serviceable. 

What has greatly contributed to the present w r eak 
state of the cavalry was, the frequent detachments 
ordered to the suite of general and other officers, 
while a Colonel commanded, which w r ere appropriated 
to every use, and the horses drove at the discretion 
of the dragoons. 

The confidence, with which the Congress and yourExcellency have honored me, is a sure guaranty to 
the zeal I shall ever act with, in the service of the 
United States. But, notwithstanding my great desire 
of rendering the cavalry as useful as its first institu 
tion intended, I find it impracticable, seeing it is deficient in its principal requisitions ; my reflections on 
which, I have judged necessary to communicate to 
your Excellency, as a proof of my attachment to the 
good of the service, and desire of executing yourExcellency s designs ; hoping for an opportunity of 
deserving the favor conferred on me by your Ex 
cellency. 

ARTICLE I. It is absolutely necessary, that the ca 
valry have a Master of Exercise, who should instruct 
the commissioned and non-commissioned officers in the 
rules of service, as, having the command,, I am obliged 
to act with precaution; but this officer, actuated by 
different motives, would remove the bad habits and 
correct the defects of the superior officers. There is 
an officer now in this country, whose name is Kowacz. 
I know him to have served with reputation in the 
Prussian service, and assure your Excellency that he 
is every way equal to this undertaking. 

II. That twenty-four dragoons be drafted from the 
different regiments to form a separate corps, w r ho shall 
be taught the use of the pike or lance, of which two 
or three days will render them masters. For this purpose I must have chosen men. 

III. A Quartermaster-General to the cavalry is es 
sentially necessary to procure winter-quarters, stables, 
and provender, also to provide arms, accoutrements, 
and clothing. An intelligent officer, acquainted with 
the cavalry, should be chosen for this purpose. I 
would recommend to your Excellency, Major Blackden, of Colonel Sheldon s regiment, a gentleman who 
has displayed his knowledge in the equipment of said 
regiment, and whom I think sufficiently qualified to 
merit this trust. 

IV. It is full time the Quartermaster-General was 
sent to the place assigned for winter-quarters, in or 
der to provide magazines, that the cavalry may be 
kept embodied and conveniently exercised and disciplined. The horse service has ever been respected. 
One third of the cavalry is generally on duty, often 
the whole. When it returns to camp, it should draw 
provision, and cook it agreeably to orders ; but their 
full allowance is seldom granted. This I know by 
experience, being the worst served of any General in 
the service. To prevent this evil, a Commissary should 
be appointed to the cavalry. The cavalry in an army 
generally forms a separate division, and has greater 
privileges than the infantry, which the honor of the 
service exacts ; but here I find it is the contrary. Not 
that I aim at a superiority over the rest of the army, 
but am desirous of having justice done the corps I 
command. It is my duty. For my own part I wish to 
be subject to your Excellency s order only, agreeably 
to my request upon entering the service, which is 
the limit of my ambition. 

PULASKI. 



FROM JOSEPH GALLOAVAY. 

Philadelphia, 18 December, 1777. 

SIR, 

Apprehending that the business of war by no means 
excludes the feelings of humanity, and relying on 
that candor and liberality of sentiment, which those 
who are best acquainted with your Excellency agreeyou possess, I have presumed to request the favor 
of your permitting Mrs. Galloway, with her household 
furniture and effects, to remove from my seat in the 
country to Philadelphia. Could I imagine that a con 
test, of such magnitude and importance as the present 
between Great Britain and America, is to be decided 
by, or in any degree depended on, a matter of so 
trivial comparative consequence as that of obliging 
me in the gratification of my desire, I should imme 
diately perceive the impropriety, and not give you 
the trouble of this request. 

This will be conveyed by a flag, obtained under 
the favor of his Excellency Sir William Howe. I am, 
Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

JOSEPH GALLOWAY. 
FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL PULASKI. 

19 December, 1777. 

SIR, 

In my preceding representations, I have been particular respecting the present state of the cavalry, 
and the means by which it may be augmented and 
completed ; but, on this head, I must necessarily know 
your Excellency s determination. The advantages that 
would arise from a superiority in cavalry are too ob 
vious to be unnoticed. It may be further observed 
that, during this war, the country will daily become 
more open and clear of woods and fences, and conse 
quently better adapted to the manoeuvres and service 
of the cavalry. 

While we are superior in cavalry, the enemy will 
not dare to extend their force, and, notwithstanding 
we act on the defensive, we shall have many opportunities of attacking and destroying the enemy by 
degrees ; whereas, if they have it in their power to 
augment their cavalry, and we suffer ours to diminish 
and dwindle away, it may happen that the loss of a 
battle will terminate in our total defeat. Our army, 
once dispersed and pursued by their horse, will never 
be able to rally. Thus our retreat may early be cut 
off, our baggage lost, our principal officers taken, and 
many other events occur not less fatal. 

Your Excellency must De too much occupied to 
take cognizance of the detail of every department, 
A workman requires proper tools to carry on his 
business, and, if he does not use them in their place, 
he cannot be perfect. Your Excellency is undoubtedly acquainted with yours ; therefore a person, possessing your confidence, and properly authorized, is 
essentially necessary to answer decisively such proposals as I have made in my late representations re 
specting the cavalry. 

I must not omit to mention, here, the dissatisfaction 
you have expressed at my seeming inattention to 
your orders. Your Excellency may be assured, that 
the good of the service is my constant study, but the 
weak state of the corps I command, renders it impossible to perform every service required ; nay, my re 
putation is exposed, as, being an entire stranger in 
the country, the least accident would suffice to injure 
me ; but, notwithstanding, I cannot avoid hazarding

PULASKI. 



FROM GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Pouglikecpsic, 20 December, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

I was not honored with the receipt of your Excel 
lency s letter of the 3d instant, before Friday last. I 
am truly sensible that the security of the North 
River is a matter of the utmost importance to the 
United States in the present war, and that the safety 
of this State in a more particular manner depends 
upon it. It gives me real concern, therefore, that so 
little has been yet done to effect it. Works we laid 
out, and began, to defend the chevaux-de-frise, and 
something was done towards finishing and sinking 
such of them as were not completed when the enemy 
came up the river; and these are the only steps that 
have hitherto been taken. 

When the enemy left the river, it was my opinion 
that as many of the troops from the Northern De 
partment should be sent to reenforce the Grand Army 
under your Excellency s more immediate command, as 
could be possibly spared ; that no greater number 
should be left in this quarter than what would be 
barely sufficient to cover the country, which is more 
immediately exposed to the ravages of the enemy ; to 
amuse them from sending large reinforcements to 
General Howe ; and to carry on the necessary works 
for the security of the river. One brigade of Continental troops, with the militia then in service, and 
such of this State as I should be able to call out, I 
conceived fully sufficient for the purposes. Two small 
New Hampshire militia regiments, which were sent 
down from the northward by General Gates, about 
seventy Connecticut militia, and those of Colonel Dubois s, who escaped from Fort Montgomery, and a 
regiment of militia of this State, were assigned for 
the works. The rest of the troops, consisting of 
General Warner s brigade of militia (which arrived 
earliest), General Parsons s brigade, and some Con 
necticut militia, were drawn off to King s Street and 
the adjacent neighbourhood on the Sound, under the 
immediate command of General Putnam. 

It was late before the militia from the northward 
arrived, and they were worn out with the fatigues of 
the campaign and their long march hither. The time 
for which they were engaged in the service expired 
the 1st of this month, and of those of this State the 
15th; and while they were with us, the want of tools 
and materials was such as to prevent their being em 
ployed to any degree of advantage. Dubois s regi 
ment are the only troops on the spot at present, 
which are by no means sufficient to mount the necessary guards. Of course the works are entirely 
neglected. 

The resolutions of Congress, of the 5th of Novem 
ber, for regaining the forts and passes on Hudson s 
lliver, and securing the communication thereof, vested 
General Gates with such ample powers for drawing 
supplies of men and materials from New Jersey, and 
the different States eastward, that something essential 
might yet have been done towards the completion of 
this important business before the opening of the 
spring, would he have taken upon himself the direc 
tion of it. But, as I understand that gentleman pro 
poses taking his seat at the Board of War, agreeably 
to his late appointment, those resolutions, as they apply to him particularly, will lose their intended effect ; 
and, though I learn by a letter I received from General Putnam, accompanying that from your Excellency, 
that he is directed to turn his views in future to this 
object, yet, however capable he may be for the task, 
I fear he will fall short in the execution of it, unless 
he shall be able to command the same aids, at least, 
which General Gates was empowered to do. 

I am clearly of the opinion, that a strong fortress 
ought to be erected either on the opposite side of 
the creek from where Fort Montgomery stood, or 
at West Point, opposite Port Constitution. The lat 
ter I prefer, as the most defensible ground, and be 
cause the navigation of the river there is more difficult and uncertain, and the river something narrower 
than it is at the former place. A new chain should 
be procured, if possible, and with the boom, which is 
nearly completed, stretched across the river. This, 
with a floating battery or two, and some gun-boats, 
I am persuaded, would answer the purpose effectually; 
and in this 6 pinion I am confirmed, as the enemy 
chose to risk every thing for the reduction of Fort 
Montgomery, rather than to attempt passing it with 
their shipping, while in our possession. If West Point 
should be the place fixed upon, it might be of 
great advantage to erect a small strong work on the 
high point on the opposite shore, a little above Fort 
Constitution. 

As to the management in this department, of which 
your Excellency desires my sentiments, I am con 
strained to say (but I wish it may be considered as in 
confidence) we have either been very unfortunate, or 
it has not been as wise as might be wished. Prudent 
management of our small force, in my humble opinion, would have saved the forts, though, perhaps, 
with the far less important loss of the Continental 
Village. By losing the forts, the Village fell, of course. 
It is true a few stores were moved from thence, and 
saved, but I dare say not of equal value with those 
lost at the forts, exclusive of the shipping. Besides, 
had we held the forts, we should have commanded 
the navigation of the river, and drove the enemy to 
the necessity of attempting to relieve Burgoyne (for 
it is evident that this was their intention) by land, 
in which case it might have been in our power, by 
calling the militia to our assistance, to have destroyed 
Clinton s whole army. Indeed, without opposition they 
could not have effected a march in season for the in 
tended purpose, and I am confident they never would 
have attempted it. 

I never considered Peekskill, or the Village, posts 
of great importance, only as they stood connected 
with the defences of the river ; for, without the latter, 
the enemy could, by landing above, come in the rearof the former, in which case they must fall, of course. 
The event has fully proved this. Notwithstanding, 
the chief part of this department were kept idle at 
Peekskill and the Village, while the forts were left 
without a sufficient number of men to carry on and 
complete the works, or defend them. If the shipping 

VOL. II. 6 
had been properly manned, and this was often soli 
cited,, the Congress, at least, might have been saved ; 
and even after the loss of the forts, by a prudent 
disposition of the force in this quarter, which was 
soon greatly increased by the coming in of the militia, Kingston might have been saved, and the greater 
part of the mischief, committed by the enemy along 
the shores of the river, prevented. 

A constant intercourse, which has been permitted 
between the country and city, by flags, has, I fear, 
been very injurious, as well by frequently enabling 
the enemy to learn our strength, as otherwise, without 
our being able to derive similar advantages from such 
correspondence. I have heard that there has been a 
weekly exchange of newspapers with Governor Tryon, 
and that the printers, Gaine and London, are permit 
ted the like liberty. The latter I have no doubt of. 
An over share of complaisance and indulgence to the 
disaffected, (which, though arising from principles of 
benevolence and humanity, will always create jea 
lousies and unfavorable suspicions, especially among 
the common people, and often even reach the army,) 
should, therefore, be carefully avoided. In these re 
spects, I cannot help thinking there has been a want 
of common prudence. I have taken the liberty of 
hinting my sentiments of these matters to General 
Putnam, and I would fain hope that there may be 
more circumspection used in future. 

The Legislature of this State is to meet at this 
place on the 5th of next month. The variety of important business to be prepared for their considera 
tion, and other affairs of government, will employ so 
great a part of my time, that I should not be able 
to give that attention to the works for the security 
of the river, as their importance, and the short time 
in which they ought to be completed, require. But 
you may rest assured, Sir, that every leisure hourshall be faithfully devoted to them, and my advice 
and assistance shall not, for any consideration, be 
withheld from the person who shall be intrusted with 
the chief direction of them. I have the honor to be, 
with the most sincere esteem and respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

GEORGE CLINTON. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SULLIVAN. 

Camp, [Valley Forge], 26 December, 1777. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

Agreeably to your Excellency s directions, I have 
consulted some of the General Officers who I thought 
most capable of advising upon the proper steps to 
take in our present circumstances. They say that 
they can by no means advise for or against an attack. 
They are fully convinced that General Howe has his 
whole force with him ; that, if your Excellency thinks 
your force sufficient to cope with his, they are wil 
ling to risk their lives and fortunes with you in the 
attempt. They say, further, that General Howe is 
possessed of very strong grounds at present, and, even 
if he w r as not, he would have sufficient time to post 
himself strongly before you could reach him, as yourarmy must have a march of two days before they 
could come to action. They think if an attack is 
made on his left with success, he can retreat with 
ease ; if on his right, he must be ruined ; but, should 
you fail in the latter, your army must be pushed into 
the Schuylkill. 

They, upon the whole, think that the attempt will 
be exceeding hazardous, and the success doubtful ; 
that, if you fail, the people who are now so fond of 
censuring, will change their clamor, and censure you 
for not attacking him when he was within a mile 
of you, and your army more numerous and in better 
condition than at present. They say they are freefor attacking him, if he, by his advances this way, 
shows an intention of attacking us ; but cannot ad 
vise to marching the army to attack him where he 
now is, unless your Excellency is fully convinced of 
your superiority in numbers. 

These are the sentiments of the gentlemen whom I 
have consulted, and, though I think they have much 
weight, I am so weary of the infernal clamor of the 
Pennsylvanians, that I am for satisfying them at all 
events, and risking every consequence in an action. 
Possibly we may be successful; if not, they may be 
satisfied, and even Congress itself may gain expe 
rience, and learn to censure with more caution. Pos 
sibly a defeat may have this good effect, and a vic 
tory will bring with it its own reward. I am, there 
fore, clearly for risking every consequence in an ac 
tion, and, among others, most cheerfully, the life and 
fortune of 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant. 

JOHN SULLIVAN. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL PULASKI. 

Trenton, 9 January, 1778. 

SIR, 

I arrived here yesterday with the cavalry, where I 
expected to have found forage sufficient to subsist the 
cavalry, at least for a few days. My Brigade Foragemaster had been informed, by Colonel Biddle, that such 
provision was made, and that he would have nothing 
more to do than issue the same ; but, so far to the 
contrary, there was not a load of hay in town. With 
the greatest difficulty we have "been enabled to put 
our heads under cover. I applied to the civil magis 
trates for directions relative to the forming a maga 
zine. In the mean while, the horses must subsist. I 
am, therefore, obliged to divide them into several 
squads, and send them out about two miles in the 
rear of the town, until the necessary provision, both 
for forage and quarters, can be made. 

It will be impossible for me to quarter the cavalry 
in this place, unless the galley-men are removed ; but 
they say they have an order from the Governor and 
Council to remain here ; and, having prior possession, 
think they are entitled to hold it. I wait your Ex 
cellency s positive order in what manner to proceed; 
and if, in this case, I must execute my first orders, 
it will be necessary that the galley-men should re 
ceive orders to evacuate the town. I have the honor 
to assure your Excellency that the cavalry is in want 
of every article. It must be exercised and taught 
the service, from the Colonel to the private. Colonel 
Kowacz is a man of great merit, and deserves the 
charge of Master of Exercise. He is an officer worthy 
of research ; and, exclusive of a thorough knowledge 
of his abilities, I request his being employed by yourExcellency. I can recommend, and assure your Ex 
cellency will never have reason to repent your confi 
dence in him. If this proposal should be agreeable 
to your Excellency, the sooner I am informed the 
better, as he will be of infinite service to the cavalry 
this winter in quarters. 

I have met with an armourer, who lives at Easton. 
He undertakes to furnish me with pikes, pistols, car6* 



66 LETTEKS TO WASHINGTON. 

bines, &c. If your Excellency approves of him, the 
Quartermaster-General will take your orders on that 
head. 

There are some excellent horses in this country ; 
and; as Colonel Luterloh has received orders to press 
all horses fit for the service, he may procure a num 
ber here ; but this must not be delayed, as I ani in 
formed many persons buy them for the use of the 
enemy. I am, with respect, your Excellency s 

Very humble, and obedient servant, 

PULASKI. 



FROM ELBRIDGE GERRY.* 

York, 13 January, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have waited some time in expectation of informing you with the sense of Congress on the several 
subjects mentioned in your agreeable favor of the 
25th December, but am not yet fully able to answer 
my purpose. 

A Committee is appointed from Congress and the 
Board of War, who, in Concert with your Excellency, 
have full powers to form and execute a plan for re 
ducing the number of battalions now in the service ; 
to recommend the necessary appointments of General 
Officers ; to determine on the necessary reinforcements 
for the cavalry, artillery, and infantry, and report 
their opinions on the best mode of obtaining the same ; 
to remove from office any officers of the civil depart 
ments of the army for negligence, incompetency, or 
fraud, and appoint others until the sense of Congress 
can be known; to report the necessary alterations to 



* A Delegate in Congress from Massachusetts. 
be made in the regulations of these departments ; to 
remove all just causes of complaint relative to rank, 
confining it, as nearly as may be, to the military 
line ; and for other purposes mentioned in their commission. The members are, Messrs. Folsom, Dana, 
General Reed, and Harvey, from Congress, and Generals Gates and Mifflin, and Colonel Pickering, from 
the Board of War. I sincerely wish that despatch 
may be made in this business, and that the first 
thing may be to consider of the necessary reinforce 
ments, that measures may be immediately pursued to 
obtain them. The mentioning of this is, however, unnecessary to your Excellency. 

The Resolutions for allowing, hereafter, to officers, 
the cost of their retained rations, and for enabling 
your Excellency to increase the number of your Aids, 
I find, by your letters to Congress, are at hand. And 
the proposals of allowing to the officers, who shall 
continue in the service to the end of the war, and 
whose regiments shall then be reduced, half pay for 
a limited time; of enabling officers, after the war, 
to sell their commissions, under proper regulations ; 
and of giving to the widows of such officers as shall 
lose their lives in the service, pensions while they re 
main in a state of widowhood, are now before Con 
gress. The first has been largely debated, and I am 
apprehensive that it will meet with a negative. There 
are many weighty arguments against it, such as the 
infant state of the country, its aversion to placemen 
and pensioners, whereby Great Britain is likely to 
lose her liberty, the equality of the officers and sol 
diers of some States, before the war, and the bad 
effect that such provision would have on the minds 
of the latter. But I must confess that none of these 
weigh so much in my mind as the necessity of making a commission so valuable that a dismission will 
not only be disgraceful to an officer, but injurious 
to his interest. This will introduce that subordina 
tion to civil authority which is necessary to produce 
an internal security to liberty, and to the high officers of the military department such authority as to 
enable them to establish discipline, without which an 
army can be neither vigorous nor successful. 

Colonel Wilkinson is appointed Secretary to the 
Board of War, which I hope he will accept, that the 
just causes of complaint arising from his hasty pro 
motion may be removed. Should he refuse, I think 
Congress will be justified in taking effectual measures 
to remedy the evils resulting therefrom. 

General Heath is directed to procure and send to 
your Excellency one thousand bell tents, to prevent, 
in future, the danger arising from heavy rains at the 
critical moment of an engagement with the enemy. 
Is it not necessary that measures should be taken by 
Congress, or your Excellency, for further providing 
against this evil, by appropriating a drummer, fifer, 
or some other officer in each company, to carry a 
bell tent for the same, in times of action, when the 
baggage-w r agons are ordered to leave the army, that, 
whether advancing or retreating, the soldiers may 
never be in danger of having their muskets and 
ammunition rendered useless from the want of this article ? I remain, Sir, in haste, but with much esteem 
and respect, 

Your Excellency s very humble servant, 

ELBRIDGE GERRY.


FROM THOMAS WHARTOX. 

In Council, Lancaster, 15 January, 1778. 

SIR, 

The inclosed recommendation of the Honorable 
House of General Assembly of this State, founded on 
a recommendation of Congress, has been repeatedly 
under consideration. As we are persuaded that, how 
ever it may be in other States, we cannot reasonably 
expect, in this State, where property is in general 
very equally divided, that farmers will exert them 
selves to enlist their neighbours children in the service, or even the laborers, whom they feel them 
selves in great want of, the Council can devise no 
means by which we can hope so effectually and expeditiously to raise our quota of troops, as by the 
officers of the battalions. If this measure shall meet 
your Excellency s approbation, we request, that you 

" Business for some time past has not been despatched in Congress with 
that degree of celerity, nor, possibly, in some instances, accuracy, which 
the peculiar exigency of these infant States demands ; not owing to 
negligence and inattention of the few members, who now faithfully devote 
their time, and drudge in the service of their country, but to a deficiency 
of numbers necessary for the discharge of the very important matters 
which every new day brings forth. There are, at present, no more than 
twenty-one members on the floor. Of these, three are ordered on a 
Committee to General Washington s camp, and one to visit the hospitals ; 
and, of late, from some unaccountable delinquencies, Congress, in order 
to guard against a total dispersion of the army, have been obliged to act 
personally, by several of its members, Quartermaster-General, ClothierGeneral, Commissary-General, and, as your Excellency will conclude from 
the intimation just now dropped, Director of Hospitals; and I might, with 
strict propriety, add two or three et cceteras. 

" I have taken the liberty of being so full on this head, in order to 
show your Excellency the necessity for hastening a more ample representation from the State of New York, as well as to apologize for any 
unavoidable delay on the part of Congress ; and I have been urged more 
particularly to do so, from a hint which Mr. Lewis gave me this evening, of his intention to leave us in a few days." 
will please to select two out of each for this purpose, and give them orders to repair to the several 
counties, as soon as may be, on this important service. 

A sum of money will be deposited in the hands 
of the County Lieutenant, or other suitable person, to 
pay the bounty of one hundred dollars ordered by the 
Assembly, over and beside the bounty given by Con 
gress, to each able-bodied recruit, who shall enter any 
of the battalions belonging to the quota of this State, 
for three years, or during the war. The words of 
the recommendation are, of the "twelve battalions," 
but we understand it to have been intended to all the 
battalions. 

The Council had, some time since, set on foot a 
collection of coarse woollens, blankets, shoes, &c., to 
be sent in the common fund in the hands of the 
Clothier-General. Very lately, Congress, departing 
from their former system, resolved that each State 
do endeavour to supply the present necessities of its 
troops. Agreeably to this, the Council immediately 
proceeded to bring a large quantity of woollens, 
which was concealed or neglected in Buck s county, 
to the supply of the distressed soldiers. The tailors 
have made considerable progress in making them up. 
They calculate that they will produce near one thou 
sand coats and waistcoats for privates, and a .few 
breeches. These goods seem not so fit for officers, 
except some surtouts would be thought acceptable. 
Your Excellency s direction concerning the distribution 
will be useful, as the Council are satisfied that you 
wish the most pressing necessity to be first relieved. 

The Assembly, in the exigence of our army at this 
inclement season, have gone into the most vigorous 
mode of relief, but a mode that cannot be continued 
nor renewed, consistent with trade and manufacture. 
They have invested two Commissioners, in each county, 
with power to seize and take all necessaries suitable 
to the purpose, in whatever hands they may be 
found ; and they have appointed Colonel Francis 
Johnston to receive and distribute the clothing as 
ordered by the Council. By this means it may be 
expected that great additions may be made to the 
clothing already made up and making. 

The officers, whose wants it is believed are very 
pressing, will be in some measure relieved ; but it 
cannot be expected that powers, of this extraordinary 
nature, can be exerted to procure any other goods 
than warmth and decency require. Lieutenant Peter 
son, of the eighth Pennsylvania battalion, applied to 
the Council for clothing for himself and several officers. At the foot hereof we transcribe, from his application, a specimen of their wants. 

The call upon the State was thought to be for 
covering for the naked part of the army ; and as no 
idea that fine ruffled shirts, laced hats, or even fineones of beaver, silken stockings, or fine scarlet cloth, 
came under this description, no provision for these 
has been made, nor can be expected. Your Excel 
lency can best judge whether any precaution may be 
necessary to prevent such officers, as intend shortly 
to resign, from obtaining a supply of the clothing 
expected to be delivered out. 

I have the honor to be, &c., 

THOMAS WHARTON, JR. 
FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL GLOVER. 

Cambridge, 27 January, 1778. 

SIR, 

I received your Excellency s letter yesterday, of 
the Stli instant, desiring me to join my brigade as 
soon as possible. 

I apprehend your Excellency has not been fully 
acquainted with the business I was charged with by 
General Gates, which has been, and still will be, at 
tended with so many difficulties, as will necessarily 
detain me at this post till the embarkation of General Burgoyne. 

I was honored with the command of conducting 
him and his troops from Saratoga to Cambridge, for 
the better supplying of whom, and the conveniency 
of the inhabitants of the country through which they 
marched, I divided them into two divisions ; the British, by Williamstown and Northampton ; the Germans, 
by Kinderhook and Springfield with Commissaries, 
Quarter-masters, and Wagon-masters for each, with 
particular directions to take bills for what supplies 
they received, and give orders on me for payment. 
This order not being fully attended to, I was obliged 
to send Quarter-master Story back to Albany to col 
lect the outstanding accounts. When that is done, I 
shall charge General Burgoyne with the whole, in onegeneral account ; and as many of the charges, in my 
opinion, are unjust, and others extravagantly high, 
large sums being charged by the inhabitants for da 
mages in burning fences, destroying hay, grain, flax, 
&c.. also for clothing, furniture, &c., stolen out of their 
houses (these charges I know General Burgoyne will 
object to), the inhabitants look to me, and expect I 
shall see them paid. 
To acquit myself of censure, I am determined to 
lay them before the General Court, and desire that 
a Committee may be appointed to examine them, 
and make what deductions shall appear to them to 
be just, which I hope will give satisfaction to both 
parties. When this is done, I have to present it to 
him for payment, and then advertise the inhabitants 
to come and receive their moneys. I shall lose no 
time in bringing the whole to a close as soon as 
possible. 

Thus, Sir, I have given an account of what I have 
been doing, and still have to do, at this post, which 
I hope will meet your Excellency s approbation. 

I know of no detachments from my brigade left at 
any post. I shall advertise and order on all officers 
and soldiers who are absent with or without furloughs, 
as well as those recovered in hospitals. In the mean 
time, I beg leave to observe to your Excellency, that 
I have given three years service to my country, in 
which I have ruined my constitution, and so much 
impaired my health, that I am by no means fit or 
able to serve her in the field another campaign. 
These reasons, I hope, will have such weight with 
your Excellency as to recommend and urge to Con 
gress in favor of my dismission, without offering ano 
ther, which is notorious to the world ; and which is, 
that the pay is so small, under the present establish 
ment, compared with the enormous high price of 
clothing and the necessaries of life, that no officercan support himself in camp. That being the case, 
what must become of his family ? This is a matter 
of general complaint, which, I hope, will be redressed, 
or I fear the consequences. 

Yesterday, arrived in Marblehead a ship of fourhundred tons burden. She sailed from Halifax with 
VOL. n. 7 
two hundred and eighty-two prisoners, under convoy 
of a ship of war bound for Rhode Island. She parted 
from the ship in a gale of wind, when the prisoners 
took charge of her, and brought her in safely. 

The same day arrived a prize ship, mounting twenty 
nine-pounders, taken by the ship Portsmouth, laden 
with wines and English goods, bound to York. I 
am, Sir, with great truth and esteem, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

JOHN GLOVER. 



FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Flemington, 9 February, 1778. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I cannot let go my guide without taking this op 
portunity of writing to your Excellency, though I 
have not yet public business to speak of. I go on 
very slow r ly; sometimes drenched by rain,, sometimes 
covered by snow, and not entertaining many hand 
some thoughts about the projected incursion into Ca 
nada, If successes were to be had, it would surprise 
me in a most agreeable manner, by that very reason 
that I do not expect any shining ones. Lake Champlain is too cold for producing the least bit of laurel, 
and, if I am not starved, I shall be as proud as if I 
had gained three battles. 

Mr. Ducr had given to me a rendezvous at a ta 
vern, but nobody was to be found there. I fancy 
that he will be with Mr. Conway sooner than he has 
told me. They will perhaps conquer Canada before 
my arrival, and I expect to meet them at the Go 
vernor s house in Quebec. 

Could I believe, for one single instant, that this 
pompous command of a Northern army will let yourExcellency forget a little us absent friends, then I 
would send the project to the place it comes from. 
But I dare hope that you will remember me some 
times. I wish you, very heartily, the greatest public 
and private happiness and successes. It is a very 
melancholy idea for me, that I cannot follow yourfortunes as near your person as I could wish ; but 
my heart will take, very sincerely, its part of every 
thing which can happen to you; and I am already 
thinking of the agreeable moment when I may come 
down to assure your Excellency of the most tender 
affection and highest respect. I have the honor to 
be, &c. 

LAFAYETTE. 



FROM GOVERNOR LIVINGSTON. 

Trenton, 16 February, 1778. 

SIR, 

I have received your Excellency s favor of the 14th 
instant, this day, and that of the 4th, a few days 
since. 

It would give me pleasure to consent to let threetroops of Jersey horse enter into the Continental service till the opening of the next campaign, as it 
would not only give me an opportunity of obliging 
your Excellency, but would be of service to the troops 
in acquiring skill and experience, which they would 
afterwards introduce into our other squadrons. But, 
from our present situation, I think we could not spare 
more than one. 

With your request of the 14th I shall comply, as 
far as possible, and endeavour to procure, to-morrow, 
a resolution of both Houses to authorize the President and Council of Safety to impress wagons for a 
limited time. But these,, Sir, are very temporary ex 
pedients. It is impossible for this State to cure the 
blunders of those whose business it is to provide the 
army ; and, considering what New Jersey has suffered 
by the war, I am pretty certain it cannot hold out 
another year, if the rest will not furnish their pro 
portionable share of provisions ; and, for my own part, 
though I would rather spend the remainder of niy 
days in a wigwam at Lake Erie, than be the most 
splendid vassal of any arbitrary prince on earth, I 
am so discouraged by our public mismanagement, and 
the additional load of business thrown upon me by 
the villany of those who pursue nothing but accu 
mulating fortunes to the ruin of their country, that I 
almost sink under it. I do not say this, Sir, to discourage you from applying to me at any time for 
any thing that is in my power to do, assuring you 
that it always gives me particular pleasure to contri 
bute in the least to alleviate that burden of yours, to 
which mine does not deserve to be compared. 

I shall pursue the plan, pointed out by the Com 
mittee of Congress, for procuring horses. I am, with 
the greatest esteem, 

Your Excellency s most humble servant, 

WILLIAM LIVINGSTON. 



FROM CAPTAIN HENRY LEE. 

Dover, 21 February, 1778. 

This country does not answer our expectation with 
respect to wagons. Consequently, the conveyance of 
the salt provision, &c., collected at this place, will 
not be so expeditious as could be wished. A drove 
of cattle, from seventy to a hundred head, will set 
out to-morrow from Middletown. JWe_do_ business very 
regularly, visiting, in our route, each and every farm, 
and taking with^jus every article necessary for ourarmy. Very little discontent prevails among the in 
habitants, and that only from among the notoriously 
disaffected. This State is void of all government ; 
therefore we can meet with no aid from the civil. 
They have a form, but there is no spirit or energy. 
The situation of the country, the want of government, 
and the artifices of the friends to the British army, 
render these lower countries an asylum to deserters 
from the Continental army. Several officers are now 
here for the business of apprehending deserters, but, 
though very active, they meet with little success, be 
cause they have no aid from government. The As 
sembly is now convened at this place. The active 
and spirited members wish a letter to the House 
from your Excellency on this head. They think many 
good consequences would result from it. I am in 
formed that there cannot be less than hundred 
deserters, who live on the fruits of their labor in this 
country. Some men of power and influence encourage 
this abominable practice by their private countenance. 

Perhaps if your Excellency would address the Le 
gislature on the subject, and at the same time furnish me with directions and authority to apprehend 
and deliver to the Provost such persons as are noto 
riously guilty of this high crime against the interest 
of the States, great advantages might accrue to the 
army. I am convinced it would encourage the re 
cruiting service. 

I must again beg that your Excellency will order 
a proper person, with money to pay those persons 
with whom I must contract debts in the execution of 
7* 
my commission. I have promised the people that 
they shall be paid, and shall be much distressed if 
my promise is not fulfilled. I have the honor to be, 
with the most perfect respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

HENRY LEE. 



FROM GOVERNOR COOKE. 

Providence, 23 February, 1778. 

SIR, 

I have been favored with your Excellency s letter 
of the 3d instant, inclosing a proposal, made to you 
by General Varnum, for recruiting the two Continental battalions raised by the State. 

I laid the letter before the General Assembly, at 
their session on the second Monday in this month, 
who, considering the pressing necessity of filling up 
the Continental army, and the peculiarly difficult cir 
cumstances of this State, which rendered it in a man 
ner impossible to recruit our battalions in any other 
way, adopted the measure. Liberty is given to every 
effective slave to enter the service during the war; 
and, upon his passing muster, he is absolutely madefree, and entitled to all the wages, bounties, and 
encouragements, given by Congress to any soldier en 
listing into their service. The masters are allowed at 
the rate of one hundred and twenty pounds for the 
most valuable slave, and in proportion for those of 
less value. The number of slaves in this State is not 
great, but it is generally thought that three hundred 
and upwards will be enlisted. I am, with great re 
spect, Sir, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

NICHOLAS COOKE. 
FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SULLIVAN. 

Camp, Valley Forge, 2 March, 1778. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

Nothing can be more painful to me, than the repe 
tition of a request, which is known to be disagreeable to a Commander, to whom America in general, 
and myself in particular, stand so much indebted. 
After so polite a refusal as I have once had, I should 
have remained forever silent upon the subject, did 
not pure necessity, which knows no law, compel me 
to repeat my request. I sincerely lament my being 
compelled to discover my situation and my feelings, 
and hope that a long silence upon the subject will 
be looked upon by your Excellency rather as evi 
dence of patience, than as a mark of my having the 
gift of complaining without cause. I shall repeat 
facts. 

When Britain first began to send troops to Boston, 
I began, at great expense, to manoeuvre troops as well 
in the eastern part of Massachusetts as in our own 
State. This not only occasioned a loss of time, but 
the loss of money was inevitable. I then served the 
public part of two years in Congress. Between the 
sessions of Congress I undertook to dismantle the 
fort at Piscataway. The Continent have received and 
used the cannons, small arms, powder, &c., which were, 
at my expense, removed into the country, at the distance of a number of miles, for which I have never 
had the least reward, nor have I the least probability 
of it. Since I have been in the service I have been 
rather unfortunate. I have been robbed at Long Is 
land, New York, New Rochelle, and at Peekskill. The 
last of these losses I never suspected, till I was on 
my return from New England, and had arrived within 
a mile of the place. I lost, at those several times, ten 
suits of clothes complete, a large quantity of linens, 
all my camp equipage, a valuable military library, 
&c. &c. I have, notwithstanding, weathered out the 
campaign, but have neither clothes nor equipage to 
begin another, or money to purchase. I have lost 
three horses in the service, which I am not able to 
replace ; and though one of them was killed in action, 
and the others in different service, Congress will 
make no recompense. 

Under these circumstances, I have but two ways 
left. One is to quit the service entirely, and the 
other, to quit it for a season, to prepare myself for 
greater fatigue and losses. I need not mention to 
your Excellency how inadequate the eight 
allowed by Congress, is to the support of an officer; 
my first letter has hinted it ; I am sure your Excel 
lency can see the justice of the hint. I have men 
tioned two ways of relief for myself. My first letter 
has shown the necessity, as well as a letter I wrote 
to Colonel Harrison, from Princeton, in June last. 
Could I be permitted to have my choice, it would be 
the former, as I have suffered too much and received 
too little for the fatigue I have endured. If this 
can be procured without trouble to your Excellency, 
and without my incurring your Excellency s censure, 
it will much oblige, dear General, him that is, with 
every sentiment of gratitude and respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

JOHN SULLIVAN. 


FROM THE REVEREND TIMOTHY D WIGHT.* 

8 March, 1778. 
MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 

The application, which is the subject of this letter, 
is, I believe, not common in the American regions; 
yet I cannot but hope it will not, on that account, be 
deemed impertinent or presumptive. For several years 
I have been employed in writing a poem, on the Con 
quest of Canaan, by Joshua. This poem, upon the first 
knowledge of your Excellency s character, I deter 
mined, with leave, to inscribe to you. If it will not 
be too great a favor, it will certainly be remembered 
with gratitude. 

I am not insensible that the subject of this request 
is delicate ; as consent on the part of your Excellency 
cannot possibly add to your reputation, and may be 
followed by consequences of a disagreeable nature. 
Of the merit or demerit of the work, your Excellency 
cannot form a guess, but from the character of the 
writer, with which you will be made acquainted by 
General Parsons, who does me the honor to inclose 
this in one from himself. All that I can say upon 
the subject (and I hope I may assert it with pro 
priety) is, that I am so independent a Republican, 
and so honest a man, as to be incapable of a wish 
to palm myself upon the world under the patronage 
of another, as to be remote from any sinister view 
in this application, and to disdain making the proffer, 
slight as it is, to the most splendid personage, for 



* At this time a Chaplain in General Parsons s brigade, at West Point. 
See Washington s Writings, Vol. V. p. 288. 
whose character I have not a particular esteem. I 
am, with the greatest respect, your Excellency s 
Most obedient and most humble servant, 

TIMOTHY D WIGHT, JR. 



FROM THOMAS WIIA11TON. 

In Council, Lancaster, 10 March, 1778. 

SIR, 

In answer to your Excellency s letter of the 7th 
instant, I beg leave to inclose to you extracts of a 
letter to his Excellency the President of Congress, 
from this Council, and of a representation from the 
Council and the General Assembly to Congress, by 
which your Excellency will see that attention has 
been given to the supplying of the army with wa 
gons, and what is the opinion of the Council respecting the difficulties attending this business. 

There is not any State on this Continent which 
has been so oppressed with Continental business as 
this has been, from the beginning of the present con 
troversy to this hour. Its exertions have been so 
zealous and unremitting, that no time has been lost 
in inquiries after groundless charges of neglect madeagainst it, which have been generally calculated to 
excuse indolent or improvident officers, or to disgrace 
the government established in it. The amazingly 
difficult task, which your Excellency has to perform, 
while you are embarrassed with perpetual applications 
and complaints of officers, who are not fully acquainted with their duty, must too forcibly convince you 
how near to an impossibility it is to conduct very 
extensive business without the subordinate officers discharging, in some sort, their duty ; and it is from the 
example of your Excellency alone, that it is believed 
to be possible to conduct the affairs of a large army, 
under the difficulties which you have had to contend 
with. Equal abilities or success in attempts of this 
kind are not to be expected in many instances. And 
this Council must acknowledge that they are not 
equal to the task imposed on them, if it is under 
stood to be their duty to furnish every Deputy Quarter-master with four or five wagons, whenever they 
are wanted, and to give equal attention to every other 
department of the State and army. This, indeed, 
seems to be expected of them; for there is, at present, 
an absolute dependence on the Council to supply the 
common rations of the soldiery now in the borough. 
An earnest desire to serve the general cause, and a 
zealous attachment to its interest, are the only mo 
tives which could possibly induce the Council to undertake such business in any extremity. 

The unparalleled patience and magnanimity with 
which the army, under your Excellency s command, 
have endured the hardships attending their situation, 
unsupplied as they have been through an uncommonly 
severe winter, is an honor which posterity will con 
sider as more illustrious than could have been derived to them by a victory obtained by any sudden and 
vigorous exertion. The latter often depends on some 
circumstance trifling in itself, while the former is derived from a determined perseverance through the 
greatest difficulties, which virtue and a truly patriotic 
spirit only can inspire. 

I have the honor to be, &c., 

THOMAS WHARTON, JR. 
FROM GENERAL CADWALADER. 

Maryland, 12 March, 1778. 

DEAR SIR ; 

I should have troubled you with a few lines if any 
thing had occurred to me that might, in the least, 
tend to promote the service. You receive such a mul 
titude of letters, that I can hardly think myself ex 
cused in taking up so much of your time as to thank 
you for the civilities I received from you at camp. 

I shall be happy to hear that you have passed the 
winter undisturbed; and that you have been able to 
keep your army together. My fears about provisions 
and forage, I confess, still give me great pain. 

Recruiting in this and the next county below suc 
ceeds better than I expected. One half of the quota 
required of each county is, I am w r ell informed, madeup, and the remainder will soon be completed. The 
farmers are in great fear of a law to draft the mili 
tia; and they are exerting themselves to the utmost 
in assisting the recruiting officers. 

There is no person who more sincerely wishes suc 
cess to the cause of America than I do ; and I should 
have esteemed it an honor to have been continued in 
the command I had in Pennsylvania, if the Govern 
ment had been such a one as promised that freedom 
and happiness for which we are contending with 
Great Britain. I now no longer look upon myself as 
a resident of that State, and am at a loss to know 
what part I shall act in this. As soon as the cam 
paign opens, I shall endeavour to make myself useful 
in some way or other. 

The importance of Billingsport to us, if we should 
be able to act offensively, has not, I dare say, escaped 
your notice. But I am apprehensive the enemy know 



TPIE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 85 

too well its consequence to neglect to take possession 
of it before we dare to do it. Five or six hundred 
men might defend it against a storm ; but would it 
be possible to keep it till we could collect force 
enough to make an attempt by siege dangerous to 
Philadelphia? The possession of this post may re 
quire such a variety of movements, that it appears to 
me a very considerable number of boats will be necessary. 

Be pleased to present my compliments to Mrs. 
Washington. With the sincerest esteem and respect, 
I remain, 

Your most obedient, and very humble servant, 

JOHN CADWALADER. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LINCOLN. 

Hingham, 17 March, 1778. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

Would not an early attempt upon the city of New 
York, by part of the Continental troops and the 
eastern militia, be attended with great probability of 
success ? Indeed, if there was but a small prospect 
of our carrying the city, it appears to me that ourcollecting a respectable body of men in its vicinity 
would be attended with many good effects ; as there 
by we should probably divide the enemy, put them 
on the defensive, and oblige them to govern their 
movements by ours. We should be in a good situation to guard the North River, and even give succourto the northern parts of the State of New York, 
should Britain be so infatuated as to attempt a second 
invasion thereof. We should then receive an easy 
supply of provisions and forage. We should draw the 

VOL. II. 8 
enemy from an open champaign country to one strong 
by nature, less favorable to their designs, and more 
friendly to ours. We should have our rear open to 
a strong and plentiful country, filled with men friend 
ly to the common cause. We should bring back the 
war to a climate more healthy, at least for the New 
England people, than a southern one, for which rea 
son the militia could with greater ease be drawn 
forth. We should avoid those inconveniences, which 
necessarily arise from the want of provisions and fo 
rage, when our whole force is collected in one camp, 
and have an opportunity of fighting the enemy in 
detachments, which is of importance to us, as a con 
siderable proportion of our men will be undisciplined. 

I hope these suggestions do not convey the most 
distant idea of a measure injurious to the Southern 
States. Nothing can be farther removed from my 
mind than the thought that the cause can be sup 
ported but by our most vigorous, united, and confi 
dential exertions. We are all embarked on the same 
bottom, and shall be saved or lost together. Should 
the Union be broken, and we find ourselves sinking, 
in vain will the Southern States lay the blame of the 
sad event upon the Northern, or the Northern re 
criminate upon the Southern. 

I am happy to inform your Excellency, that my 
wounded leg daily acquires strength, and there is no 
present appearance of any further exfoliations. It is 
a little shorter than the other. However, the defect 
I hope to supply by a corked shoe, and that it will 
not be long before I shall be able to walk.* I am, 
dear General, with sentiments of regard and esteem, 
Your affectionate, humble servant, 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN.

action of Behmus s Heights. 
FROM COUNT PULASKI. 
(Translation.) 

Yorktown, 19 March, 1778. 
SlR ? 

Without going into a detailed history of niy life, 
which would be too long, it will suffice to say to 
you, in the language of an old soldier and of a 
citizen, that, in coming to America, my sole object 
has been to devote myself entirely to her welfare 
and glory, in using every exertion in my individual 
power to secure her freedom. 

I think the nation was satisfied of my sentiments 
when it saw that I accepted the post of BrigadierGeneral of cavalry, though a long service, and my 
former rank of Commander-in-chief of the army of 
Poland, had given me a right to expect a higher po 
sition. But the sole desire to distinguish myself by 
my zeal in the cause of the United States, has disposed me to sacrifice my repose and my life to its 
support, at all times, and in whatever position. I 
venture to flatter myself, Sir, that my conduct at the 
head of the cavalry has proved this to the complete 
satisfaction of the people and the Honorable Congress ; 
happy, General, if I may now be assured of that con 
fidence, on your part, to which I aspire, and if, as I 
hope, you will honor with your approbation a plan 
which I have conceived with a sole view to the 
public good. Here it is, just as I have conceived it 
to be best adapted to benefit the army and the 
public. 

The corps placed under my command shall be in 
dependent, and formed of the two companies of 
horse and of six companies of infantry. If the Board 
of War, on which it will depend, shall see fit to en 
large it, on seeing, by experience of its courage and 
conduct, that it might be thus made of greater uti 
lity, it will be for them to decide. 

The duty of the Commandant-m-chief of this corps 
will be always to observe, very close at hand, all the 
movements of the enemy ; to take upon himself dif 
ferent enterprises, of the nature of surprises, ambus 
cades, affairs of posts, rear-guards, protecting flanks, 
&c., and to advise the Commander-in-chief of the 
army, and the Board of War, of every thing which 
he shall find to be of interest. It is easy to see 
that the whole system of the Commander of such a 
corps is simply one of active operation. So that, 
without enlarging on the advantages to be derived 
from it, it is easy to see that a corps which shall 
have no other object than to surprise the enemy, to 
watch them incessantly, and attack them at all points 
by continual surprises, must be of great utility. 

The corps will be recruited from the people of the 
country, from deserters, and from prisoners of war, 
agreeably to the letter of General Washington. 

I would propose, for my subaltern, an experienced 
officer, by name Kow r acz, formerly a Colonel and partisan in the Prussian service. And as my plan is to 
employ all the other officers whom I personally know 
to be capable of serving with distinction and honor, 
after obtaining the consent of the Honorable Con 
gress for the execution of the plan, I shall have the 
honor to mention them. 

The muskets for the infantry, the pistols for the 
lancers, the sabres, and the horses, to be furnished 
me as soon as possible. I will undertake to execute 
the rest; and as it is difficult to find leather for 
boots, saddles, &c., I request an order upon the Commissary of Leather to furnish it to me, and upon the 
different Commandants where my recruits may be, for 
quarters and rations. 

I hope that the instructions may be such, that onethird of the cost of equipping the corps may be furnished at once ; another third, in proportion as the 
corps is filled up ; and so on. 

You enjoy, General, the most distinguished, estima 
tion in our army. I reverence your virtue and yourvalor; and your military knowledge gives me a 
confident hope, in presenting this view, of the success 
of a plan which is only interesting to me through 
my desire to make myself useful to the nation. 

I hope, General, that you will do me the favor to 
obtain a prompt decision. 

C. PULASKI. 



FROM THE REVEREND JOHN ETTWEIN. 

Bethlehem, 25 March, 1778. 

SIR, 

Being informed by Dr. Shippen, the Director-General of the Military Hospitals, of an intention or pro 
posal to fix the general hospital at Letiz, one of the 
settlements of the United Brethren, eight miles from 
Lancaster, and that he gave it as his opinion, that 
in that case the inhabitants of said Letiz might be 
moved to Bethlehem and Nazareth, and finding said 
proposition founded upon misinformation and a very 
wrong notion of the constitution of these infant set 
tlements of the United Brethren, commonly called 
Moravians ; I humbly beg leave to give your Excel 
lency a short and true description of the Brethren s 
settlements in general, and of Letiz in particular. 
8* 
The Brethren s church in Germany, with a view to 
propagate the Gospel among the heathens, and to 
plant a nursery of missionaries to the Indians and 
negroes, as also to provide one or more places where 
their here-and-there dispersed and persecuted mem 
bers might find rest and liberty of conscience, did, 
in the year 1736, send a number of their members 
to make a settlement in Georgia, where the Trustees 
had promised them all indulgence in regard to their 
particular principles ; but being very ill-treated by 
the populace, on account of the war with the Span 
iards, they left Georgia, moved to Pennsylvania, and 
began this place, called Bethlehem, in the forks of 
Delaware, in 1741. 

Their poverty, and the wild state of these parts, 
made them deny many conveniences of this life, and 
they lived in simplicity and brotherly love, as onefamily, worked all for the benefit of the whole, and 
desired nothing but food and raiment; if one or the 
other had some private property, he deposited it, or 
disposed of it as he pleased, for his own interest, 
for there was no communion of goods, though it 
seemed so. 

In this way they began several other settlements ; 
but finding more and more difficulties to go on in 
this economy, it was, by common consent, altered in 
the year 1762 ; so that all who had a mind to carry 
on their art or trade, and usual occupation, for their 
own emolument, were assisted to do it. The steward 
of the single brethren, in their name and behalf, be 
came debtor for the debt of the house and stocks in 
their possession. So did the single sisters with their 
house. To encourage and to support honesty and 
fair dealing, the tavern, mill, and merchant store. 
were reserved for the benefit of the Society; and a 
few others, who required a large stock, and great 
risk, were also left to it. Each branch bears its ex 
penses, as salaries, rent, and interest of the stocks, 
&c., and the yearly gain or overplus is appropriated 
to the funds for maintaining the ministers, schools, 
missionaries, old and infirm, and their widows, or 
phans, and children of missionaries. 

In this economical regulation we lived very happy 
in brotherly love and union, and enjoyed the blessings of God attending it. But it has been the cause 
of two very erroneous opinions, or ideas, in the mind 
of strangers, concerning these settlements, of very grie 
vous consequences for them, namely, as if they were 
still as one family, and as if they were very rich. 
Both are great mistakes, if taken in a natural sense ; 
for every congregation, and every family and private 
person, has to take care of itself, so as it is custo 
mary in other places, though we do help and assist 
each other a little more than is nowadays custom 
ary. All the moneys for transporting so many hundreds from the inner part of Germany to America, to 
buy lands, and great sums expended in building and 
providing stocks, have been borrowed, and very little 
paid off. 

In the year 1757, upon request of some friends, a 
little town was laid out in Lancaster county, and 
called Letiz (in remembrance of the place where, 
just three hundred years before, the first Brethren s 
settlement was begun by some of the followers of 
John IIuss in Bohemia). Some brethren were settled 
there. With borrowed money they built three good 
fine houses ; one with a hall, where they can have 
divine service, till they shall be able to build another 
place of public worship. This house has, besides the 
hall, a few rooms where one of our bishops and the 
minister of the place dwell. On one side of it, the 
single brethren, and on the other the single sisters, 
build houses, on their own account. As well the sin 
gle men as the single women in these houses have 
their own separate economy. Each house has two 
persons to take care of their temporal and spiritual 
welfare ; each person residing in the house is paid for 
his labor, and pays weekly a certain sum for boarding and lodging, to the House economy. The yearly 
profit in that economy is for the sick and superan 
nuated, or others who cannot earn a livelihood. 

All the other houses in said Letiz, except the 
tavern and a house where a shopkeeper lives, about 
eighteen in number, are the property of private families, who built and fitted them, convenient for their 
several trades and occupations. Amongst them are 
two taverns, one whitesmith, one gunsmith, one organbuilder, one skinner, the rest shoemakers, weavers, &c. 

The single brethren were turned out of their wellregulated economy and different trades, and their 
house, to their great inconvenience and damage, con 
verted into a hospital, which is also the case of those 
in Bethlehem. 

Should your Excellency agree to Dr. Shippen s 
proposal, three hundred souls w r ould be inexpressibly 
distressed, and the single brethren and sisters, and 
all the families at Letiz, by their removal, would be 
entirely ruined in their property their useful occu 
pations, to the loss of the public, would be stopped; 
and it would be impossible to accommodate them 
with lodgings at Bethlehem and Nazareth, where AVC 
are so crow r ded together that it is a great hinderance 
to our lawful callings, wherein we provided for ourselves and served the public. 

I pray, therefore, most humbly, in the name of the 
Bishop and Elders of the United Brethren, that yourExcellency would please to grant to the Brethren s 
settlements in the fork of Delaware and at Letiz, 
near Lancaster, and at Hope, in Sussex county, West 
Jersey, protection for their persons and property, 
against all such oppressive and destructive measures. 

It is our duty to comfort and to help, as far as we 
are able, all the distressed, and to serve the public 
in our callings, wherever we can. We have done it 
with a willing heart, and intend, by the grace of 
God, to do so as long as we live. 

Recommending your Excellency to God s favor and 
protection, I am, with deepest respect, 

Your Excellency s most humble servant, 

JOHN ETTWEIN. 

P. S. The bearer, Mr. llasse, is well informed of 
our circumstances, and can give your Excellency further explanation of one thing or the other, if it is 
desired. 



FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Albany, 25 March, 1778. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

How happy I have been in receiving your Excel 
lency s favor of the 10th present, I hope you will 
be convinced by the knowledge of my tender affec 
tion for you. I am very sensible of that goodness, 
which tries to dissipate my fears about that ridiculous Canadian expedition. At the present time we 
know which was the aim of the honorable Board, 
and for which project three or four men have rushed 
the country into a great expense, and risked the reputation of our arms, and the life of many hundred 
men, had the General, your deceived friend, been as 
rash and foolish as they seem to have expected. 0, 
American freedom, what shall become of you, if you 
are in such hands ! 

I have received a letter from the Board, and a re 
solve from Congress, by which you are directed to 
recall me and the Baron de Kalb, whose presence is 
deemed absolutely necessary to your army. I believe 
that of General Conway is absolutely necessary to Al 
bany, and he has received orders to stay there, which 
I have no objection to, as nothing, perhaps, will be 
done in this quarter but some disputes of Indians 
and Tories. However, you know I have wrote to 
Congress, and as soon as their leave will come, I 
shall let Conway have the command of these few 
regiments, and I shall immediately join my respect 
able friend ; but till I have received instructions for 
leaving that place from yourself, I shall stay, as 
powerful Commander-in-chief, as if Congress had never 
resolved my presence absolutely necessary for the 
Great Army. 

Since your last letter, I have given up the idea 
of New York, and my only desire is to join you. 
The only favor I have asked of your Commissioners 
in France, has been, not to be under any orders but 
those of General Washington. I seem to have had 
an anticipation of our future friendship ; and what I 
have done out of esteem and respect for your Excel 
lency s name and reputation, I should do now out of 
mere love for General Washington himself. I am 
glad to hear General Greene is Quartermaster-General ; it is very interesting to have there an honest 
man and a friend of yours. 

But I feel the greatest pain not to hear any thing 
about reinforcements. What can you do with a 
handful of men ? And my poor division, whom I was 
so desirous of instructing, clothing, managing myself 
in the winter, and whom, I was told, I should find 
six thousand strong at the opening of the campaign! 
Don t your Excellency think that I could recruit a 
little in General Greene s division, now that he is 
Quartermaster-General ? By that promotion I find 
myself very proud to be the third officer of yourarmy. 

With the utmost respect and affection, I have the 

honor to be, &e., 

LAYFAYETTE. 



FROM GENERAL BURGOYNE. 

Cambridge, 4 April, 1778. 

SIR, 

I beg you to accept my sincerest acknowledgments 
for your very obliging letter. I find the character, 
which I before knew to be respectable, is also per 
fectly amiable ; and I should have few greater pri 
vate gratifications in seeing our melancholy contest 
at an end, than that of cultivating your friendship. 

I shall take particular care of your letter to Mr. 
Fairfax. He is a gentleman much esteemed. I hopethere is no reason to apprehend his death ; I heard 
no such report when I left England, last spring, nor 
have I seen it in any of the magazines since, most 
of which have come to my hands. I have the honor 
to be, with great respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

JOHN BURGOYNE.*

Yorktown, 4 April, 1778. 

SIR, 

Since my last, of the 30th ultimo, per Barry, I had 
the honor of receiving and presenting to Congress 
your Excellency s favor of the 29th of that month, 
which, having been taken under consideration, the in 
closed act was this day resolved, for empowering 
your Excellency, when you shall judge it necessary, 
to call on the States of Maryland, Pennsylvania, and 
New Jersey, for five thousand militia-men, armed and 
accoutred. I have the honor to be, with great esteem 
and respect, Sir, your Excellency s 

Most obedient and most humble servant, 

HENRY LAURENS, President of Congress. 

P. S. Evening, 9 &lt;? clock. M. de Francis this mo 
ment delivered me your Excellency s favor of the 1st 
instant, which shall be presented to Congress on 
Monday. Meantime permit me, Sir, to intimate that 
I had backed the report of your Excellency s letter 



as part of a speech in Parliament, May 2Gth, 1778, with the following preliminary remarks ; "I accompanied my letter to Congress by 
one to General Washington, wherein, upon an opinion of his charac 
ter, I asked him for his support to an application that could not in 
terfere with the public duties of our respective situations. I shall 
beg leave to read his answer as part of my speech ; and I do it. 
Sir, not only lest, in these times of doubt and aspersion, I should 
incur censure for holding private correspondence with an enemy, but 
likewise because I think the letter, though from an enemy, does 
honor to the human heart." Parliamentary Register, Vol. IX. p. 221. 

While General Burgoyne was at General Schuyler s house, in Al 
bany, he wrote as follows to Lord George Germain, October 20th, 
1777, concerning the American troops. 

"I should now hold myself unjustifiable, if I did not confide to 
your Lordship my opinion, upon a near inspection, of the rebel troops. 
The standing corps, which I have seen, are disciplined. I do not 
of the 27th of February with an information to Con 
gress, that one gentleman of the late Committee on 
the Ticonderoga inquiry had retired, and that it was 
impracticable for me to give that attention which 
was due to an affair of such importance. A new 
Committee was immediately appointed. These gen 
tlemen, some eight or ten days ago, offered a report, 
when Mr. Duer interposed arguments, which induced 
the House to postpone the consideration for two 
days. 

I have taken the liberty to name that gentleman, 
because his declared motives for delay were coupled 
with assurances of particular considerations respecting 
General Schuyler. This very morning I called on 
Mr. Duer, and reminded him of his engagements, 
urging the painful situation in which his friends and 
the other General Officers remained. He replied, " I 
will soon bring on that business." Your Excellency s 
present letter will prove a further incitement. I 
have very long felt for the gentlemen who are sub 
jects of the inquiry ; and, although it was with ex 
treme reluctance I obeyed the order of Congress to 
be of the original Committee, after having urged 
such reasons for exemption as appeared to me very 
forcible, yet I cannot charge myself with delinquen 
cy at any stage in the course of our proceedings. 
To account for the uncouth and entangled state of 
this inquiry, would not be half so difficult, as it 



hazard the term, but apply it to the great fundamental points of 
military institution; sobriety, subordination, regularity, and courage. 
The militia are inferior in method and movement, but not a jot less 
serviceable in woods. My conjectures were very different after the 
affair of Ticonderoga, but I am convinced they were delusive; and 
it is a duty to the state to confess it. The panic of the rebel troops 
is confined, and of short duration ; the enthusiasm is extensive and 
permanent." Ibid. Vol. XL p. 480. 

VOL. II. 9 
might be impertinent to the proper line of my correspondence. From this consideration I shall only 
add, that I trust your Excellency s present applica 
tion will have that weight which is justly due.

FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Yorktown, 8 April, 1778. 

SIR, 

I had the honor of writing to your Excellency, the 
4th, by Jones ; since which I have presented to Con 
gress your Excellency s favors of the 1st, 3d, and 4th. 
Upon reading the first, I took occasion to intimate 
to Mr. Duer the distressed situation of his friend 
General Schuyler, as described by the General himself in a late letter of the 15th of March, and this 
morning suggested again to the House the demands 
of all the General Officers, subjects of the suspended 
inquiry. I shall repeat the same to-morrow ; and, 
having just now obtained the concurrence of gen 
tlemen in private conversation, that Congress are 
guardians of the honor of their officers, I flatter 
myself there will be no further delay of this busi 
ness. 

Your Excellency will receive, under the present inclosure, an act of Congress of the 7th, for promoting 
Captain Lee to the rank of Major of horse, and to 
the command of a separate corps. I perceive it is 
not expressed in the act; but I am warranted to as 
sure your Excellency it is the particular desire of 
Congress that suitable declarations of that gentleman s 
merit should be expressed, either within the intended 
commission, or by annexing to it the above-mentioned 
act, a certified copy of which Major Lee will receive 
by the present despatch.* 

Consideration of Colonel Lee and Major Swasey s 
application is postponed a few days for particularreasons. I shall direct the Secretary of Congress to 
collect the dates of the late resignations of Colonels 
in the Virginia line, and transmit an account to yourExcellency, when obtained. 

Your Excellency s last letter of the 4th is at present the subject of a special Committee. It is proba 
ble a report will be offered to-morrow morning. 

Previous to the receipt of your Excellency s ad 
vices, Congress had determined to make a purchase 
of divers articles, set forth in Captain Cottineau s 
schedule of his cargo ; and for this purpose a gentle 
man will proceed, to-morrow, on his journey to Cape 
Lookout, by whom your Excellency s letter will go 
forward. I have the honor to be, with the highestesteem and regard, Sir, 

Your Excellency s obedient and humble servant, 

HENRY LAUEENS, President.

commanded, distinguished honor; and it being the determination of 
Congress to reward merit ;

corps by enlistment to two corps of horse, to act as a separate corps." 
FROM THE REVEREND ANDREW BURNABY.* 

Greenwich, 9 April, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

Availing myself of the present moment of tranquil 
lity, I sit down to renew a correspondence, which 
has been long interrupted, either by my residence in 
Italy, or by that common calamity which I am per 
suaded we both sincerely lament. Yet, how shall I 
resume a subject, which, by naturally carrying us 
back to those happy days when our acquaintance 
commenced, and obliging us to compare them with 
that sad and unfortunate reverse which has since 
happened, must necessarily affect us both with con 
cern ? A civil war, spreading enmity and distrust 
where affection and confidence ought naturally to prevail, is a circumstance which not only we, but every 
one not lost to humanity, must, I persuade myself, 
most seriously deplore. 

And is there no way to stop the further progress 
of this ruin, and heal the wounds which have been 
opened by so dire a calamity? Must the parent and 
the child be forever at r variance? And can either of 
them be happy, independent of the other? You, my 
dear Sir, know too well the circumstances and inte 
rest both of Great Britain and America, not to per 
ceive the impossibility of it. Great Britain and 
America, united, will constitute the fairest and happiest state in the world; but, divided, they will be

Revolution, and who published his Travels after his return to England. 
This letter seems to have been designed to prepare the way for the 
Commissioners, who were coming out empowered to negotiate a recon 
ciliation upon the terms embraced in what were called Lord North s 
Conciliatory Bills. 
quite the reverse. It is not even possible that Ame 
rica should be happy, unconnected with Great Britain. 
Will the union, for example, which is at this time so 
firm among the Americans, from the sense of a common cause, be permanent, when they are totally in 
dependent? Are there no circumstances in the state 
of each Colony, no ingredients in the character of 
their respective inhabitants, which render this morally 
impossible ? A worse and more disastrous war than 
the present will, in such case, not fail, in the space 
of half a century, to desolate America from border to 
border. Remember the States of Greece after the re 
treat of the Persians; remember the Peloponnesian 
war. 

France, too; is it to be supposed, however specious 
and fair her conduct and promises may be at present, 
that she can in reality be a well-wisher to America? 
I doubt not of her professions, indeed, nor even of 
her readiness, in case of any appearance of a recon 
ciliation taking place between us, to make war sooner 
than suffer it to come to a conclusion. But will it 
be from affection to America that she will do so? 
Et sic notus Ulysses ? Will it not rather be from 
hope that Great Britain and America may weaken 
each other, and then fall a common prey to her in 
sidious arts ? There can be no doubt of it. You 
yourself have most sensibly experienced the perfidy 
of that false and treacherous people. The interest of 
Great Britain and America is the same ; the same 
lineage, the same language, the same liberty, the 
same religion connecting them; but that of America 
and France is diametrically opposite, absolutely irre 
concilable. 

That union and harmony, then, which so happily 
subsisted between us in the year 1763, ought to be 
9* 
again revived, and forever preserved hereafter invio 
late and sacred. This, I am convinced, is the ardent 
wish of every good and honest man in this kingdom, 
whether in the highest or the humblest stations. In 
deed, the appointment of the present commission is an 
incontrovertible proof of it. Whatever errors or mis 
understandings there may have happened during the 
course of this unfortunate business, it is time that 
they were rectified, and that the wounds were on 
both sides healed. Let us mutually forget our past 
misfortunes, and unanimously strive to recover ourformer happiness and friendship. Let affliction teach 
us wisdom and moderation. 

You, my dear Sir, whose virtues have raised you 
to so eminent and conspicuous a situation, may, by 
using and exerting your endeavours, contribute very 
much to the completion of so divine a purpose ; and 
thereby acquire more glory, and confer more real 
and lasting service, both to your own country and to 
mankind in general, than perhaps ever yet happened 
to the lot of any one man. May Heaven give you 
the power, as I doubt not the inclination, to effect 
so great and virtuous a design! 

Allow me, before I take leave of you, to inquire 
after Mrs. Washington and my friends. I hope they 
are well; and desire that you will recall me to their 
remembrance. You will find, by a very imperfect 
and I fear injudicious, account of my travels in Ame 
rica, which I have taken the liberty to send you, 
how deep a sense I retain of the kindness and civil 
ities of my American acquaintance. I hope Mrs. 
Washington will not think that I have spoken too 
slightly of the Virginian ladies. If she does, be so 
good as to remind her, in a whisper, that I w r as at 
that time in love with a lady whom I had left in 
England ; and, of course, was half blind to the beauty 
of every one else. I was not, however, insensible to 
her merit; and I would add, if it were not for fearthat she would suspect me of flattery, that the happiness of her acquaintance obliged me to speak that 
truth of the Virginian ladies, which, in my present 
judgment, I think the most honorable testimony I 
could bear to their virtue, "that they make the best 
wives and best mothers in the world." 

Wythe is, I take for granted, as philosophical and 
Socratic as ever, and as deeply absorbed in Grecian 
literature. Be so good as to present my best affec 
tions to him. Our friend, Small, is, alas ! no more. 
He died about two years ago, leaving a considerable 
fortune, but a much more considerable character be 
hind him. 

I am, myself, in possession of every blessing in life ; 
a respectable preferment, an independent fortune, a 
wife after the Virginian model, four sons and a daugh 
ter, and, above all things, of the most perfect friend 
ship and affection for yourself; being, dear Sir, with 
the highest respect and gratitude, your most faithful 
and most obliged humble servant, 

ANDREW BURNABY. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OP CONGRESS. 

Yorktown, 14 April, 1778. 

SIR, 

In obedience to the direction of Congress, I am to 
acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th 
instant. Congress, with great concern, perceive that 
your sensibility is wounded by their resolutions. 
Placing the firmest confidence in your prudence, abilities, and integrity, they wish to preserve that harmony with you, which is essential to the general 
weal. You may rest assured, that, far from any in 
tention to give you pain, their resolutions have no 
other motives or end but the public good. They 
therefore hope that you will not, in future, be distressed by apprehensions as injurious to their honor 
as they are to your own feelings. 

However different the views of Congress may seem 
to you now from what you supposed them to be 
when you entered into your late engagements with 
General Howe, Congress certainly had nothing in 
view but a proper respect to the dignity, safety, and 
independence of these States. The duplicity of Ge 
neral Howe, and authentic information that the gen 
tlemen appointed by you to negotiate the cartel held 
opinions repugnant to the sense of Congress, con 
strained them, in a matter of such high moment as 
forming a general cartel, to express their sentiments 
in an explicit manner, lest they might have only to 
lament, when it was out of their power to remedy, a 
misapprehension on points deeply affecting, in their 
judgment, the safety and honor of these States. 

Congress expected you would consider their resolu 
tions of the 30th ultimo in the light of private in 
structions, calculated to show their sense with respect 
to the general outlines of the proposed cartel ; a 
practice usual with the supreme power of every State 
in similar cases. You observe that a strict adherence 
to all the resolutions of Congress must, of necessity, 
destroy all idea of a cartel ; but, as a distinction can 
easily be made betwixt such of the resolutions of 
Congress as flow from general principles of policy, 
and those which arise from circumstances which have 
rendered a variation from time to time necessary, it 
is conceived that an attention to this discrimination 
will rid you of those embarrassments, which you may, 
at first view, think yourself entangled with. The re 
solution of Congress of the 19th December, respecting 
the mode of settlement for supplies to the enemy s 
prisoners, seems not to have been sufficiently attended to. It is left at the option of the enemy to pay 
either in coin, dollar for dollar, or in provisions 
equal in quantity and kind to what is furnished. 
Whatever objections may be made against the first 
mode, there surely cannot be a more just and equal 
ratio than the latter. General Burgoyne lately madethe same objections on this point, which are carried 
to you; but, on being reminded of the alternative 
offered by the resolution, he acquiesced, and the vict 
ualling-ships are now actually delivering provisions 
in payment for what they received. The Commis 
saries of Prisoners, on each side, may pass receipts 
for the rations received, expressing the quantum of 
each article received for the subsistence of the pri 
soners in the power of the contracting parties, and 
the balance may be paid in provisions or in coin, at 
the option of either party. 

The mode suggested by you is liable to this strong 
objection; that it would lay us under the necessity 
of furnishing the enemy s prisoners with us, as well 
as ours with them, with provisions; which certainly 
would be a capital advantage to them, if we consider 
the distance whence they must derive their supplies. 
The resolution of the 30th December was a measure 
naturally flowing from the treason acts, which the 
respective States have passed in consequence of the 
express recommendation of Congress. On a mature 
deliberation, they are convinced that a deviation from 
it would be subversive of our character as an independent people, in consistence with sound policy. No 
act of Congress can suspend the operation of the 
laws of the different States, and therefore they can 
not consent that any measure should be adopted in 
the proposed cartel, which may contravene this reso 
lution. 

It does not, however, appear to Congress that any 
embarrassment will arise in this matter, unless the 
enemy should insist upon an article in the cartel, 
that Americans, taken in arms, shall be entitled to the 
benefits of an exchange. Under the terms u officerfor officer, soldier for soldier," which are generally 
used in cartels, traitors would no more be included 
by the laws of nations than deserters. The carrying 
this resolution into practice can depend only on the 
will of the several States, who, in this respect, must 
be presumed to be governed by principles of policy. 
of which they must necessarily be competent judges. 
With respect to the resolution concerning General 
Lee, at his request Congress are willing that you 
should waive his exchange for Major-General Prescott, 
as a preliminary article. It is, however, their inten 
tion that no cartel be acceded to, unless it be ex 
pressly admitted therein, that General Lee be ex 
changed for General Prescott, 

Congress have taken measures for purchasing such 
articles of Captain Cottineau s cargo as are necessary 
for the army. 

By order of Congress, 

HENRY LAURENS, President. 
FROM JOHN BANISTER,* 

York, 16 April, 1778. 

SIR, 

In consequence of a letter from Governor Henry 
to the Virginia Delegates, directing the payment of 
thirty thousand dollars, as an additional bounty granted to the soldiers who have reenlisted into the Vir 
ginia regiments, I am to inform you, that the money 
shall be paid in any manner you may please to 
direct. 

It was with the most painful sensibility that I pe 
rused your last letter, on the subject of the present 
state of the army, and I am equally concerned in re 
flecting, that I do not see effectual measures taken 
to ward off the impending blow. 

As to the establishment, I am under no doubt of 
its being adopted, and put upon a ground of stability. 
Its not having taken effect as yet, has been owing to 
a thin representation. Virginia, the leader in this 
great business, for want of the constituent number to 
form a representation, remains a cipher, without suf 
frage, at this momentous period. Did I not fear to 
intrude upon your hours of essential business, I should 
sometimes write- to you, for my own information, on 
military subjects ; here being the greatest ignorance 
in every occurrence of that kind, mixed with an in 
activity, that permits affairs of the greatest magnitudeto lie dormant, and give place to local trifles. I have 
said with freedom, in few words, what has often oc 
curred since I have been here. I wish I had the 
capability to apply an instant remedy, for nothing 
procrastinated will do. However, the military esta

blishment will come out soon. God knows what other 
regulations may take place. Virginia s drafted men 
will come on soon, and I believe may amount to 
seventeen hundred, instead of two thousand voted, as 
it is highly probable more men desert of those compelled into service, than if they had entered volunta 
rily. Colonel Harrison s artillery regiment are on 
their march. Would volunteers, provided they can be 
had, be of service to your operations ? Certain it is. 
they will not come out in such numbers as some have 
conjectured; but I believe a considerable body, per 
haps two battalions, may be induced to venture their 
persons, in this time of danger. 

The order on the Paymaster, if it is to go through 
his hands, will and eighty dollars ; the eighty 

being for a soldier, which I have desired Colonel 
Meade to pay. I am, with the highest regard and 
attachment, your Excellency s

Piccadilly, 17 April, 1778. 

Notwithstanding the different parts, Sir, we have 
taken in the unhappy differences still subsisting be 
tween Great Britain and America, I. flatter myself 
there yet remains a mutual share of esteem between 
your Excellency and me ; and I hope you do mo the 
justice to think, that should the Commissioners, by 
whom I have the honor of sending this, be fortunate 
enough to accomplish a reconciliation, it will give me 
the highest pleasure. When I inform your Excellency

FROM GENERAL CADWALADER. 

Maryland, Kent County, 27 April, 1778. 

MY DEAR SIR, 

I was on the Western Shore when your favor by 
Captain Lee reached my house ; and as I was daily 
expected home, General Dickinson did not forward it; 
by which means I cannot have the pleasure of seeing 
you so soon as I could wish. 

I alwa}^s proposed spending the active part of the 
campaign in camp, but I did not conceive the enemy 
could possibly take the field till towards the 1st of 
June, owing to the difficulties of subsisting their 
horses before that time; and, therefore, I have not 
made the necessary preparation for setting off imme 
diately, agreeably to your wishes. But, be assured, I 
shall exert myself, to the utmost, in getting some 

VOL. II. 10 
matters of importance to my private affairs settled ; 
after which, I shall lose no time in paying my compliments to you in camp. 

The wishes you kindly express, to see me engaged 
in the service, I esteem the greatest honor; but an 
appointment to any command, at this time, would pro 
bably create great complaints ; which, instead of occa 
sioning, I wish to prevent. I have not the vanity 
to think my assistance at camp can be important to 
the service ; but, small as it may be, I conceive it my 
duty to offer it at this critical time ; reflecting, that 
if it is of no value to my country, it will cost it 
nothing. 

Be pleased to present my compliments to the gen 
tlemen of your family; and believe me to be, with 
the greatest respect and esteem, your affectionate and 
most obedient, humble servant, 

JOHN CADWALADER. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Yorktown, 27 April, 1778. 

SIR, 

I had the honor of writing to your Excellency the 
24th instant, by McKlosky. Yesterday, about half 
past 5 o clock, P. M., your Excellency s favor of the 
25th was brought to me in Congress, and was imme 
diately presented. The person who had been the 
bearer of it was anxious to obtain a receipt of the 
letter to express the time of delivery, and he complained of unnecessary detention half the day at the 
Suscjuehanna Ferry. This intimation will answer his 
purpose. 

I am directed, by Congress, to request your Excel 
lency will immediately require all officers, civil as well 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. HI 

as military, in the army, who are at present delin 
quent, to comply with the terms of an act of Congress 
of the 3d of February last, by taking the oath of 
allegiance and abjuration, and that your Excellency 
will be pleased to cause the necessary certificates as 
speedily as possible to be returned, and if occasion 
shall be given, which is supposed to be scarcely possible, the name or names of such persons as shall 
refuse. 

The bearer hereof will deliver three packets, con 
taining about six hundred blanks, which will hasten 
the business of administering oaths. More shall be 
sent by the next messenger. 

In considering the article of provision to be madefor officers, who shall continue in the army to the end 
of the war, Congress had proceeded so far last night 
as resolving, that one half the present pay be con 
tinued during life, without exceptions of country, to 
all such officers as shall also take the oath of allegi 
ance, and actually reside within the United States. 
This resolution, and the whole plan for the militaryestablishment, is subject to further discussion, respecting the propriety of transmitting it to the several 
States for concurrence. I have the honor to be, with 
the highest respect and esteem, Sir, 

Your most obedient and very humble servant, 

HENRY LAURENS, President. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Yorktown, 27 April, 17 78. 

SIR. 

The newspapers which I received, from your Excel 
lency, in company with the honor of your Excellency s letter of the 18th, afford me sometimes amuse 
ment in intervals from the necessary duties of my 
present station ; and I am particularly indebted to 
your Excellency for the notice which is included in 
the kindness of this favor. 

Your Excellency is too well acquainted with the 
integrity of your own heart, and too well assured of 
the good opinion of your countrymen., to admit any 
anxious impression from the forgeries of an enemy. 
I am disposed to vote for every exertion in ourpower, in order to defeat their designs against us, 
except following such of their examples as will, when 
related in history, greatly abate from that character 
for generosity, which England, and upon good ground, 
once boasted. The late attempt, by publishing forged 
resolves of Congress within a garrisoned town, imme 
diately under the eye of a Commander-in-chief, appears to me to be mean and scandalous, and must be 
considered in the same light by every good English 
man, military, or in public or private life. 

We are now 7 verging towards a most important 
crisis, when all the wisdom of these States will be 
required. Permit me, Sir, to lay before you my pri 
vate sentiments. If the time shall come for appointing a deputation for treating with British Commis 
sioners on terms for establishing peace, 1 hold it necessary that able men be called forth for that purpose from any place within the Union, without con 
fining our election within any one State or body. I 
entreat your Excellency s pardon for this freedom, and 
that you will believe me m to be, with the most sin 
cere esteem and attachment, Sir, 

Your obliged, and most obedient servant, 

HENRY LAURENS. 
FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SULLIVAN. 

Providence, 1 May, 1778. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I should have long since wrote your Excellency, 
was there any thing in this quarter worth engaging 
your attention. I found, upon my journey home, that 
there was not the least probability of the enemy s 
attempting to rescue General Burgoyne and army. I 
therefore went to New Hampshire, where I tarried 
about twelve days. Upon my arrival there, I found 
no troops worth mentioning, and, by the inclosed re 
turn, your Excellency will see we are little better 
now. Connecticut has not sent us a man; Massachu 
setts, but fifty ; New Hampshire, owing to my pushing the matter, have theirs principally on the roads. 

The three last-mentioned regiments will leave me 
to-morrow; their time expires this night. When yourExcellency has viewed this return, you will be surprised at the indolence of the enemy. They are 
three thousand six hundred strong, of British and 
Hessians, besides a small regiment of Greencoats, 
made up of deserters and refugees from us. This 
regiment consists of one hundred and twenty-seven, 
and is commanded by one Whitmore. They have 
drafted none from Rhode Island, this year, except 
fifty-four to join the light infantry of their Grand 
Army. Those sailed with Lord Howe. The enemy 
are busy in fortifying the Island, and are much afraid 
that we are about to attack them. I wish the deception may continue. Captain Whipple, in the Pro 
vidence frigate, passed their shipping, with a strong 
gale of wind, the night of the 30th ultimo, under a 
severe fire, which he warmly returned, and got safe 
to sea, 

10* 
We have nothing new in this quarter, save that 
General Pigot politely requested nie to disperse his 
handbills among the people, which I refused, and delivered them over to the Assembly.* I since hear, 
that while I was viewing the sea-coast below the

FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Yorktown, 3 May, 1778. 

SIR, 

My last trouble to your Excellency was dated the 
30th ultimo, by Rosse. The present will cover an 
act of that date for ascertaining the rank and pay 
annexed to Brevet commissions. Whether this is, or 
is not, intended to have a retrospective effect, I think 
is not clearly expressed by the letter ; and, as I apprehend such operation may, in many instances, give 
umbrage, I shall embrace the first proper opportunity 
of obtaining an explanation of the act, or information 
to my own understanding. 

I despatch this messenger principally to inform 
your Excellency of an event, the knowledge of which 
may nevertheless very probably have reached camp 



that body I have, therefore, commended your desire, and with it havo 
lodged the copies you sent. 

" Had proposals of this kind been properly and sincerely made by 
the Court of Britain to the Supreme Authority of America, before 
the wanton cruelty which has marked the progress of the British 
arms in this country had taken place, or prior to our declaring ourselves independent, and entering into alliances with foreign powers, 
they would have been accepted with sentiments of gratitude. But at 
this time, all proposals, except for a peace upon honorable and equal 
terms, must be ineffectual." 

Copies of the same Bills were sent to Governor Trumbull by Go 
vernor Tryon from New York. The following extracts are from 
Governor Trumbull s answer. 

" Your letter of the 1 7th instant, from New York, is received, with 
its inclosures, and the several similar packets of various addresses 
with which it was accompanied. 

"Propositions of peace are usually made from the supreme author 
ity of one contending power to the similar authority of the other; 
and the present is the first instance, within my recollection, where a 
vague, half-blank, and very indefinite draft of a Bill, once only read 
before one of three bodies of the Legislature of a nation, has ever 
been addressed to the people at large of the opposite power, of an 
before this can arrive there, as our messenger from 
France, Mr. Simeon Deane, had spoken, everywhere 
on his journey to York, of the treaties between the 
Court of Versailles and the United States of Ame 
rica, which were executed on the 6th of February. 
1778. These were read in Congress late last eve 
ning, and will probably be ratified and published in 
the course of the present week, except a secret arti 
cle, which it is also probable is very well known 
abroad. Be this as it may, I view the treaties of 
alliance and commerce, although not free from excep 
tion, as circumstances of advantage to these United 
States, and which afford a bottom for vast improve 
ments. I beg leave, therefore, to congratulate with 
your Excellency, and with every friend to the great 
American cause. I shall move Congress, to-morrow, 
to order duplicates of the treaties to be immediately 
transmitted to your Excellency ; in the mean time 
this of a letter from Doctor Franklin and Mr.

great outlines. I have the honor to be, with the

from our then acknowledged parent State might have been accepted 
with joy and gratitude. But that day, Sir, is passed irrevocably. 

" If peace be really the object, let your proposals be addressed 
properly to the proper power, and your negotiations honorably con 
ducted. We shall then have some prospect of (what is the most 
ardent w T ish of every American) a lasting arid honorable peace. The 
British nation may then, perhaps, find us as affectionate and valua

most sanguine can expect from conquest." Lebanon, April 23d. 
FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Yorktown, 5 May, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

In a public letter, which I had the honor of writing to your Excellency the 3d instant, by Major 
Price, I sent a number of handbills calculated for 
giving satisfactory information to the public, who were 
anxious to learn the recent intelligence from France. 
One article of this has been questioned, respecting 
the King of Prussia s promise, the only part of the 
performance that can be called mine. I believe my 
authority is good. Izard, under the 16th February, 
informs me, " the King of Prussia has given the most 
explicit and unequivocal assurance, that he will be 
the second power in Europe to acknowledge the in 
dependence of America." It is true our Commission 
ers, in their public advices, are not so express, nor 
are they, in my opinion, so full and clear in some 
other respects, as they might have been. 

Human nature pervades every human breast. A 
residence at Paris will not exempt men from infirm 
ities of the mind ; nor is even the momentous concern 
of guardianship to thirteen United States, an infant 
world in danger of being crushed by the hand of 
violence, paramount to those curses upon mankind, 
pride and covetousness, sources from whence all the 
evils of this life spring. Our Ambassadorial Commis 
sioners, of which your Excellency cannot be ignorant, 
are unhappily divided in sentiments. Jarrings and 
appeals have followed. Intelligence, intended for the 
public, loses part of that fulness and perspicuity, 
which would have appeared in candid and united 
counsels. I have seen so much of the world as to be 
guarded against surprise at any thing. No inconsiderable benefit results from attempts to reconcile, and 
even sweeten, the most untoward circumstances which 
happen in one s journey through it. I apprehend it 
would break in on your Excellency s time,, otherwise 
I would have troubled you with Mr. Izard s letter, not 
merely for information, but for a hope that something 
might be devised for promoting concord between ourfriends yonder, or the public good, by a wise couperation. But I will not dwell upon this subject. 

Last night I had the honor of receiving your Ex 
cellency s favor of the last of April, and am happy 
in finding a confirmation of my sentiments respecting 
persons proper for treating with the expected depu 
tation from our adversary. I fear the determination, 
where only this point can be determined, will be con 
trary. Be it so ; thank God we have here some men 
of abilities and integrity. I hope we shall make a 
judicious choice. The act of Congress of the 22d 
April will blot out pages of the British instructions. 
The Commissioners from that side will perceive a 
necessity for taking a new departure from the Tower 
of Independence ; and what happened in France, on 
the 6th of February, will oblige them to shape a new 
course. From the absence of the Commissioners, I 
presume they had not sailed from England on the 
10th of March. It may have been found expedient, at 
St. James s, to vest them with more ample powers, it 
they meant to come, than were originally intended, 
and under new sanctions of Parliament ; a work of 
slow progress. The people would have much to say. 
That the nation were more than a little agitated, appears from a letter, which I take the liberty of in 
closing for your Excellency s perusal. I have like 
wise a letter from the mercantile line in London, 
which proves to me the people in general had very 



THE AMEBICAN REVOLUTION. 119 

sensibly felt the weight of the war, were ardently desirous of peace, and anxious lest Congress should re 
ject the intended propositions. 

The long, arid, as I humbly think, unnecessary delay of the army arrangement, is very afflicting. I 
know it must give extreme pain to your Excellency. 
It is improper for me to touch upon the cause, espe 
cially when it is so well known that Congress have 
been engaged in very important business. The plan 
introduced for that part of it which is intended toestablish a half-pay for officers during life, I have 
been uniformly averse from, and in a committee of 
Congress delivered my objections. These appear to 
me, at this moment, of more weight, because they have 
not been removed by the reasonings which have been 
offered against them, and I may, without vanity, think 
myself not obstinate. I am open to conviction, and 
always, without murmuring, submit to a majority. I 
view the scheme as altogether unjust and unconstitutional in its nature, and full of dangerous conse 
quences. It is an unhappy dilemma to which we 
seem to be reduced. Provide for your officers in 
terms dictated to you, or lose all the valuable soldiers 
among them ; establish a pension for officers, make 
them a separate body, to be provided for by the 
honest yeomanry, and others of their fellow-citizens, 
many thousands of whom have equal claims upon 
every ground of loss of estate, health, &c,, or lose 
your army and your cause. That such provision will 
be against the grain of the people, has been unwarily 
testified by its advocates, whom I have heard con 
verse upon the subject. Indeed, they have furnished 
strong ground for opposition against an immediate 
compliance with the demand. If we cannot make 
justice one of the pillars, necessity may be submitted to at present; but republicans will, at a pro 
per time, withdraw a grant which will appear to have 
been extorted. 

Were I in private conversation with an officer on 
this point, I should not despair of fairly balancing 
every grievance he might suppose to be peculiar to 
the army, by instances of losses and inconveniences 
in my own property and person ; and I count myself 
very happy, compared with thousands who have as 
faithfully adhered to our original compact. It is said, 
gentlemen did not think the war would have con 
tinued so long. Forgive me, Sir, a ludicrous remark 
which I made early in our contest, indeed in Eng 
land, before the commencement of the contest. " I 
know my countrymen are good for the quarter, but I 
have doubts of their going the course." There is a 
certain versatility, habitual if not almost constitu 
tional, in men born south of thirty-eight degrees of 
latitude, in these States. Circumstances, which have 
occurred in the progress of this war, have given 
strength to my observation. 

There are, within that division of America, not only 
objects inviting, but temptations almost irresistible, to 
change, to say nothing of the general train of educa 
tion. Hence, it is easy to account for a resignation of 
a commission, which had been anxiously solicited by 
scores. The want of something is made an excuse, 
and even sometimes by worthy characters, who do 
not suspect themselves. Would to God, gentlemen 
had followed the noble, patriotic example of their 
Commander-in-chief, a plan which, reflection will show 
them in a shade of disgrace, would never have found 
place in their minds. How superior are many of the 
gentlemen, now in my contemplation (for I know 
many with whom I do not converse), to the acceptance of a half-pay, contributed to by widows and or 
phans of soldiers who had bled and died by their 
sides ! shackled with a condition of being excluded 
from the privilege of serving in offices, in common 
with their fellow-citizens voted in every House of 
Assembly as the drones and incumbrances of society, 
pointed at by boys and girls, there goes a man, who 
every year robs me of part of my pittance. I think, 
Sir, I do not overstrain. This will be the language 
of republicans ; how pungent, when applied to gen 
tlemen who shall have stepped from the army into a 
good remaining estate ; how much deeper to some, 
who, in idleness and by speculation, have amassedestates in the war ! 

This, Sir, is a large field. Virtue and honor might 
be summoned to answer, but it is time for me to for 
bear. I am obliged to write in haste, called upon by 
particular public duties. Besides, I feel a full assurance, notwithstanding the present seeming contra 
riety, that my sentiments, when fully explained, will 
not differ essentially from your Excellency s. I must 
not, however, conclude without these declarations, that 
I am not among those to whom may be applied, 
" Our God and soldier we adore, in time of danger, 
&c." I am most heartily disposed to distinguish the 
gallant officers and soldiers, by the most liberal marks 
of esteem, desirous of making proper provision for all 
who shall stand in need. I would not except even 
some of the brave, whose expenses have been prince 
ly in extravagance, while they complained of insuffi 
ciency of pay. 

I have ever detested, and never practised, Parlia 
mentary jockeyings for procrastinating an unpalatable 
business, which, as a silent auditor and spectator, I 
have, within some time past, known to be alternately 

VOL. II. 11 
adopted. I most sincerely wish the army had been 
wisely attended to. The high esteem I from grati 
tude bear for your Excellency, whose sufferings from 
a contrary conduct I know must have been great, 
as well as my love of despatch, makes me wish it ; 
and I lament that, in some degree, we are likely to 
be indebted more to the policy and deep projects of 
other men for our deliverance, than to our own wis 
dom and fortitude. I am, with the most sincere re 
spect, and the most respectful affection and esteem, 
dear Sir, 

Your most obliged servant. 

HENRY LAURENS. 



FROM ELIAS BOUDINOT, COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS. 

Baskingridge, 13 May, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

On my arrival at Morristown, I found LieutenantColonel Campbell, who proposed my going with himto New York, as he thought he could aid me great 
ly in furthering t some immediate relief to our suffering prisoners. By Colbnel Allen I received General 
Clinton s permission to attend Colonel Campbell, and 
then proceeded to New York. I found Major-General 
Daniel Jones in the command, and General ValentineJones Commandant of the city. Both these gentle 
men appear determined to give every relief to prison 
ers that is in their power. They treated me with 
uncommon civility, and granted me every thing I 
asked. 

The exchange, I took with me, was completely carried into execution, with the addition of twenty-five 
officers and about twenty privates, being for the servants of General Burgoyne, Colonel Campbell, and 
others. General Jones has given me the strongest 
assurances that our officers and privates will not have 
reason again to complain of unnecessary severity ; in 
deed, their whole system appears to be changed, or 
at least in confusion. I cannot but mention the service I received from Colonel Campbell, who seems 
determined to interest himself in mitigating the rigors 
of captivity, which he appears well acquainted with. 

Many of our officers, who are now exchanged, are 
at a loss to know what to do, there being no provi 
sion made for them ; and having left both property 
and friends, they are anxious for any employment in 
which they may hope for some satisfaction for the 
multitude and severity of their sufferings. 

As I am much engaged to get my accounts in pro 
per order, I shall remain here till that is done, unless I receive other orders from your Excellency, 
which I beg to be favored with, if you think my 
immediate presence necessary at camp. If a succes 
sor to my department has been nominated, I should 
be much obliged by the information. I have the 
honor to be, with the greatest regard and esteem, 
your Excellency s 

Most obedient, and most humble servant, 

ELIAS BOUDINOT. 



FROM RICHARD HENRY LEE, IN CONGRESS. 

York, 16 May, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

The unfortunate cause, which hath prevented me 
from attending to your last favor sooner, will, I hope, 
be my excuse. The long sickness and death of my 
much-loved brother of Bellevue, has for some time 
past confined me in Virginia, and removed every other 
consideration from my mind. I now embrace the first 
good opportunity of sending you the pamphlet of 
forgeries, that I formerly mentioned. It is among the 
pitiful arts of our enemies, to endeavour at sowing 
dissension among the friends of liberty and their country. With me, such tricks can never prevail. 

Give me leave, dear Sir, to congratulate you on 
the happy event of our treaty with France being so 
effectually concluded. Congress have ratified it on 
their part, and ordered the ratification to be delivered 
in due form. This will be announced to the public 
immediately. The counsels of France have been go 
verned, in this affair, by true magnanimity and sound 
policy. It was magnanimous in his Most Christian 
Majesty, not to avail himself of our situation to demand unequal and oppressive terms; and it was wise 
to leave the commerce of America open to all the 
maritime states, which will prevent their jealous} 
and enmity, and make them foes instead of friends to 
England. Great Britain has its choice now of mad 
ness or meanness. She will not war with the house 
of Bourbon and North America at the same time ; so 
that I incline to think meanness will be her choice, 
as best befitting her present state and the minds of 
her rulers. It will probably happen, that the tradeof France will not now be interrupted ; and thus, by 
affording no pretext for war, the whole force of ourenemies may be devoted to one last and vigorous 
campaign against us. As wise men, we ought to be 
prepared for such an event, by collecting a strong 
army, and by every other means that can discourage 
and defeat such intentions of our inveterate enemies. 
Being disappointed this campaign, must infallibly compel the acknowledgment of our independence, and 
keep the world, for some time longer, in peace. Eng 
land alone will pay, for her wickedness and folly, by 
the loss of North America. 

Our information is good, that very few troops can 
come here from Germany ; and private letters, as well 
as public papers, say that the plan of getting regi 
ments by subscription, though much boasted of at 
first, has fallen very low. From the Highlands of 
North Britain some men will be obtained, and per 
haps a few from England and Ireland, but there 
seems no reason to suppose that their every exer 
tion can add more than four or five thousand to the 
present force in North America. But this will re 
quire a very considerable strength, on our part, to 
make the event certain. An unsettled dispute be 
tween the Emperor and the King of Prussia (w r hich 
England will undoubtedly foment) concerning the di 
vision of the estate of the late Elector of Bavaria, 
has threatened a rupture in Europe, not for our ad 
vantage, because the former of these princes being 
with us, the latter might be disposed to favor the 
views of Great Britain, to our injury. 

Alderman Lee writes, that there is some hope of 
this being negotiated happily. An intelligent corre 
spondent in England writes to Alderman Lee, that it 
was uncertain whether Lord North s Bills would be 
agreed to or not, but that they were industriously 
sent over here, and circulated, to prevent our treaty 
with France from being concluded. Vain and unwise 
men ! Their means are always destructive of their 
ends. North s delusive and indecent propositions 
have accelerated an adoption of the agreement with 
France. 

I am much concerned to find, in Virginia, such 
11* 
want of method and industry in collecting and bringing forward the drafts. When I came away, there 
were all the men (amounting to forty-one or two), 
both of the former and the latter drafts, remaining 
in King George, merely for want of an officer to 
bring them away ; and I am misinformed if it is not 
the case in other counties. As far as I have been 
able to learn, it is probable that, if dexterous recruiting officers were properly furnished for the business, 
and sent out, almost all these veterans, that have 
been discharged from our nine regiments, would ree nlist in a short time. I am, with sincere esteem, dearSir, 

Your most affectionate and obedient servant, 

RICHARD HENRY LEE. 

P. S. Alderman Lee says, they talk of sending 
Lord Westcote and Hans Stanley here, to treat with 
us, and that they are to bring half a million of gui 
neas to bribe the Congress. From their own corrup 
tions, these men reason to the corruption of all others. 

I had almost forgot to mention, that four expresses 
were sent from St. James s, on the subject ^of Generals Howe and Clinton. The latter had leave to go 
home ; the Court was disgusted with the , former, and 
had recalled him, but recollecting that Clin/ton might 
be come away, another messenger was sent to stop 
HOW T O, if that should be the case. I hope-d,hey are 
both gone.* 



* These rumors appear to have had little foundation. 
FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Valley Forge, 19 May, 1778. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

Agreeably to your Excellency s orders I have taken 
the oath of the gentlemen officers in General Woodford s brigade, and their certificates have been sent 
to the Adjutant-General s office. Give me leave, now, 
to present you with some observations delivered to 
me by many officers in that brigade, who desire me 
to submit them to your perusal. I know, Sir, (be 
sides I am not of their opinion in the fact itself), 
that I should not accept for you the objections those 
gentlemen could have had, as a body, to any order 
from Congress; but I confess the desire of being 
agreeable to them, of giving them any mark of 
friendship and affection, which is in my power, and 
acknowledging the kind sentiments they honor me 
with, have been my first and dearest considerations. 

Besides that, be pleased to consider that they be 
gan by obeying orders, and want only to let their 
beloved General know which were the reasons of their 
being rather reluctant (as far as reluctance may comply with their duty and honor) to an oath, the 
meaning and spirit of which was, I believe, misunderstood by them. I may add, Sir, with a perfect 
conviction, that there is not one among them but 
would be* thrice happy, were occasions offered to them 
of distinguishing yet, ly new exertions, their love for 
their country, their zeal for their duty as officers, 
their consideration for the civil superior power, and 
their love for your Excellency. 

AVith the greatest respect and most tender affec 
tion, I have the honor to be, &c., 

LAFAYETTE. 
FROM EDMUND RANDOLPH. 

Williamsburg, 21 May, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

It rnay ? perhaps, be some entertainment to you, to 
be informed of the proceedings of the present Assem 
bly. 

After choosing Colonel Harrison Speaker, by a 
great majority, they seemed to be determined against 
every act of legislation which did not, in some measure, tend to the security of independence. The 
sense of the House was taken, as to their inclination 
to proceed upon the report of the revisers of the 
laws; but it was decided that the general business 
of the Commonwealth should be postponed until the 
military arrangements were absolutely settled. But I 
wish the prospect of success was equal to the ardor 
of the law-makers. They have, indeed, a bill, now 
committed to the whole House, for raising two thou 
sand volunteers, to reenforce your Excellency. They 
have annexed numberless seducing advantages, in or 
der to obtain recruits. , But the demon of avarice, 
and spirit of extortion, seem to have expelled pure 
patriotism from the breasts of those who usually compose armies. A regiment of horse is voted, also, to 
consist of three hundred and fifty. This, I conceive, 
will be soon completed, as many men of family and 
fortune propose to enter as privates. 

An act has passed the House of Delegates, agreeably to the recommendation from your Excellency 
and Congress, for the oblivion of past treasons. The 
persons in this country, who will be the objects of 
this law, are few in number, and I am afraid the 
time allowed for their coming in is too short for our act to have any effect in the army. A battalion of 
infantry is to be raised, for garrison duty, at the 
ports and harbours of this State. General Nelson 
leaves Williamsburg to-day, on his way to camp ; but 
it cannot be ascertained, before his arrival at Fredericksburg, what number of troops he will carry with 
him. I am, dear Sir, your Excellency s 

Much obliged, affectionate, humble servant, 

EDMUND RANDOLPH. 



FROM GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

In Congress, 27 May, 1778. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I have a word to say to you upon the subject of 
promotion, which we have just now finished, or rather 
unfinished, at least if that matter was before in an 
unfinished situation. That famous incomprehensible 
Baltimore Resolution (unluckily perhaps) introduced 
a very tedious debate, which terminated, at length, 
by rejecting the whole of what the Committee re 
ported with relation to the promoting of officers. 

You may be a little surprised when I tell you, 
that upon the whole matter I believe this is best. 
But how? It is true, I confess, that much ground of 
heart-burning is left under the Baltimore Resolution 
governing these matters, by the mysterious trinity of 
seniority, merit, and quota. Let me, however, on the 
other hand, observe, that to tie up the hands of the 
Republic, as to the officers whom they are to appoint, 
is utterly inconsistent with the republican principles 
of Government, which ought to prevail among us. 
No danger, it is true, can arise at present; but, my 
dear Sir, we are laying foundations ; and how posterity, in future wars, may build on the foundations 
laid by ancestors, whom they will certainly reverence, 
no man can be hardy enough to assert. 

What, then, you will say, is the effect of the new 
rule ? In my poor opinion, it is no rule. What, 
then, is the use of the Resolution ? Nothing more 
than an apology for officers whom it may be found 
necessary to supersede. Congress, in effect, seem to 
have pledged themselves to their constituents, that 
they will pay a due attention to the quota of troops 
furnished by the States respectively, to the seniority 
of the several officers, and to that degree of military 
ability which nature or industry may have conferred 
upon deserving individuals. You ask me, what is to 
be the rule below the degree of a General Officer? I 
answer, that Congress could not, with propriety, make 
any rule. They have given to the States the power 
of appointing the officers in their own regiments. Of 
consequence, therefore, it would be idle to restrict 
them as to the persons whom they shall appoint. It 
will, therefore, be necessary to make application to 
the several States on the occasion. They have al 
ready, I believe, in most instances, given you the 
necessary power; and if so, then to fix the order of 
promotion will be only a limitation of such power. 
What are my ideas on the occasion, you will see 
by the letter I inclose, directed to Governor Clinton, 
which you will do me the honor to transmit to him. 
I am, dear General, 

Most sincerely, yours, 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.

Yorktown, 9 October, 1777. 

SIR, 

It is with the highest pleasure I comply with the 
order of Congress, in conveying to you the inclosed 
resolve, expressing the thanks of that body to you 
for the wise and well-concerted attack upon the enemy, near Germantown, on the 4th instant, and also 
to the officers and soldiers for their brave exertions 
on that occasion; and I must request you will communicate to them the distinguished mark of the approbation of their country. 

It is indeed true, that the best designs and boldest efforts may sometimes fail of success, through 
unforeseen incidents, yet is it a source of satisfaction 
to reflect, in such instances, that every thing has 
been done to insure success, that human wisdom 
could devise. Something must still be left to fortune. 
It is not in mortals to command success. But permit 
me to say, Sir, you have done more on this occasion ; 
you have deserved it. 

Wishing, with the utmost sincerity, that your great 
and virtuous exertions in the cause of freedom and 
your country may be crowned with victory, I have 
the honor to be, with perfect esteem and respect. Sir, 
Your most obedient, and very humble servant,

FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS, 

Yorktown, 9 October, 1777. 

SIR, 

The absolute necessity of cutting oif all supplies 
and intelligence from the enemy, in and near the 
city of Philadelphia, and thereby preventing any 
intercourse between them and the disaffected in the 
State of Pennsylvania and elsewhere, has induced 
the Congress to adopt the inclosed resolves, in hopes, 
if possible, to put an effectual stop to a practice so 
extremely dangerous to the cause of America. They 
have, for this end, authorized you to sentence, by 
court-martial, any person convicted of either of the 
above-mentioned offences, or of acting as a guideor pilot, to suffer death, or such other punishment 
as may be thought adequate, provided he is taken 
within thirty miles of any town in Pennsylvania, Jersey, or Delaware, that is in possession of the enemy. 
They have also recommended to the good people of 
this and the other States to be vigilant in apprehending and securing all such persons as may be 
caught in the violation of the inclosed resolves, to 
which I beg leave to refer your attention. 

Your favor of the 5th instant was duly received, 
and immediately laid before Congress. I have the 
honor to be, with the greatest respect, Sir, 

Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
JOHN HANCOCK, President.

FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Yorktown, 12 October, 1777. 

SIR, 

I have nothing in charge from Congress, at this 
time, but to transmit the inclosed resolves, and to re 
quest your attention to them. 

The information that the enemy have, ai different 
times, compelled our troops, who are prisoners with 
them, to labor, and that a number are at this time 
actually engaged in throwing up some works at and 
near Kensington, is of such a nature that Congress 
think it incumbent on them to inquire into the truth 
of it. They have, therefore, directed that a flag be 
immediately despatched to General Howe, to know 
whether there is any foundation for the report; and 
I am to request you will send a flag for this purpose 
as soon as you conveniently can. M. Le Balme having desired leave of Congress to resign his commission as Inspector of the cavalry, they have accordingly complied with his request. I have the honor 
to be, with the utmost respect, Sir, 

Your most obedient and very humble servant, 

JOHN HANCOCK, President. 



FROM COLONEL CHRISTOPHER GREENE. 

Fort at Red Bank, 14 October, 1777. 
MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 

I arrived here on Saturday last with my regiment. 
They were much fatigued with the march, as I forced 
thirty-five miles one day. They are now in high 
spirits, and go to their duty with the greatest cheerfulness. The inclosed return shows our strength. I 
have found it necessary to contract the fort, but it is 
IIOAV too large for our numbers, as we have very lit 
tle to expect from the militia. 

I saw General Newcomb last evening. He informs 
me that the small number now on duty expect to 
return home in a day or two ; those that relieve them 
expect to be relieved in three days. The General 
thinks your Excellency s intentions were, for the 
militia only to help complete the fort ; after that, to 
fall on the rear of the enemy, in case of an attack. 
Should we be attacked, they must be so scattered as 
to be able to give us little or no assistance. 

The strength of the navy, and of Fort Mifflin, yourExcellency will have by the express who bears this, 
from the officers commanding them. They are certainly very w r eak for so important a post. I have 
already, and shall still give them all the assistance 
in my power. Could your Excellency give us the 
assistance of Colonel Angell s regiment, I doubt not 
this post would be secure, without dependence on 
militia. If they are to be relieved in the manner I 
understand they are, it is my opinion they will do 
us no service. General Newcomb gives very little 
encouragement of any to supply the place of those 
that are going off the ground. Could we be reenforced, we probably might frustrate the enemy s designs in three batteries they are erecting against 
Fort Mifflin, and so near as to do much injury when 
opened. 

I find it necessary, for the security of the post, to 
keep my men all on fatigue daily. This I doubt will 
cause them to be less spirited in action, if I should 
be under the necessity to continue it, which must be 
the case, unless I am reenforced. The post I have in 
charge I am determined to defend, with the small 
number I command, to the last extremity ; yet I 
doubt my number is much too small to answer yourExcellency s expectations. I am, with the greatest 
respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

CHRISTOPHER GREENE. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL PUTNAM. 

Fishkill, 1C October, 1777. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I have been honored with the receipt of your two 
favors of the 8th, and imagine before this you have 
received mine of the same date, containing the disagreeable intelligence of the loss of Fort Montgomery, 
after a most spirited defence, and of our evacuating 
Peekskill in consequence thereof. I congratulate you 
on the bravery of your troops in attacking and put 
ting to flight the British army, and regret the unfavorable circumstance that prevented its terminating 
in a complete victory. 

Last Monday, General Parsons, with about two 
thousand troops, marched down and took possession 
of. Peekskill and the passes in the Highlands. He 
has taken a number of cattle, horses, and sheep, that 
were collected by the enemy. The enemy have burnt 
the buildings and barracks at the Village,* and several 
dwelling-houses at Peekskill. They have demolished 
Forts Montgomery and Constitution, and are repairing Fort Clinton. Yesterday, about forty sail passed 
up the river, crowded with troops, and are now at 
anchor above Poughkeepsie, the wind not favoring. 
We were on our march after them, when I met the 
agreeable intelligence of the surrender of General 
Burgoyne and his army, as prisoners of war, a copy 
of which is inclosed ; and thereupon I do most sin 
cerely congratulate your Excellency. 

I have halted my troops, and am now considering 
what ought to be my next movement, I have sent 
to General Clinton for his opinion on the subject, 
and ordered General Parsons to spare no pains to 
find the situation and strength of the garrison at 
King s Bridge, in order to direct my future opera 
tions most advantageously. I have about six thou 
sand troops, who are chiefly militia. I understand 
that General Campbell was killed at Fort Montgomery/ and several field-officers, and others of inferior 
rank. 

The enemy s loss, by the last accounts I have been 
able to get, is very considerable ; not less than a 
thousand. The two Continental frigates, and the rowgalley which lay above Fort Montgomery, were burnt, 
to prevent their falling into the hands of the enemy, 
for which I am very sorry, as one, I believe, might 
have been saved. 

I have the unhappiness to inform you, that Mrs. 
Putnam, after a long and tedious illness, departed 
this life last Tuesday night. With the highest esteem 
and respect, I am, dear Sir, 

Your most obedient, humble servant, 

ISRAEL PUTNAM. 




FROM LIEUTENANT-COLONEL SAMUEL SMITH. 

Fort Mifflin, 16 October, 1777; 

5 o clock, P. M. 

The enemy have opened three batteries on us. One, 
in front of the pest-houses, which, with Precache s, 
rakes the whole garrison, from whence they throw 
red-hot balls, as yet without success. Another, in rearof our north-west block-house, in which they have 
some royals, an eight-inch howitzer, one piece of artillery, twelve-pounder. I believe, the other, in rearof the mud-battery, in which, as yet, they have but 
one eight-inch howitzer ; but it is lengthened so as 
to mount a pair of cannon. The large battery, on the 
height to the left of Guyer s house, is not yet opened ; 
they have staked out a large piece of work to the 
left of that, and thrown up some dirt. 

What their intentions are by that, I cannot tell; 
but I am of opinion they will not attempt any thing 
effectual until their shipping opens the chevaiix-de-frise, 
and then make the attack all together. My reason 
is, that they relieve the party here from time to 
time, which I am convinced is not more on Province 
Island than five hundred, and which agrees with the 
number said to have been sent from Germantown. 
Certain I am, we have a new set of men. Their men 
are so detached from each other that I think it would 
not be a difficult matter to raise our siege by the Blue 
Bell. One party, the largest, extends from Guyer s 
house, a quarter of a mile to our left, in barns; the 
other, opposite to our rear; and the other, about the 
pest-houses. We might make a diversion from this 
garrison. Could we once oblige them to raise the 
siege, I am persuaded they have met with so many 
difficulties, they would not again attempt it. 
The shipping are very busy endeavouring to raise 
the chevaux-dc-frise. What success they have had, we 
know not. However, if undisturbed (which is the 
case), it must at length be effected. Want of ammunition obliges us to leave them undisturbed ; else, per 
haps, we might dismount their pieces. When Colonel 
Angell comes, we shall be able to assist each other 
effectually. Colonel Greene s reenforcement of onehundred and fifty are on their way over now. I presume it will be sufficient, if the galleys give us the 
assistance in their power. I have the honor to be, 
Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

SAMUEL SMITH. 

P. S. I should be extremely obliged, if my letters 
from Maryland were forwarded. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Yorktown, 17 October, 1777.* 

SIR, 

It is now above twd years since I have had the 
honor of presiding in Congress ; and I should esteem 
myself happy to have it in my power to render further service to my country in that department ; but 
the decline of health, occasioned by so long and unremitting an application to the duties of my office, 
both in Congress and out of Congress, joined to the 
situation of my own private affairs, has, at length, 
taught me to think of retiring for two or threemonths ; and I have determined to take my leave 
the ensuing week, and set out immediately for Boston after this express returns. 

As the Congress will doubtless proceed to appoint 
a successor in my stead, on him, therefore, will devolve the business of the chair. It will fall within 
the line of his duty to keep up that connection and 
correspondence with you, which has heretofore been 
mine; and I sincerely hope he may do it, as well as 
discharge every other duty incident to the office, 
with more advantage than I have done. Upon the 
review, however, of the intercourse that has subsisted 
between us, I cannot avoid saying, that I feel a 
great degree of pleasure in having, to the utmost of 
my power, endeavoured to execute the business committed to my care, and in a particular manner with 
regard to the army under your command. I flatter 
myself my conduct, in this instance, will meet with 
your approbation. The politeness and attention I have 
ever experienced from you, in the course of our correspondence, will always be a source of the most pleasing satisfaction to me. 

As it is probable I shall meet with some difficulty 
in crossing the North River, and shall run a con 
siderable risk in passing through some Tory towns 
on the east side, I must ask the favor of you to 
give me authority to order a few light-horse from 
thence, to escort me through that part of the country. I apprehend I may safely go from hence to the 
North River, though I should be happy in having 
your opinion, and as to the best route. 

On my arrival in Boston, I shall think myself happy to be favored with any commands from you; and 
should any thing of a public nature occur, I will do 
myself the honor of letting you hear from me. 

With the most sincere wishes that you may soon 
triumph over the enemies of America, and meet with 
every public and private prosperity, and with the ut 
most respect, I am, Sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

JOHN HANCOCK.* 



FROM RICHARD HENRY LEE. 

York, 20 October, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

Your favor of the 17th I received yesterday, and 
was a good deal surprised to find you had been told 
that Congress had appointed General Conway a MajorGeneral. No such appointment has been made ; nor 
do I believe it will, while it is likely to produce the 
evil consequences you suggest. It is very true, that 
both within and without doors, there have been advocates for the measure ; and it has been affirmed that 
it would be very agreeable to the army, whose favor 
ite Mr. Conway was asserted to be. My judgment 
on this business was not formed until I received yourletter. I am very sure Congress would not take any 
step that might injure the army, or even have a ten 
dency that way; and I verily believe they wish to 
lessen your difficulties by every means in their power, 
from an entire conviction that the purest motives of 
public good direct your actions. 

The business of a Board of War is so extensive, 
so important, and demanding such constant attention, 
that Congress see clearly the necessity of constituting 
a new Board, out of Congress, whose time shall be 



* President Hancock took leave of Congress on the 29th of October. 
His address on the occasion may be found in the Journals, October 3lst. 
Henry Laurens, of South Carolina, was chosen his successor on the 1st 
of November. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. H 

entirely devoted to that essential department. It 
is by some warmly proposed that this Board shall 
be filled by the three following gentlemen; Colonel 
Reed, Colonel Pickering, the present Adjutant-General, and Colonel Harrison, your Secretary 5 and that 
General Conway be appointed Adjutant-General, in the 
room of Colonel Pickering. It is my wish, and I am 
sure it is so of many others, to know your full and 
candid sentiments on this subject. For my own part, 
I cannot be satisfied with giving any opinion on the 
point until I am favored with your sentiments, which 
I shall be much obliged to you for, Sir, as soon as 
your time will permit. It has been affirmed that 
General Conway would quit the service if he were 
not made a Major-General. But I have been told, in 
confidence, that he would leave it at the end of this 
campaign, if he was appointed, unless his word of 
honor were taken to continue for any fixed time. 
And it is a question with me, whether the advocates 
for General Conway will not miss their aim, if he 
should be appointed Adjutant-General, unless he has 
the rank of Major-General also. My reason for thinking so is, that I have been informed General Conway 
desires to retire to his family, provided he can carry 
from this country home with him a rank that will 
raise him in France.* 

It is very certain that the public good demands a 
speedy erecting and judicious filling of the new Board 
of War ; and I sincerely wish it may be done in the 
most proper manner. I do not imagine Congress 
would appoint Colonel Harrison without first knowing whether you could spare him; nor do I think 
that so important an office as that of Adjutant-General should be touched without maturest consideration. 

We every moment expect the express, with an ac 
count that will enable us to congratulate you on the 
surrender of General Burgoyne, and the remains of 
his shattered army. This will be one of the Prussian 
sixes, and I augur that the other will soon cast up 
upon the Delaware. 

I am, with sincerest wishes for your health and 
success, dear Sir, 

Your most affectionate and obedient servant, 

RICHARD HENRY LEE. 



FROM COMMODORE HAZELWOOD.^ 

Red Bank, 23 October, 1777. 
MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 

This will acquaint your Excellency that, early this 
morning, w r e carried all our galleys to action, and, 
after a long and heavy firing, we drove the enemy s 
ships down the river, except a sixty-four gun ship, 
and a small frigate, which we obliged them to quit, 
as they got on shoi*e ; and, by accident, the sixtyfour gun ship blew up, and the frigate they set on 
fire themselves, took the people all out, and quitted 
them. Our action lasted till twelve o clock, and ourfleet has received but very little damage. 

You will be informed of the glorious event of last 
night, by Colonel Greene. !" We, in our galleys, were

fort, may be seen in Washington s Writings, Vol. V. p. 112. 
of great use in flanking round the fort. As I am 
very much fatigued, I hope your Excellency will be 
satisfied with this short account of our affairs of the 
river and fleet. I have not, as yet, got a man to 
reenforce our fleet, for I thought it a pity to take 
them from the fort, as they wanted them more than 
the fleet ; and, God knows, we are very weakly 
manned. Being in haste, I hope soon I shall have it 
in my power to give you a better account of this 
action. Besides the sixty-four and frigate being burnt, 
the Roebuck, which lay to cover them, we damaged 
much, and drove off, and, had she laid fast, we should 
have had her in the same situation. We want ammunition, cartridges for muskets, for eighteen and twentyfour pounders. Having nothing to add, I am yourExcellency s 

Most obedient, and very humble servant, 

JOHN HAZELWOOD. 



FROM COLONEL WILKINSON. 

Easton, 24 October, 1777. 

Sm, 

I have this moment arrived here, on my way to 
Congress, with despatches from Major-General Gates ; 
and, being uncertain whether your Excellency is apprised of the fact, I think it my duty to congratulate you on Lieutenant-General Burgoyne s surrender 
to the American arms. This fortunate event took 
place on the 17th instant, and put us in possession 
of six General Officers, five thousand combatants, five 
thousand stands of arms, and twenty-seven pieces of 
well-sorted brass ordnance, with fixed ammunition, 
complete. 

VOL. n. 2 
I have the further pleasure to assure your Excel 
lency, that we have made, during the campaign, up 
wards of two thousand discretional prisoners, among 
whom are several field-officers, and a large proportion 
of subordinate ones. The most material article in the 
convention between Major-General Gates and Lieutenant-General Burgoyne, is, that the latter, with his 
army, is allowed to return to Great Britain, on parole 
not to bear arms against America during the present 
contest. 

The incendiary crew from New York continue to 
ravage the banks of the North River. The dwellings of Judge Livingston and Mrs. Montgomery have, 
among many others, shared the fate of [Kingston.]* 

I have the honor to be your Excellency s 

Obliged, obedient, and ready servant, 

JAMES WILKINSON. 



FROM THOMAS WHARTON. 

In Council, Lancaster, 24 October, 1777. 

SIR, 

I had the honor of receiving your favor of the 
17th instant, which was immediately laid before the 
Council. 

In consequence of this application we have ordered 
out two classes of militia, offering an exemption from 
their fines to such delinquents of the former classes 
as can be prevailed upon to join them, and have in 
vited all, of every class, to turn out as volunteers. 
The Lieutenants have orders, if they do not find 
these two classes turn out generally, to order to 
camp the next two succeeding classes. To encourage 
the people to exert themselves with alacrity, we 
have published an address, offering every motive we 
could suggest, to stimulate our constituents to their 
duty. What numbers may be drawn forth into service, in consequence of these measures, we cannot 
possibly ascertain with precision; but believe they 
will be more than we can possibly arm. If you 
should think proper to encourage our calling forth 
unarmed men, under the prospect of their finding 
arms at camp, we will endeavour to do more; but, 
from the view your letter presents of the want of that 
necessary article with you, we think it unnecessary 
to take further measures, at present, to draw forth a 
multitude of people who cannot afford any service. 

The other important subject, mentioned in yourletter, of taking measures for completing our Continental battalions, I shall communicate to the Legislature as soon as they meet. 

I have the honor to be, &c., 

THOMAS WHARTON, JR. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL PUTNAM. 

Fishkill, 25 October, 1777. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I have been honored with the receipt of your two 
favors of the 15th and 19th instant; and have the 
pleasure to acquaint you that, after a tedious march, 
we are returned to this place ; the fleet passed down 
by here yesterday, and did but little damage on their 
return. 

Some heavy artillery, and a reinforcement of Continental troops, I am informed by General Grates, are 
on their way to join me. By a deserter, and two of 
our people who escaped from the enemy at Yerplanck s Point, day before yesterday, I am informed 
that four regiments are gone from New York to ree nforce General Howe, which caused General Yaughan s 
hasty return down the river, probably to increase the 
reenforcement, as fifteen hundred of the York militia 
are ordered to be drafted, to supply their place at 
New York. I trust and hope the succour they are 
sending will arrive too late to relieve General Howe. 
We have collected twenty-three boats that escaped 
the enemy, some of which want repairing, besides the 
boats supposed to be left up Esopus Creek, and the 
new galley, which have not been reconnoitred. 1 
shall order the boats that want repairing to be re 
paired, and some new ones to be built immediately. 
With esteem and respect, I am, affectionately, 
Your most obedient, humble servant, 

ISRAEL PUTNAM. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL HEATH. 

Head-Quarters, Boston, 25 October, 1777. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

We find, by the destination of the prisoners of 
General Burgoyne s army to this neighbourhood, a 
wide and difficult field opens to us. To providequarters, provisions, fuel, &c., for five or six thousand 
men, will be no small task. The Assembly suppose 
them to be under my direction, and have advised 
that they be placed in the barracks on Prospect and 
Winter Hills, Cambridge, and Sewell s Point- and, 
indeed, I do not see where else they can be quartered, if they are to remain together, and near this 
place. I have applied for a thousand or twelve hundred men for guards and am determined, on the onehand, to treat them with politeness and humanity, 
and, on the other, with precaution and strict order. 
But I must entreat your Excellency s endeavours to 
facilitate their removal as soon as possible, as their 
continuance, for any considerable time, will greatly 
distress the inhabitants, both as to provisions and 
fuel, especially the latter. 

Wood is now twelve or fourteen dollars per cord, 
on the wharves, and the inhabitants cannot obtain a 
supply at that price. So many of the coasters are 
taken by the enemy s cruisers, that they are become 
very unwilling to run the risk of falling into their 
hands. I submit to your Excellency the propriety 
and expediency of obtaining a protection from Lord 
Howe for such a number of vessels as may be 
thought necessary to supply the prisoners, from the 
eastern country. If some such method cannot be devised, I do not at present see how it can be obtained. I have wrote to Congress on the subject, and 
would also request your Excellency s direction as 
soon as may be convenient .to you. As soon as the 
disposition of, and regulations for, the prisoners are 
made, I will transmit them to your Excellency. It 
will be necessary, if practicable, to convey a quantity 
of flour this way. I have the honor to be, with 
great respect, 

Your Excellency s obedient servant, 

WILLIAM HEATH. 



2* 
FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Yorktown, Pennsylvania, 25 October, 1777. 

SIR, 

I was duly honored with your favor of the 22d. 
and am much obliged by the expressions of politeness 
and friendship which it contains. A few months re 
laxation will, I hope, restore my health and constitution, and enable me still to contribute my feeble 
efforts, in some mode or other, to the advancement of 
the cause of freedom in America, If I should not 
return to Congress, it will be the height of my inclination, as it will also be in my power, to render 
some service to the general interest in my own native 
country. 

As I propose setting out on Monday, and shall go 
through Bethlehem, I must request that the escort of 
horse you so politely offered to attend me, may meet 
me there. Should I reach Bethlehem before them, I 
shall wait their arrival. In the present critical state 
of our affairs, I believe I should decline setting out 
for a few days ; but, having wrote to Mrs. Hancock 
to meet me at some distance from Boston, I am 
under a necessity of beginning my journey on Monday morning. I am, dear Sir, with great esteem and 
regard, 

Your most obedient and most humble servant, 

JOHN HANCOCK, President. 



FROM COMMODORE HAZELWOOD. 

On board the Chatham Galley, 26 October, 1777. 

SIR, 

By your Excellency s pressing, in your last letter, 
so much for my keeping up harmony with the fleet 
and army, I apprehended some letters had been wrote, 
as though a difference subsisted here. As to my 
own part, I can lay my hand on my heart, and declare, I have taken every step in my power to 
keep from the least shadow of a difference, and did 
not know that any one had the least complaint to 
make, among the Continental fleet or army, as I had 
not ever heard the least mention of any such thing, 
and perfect harmony always appearing. Calling on 
Captain Robinson, I found he had wrote a letter to 
your Excellency concerning a Council of War that 
was held, and I am sorry to find he had given such 
a representation of it; and beg leave to relate matters 
as they were. 

On the 19th day of October, I hoisted a signal for 
all Captains to come on board the galley in which 
the flag was hoisted. They came, among whom was 
Captain Robinson, and some other officers of the Con 
tinental fleet. Finding the galley too small, I desired 
the Captains to remove on board the floating battery, 
where we should have more room; and acquainted 
Captain Robinson that my design was to hold a 
Council. He- then replied, he supposed there was no 
occasion for him or his officers. I told him there 
was, and I expected him to attend ; but he left the 
galley, and did not come to the Council. This is 
the state of facts, which he represents as a partial 
and absurd Council ; and says, I knew he would 
not give his consent, when he, nor myself could possibly tell what the determination of the Council would 
be. 

Captain Robinson and myself have always had an 
exceeding good understanding ; but I am. astonished 
at his unkind treatment, in his letter to your Excel 
lency. But, as I look on him as a good officer, this 
shall not in the least interrupt that harmony I have 
hitherto kept with him. 

Your Excellency may be assured that every thing 
that tends to promote peace, good order, and friend 
ship, between me and the officers of the fleet and 
army, shall be done, to the utmost of my power. 

I wrote to your Excellency in my last, of the destruction of the enemy s ships. I shall now be more 
particular. On the 22d, while the fort at lied Bank 
was attacked, the Augusta, of sixty-four guns ; the 
Roebuck, of forty-four ; two frigates ; the Merlin, of 
eighteen, and a galley, came up through the lower 
chevaiix-de-frise, which were attacked by the floatingbatteries and some of the galleys, while the rest of 
the galleys were flanking the enemy that were attacking the fort, where the galleys did much execution. 
As soon as the enemy was repulsed at the fort, the 
ships, finding so hot a fire, endeavoured to fall down, 
but the Augusta and Merlin ran aground. Early next 
morning the galleys and floating batteries attacked 
them, when an incessant fire was kept up. About 
eleven o clock, I believe, one of our shot set the 
August;! on fire, and at twelve, she blew up, beingaground. The engagement still continued with the 
other ships ; and, at three in the afternoon, the Mer 
lin, we think, also took fire and blew up. Then 
the fire ceased on both sides. The Roebuck dropped 
down to the lower chcvaux-de-frisc., and went through. 
Yesterday, I went down to the wrecks, and I. find 
the guns of both ships may be got out, if the enemy s 
ships can be kept at a proper distance. We brought 
off two twenty-four pounders, and, as soon as possible, 
shall endeavour for the rest. 

This day we can see great numbers of the enemy 
crossing Webb s Ferry, and, we are told, they have 
large numbers of fascines with them, by which, I suppose, they intend a grand attack on Fort Mifflin. 
We are also assured, this day, that they landed a 
number of troops at Billingsport, so that we are apprehensive they intend to attack both forts at onetime. 

The fleet is now so poorly manned, and the con 
stant cry from Fort Mifflin is to guard that post, that 
I know not how to act without more assistance. 

Colonels Greene and Angell can spare no men, as 
they are afraid of being attacked ; and as to the 
vessels at Bordentown, I am informed they have not 
twenty private men on board, so that I expect no 
assistance from there. 

This night it blows hard, and I fear the galleys 
will not be able to lay near Fort Mifflin, as, when 
the swell is great, they must get under a safe place. 
Having nothing to add, I am your Excellency s 
Most obedient, and most humble servant, 

JOHN HAZELWOOD. 



FROM GOVERNOR HENRY. 

Williamsburg, 30 October, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

My great anxiety for the success of the American 
arms under your command, induces me to trouble you 
with this. Accounts from the camp are so various 
and contradictory that I know not what to rely on. 
If the weight of public affairs, under which you have 
so long labored, will permit, a few lines will be most 
welcome to me. 

Although it seems impossible to enlist Continental 
recruits here, yet the zeal of our countrymen is great 
and general in the public cause. I wish some proper 
exertions of that spirit were wisely directed to the 
general good. A hint from you may lead to some 
thing important,, at a time like this, when most people seem at a loss to fix on the most effectual means 
of prosecuting the war vigorously. The Assembly is 
now sitting, and I shall take pleasure in communicating to them any matter you judge proper for 
their attention. 

I beg leave to assure your Excellency, that with 
the most unfeigned respect, and the highest regard, 
I am, dear Sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

PATRICK HENRY. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL DICKINSON. 

Elizabctlitown, 1 November, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

Your Excellency s favor of the 27th October, I re 
ceived the 30th ; and should be happy, if I had it in 
my power, to inform you that I w r as preparing for my 
march to the Delaware. 

I mentioned to the Governor and Council the urgent necessity for the immediate compliance with 
your Excellency s request, but have yet received no 
answer ; nor do I believe the orders will be given in 
time to be of any service. There are not more than 
one hundred western militia now at this post; the 
supplies have been drawn from the eastern parts of 
this State. The reports of our intended march to 
Red Bank have lessened the numbers at this post ; 
the troops, being eastern men, not choosing to abandon (as they term it) this part of the State. Mr. 
Boudinot, who is here, and returns to camp in a few 
days, will inform your Excellency the prevailing opinion in East Jersey. Thus it is with militia. They 
will undertake to judge for themselves. Those are 
difficulties and inconveniences your Excellency has 
often had to contend with and submit to, for which I 
am sincerely concerned. Our Governor and Council 
seem inattentive to your request, perhaps from an 
inclination to keep the troops in their present situation. General Winds, with his brigade, has not yet 
returned ; they were at New Windsor by the last 
accounts. 

I would by no means presume to dictate to yourExcellency, but beg leave just to hint, that, if an or 
der was given to Generals Gates and Putnam, to raise 
a number of militia, and make an attack upon LongIsland and New York ; and myself, with what militia 
I could collect from this part of the State, to make 
a descent upon Staten Island, all at the same time, 
whether it would not answer a valuable purpose, 
although we should not all succeed. I have reason 
to believe it is an order that would be obeyed with 
great readiness ; the sooner the better, if it meets 
your Excellency s approbation. I should only require 
a few days notice, having boats now ready to transport five hundred men at a time ; and I am of opinion I could increase my present numbers (about six 
hundred men) to twelve hundred men, upon such an 
occasion ; and if I should be disappointed, I would 
make the attack with whatever numbers I could col 
lect, 

By information that may be depended upon (in my 
opinion), the enemy are embarking troops from New 
York to Staten Island to reenforce Mr. Howe. I 
could, within twenty-four hours, have intelligence conveyed to Mr. Skinner, if your Excellency thought 
proper, that something was intended against .New 
York, &c., which might prevent the re enforcements 
heing sent. 

I have a person now in New York ; he returns 
to-inorrow ; if he brings any thing material, it shall 
he instantly communicated to your Excellency. I 
have the honor to he, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

PHILEMON DICKINSON. 



FROM COLONEL HAMILTON.* 

Head-Quarters, Fishkill, 2 November, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

I lodged last night in the neighbourhood of New 
Windsor. This morning early, I met Colonel Morgan 
with his corps, about a mile from it, in inarch for 
head-quarters. I told him the necessity of making 
all the despatch he could, so as not to fatigue his 
men too much which he has promised to do. 

I understand, from Colonel Morgan, that all the 
Northern army were marching down on both sides the 
river, and would probably be to-morrow at New Wind 
sor and this place; and that General Putnam had 
held a Council for the general disposition of them, in 
which it was resolved to send you four thousand men. 
and to keep the rest on this side the river. I came 
here in expectation that matters were in such a train 
as to enable me to accomplish my errand without 
going any farther, unless it should be to hasten the 
troops that were on their march. But, on my arrival, I learn from Mr. Hughes, an Aid-de-camp of 
General Grates, that the following disposition of the 
Northern army had taken place. 

General Patterson s, Glover s, and Nixon s brigades, 
and Colonel Warner s Mountain Boys to remain in 
and about Albany; barracks building for them. 

General Poor s brigade, marching down this side of 
the river to join General Putnam, will probably be 
here to-morrow. General Learned s brigade, Morgan s 
corps, Warner s brigade of Massachusetts militia, and 
some regiments of New York militia, on their march 
on the west side of the river. 

I have directed General Putnam, in your name, 
to send forward, with all despatch, to join you, the 
two Continental brigades and Warner s militia brigade. 
This last is to serve till the latter end of this month. 
Your instructions did not comprehend any militia; 
but as there are certain accounts here that most of 
the troops from New York are gone to reenforce 
General Howe, and as so large a proportion of the 
Continental troops have been detained at Albany, I 
concluded you would not disapprove of a measure 
calculated to strengthen you, though but for a small 
time, and have ventured to adopt it, on that presumption. 

Being informed, by General Putnam, that General 
Winds, with seven hundred Jersey militia, was at 
King s Ferry, with intention to cross to Peekskill, I 
prevailed upon him to relinquish that idea, and send 
off an immediate order for them to march towards 
Red Bank. 

It is possible, however, unless your Excellency sup 
ports this order by an application from yourself, he 
may march his men home instead of to the place he 
has been directed to repair to. Neither Lee s [nor] 

VOL. II. 3 
Jackson s regiments, nor the detachments belonging 
to General McDougall s division, have yet marched. 
I have pressed their being sent, and an order has 
been despatched for their instantly proceeding. 

Colonel Hughes is pressing some fresh horses for 
me. The moment they are ready, I shall recross the 
river in order to fall in with the troops on the other 
side, and make all the haste I can to Albany, to get 
the three brigades there sent forward. 

Will your Excellency permit me to observe, that I 
have some doubts, under present circumstances and 
appearances, of the propriety of leaving the regiments 
proposed to be left in this quarter? But if my 
doubts on this subject were stronger than they are, I 
am forbid, by the sense of Council, from interfering 
in this matter. I have the honor to be, with the 
warmest esteem and respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 

P. S. General Poor s brigade is just arrived here. 
They will proceed to join you with all expedition. 
So strongly am I impressed with the importance of 
endeavouring to crush Mr. Howe, that I am apt to 
think it would be advisable to draw off all the Con 
tinental troops. Had this been determined on, General 
Warner s sixteen hundred militia might have been 
left here. 



FROM COLONEL HAMILTON. 

Albany, November, 1777. 



DEAR SIR, 
I arrived here yesterday, at noon, and waited upon 
General Gates immediately, on the business of my 
mission ; but was sorry to find his ideas did not correspond with yours for drawing off the number of 
troops you directed. I used every argument in my 
power to convince him of the propriety of the measure ; but he was inflexible in the opinion, that two 
brigades, at least, of Continental troops should remain 
in and near this place. His reasons were, that the 
intelligence of Sir Henry Clinton s having gone to 
join Burgoyne was not sufficiently authenticated to 
put it out of doubt ; that there was, therefore, a possibility of his returning up the river, which might ex 
pose the finest arsenal in America (as he calls the 
one here) to destruction, should this place be left so 
bare of troops as I proposed ; and that the w r ant of 
conveniences, and the difficulty of the roads, would 
make it impossible to remove the artillery and stores 
here for a considerable time ; that the New England 
States would be left open to the depredations and 
ravages of the enemy; that it would put it out of 
his power to enterprise any thing against Ticonderoga, which, he thinks, might be done in the winter, 
and which he considers it of importance to under 
take. 

The force of the reasons did by no means strike 
me, and I did every thing in my power to show 
they were unsubstantial; but all I could effect, was 
to have one brigade despatched, in addition to those 
already marched. I found myself infinitely embarrassed, and was at a loss how to act. I felt the importance of strengthening you as much as possible ; 
but, on the other hand, I found insuperable inconveniences in acting diametrically opposite to the 
opinion of a gentleman, whose successes have raised 
him into the highest importance. General Gates has 
won the entire confidence of the Eastern States. If 
disposed to do it, by addressing himself to the prejudices of the people, he would find no difficulty to 
render a measure odious, which, it might be said 
with plausibility enough to be believed, was calculated to expose them to unnecessary danger, notwithstanding their exertions during the campaign had 
given them the fullest title to repose and security. 
General Gates has influence and interest elsewhere ; 
he might use it, if he pleased, to discredit the measure there also. On the whole, it appeared to me 
dangerous to insist on sending more troops from 
hence, while General Gates appeared so warmly op 
posed to it. Should any accident or inconvenience 
happen in consequence of it, there would be too fair 
a pretext for censure ; and many people are too w^ell 
disposed to lay hold of it. At any rate, it might be 
considered as using him ill, to take a step so con 
trary to his judgment^ in a case of this nature. 

These considerations, and others which I shall be 
more explicit in, when I have the pleasure of seeing 
you, determined me not to insist upon sending either 
of the other brigades remaining here. I am afraid 
what I have done may not meet with your approbation, as not being, perhaps, fully warranted by 
your instructions ; but I ventured to do what I 
thought right, hoping that, at least, the goodness of 
my intention will excuse the error of my judgment. 

I was induced to this relaxation the more readily, 
as I had directed to be sent on two thousand militia, 
which were not expected by you, and a thousand 
Continental troops out of those proposed to be left 
with General Putnam, which I have written to him, 
since I found how matters were circumstanced here. 
to forward to you with all despatch. I did this for 
several reasons; because your reinforcement would 
be more expeditious from that place than from this; 
because two thousand Continental troops at Peekskill 
will not be wanted, in the present circumstances, 
especially as it was really necessary to have a body 
of Continental troops at this place for the security 
of the valuable stores here ; and I should not, if I 
had my wish, think it expedient to draw off more 
than two of the three brigades now here. This being 
the case, one of the ends you proposed to be an 
swered by leaving the ten regiments with General 
Putnam, will be equally answered by the troops here ; 
I mean that of covering and satisfying the Eastern 
States ; and one thousand Continental troops, in ad 
dition to the militia collected and that may be col 
lected there, will be sufficient in the * Highlands for 
covering the country down that way, and carrying 
on the works necessary to be raised for the defence 
of the river. 

The troops gone, and going, to reenforce you, are 
near five thousand, rank and file, Continental troops, 
and twenty-five hundred Massachusetts and New Hamp 
shire militia. These, and the seven hundred Jersey 
militia, will be a larger reinforcement than you ex 
pected, though not quite an equal number of Continental troops, nor exactly in the way directed. General Lincoln tells me the militia are very excellent; 
and though their times will be out by the last of 
this month, you will be able, if you think proper, to 
order the troops still remaining here, to join you by 
the time their term of service expires. 

I cannot forbear being uneasy lest my conduct 
should prove displeasing to you; but I have donewhat, considering all circumstances, appeared to me 
most eligible and prudent. I have the honor to be. 
with great esteem and respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 

P. S. Vessels are preparing to carry the brigadeto New Windsor, which will embark this evening. 
I shall, this afternoon, set out on my return to camp, 
and, on my way, shall endeavour to hasten the troops 
forward. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL PUTNAM. 

Fishkill, 7 November, 1777. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

Yours of the 31st October and 1st November, I 
have been favored with, and have taken the neces 
sary precautions that your army should be supplied 
with provisions. 

In my last, I informed you that General Warner s 
brigade were ordered to join you ; but, as they are 
raised only till the 1st of December, the officers and 
men think it exceeding hard that they should be 
obliged to make that long march, and their times out 
soon after they could reach you. I have, in conse 
quence of their request, detained them here, to make 
obstructions in the river. Governor Clinton and my 
self have been down to view the forts, and are both 
of opinion that a boom, thrown across at Fort Consti 
tution, and a battery on each side the river, would 
answer a much better purpose than at Fort Mont 
gomery; as the garrison would be reenforced by militia with more expedition, and the ground much 
more definable. 
All these circumstances considered, we have con 
cluded to obstruct the navigation at the former place, 
and shall go about it immediately. 

The cannon that were left at the forts are rendered entirely useless, except six twelve-pounders at 
Fort Constitution- and these are spiked, and the 
trunnions broke off, but may be stocked, so as to 
answer the purpose tolerably well. 

I yesterday received a letter from Colonel Hamil 
ton, dated at Albany, ordering me to send forward 
one thousand more Continental troops than was pro 
posed when he was here ; this will leave me with 
about three hundred Continental troops, and no mili 
tia except those whose times are out the first of De 
cember, to cover all this distressed country. I do not 
think I can justify myself in this, without first ac 
quainting you; and, if I then have your Excellency s 
orders, I will, with pleasure, immediately and prompt 
ly comply with them. 

I am sorry to inform you that, for want of pay, 
General Poor s brigade of Continental troops have 
refused to cross the North River. The troops mu 
tinied, the officers endeavouring to suppress them, 
and they so determined to go home, that a Captain, 
in the execution of his duty, ran a soldier through 
the body, who soon expired, but not before he shot 
the Captain through, who is since dead. I have got 
several of them in provost guard, and a general Courtmartial sitting for their trial. About twenty of them 
have made their escape, and gone home. I have sent 
off some light-horse, and officers of the brigade, to 
bring them back. In order to make peace, and reenforce you as soon as possible, I am endeavouring 
to borrow about one thousand or fifteen hundred 
pounds, to give them a month s pay. In the mean 
time they are curing themselves of the itch. As soon 
as this operation is over, they will march immedi 
ately. This, I acknowledge, is a bad precedent, but it 
is a worse one to keep troops ten months without pay. 
This department is absolutely in distress for money, 
and the necessary business cannot be carried on with 
out a supply is immediately sent. I am, dear General, 
very respectfully, 

Your most obedient servant, 

ISRAEL PUTNAM. 

P. S. I have just received information from Generals Dickinson arid Parsons, that Sir Henry Clinton 
has embarked about six thousand troops as a ree nforcement for General Howe ; they have not yet sailed. I shall go down to White Plains this afternoon, 
to make a show there. Possibly this will prevent 
their going so soon as they would otherwise, if at 
all. 



FROM COLONEL HAMILTON. 

New Windsor, 10 November, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

I arrived here last night from Albany. Having 
given General Gates a little time to recollect himself, 
I renewed my remonstrances on the necessity and 
propriety of sending you more than one brigade of 
the three he had detained with him, and finally prevailed upon him to give orders for Glover s, in addition to Patterson s brigade, to march this way. As 
it was thought conducive to expedition to send the 
troops by water, as far as it could be done, I pro 
cured all the vessels that could be had at Albany fit 
for the purpose, but could not get more than suffi 
cient to take in Patterson s brigade. It was embarked the 7th instant, and I expected would have been 
here before this, but the wind has been contrary, 
though they must, in all probability, be here to-day. 
General Glover s brigade marched at the same time 
on the east side of the river, the road being much 
better there than on this side. I am this moment 
informed that one sloop, with a part of Patterson s, 
is arrived, and that the others are in sight. They 
will immediately proceed by water to King s Ferry, 
and thence take the shortest route to you. 

I am pained, beyond expression, to inform your Ex 
cellency that, on my arrival here, I find every thing 
has been neglected and deranged by General Putnam, 
and that the two brigades, Poor s and Learned s, still 
remained here and on the other side the river at 
Fishkill. Colonel Warner s militia, I am told, have 
been drawn to Peekskill, to aid in an expedition 
against New York, which, it seems, is at this time the 
hobby-horse with General Putnam. Not the least at 
tention has been paid to my order, in your name, for 
a detachment of one thousand men from the troops 
hitherto stationed at that post. Every thing is sacrificed to the whim of taking New York. 

The two brigades of Poor and Learned, it appears, 
would not march for want of money and necessaries, 
several of the regiments having received no pay for 
six or eight months past. There has been a high 
mutiny among the former on this account, in which a 
Captain killed a man, and was shot himself by his 
comrade. These difficulties, for want of proper ma 
nagement, have stopped the troops from proceeding. 
Governor Clinton has been the only man who has 
done any thing towards removing them ; but, for want 
of General Putnam s cooperation., has not been able 
to effect it. He has only been able to prevail with 
Learned s brigade to agree to march to Goshen, in 
hopes, by getting them once on the go, to get them 
to continue their march. On coming here, I immedi 
ately sent for Colonel Bayley, who now commands 
Learned s brigade ; and have gotten him to engage 
for carrying the brigade on to head-quarters as fast 
as possible. This he expects to effect by means of 
live or six thousand dollars, which Governor Clinton 
was kind enough to borrow for me, and which Colonel 
Bayley thinks will keep the men in good humor till 
they join you. They marched this morning towards 
Goshen. 

I shall, as soon as possible, see General Poor, and 
do every thing in my power to get him along. I 
hope I shall be able to succeed. 

The plan I before laid having been totally deranged, a new one has become necessary. It is now 
too late to send Warner s militia. By the time they 
get to you, their term of service would be out. The 
motive for sending them, which was to give you a 
speedy reenforcement, has, by the past delay, been 
superseded. By Governor Clinton s advice, I have 
sent an order, in the most emphatical terms, to General 
Putnam, immediately to despatch all the Continental 
troops under him to your assistance ; and to detain 
the militia instead of them. 

My opinion is, that the only present use for troops 
in this quarter is to protect the country from the 
depredations of little plundering parties, and for carrying on the works necessary for the defence of the 
river. Nothing more ought to be thought of. It is 
only wasting time, and misapplying men, to employ 
them in a fancied parade against New York; for in 
this it will undoubtedly terminate. New York is no 
object, if it could be taken ; and, to take it, would 
require more men than could be spared from more 
substantial purposes. Governor Clinton s ideas coin 
cide with mine. He thinks that there is no need of 
more Continental troops here than a few to give a 
spur to the militia in working upon the fortifications. 
In pursuance of this, I have given the directions be 
fore mentioned ; if General Putnam attends to them, 
the troops under him may be with you nearly as 
early as any of the others (though he has unluckily 
marched them down to Tarrytown), and General Glo 
ver s brigade, when it gets up, will be more than suffi 
cient to answer the purposes of this post. 

If your Excellency agrees with me in opinion, it 
will be w r ell to send instant directions to General Put 
nam to pursue the objects I have mentioned; for I 
doubt whether he will attend to any thing I shall 
say, notwithstanding it comes in the shape of a posi 
tive order. I fear, unless you interpose, the works 
here will go on so feebly, for want of men, that they 
will not be completed in time ; whereas, it appears to 
me of the utmost importance they should be pushed 
with the utmost vigor. Governor Clinton will do 
every thing in his power. I wish General Putnam 
was recalled from the command of this post, and Go 
vernor Clinton would accept it. The blunders and ca 
prices of the former are endless. 

Believe me, Sir, nobody can be more impressed 
with the importance of forwarding the reinforcements 
coming to you, with all speed, nor could anybody 
have endeavoured more to promote it than I have 
done ; but the ignorance of some, and the design of 
others, have been almost insuperable obstacles. I am 
very unwell; but I shall not spare myself to get 
things immediately in a proper train; and, for that 
purpose, intend, unless I receive other orders from yon, 
to continue with the troops in the progress of their 
march. As soon as I get General Poor s brigade in 
march, I shall proceed to General Putnam at Peekskill. I have the honor to be, with much regard and 
respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 



FROM COLONEL HAMILTON. 

New Windsor, 12 November, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have been detained here these two days by a 
fever, and violent rheumatic pains throughout my 
body. This has prevented my being active in person 
for promoting the purposes of my errand; but I have 
taken every other method in my power, in which 
Governor Clinton has obligingly given me all the aid 
he could. In answer to my pressing application to 
General Poor, for the immediate marching of his bri 
gade, I was told they were under an operation for 
the itch, which made it impossible for them to pro 
ceed till the effects of it were over. By a letter, 
however, of yesterday, General Poor informed me he 
would certainly march this morning. I must do himthe justice to say, he appears solicitous to join you ; 
and that I believe the past delay is not owing to 
any fault of his, but is wholly chargeable on General 
Putnam. Indeed, Sir, I owe it to the service to say, 
that every part of this gentleman s conduct is marked 
with blunders and negligence, and gives general disgnst. 
Parsons s brigade will join you, I hope, in five or six 
days from this. Learned s may do the same. Poor s 
will, I am persuaded, make all the haste they can for 
the future ; and Glover s may be expected at Fishkill 
to-night, whence they will be pushed forward, as fast 
as I can have any influence to make them go. But, I 
am sorry to say, the disposition for marching, in the 
officers and men in general, of these troops, does not 
keep pace with my wishes, or the exigency of the 
occasion. They have unfortunately imbibed an idea 
that they have done their part of the business of the 
campaign, and are now entitled to repose. This, and 
the want of pay, make them averse to a long march 
at this advanced season. 

A letter from you to General Putnam, of the 9th, 
fell just now into my hands. As it might possibly 
contain something useful to me, I took the liberty of 
opening it, and, after reading it, immediately des 
patched it to him. If he has paid any attention to 
my last letters to him, things will be in a right train 
for executing the order in yours ; but whether he has 
or not, is a matter of doubt. In a letter from him, 
just now received by Governor Clinton, he appears to 
have been, on the 10th instant, at King Street, at 
the White Plains. I have had no answer to my last 
applications. 

The enemy appear to have stripped New York 
very bare. The people there (that is, the Tories) are 
in a very great fright. This adds to my anxiety 
that the reinforcements from this quarter to you are 
not in greater forwardness and more considerable. 

I have written to General Gates, informing him of 
the accounts of the situation of New York with re 
spect to troops, and the probability of the force goneto Howe being greater than was at first expected, to 

VOL. II. 4 
try if this will not extort from him a further reenforcement. I do not, however, expect much from 
him, as he pretends to have in view an expedition 
against Ticonderoga, to be undertaken in the winter; 
and he knows that, under the sanction of this idea, 
calculated to catch the Eastern people, he may, with 
out censure, retain the troops. And as I shall be 
under a necessity of speaking plainly to your Excel 
lency when I have the pleasure of seeing you, I 
shall not hesitate to say, I doubt whether you would 
have had a man from the Northern army if the 
whole could have been kept at Albany with any decency. Perhaps you will think me blainable in not 
having exercised the powers you gave me, and given 
a positive order. Perhaps I have been so ; but, deli 
berately weighing all circumstances, I did not, and 
do not, think it advisable to do it, I have the honor 
to be, with unfeigned esteem and regard, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL PUTNAM. 

Head- Quarters, North Street, 14 November, 1777. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I am favored with yours of the 4th, 5th, and 9th 
instant ; and you will see, by mine of the Vth, that 
I have detained General Warner s brigade. The New 
York regiments being annexed to General Poor s bri 
gade, they are exceeding unwilling to be separated ; 
and I, knowing the disadvantages that would arise 
from their being here, have presumed, in some measure, to deviate from your Excellency s orders. Those 
regiments are principally composed of men whose for 
mer residence was within the enemy s lines ; and, the 
little time they were down in this quarter last sum 
mer, there was upwards of one hundred deserters from 
them, mostly to the enemy. We should soon lose 
the principal part of them here. Add to this, they 
have lately got some clothes and money, which puts 
them in a much better situation to march than most 
of the other Continental troops here. Besides all this, 
they began their march before I received your letter. 
This, Sir, has induced me to let them continue their 
route, and, in their stead, I have detained Wyllys s 
and Meigs s regiments, whose situation will by no 
means admit of their inarching with that expedition 
which is necessary. Near one half of them without a 
shoe or stocking ; but a supply is soon expected. 

Colonel Charles Webb s regiment marched yester 
day. I have directed him to advise you of his route, 
by express, before he arrives. I shall be happy to 
find this step meets your Excellency s approbation. 

The inclosed is a copy of a letter from Colonel 
Hamilton to me, by which you will see that I am 
positively ordered to send all the Continental troops 
from here. This letter contains some most unjust and 
injurious reflections ; for I am conscious of having 
done every thing in my power to succour you as 
speedily as possible.* 

I shall go to New Windsor this day to see Colonel 
Hamilton ; and, until I have your orders, I cannot 
think of continuing at this post myself, and send all 
the troops away. If they should go now, I am con 
fident General Howe will be further reenforced from 
this quarter. For, by deserters, spies, and every other 
corroborating intelligence, there is now on York Island 

* See this letter, dated November 9th, in the Appendix. 
the thirty-fifth, forty-fifth, fifty-second, and fifty-seventh, 
British, four regiments of Hessians, and one of Waideck Brown s, Fanning s, Byard s, Robinson s, Ilirlehy s, and Delancy s first and second battalions of new 
levies. Some say Fanning s is at Panlus Hook, though 
that is immaterial. On Long Island, there are nonebut militia, By information from General Dickinson, 
there are about one thousand on Staten Island. 

I had, previous to the receipt of your letter, wrote 
Governor Trumbull for a number of militia ; but I 
have my doubts whether they w T ill come or not, as 
they have been much fatigued this summer already. 
The Rhode Island expedition has been of no service 
to us. You have doubtless heard that it is dropped, 
and it is said about three thousand troops remain 
there. 

Mr. Colt has accepted his appointment as Deputy 
Commissary-General of Purchases. I have seen himthis day. He informs me there are a number of 
cattle purchased, which shall be immediately for 
warded to you. Since I came here we have had 
near fifty deserters, some from all corps. I am, dearGeneral, with much respect, 

Your most obedient servant, 

ISRAEL PUTNAM. 



FROM FRANCIS HOPKINS ON. 

Bordentown, 14 November, 1777. 

SIR, 

The intimacy of my connection with Mr. Duche 
renders all assurance unnecessary, that the letter, ad 
dressed by him to your Excellency on the 8th of 
October last, gave me the greatest concern. I flatter 
myself some undue means have been used to induce 
him to write such a letter, so incompatible with the 
amiable character he has ever maintained, and so 
fatal to his reputation. I could not forbear communicating to him some of my sentiments on the occasion. 
These I might probably have been able to convey to 
him by secret means ; but did not choose to risk the 
imputation of a clandestine correspondence. I have, 
therefore, taken the liberty to send the inclosed letter 
to your Excellency, unsealed, for your perusal; resting it entirely on your better judgment to cause it 
to be forwarded or not. 

I hope your Excellency will pardon my giving 
you this trouble. The occasion is a very interesting 
one to me. My friendship for Mr. Duche calls upon 
me to do all I can to warn him against the fatal 
consequences of his ill-advised step, that he may, if 
possible, do something to avert them before it is too 
late. 

I am, Sir, with the warmest wishes of my heart 
for your welfare, 

Your sincere friend, and very humble servant, 

FRANCIS HOPKINSON.* 



FROM COLONEL HAMILTON.

Sm, 

I arrived at this place last night, and, unfortunate

confined me at Governor Clinton s, and anxious to be

about, attending to the march of the troops, the day 
before yesterday I crossed the ferry, in order to fall 
in with General Glover s brigade, which was on its 
march from Poughkeepsie to Fishkill. I did not. 
however, see it myself, but received a letter from 
Colonel Shepherd, who commands the brigade, in 
forming mo he would be, last night, at Fishkill, and 
this night at King s Ferry. Wagons, &c., are pro 
vided on the other side for his accommodation, so 
that there need be no delay, but what is voluntary ; 
and, I believe, Colonel Shepherd is as well disposed 
as could be wished to hasten his march. General 
Poor s brigade crossed the ferry the day before yes 
terday. Tw 7 o York regiments, Cortlandt s and Livings 
ton s, are with them; they were unwilling to be sepa 
rated from the brigade, and the brigade from them. 
General Putnam was unwilling to keep them with 
him, and, if he had consented to do it, the regiments 
to replace them would not join you within six days 
as soon as these. 

The troops now remaining with General Putnam 
will amount to about the number you intended, 
though they are not exactly the same. He has detached Colonel Charles Webb s regiment to you. He 
says the troops with him are not in a condition to 
march, being destitute of shoes, stockings, and other 
necessaries ; but, I believe, the true reasons of his 
being unwilling to pursue the mode pointed out by 
you were, his aversion to the York troops, and his 
desire to retain General Parsons with him. I am, 
with much respect and esteem, 

Y r our Excellency s most obedient servant, 

ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 


FROM COLONEL GREENE. 

Red Bank, 17 November, 1777; 
4 o clock, P. M. 

SIR, 

Your Excellency, I dare say, has been informed of 
the evacuation of Fort Mifflin, and the gallant defence there made by Major Thayer. The evacuation 
of that fort, the removal of our navy, the movements 
of the British fleet, and our own situation at present, 
have put it wholly out of my power to answer those 
important purposes for which your Excellency was 
pleased to order me to this command. 

Our fleet here are now moving as fast as possible 
to Timber Creek. The river is so open to the enemy s shipping, that topsail and other vessels are now 
passing between Mud Island and Province Island to 
the Schuylkill, unmolested. Fort Mercer is tolera 
bly secure against a storm only. A bomb-proof ma 
gazine is nearly finished; no other security in the 
fort against shells. A strong breastwork partly fin 
ished on the bank, takes up a considerable part of 
the floor of the fort; and the magazine takes up so 
much, that the remainder of the floor is insufficient 
to spring tents on for more than one third of the 
garrison. 

The proposal for building a bomb-proof under the 
bank is now at an end, since Fort Mifflin is lost. 
The communication to Red Bank, by water, is nearly 
intercepted; and, should a party of the enemy in 
vest this fort by land, our whole supply would be 
cut off; and, should they erect bomb-batteries on the 
land side, they would be able to throw shells to 
us on all sides; from all of which I conclude, that 
an army investing us, sufficient to keep the field, 
will reduce the garrison, and make the survivors 
prisoners, as we could have no retreat. 

Thus, having given your Excellency what appears 
to me, with the unanimous voice of all the FieldOfficers of the garrison, a true state of our circum 
stances, and observations thereon, I wait your Ex 
cellency s particular commands and directions, for an 
invariable rule for me to pursue ; for which purpose 
Major Ward will wait on your Excellency, to whom 
I refer for a more particular account of matters here. 

With every sentiment of respect and esteem, I am, 
Your Excellency s humble servant, 

CHRISTOPHER GREENE. 



FROM RICHARD HENRY LEE. 

York, 20 November, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have no doubt of being excused by you for not 
sooner answering your favor of the 24th last, when 
you are informed that my ill state of health has prevented me from attending, as I ought, to the import 
ant matter it contains. I gave Mr. Jones the letter, 
that he might inform Congress of such parts as it 
imported the public they should be acquainted with. 
As it appeared, by the letters of General Mifflin, that 
he objected only to serve in the Quarter-masters De 
partment, that his health was returning, and that he 
was willing to continue his aid to the public cause, 
Congress appointed him one of the Commissioners of 
the new Board, because he is competent to the right 
discharge of its duties, because that would best suit 
his valetudinary state, and as showing a just sense 
of his uniform, vigorous, and well-founded patriotism. 
I have strong hopes that, by the skill and industry 
of this new Board, and from the right execution of 
business in that important department, you will, in 
future, find great relief. 

General Conway has not lately been mentioned in 
Congress, nor has there been much talk of an Adju 
tant-General, since it is not certainly known whether 
Colonel Pickering will accept his new appointment. 
Mr. Fleming s character stands very fair, and, so faras I am able to judge, he would answer well in this 
Commission. You will see, in the inclosed, what Mr. 
Sergeant says of him. j General Mifflin has proposed a 
plan for the Quarter-master s Department, that appears 
judicious, and well fitted to answer the purpose of 
good service and economy at the same time. He 
would divide this department into its military and 
civil branches ; the former to be filled by a person 
well qualified to discharge its duties, and the latter 
again to be divided into Commissaries of Teams, of 
Forage, of Tents, &c., to be governed in their purchases by estimates from the Quartermaster-General, , 
who is to touch no money but a moderate and suffi-/ 
cient salary. 

It is unfortunately too true, that our enemies pay 
little regard to good faith, or any obligations of jus 
tice and humanity, which renders the Convention of 
Saratoga a matter of great moment ; and it is also, 
as you justly observe, an affair of infinite delicacy. 
The undoubted advantage they will take, even of the 
appearance of infraction on our part, and the Ameri 
can character, which is concerned in preserving its 
faith inviolate, cover this affair with difficulties, and 
prove the disadvantage we are under in conducting 
war against an old, corrupt, and powerful people, who, 
having much credit and influence in the world, will 
venture on things that would totally ruin the reputa 
tion of young and rising communities like ours. 

The English, however, were not to blame in the 
business of Closter Seven. That Convention was left 
incomplete by the Commanders who made it. It was 
stipulated, particularly, that the Court of Versailles 
must ratify, and that within a certain time, which 
was not done until long after the time was elapsed, 
and before which ratification the troops of Hanover 
had returned to arms. Upon this occasion, the good 
faith of England is not impeached. 

It is greatly to be regretted that the situation of 
your army unfits it for vigorous action, because it is 
very obvious that the enemy s possession of Phila 
delphia this winter and the ensuing spring, may pro 
duce consequences extensively injurious. You well 
know, Sir, how weak and divided the people of this 
State are from various causes. Those of Delaware are 
still worse. In this condition, with the infinite arts 
of our enemies, pushed up almost to the centre of 
the above Governments, and aided by the powerful 
means of supplying the wants, fanciful and real, of 
the people, with all kinds of European goods and 
salt, it will be no great matter of surprise if we were 
to find a total revolution in Pennsylvania and Dela 
ware. Add to this, the ill condition of our finances, 
which totter upon every seeming success of the 
enemy. 

It is not to be supposed that, where so much is at 
stake, Great Britain will fail to make most potent 
efforts to recover her honor, and prevent her ruin. 
Upon this ground, we may expect considerable ree nforcements, and early as possible in the spring. With 
an army much strengthened, General Howe may effect 
purposes dangerous to America, It happens, too, unluckily for us, that, in order to support the credit of 
our money, the several States must, of necessity, impose large and immediate taxes. This is the most 
delicate and difficult of all Government operations, 
even in old and undisturbed states. Yet it is una 
voidable, and Congress have pressingiy requested that 
it may be quickly and extensively entered upon. 

It was most evident, to discerning men, that the 
change in the Commissariat, at the time it was adopted, would produce most mischievous consequences, 
yet such was the rage of reformation, that no en 
deavours to prevent the evil could avail 5 and now I 
feel the most anxious solicitude, for fear the conse 
quences may disperse our army even in face of the 
enemy. A Committee is appointed to confer with 
the Commissary-General, and to try what can be 
done to avert the evil. I wish they may be for 
tunate enough to hit upon a remedy. That there 
should be a want of flour amazes me, and proves 
great want of attention in the Commissary-General, 
because I well know that any quantity might have , 
been got in Virginia at a reasonable price. 

By our last despatches from the West Indies, it 
would seem as if a war between France and England 
was inevitable, unless the latter should restore all her 
captures made from the former without the limits 
prescribed by treaty, and which have been madeunder authority of an Act of Parliament. But the 
royal spleen against America is such, that every con 
sideration falls before the wish to subjugate this freecountry. Yet Mr. Bingham mentions, that the minis 
terial writings are calculated to rouse the national 
resentment against France. If so, it is evident they 
want to set Europe on fire, that the smoke may 
cover them from the eyes of their injured country. 
Mr. Carmichael writes that Dr. Lee was returning to 
Paris from Berlin, having finished his business success 
fully at the Prussian Court; and Mr. Bingham says 
it is certain that the King of Prussia has opened his 
ports to the United State s, and that Portugal has 
deserted the interest of England, and acceded to the 
family compact. This is all good news, and will, I 
hope, furnish employment quickly for our unprin 
cipled enemies.* 

My ill state of health will compel me to return 
home in a few days, where I shall continue ardently 
to pray for your health and success. 

I am, dear Sir, affectionately yours, 

RICHARD HENRY LEE. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GATES. 

Albany, 23 November, 1777. 

SIR, 

I am just now honored with the receipt of yourExcellency s letter of the 14th instant, from White 
Marsh. I have never entertained the smallest idea 
that General Burgoyrie should be permitted to ex 
change the port of embarkation, or that the least 
variation of the spirit and letter of the Convention 
would be indulged to the troops under his command. 
There is no doubt but the British regiments, upon 
their arrival in England, will be ordered to do duty 
there; but the Germans cannot, by the laws, serve in 
Great Britain or Ireland. 

If General Burgoyne has any sinister design, what 
I suggested to Congress in my letter of the 10th 
instant, a copy of which I conclude your Excellency 

* This intelligence was not confirmed. 
has received, will be a good method of delaying, if 
not finally preventing, the execution of his project. 

I shall write to-morrow, by the Boston post, to 
General Glover, who is charged with the embarkation 
of the prisoners under the Convention, and send hima copy of your Excellency s letter. I am, Sir, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant. 

HORATIO GATES. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL DICKINSON. 

Elizabethtown, 28 November, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

Having obtained the fullest information respecting 
the strength and situation of the enemy upon Staten 
Island, and made the necessary preparations, I called 
in many volunteers, whose numbers, in addition to 
those on duty at this post, amounted to about fourteen hundred men. With this detachment I landed 
yesterday morning, before day, upon the Island, from 
Halstead s Point. The whole strength of the enemy 
was drawn to this side of the Island, and extended 
from the Blazing Star to their former works. General Skinner, with five regiments of Greens, were 
quartered in different parts.* About three hundred 
Waldeckers, with General Campbell, lay at the works, 
in which were light cannon, with a company of artil 
lery, covered by a fifty-gun ship, and a sloop-of-war. 

I landed in three divisions (having the best guides), 
and intended to have marched in by-roads, in order 
to get in the rear of the Greens, and cut off their 
retreat. The divisions proceeded as far as was in
* Cortland Skinner had been Attorney-General of New Jersey be 
fore the war, and he now commanded a body of Loyalists, who were 
dressed in a green uniform. See Sabine s American Loyalists, p. 615. 

VOL. II. 5 
tended (seven miles), and then met at the appointed 
rendezvous ; but, to my great disappointment, they 
secured their retreat in the works by the most precipitate flight; General Skinner, Colonel Allen, and 
many other officers, having narrowly escaped. We 
drove in all their pickets, with little opposition, and 
now and then skirmished a little with them as they 
fled. I kept my design as secret as possible, not having communicated it to the Field-Officers until eight 
o clock the evening before ; but, notwithstanding all 
my precaution, Mr. Skinner received the intelligence 
at three o clock in the morning, which frustrated my 
plan. I flattered myself I should have had the plea 
sure of giving your Excellency a good account of 
the General and his Green brigade, which, undoubted 
ly, would have been the case, had he not unluckily 
received the above information. 

We made the following prisoners, namely; two 
Lieutenants (one Colonel Bushkirk s son), one Surgeon, one Commissary, and twenty privates (Mr. Hood, 
of Brunswick, among the number) ; and killed five or 
six Greens. Our loss was three men made prisoners, 
and ten slightly wounded. In justice to both officers 
and men, I must inform your Excellency they be 
haved well, and wanted nothing but an opportunity 
to have done honor to the State they belong to. 
Their expectations were great, and their spirits high. 
I was astonished that the enemy had not collected 
and formed upon some advantageous ground. This 
I expected would have been the case, and proceeded 
with caution. They came down in a body to play 
the old game upon our rear. This I expected, and 
was sufficiently prepared for, having thrown up a 
small work at Halstead s Point, and placed two fieldpieces in it, from which we kept up a brisk fire, and 
soon dispersed them. 
After remaining on the Island eight hours, and 
driving them within their works, we made an easy 
and secure retreat, not having lost a single man, 
horse, or boat. By a flag, just come over, I am in 
formed they say, in excuse for their gallant beha 
viour, that we were joined by two thousand Con 
tinental troops. Had it not been strong tide of 
flood, by which means they might have been easily 
reenforced from New York, as General Putnam only 
intended a feint there, and their having two gondolas, 
and an armed sloop lying in the Sound, I should have 
remained in possession of the Island for the day. 
Those considerations, and the troops being much fa 
tigued, as the night was very cold, and they obliged 
to march through much water, determined me to re 
turn, which reasons, I hope, will meet with your Ex 
cellency s approbation. 

I proposed to the Governor to march most of the 
men from this post to the southern part of this State, 
to serve out the remainder of their time, (indeed, the 
whole force should have marched long ago, but the 
Council would not consent). If I am not forbid, I 
shall take the liberty of sending on six hundred of 
the best troops early to-morrow morning, which detachment I shall accompany. The weather is very 
bad, but I hope it will clear up this evening. 

My indisposition, being much fatigued and very 
wet in crossing the river, prevented my giving yourExcellency the above information earlier. 

A fleet, consisting of twenty-five sail, is just arrived 
at the Narrows, said to come from England, and to 
have brought over some of the new raised Irish regi 
ments. I have the honor to be, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

PHILEMON DICKINSON. 
FROM GOVERNOR HENRY. 

Williamsburg, 6 December, 1777. 

SIR, 

Inclosed I have the honor to transmit you an ac 
count of necessaries sent off in nine wagons, for the 
Virginia regiments in Continental service. The goods 

& o o 

have been delivered to Colonel Finnic, the Quarter 
master, and he has put them under the escort of 
Lieutenant Mennis and a party of soldiers, who, I 
trust, will deliver them safely. It is my wish that 
the troops of Virginia shall have them. I also send 
a list of some other articles, chiefly linens, that will 
shortly set out from our public store, for the same 
uses. 

Added to this supply, fifteen thousand pounds 
worth of woollens, &c., proper for the soldiers, will 
set out from Petersburg in a few days. These last 
are procured under an act of Assembly, empowering 
me to seize necessaries for our troops wherever they 
may be found. I have given orders, in consequence. 
to proper persons in different parts of the State, which 
I expect will produce many necessaries, if not enough 
for the Virginia troops". Orders are sent to both Carolinas for blankets, particularly, and soldiers clothes ; 
and nothing, possible for me to effect, will be left undone, in getting whatever the troops are in want of. 

I should be more particular, as to the goods seized, 
but the Commissioners have as yet sent me no distinct account of their proceedings. If it happens that 
the wants of your army are supplied in any short 
time, I beg to know it, that the execution of the 
present law for seizing goods may be stopped. 

I take the liberty to send, under cover to yourExcellency, two letters from France, to the Marquis cle 
la Fayette. One of them is from his lady, I believe. 
I beg to be presented to him in the most acceptable 
manner. I greatly revere his person and amiable 
character. 

The lenity of your publications respecting deserters 
is very apparent. But, nevertheless, a great many of 
them are yet skulking on the Eastern Shore, and 
really I think their case peculiar. Their officers took 
up the general opinion, that their service would be 
confined to that shore, and promised them to remain 
there. Their desertion followed upon orders to march 
away. I beg leave to observe, that, if your Excel 
lency would offer them a pardon upon their enlist 
ment to serve this State, it would forward the general service by enabling us to spare so many more 
troops for the Grand Army. I beg leave to assure 
you of the highest esteem and regard, with which I 
have the honor to be, Sir, your Excellency s 
Most obedient, and very humble servant, 

PATRICK HENRY. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL PULASKI.* 

[December, 1777.] 

SIR, 

I make no doubt but your Excellency is acquainted with the present ineffective state of the cavalry. 
In this situation it cannot be appropriated to any 

* Count Pulaski was appointed by Congress a Brigadier-General in the 
service of the United States, on the 15th of September, upon the re 
commendation of General Washington, and assigned to the command of 
the cavalry. This branch of the army had hitherto been very imper 
fectly organized. See Sparks s Life of Count Pulaski, in the Library 
of American Biography, Vol. XIV. p. 416. 

5* 
other service than that of orderlies, or reconnoitring 
the enemy s lines, which your Excellency must be 
persuaded is not the only service expected from a 
corps, which, when on a proper footing, is so very 
formidable. Although it is the opinion of many, that, 
from the construction of the country, the cavalry can 
not act to advantage, your Excellency must be too 
well acquainted with the many instances wherein the 
cavalry have been decisively serviceable, to be of this 
opinion, and not acknowledge that this corps has more 
than once completed victories. To this end I would 
wish to discipline the cavalry ; and I flatter myself by 
next campaign to render it essentially serviceable. 

What has greatly contributed to the present w r eak 
state of the cavalry was, the frequent detachments 
ordered to the suite of general and other officers, 
while a Colonel commanded, which w r ere appropriated 
to every use, and the horses drove at the discretion 
of the dragoons. 

The confidence, with which the Congress and yourExcellency have honored me, is a sure guaranty to 
the zeal I shall ever act with, in the service of the 
United States. But, notwithstanding my great desire 
of rendering the cavalry as useful as its first institu 
tion intended, I find it impracticable, seeing it is deficient in its principal requisitions ; my reflections on 
which, I have judged necessary to communicate to 
your Excellency, as a proof of my attachment to the 
good of the service, and desire of executing yourExcellency s designs ; hoping for an opportunity of 
deserving the favor conferred on me by your Ex 
cellency. 

ARTICLE I. It is absolutely necessary, that the ca 
valry have a Master of Exercise, who should instruct 
the commissioned and non-commissioned officers in the 
rules of service, as, having the command,, I am obliged 
to act with precaution; but this officer, actuated by 
different motives, would remove the bad habits and 
correct the defects of the superior officers. There is 
an officer now in this country, whose name is Kowacz. 
I know him to have served with reputation in the 
Prussian service, and assure your Excellency that he 
is every way equal to this undertaking. 

II. That twenty-four dragoons be drafted from the 
different regiments to form a separate corps, w r ho shall 
be taught the use of the pike or lance, of which two 
or three days will render them masters. For this purpose I must have chosen men. 

III. A Quartermaster-General to the cavalry is es 
sentially necessary to procure winter-quarters, stables, 
and provender, also to provide arms, accoutrements, 
and clothing. An intelligent officer, acquainted with 
the cavalry, should be chosen for this purpose. I 
would recommend to your Excellency, Major Blackden, of Colonel Sheldon s regiment, a gentleman who 
has displayed his knowledge in the equipment of said 
regiment, and whom I think sufficiently qualified to 
merit this trust. 

IV. It is full time the Quartermaster-General was 
sent to the place assigned for winter-quarters, in or 
der to provide magazines, that the cavalry may be 
kept embodied and conveniently exercised and disciplined. The horse service has ever been respected. 
One third of the cavalry is generally on duty, often 
the whole. When it returns to camp, it should draw 
provision, and cook it agreeably to orders ; but their 
full allowance is seldom granted. This I know by 
experience, being the worst served of any General in 
the service. To prevent this evil, a Commissary should 
be appointed to the cavalry. The cavalry in an army 
generally forms a separate division, and has greater 
privileges than the infantry, which the honor of the 
service exacts ; but here I find it is the contrary. Not 
that I aim at a superiority over the rest of the army, 
but am desirous of having justice done the corps I 
command. It is my duty. For my own part I wish to 
be subject to your Excellency s order only, agreeably 
to my request upon entering the service, which is 
the limit of my ambition. 

PULASKI. 



FROM JOSEPH GALLOAVAY. 

Philadelphia, 18 December, 1777. 

SIR, 

Apprehending that the business of war by no means 
excludes the feelings of humanity, and relying on 
that candor and liberality of sentiment, which those 
who are best acquainted with your Excellency agreeyou possess, I have presumed to request the favor 
of your permitting Mrs. Galloway, with her household 
furniture and effects, to remove from my seat in the 
country to Philadelphia. Could I imagine that a con 
test, of such magnitude and importance as the present 
between Great Britain and America, is to be decided 
by, or in any degree depended on, a matter of so 
trivial comparative consequence as that of obliging 
me in the gratification of my desire, I should imme 
diately perceive the impropriety, and not give you 
the trouble of this request. 

This will be conveyed by a flag, obtained under 
the favor of his Excellency Sir William Howe. I am, 
Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

JOSEPH GALLOWAY. 
FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL PULASKI. 

19 December, 1777. 

SIR, 

In my preceding representations, I have been particular respecting the present state of the cavalry, 
and the means by which it may be augmented and 
completed ; but, on this head, I must necessarily know 
your Excellency s determination. The advantages that 
would arise from a superiority in cavalry are too ob 
vious to be unnoticed. It may be further observed 
that, during this war, the country will daily become 
more open and clear of woods and fences, and conse 
quently better adapted to the manoeuvres and service 
of the cavalry. 

While we are superior in cavalry, the enemy will 
not dare to extend their force, and, notwithstanding 
we act on the defensive, we shall have many opportunities of attacking and destroying the enemy by 
degrees ; whereas, if they have it in their power to 
augment their cavalry, and we suffer ours to diminish 
and dwindle away, it may happen that the loss of a 
battle will terminate in our total defeat. Our army, 
once dispersed and pursued by their horse, will never 
be able to rally. Thus our retreat may early be cut 
off, our baggage lost, our principal officers taken, and 
many other events occur not less fatal. 

Your Excellency must De too much occupied to 
take cognizance of the detail of every department, 
A workman requires proper tools to carry on his 
business, and, if he does not use them in their place, 
he cannot be perfect. Your Excellency is undoubtedly acquainted with yours ; therefore a person, possessing your confidence, and properly authorized, is 
essentially necessary to answer decisively such proposals as I have made in my late representations re 
specting the cavalry. 

I must not omit to mention, here, the dissatisfaction 
you have expressed at my seeming inattention to 
your orders. Your Excellency may be assured, that 
the good of the service is my constant study, but the 
weak state of the corps I command, renders it impossible to perform every service required ; nay, my re 
putation is exposed, as, being an entire stranger in 
the country, the least accident would suffice to injure 
me ; but, notwithstanding, I cannot avoid hazarding 
every thing that is valuable in life. 

PULASKI. 



FROM GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Pouglikecpsic, 20 December, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

I was not honored with the receipt of your Excel 
lency s letter of the 3d instant, before Friday last. I 
am truly sensible that the security of the North 
River is a matter of the utmost importance to the 
United States in the present war, and that the safety 
of this State in a more particular manner depends 
upon it. It gives me real concern, therefore, that so 
little has been yet done to effect it. Works we laid 
out, and began, to defend the chevaux-de-frise, and 
something was done towards finishing and sinking 
such of them as were not completed when the enemy 
came up the river; and these are the only steps that 
have hitherto been taken. 

When the enemy left the river, it was my opinion 
that as many of the troops from the Northern De 
partment should be sent to reenforce the Grand Army 
under your Excellency s more immediate command, as 
could be possibly spared ; that no greater number 
should be left in this quarter than what would be 
barely sufficient to cover the country, which is more 
immediately exposed to the ravages of the enemy ; to 
amuse them from sending large reinforcements to 
General Howe ; and to carry on the necessary works 
for the security of the river. One brigade of Continental troops, with the militia then in service, and 
such of this State as I should be able to call out, I 
conceived fully sufficient for the purposes. Two small 
New Hampshire militia regiments, which were sent 
down from the northward by General Gates, about 
seventy Connecticut militia, and those of Colonel Dubois s, who escaped from Fort Montgomery, and a 
regiment of militia of this State, were assigned for 
the works. The rest of the troops, consisting of 
General Warner s brigade of militia (which arrived 
earliest), General Parsons s brigade, and some Con 
necticut militia, were drawn off to King s Street and 
the adjacent neighbourhood on the Sound, under the 
immediate command of General Putnam. 

It was late before the militia from the northward 
arrived, and they were worn out with the fatigues of 
the campaign and their long march hither. The time 
for which they were engaged in the service expired 
the 1st of this month, and of those of this State the 
15th; and while they were with us, the want of tools 
and materials was such as to prevent their being em 
ployed to any degree of advantage. Dubois s regi 
ment are the only troops on the spot at present, 
which are by no means sufficient to mount the necessary guards. Of course the works are entirely 
neglected. 

The resolutions of Congress, of the 5th of Novem 
ber, for regaining the forts and passes on Hudson s 
lliver, and securing the communication thereof, vested 
General Gates with such ample powers for drawing 
supplies of men and materials from New Jersey, and 
the different States eastward, that something essential 
might yet have been done towards the completion of 
this important business before the opening of the 
spring, would he have taken upon himself the direc 
tion of it. But, as I understand that gentleman pro 
poses taking his seat at the Board of War, agreeably 
to his late appointment, those resolutions, as they apply to him particularly, will lose their intended effect ; 
and, though I learn by a letter I received from General Putnam, accompanying that from your Excellency, 
that he is directed to turn his views in future to this 
object, yet, however capable he may be for the task, 
I fear he will fall short in the execution of it, unless 
he shall be able to command the same aids, at least, 
which General Gates was empowered to do. 

I am clearly of the opinion, that a strong fortress 
ought to be erected either on the opposite side of 
the creek from where Fort Montgomery stood, or 
at West Point, opposite Port Constitution. The lat 
ter I prefer, as the most defensible ground, and be 
cause the navigation of the river there is more difficult and uncertain, and the river something narrower 
than it is at the former place. A new chain should 
be procured, if possible, and with the boom, which is 
nearly completed, stretched across the river. This, 
with a floating battery or two, and some gun-boats, 
I am persuaded, would answer the purpose effectually; 
and in this 6 pinion I am confirmed, as the enemy 
chose to risk every thing for the reduction of Fort 
Montgomery, rather than to attempt passing it with 
their shipping, while in our possession. If West Point 
should be the place fixed upon, it might be of 
great advantage to erect a small strong work on the 
high point on the opposite shore, a little above Fort 
Constitution. 

As to the management in this department, of which 
your Excellency desires my sentiments, I am con 
strained to say (but I wish it may be considered as in 
confidence) we have either been very unfortunate, or 
it has not been as wise as might be wished. Prudent 
management of our small force, in my humble opinion, would have saved the forts, though, perhaps, 
with the far less important loss of the Continental 
Village. By losing the forts, the Village fell, of course. 
It is true a few stores were moved from thence, and 
saved, but I dare say not of equal value with those 
lost at the forts, exclusive of the shipping. Besides, 
had we held the forts, we should have commanded 
the navigation of the river, and drove the enemy to 
the necessity of attempting to relieve Burgoyne (for 
it is evident that this was their intention) by land, 
in which case it might have been in our power, by 
calling the militia to our assistance, to have destroyed 
Clinton s whole army. Indeed, without opposition they 
could not have effected a march in season for the in 
tended purpose, and I am confident they never would 
have attempted it. 

I never considered Peekskill, or the Village, posts 
of great importance, only as they stood connected 
with the defences of the river ; for, without the latter, 
the enemy could, by landing above, come in the rearof the former, in which case they must fall, of course. 
The event has fully proved this. Notwithstanding, 
the chief part of this department were kept idle at 
Peekskill and the Village, while the forts were left 
without a sufficient number of men to carry on and 
complete the works, or defend them. If the shipping 

VOL. II. 6 
had been properly manned, and this was often soli 
cited,, the Congress, at least, might have been saved ; 
and even after the loss of the forts, by a prudent 
disposition of the force in this quarter, which was 
soon greatly increased by the coming in of the militia, Kingston might have been saved, and the greater 
part of the mischief, committed by the enemy along 
the shores of the river, prevented. 

A constant intercourse, which has been permitted 
between the country and city, by flags, has, I fear, 
been very injurious, as well by frequently enabling 
the enemy to learn our strength, as otherwise, without 
our being able to derive similar advantages from such 
correspondence. I have heard that there has been a 
weekly exchange of newspapers with Governor Tryon, 
and that the printers, Gaine and London, are permit 
ted the like liberty. The latter I have no doubt of. 
An over share of complaisance and indulgence to the 
disaffected, (which, though arising from principles of 
benevolence and humanity, will always create jea 
lousies and unfavorable suspicions, especially among 
the common people, and often even reach the army,) 
should, therefore, be carefully avoided. In these re 
spects, I cannot help thinking there has been a want 
of common prudence. I have taken the liberty of 
hinting my sentiments of these matters to General 
Putnam, and I would fain hope that there may be 
more circumspection used in future. 

The Legislature of this State is to meet at this 
place on the 5th of next month. The variety of important business to be prepared for their considera 
tion, and other affairs of government, will employ so 
great a part of my time, that I should not be able 
to give that attention to the works for the security 
of the river, as their importance, and the short time 
in which they ought to be completed, require. But 
you may rest assured, Sir, that every leisure hourshall be faithfully devoted to them, and my advice 
and assistance shall not, for any consideration, be 
withheld from the person who shall be intrusted with 
the chief direction of them. I have the honor to be, 
with the most sincere esteem and respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

GEORGE CLINTON. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SULLIVAN. 

Camp, [Valley Forge], 26 December, 1777. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

Agreeably to your Excellency s directions, I have 
consulted some of the General Officers who I thought 
most capable of advising upon the proper steps to 
take in our present circumstances. They say that 
they can by no means advise for or against an attack. 
They are fully convinced that General Howe has his 
whole force with him ; that, if your Excellency thinks 
your force sufficient to cope with his, they are wil 
ling to risk their lives and fortunes with you in the 
attempt. They say, further, that General Howe is 
possessed of very strong grounds at present, and, even 
if he w r as not, he would have sufficient time to post 
himself strongly before you could reach him, as yourarmy must have a march of two days before they 
could come to action. They think if an attack is 
made on his left with success, he can retreat with 
ease ; if on his right, he must be ruined ; but, should 
you fail in the latter, your army must be pushed into 
the Schuylkill. 

They, upon the whole, think that the attempt will 
be exceeding hazardous, and the success doubtful ; 
that, if you fail, the people who are now so fond of 
censuring, will change their clamor, and censure you 
for not attacking him when he was within a mile 
of you, and your army more numerous and in better 
condition than at present. They say they are freefor attacking him, if he, by his advances this way, 
shows an intention of attacking us ; but cannot ad 
vise to marching the army to attack him where he 
now is, unless your Excellency is fully convinced of 
your superiority in numbers. 

These are the sentiments of the gentlemen whom I 
have consulted, and, though I think they have much 
weight, I am so weary of the infernal clamor of the 
Pennsylvanians, that I am for satisfying them at all 
events, and risking every consequence in an action. 
Possibly we may be successful; if not, they may be 
satisfied, and even Congress itself may gain expe 
rience, and learn to censure with more caution. Pos 
sibly a defeat may have this good effect, and a vic 
tory will bring with it its own reward. I am, there 
fore, clearly for risking every consequence in an ac 
tion, and, among others, most cheerfully, the life and 
fortune of 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant. 

JOHN SULLIVAN. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL PULASKI. 

Trenton, 9 January, 1778. 

SIR, 

I arrived here yesterday with the cavalry, where I 
expected to have found forage sufficient to subsist the 
cavalry, at least for a few days. My Brigade Foragemaster had been informed, by Colonel Biddle, that such 
provision was made, and that he would have nothing 
more to do than issue the same ; but, so far to the 
contrary, there was not a load of hay in town. With 
the greatest difficulty we have "been enabled to put 
our heads under cover. I applied to the civil magis 
trates for directions relative to the forming a maga 
zine. In the mean while, the horses must subsist. I 
am, therefore, obliged to divide them into several 
squads, and send them out about two miles in the 
rear of the town, until the necessary provision, both 
for forage and quarters, can be made. 

It will be impossible for me to quarter the cavalry 
in this place, unless the galley-men are removed ; but 
they say they have an order from the Governor and 
Council to remain here ; and, having prior possession, 
think they are entitled to hold it. I wait your Ex 
cellency s positive order in what manner to proceed; 
and if, in this case, I must execute my first orders, 
it will be necessary that the galley-men should re 
ceive orders to evacuate the town. I have the honor 
to assure your Excellency that the cavalry is in want 
of every article. It must be exercised and taught 
the service, from the Colonel to the private. Colonel 
Kowacz is a man of great merit, and deserves the 
charge of Master of Exercise. He is an officer worthy 
of research ; and, exclusive of a thorough knowledge 
of his abilities, I request his being employed by yourExcellency. I can recommend, and assure your Ex 
cellency will never have reason to repent your confi 
dence in him. If this proposal should be agreeable 
to your Excellency, the sooner I am informed the 
better, as he will be of infinite service to the cavalry 
this winter in quarters. 

I have met with an armourer, who lives at Easton. 
He undertakes to furnish me with pikes, pistols, car6* 



66 LETTEKS TO WASHINGTON. 

bines, &c. If your Excellency approves of him, the 
Quartermaster-General will take your orders on that 
head. 

There are some excellent horses in this country ; 
and; as Colonel Luterloh has received orders to press 
all horses fit for the service, he may procure a num 
ber here ; but this must not be delayed, as I ani in 
formed many persons buy them for the use of the 
enemy. I am, with respect, your Excellency s 

Very humble, and obedient servant, 

PULASKI. 



FROM ELBRIDGE GERRY.* 

York, 13 January, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have waited some time in expectation of informing you with the sense of Congress on the several 
subjects mentioned in your agreeable favor of the 
25th December, but am not yet fully able to answer 
my purpose. 

A Committee is appointed from Congress and the 
Board of War, who, in Concert with your Excellency, 
have full powers to form and execute a plan for re 
ducing the number of battalions now in the service ; 
to recommend the necessary appointments of General 
Officers ; to determine on the necessary reinforcements 
for the cavalry, artillery, and infantry, and report 
their opinions on the best mode of obtaining the same ; 
to remove from office any officers of the civil depart 
ments of the army for negligence, incompetency, or 
fraud, and appoint others until the sense of Congress 
can be known; to report the necessary alterations to 



* A Delegate in Congress from Massachusetts. 
be made in the regulations of these departments ; to 
remove all just causes of complaint relative to rank, 
confining it, as nearly as may be, to the military 
line ; and for other purposes mentioned in their commission. The members are, Messrs. Folsom, Dana, 
General Reed, and Harvey, from Congress, and Generals Gates and Mifflin, and Colonel Pickering, from 
the Board of War. I sincerely wish that despatch 
may be made in this business, and that the first 
thing may be to consider of the necessary reinforce 
ments, that measures may be immediately pursued to 
obtain them. The mentioning of this is, however, unnecessary to your Excellency. 

The Resolutions for allowing, hereafter, to officers, 
the cost of their retained rations, and for enabling 
your Excellency to increase the number of your Aids, 
I find, by your letters to Congress, are at hand. And 
the proposals of allowing to the officers, who shall 
continue in the service to the end of the war, and 
whose regiments shall then be reduced, half pay for 
a limited time; of enabling officers, after the war, 
to sell their commissions, under proper regulations ; 
and of giving to the widows of such officers as shall 
lose their lives in the service, pensions while they re 
main in a state of widowhood, are now before Con 
gress. The first has been largely debated, and I am 
apprehensive that it will meet with a negative. There 
are many weighty arguments against it, such as the 
infant state of the country, its aversion to placemen 
and pensioners, whereby Great Britain is likely to 
lose her liberty, the equality of the officers and sol 
diers of some States, before the war, and the bad 
effect that such provision would have on the minds 
of the latter. But I must confess that none of these 
weigh so much in my mind as the necessity of making a commission so valuable that a dismission will 
not only be disgraceful to an officer, but injurious 
to his interest. This will introduce that subordina 
tion to civil authority which is necessary to produce 
an internal security to liberty, and to the high officers of the military department such authority as to 
enable them to establish discipline, without which an 
army can be neither vigorous nor successful. 

Colonel Wilkinson is appointed Secretary to the 
Board of War, which I hope he will accept, that the 
just causes of complaint arising from his hasty pro 
motion may be removed. Should he refuse, I think 
Congress will be justified in taking effectual measures 
to remedy the evils resulting therefrom. 

General Heath is directed to procure and send to 
your Excellency one thousand bell tents, to prevent, 
in future, the danger arising from heavy rains at the 
critical moment of an engagement with the enemy. 
Is it not necessary that measures should be taken by 
Congress, or your Excellency, for further providing 
against this evil, by appropriating a drummer, fifer, 
or some other officer in each company, to carry a 
bell tent for the same, in times of action, when the 
baggage-w r agons are ordered to leave the army, that, 
whether advancing or retreating, the soldiers may 
never be in danger of having their muskets and 
ammunition rendered useless from the want of this article ? I remain, Sir, in haste, but with much esteem 
and respect, 

Your Excellency s very humble servant, 

ELBRIDGE GERRY.


FROM THOMAS WHARTOX. 

In Council, Lancaster, 15 January, 1778. 

SIR, 

The inclosed recommendation of the Honorable 
House of General Assembly of this State, founded on 
a recommendation of Congress, has been repeatedly 
under consideration. As we are persuaded that, how 
ever it may be in other States, we cannot reasonably 
expect, in this State, where property is in general 
very equally divided, that farmers will exert them 
selves to enlist their neighbours children in the service, or even the laborers, whom they feel them 
selves in great want of, the Council can devise no 
means by which we can hope so effectually and expeditiously to raise our quota of troops, as by the 
officers of the battalions. If this measure shall meet 
your Excellency s approbation, we request, that you 

" Business for some time past has not been despatched in Congress with 
that degree of celerity, nor, possibly, in some instances, accuracy, which 
the peculiar exigency of these infant States demands ; not owing to 
negligence and inattention of the few members, who now faithfully devote 
their time, and drudge in the service of their country, but to a deficiency 
of numbers necessary for the discharge of the very important matters 
which every new day brings forth. There are, at present, no more than 
twenty-one members on the floor. Of these, three are ordered on a 
Committee to General Washington s camp, and one to visit the hospitals ; 
and, of late, from some unaccountable delinquencies, Congress, in order 
to guard against a total dispersion of the army, have been obliged to act 
personally, by several of its members, Quartermaster-General, ClothierGeneral, Commissary-General, and, as your Excellency will conclude from 
the intimation just now dropped, Director of Hospitals; and I might, with 
strict propriety, add two or three et cceteras. 

" I have taken the liberty of being so full on this head, in order to 
show your Excellency the necessity for hastening a more ample representation from the State of New York, as well as to apologize for any 
unavoidable delay on the part of Congress ; and I have been urged more 
particularly to do so, from a hint which Mr. Lewis gave me this evening, of his intention to leave us in a few days." 
will please to select two out of each for this purpose, and give them orders to repair to the several 
counties, as soon as may be, on this important service. 

A sum of money will be deposited in the hands 
of the County Lieutenant, or other suitable person, to 
pay the bounty of one hundred dollars ordered by the 
Assembly, over and beside the bounty given by Con 
gress, to each able-bodied recruit, who shall enter any 
of the battalions belonging to the quota of this State, 
for three years, or during the war. The words of 
the recommendation are, of the "twelve battalions," 
but we understand it to have been intended to all the 
battalions. 

The Council had, some time since, set on foot a 
collection of coarse woollens, blankets, shoes, &c., to 
be sent in the common fund in the hands of the 
Clothier-General. Very lately, Congress, departing 
from their former system, resolved that each State 
do endeavour to supply the present necessities of its 
troops. Agreeably to this, the Council immediately 
proceeded to bring a large quantity of woollens, 
which was concealed or neglected in Buck s county, 
to the supply of the distressed soldiers. The tailors 
have made considerable progress in making them up. 
They calculate that they will produce near one thou 
sand coats and waistcoats for privates, and a .few 
breeches. These goods seem not so fit for officers, 
except some surtouts would be thought acceptable. 
Your Excellency s direction concerning the distribution 
will be useful, as the Council are satisfied that you 
wish the most pressing necessity to be first relieved. 

The Assembly, in the exigence of our army at this 
inclement season, have gone into the most vigorous 
mode of relief, but a mode that cannot be continued 
nor renewed, consistent with trade and manufacture. 
They have invested two Commissioners, in each county, 
with power to seize and take all necessaries suitable 
to the purpose, in whatever hands they may be 
found ; and they have appointed Colonel Francis 
Johnston to receive and distribute the clothing as 
ordered by the Council. By this means it may be 
expected that great additions may be made to the 
clothing already made up and making. 

The officers, whose wants it is believed are very 
pressing, will be in some measure relieved ; but it 
cannot be expected that powers, of this extraordinary 
nature, can be exerted to procure any other goods 
than warmth and decency require. Lieutenant Peter 
son, of the eighth Pennsylvania battalion, applied to 
the Council for clothing for himself and several officers. At the foot hereof we transcribe, from his application, a specimen of their wants. 

The call upon the State was thought to be for 
covering for the naked part of the army ; and as no 
idea that fine ruffled shirts, laced hats, or even fineones of beaver, silken stockings, or fine scarlet cloth, 
came under this description, no provision for these 
has been made, nor can be expected. Your Excel 
lency can best judge whether any precaution may be 
necessary to prevent such officers, as intend shortly 
to resign, from obtaining a supply of the clothing 
expected to be delivered out. 

I have the honor to be, &c., 

THOMAS WHARTON, JR. 
FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL GLOVER. 

Cambridge, 27 January, 1778. 

SIR, 

I received your Excellency s letter yesterday, of 
the Stli instant, desiring me to join my brigade as 
soon as possible. 

I apprehend your Excellency has not been fully 
acquainted with the business I was charged with by 
General Gates, which has been, and still will be, at 
tended with so many difficulties, as will necessarily 
detain me at this post till the embarkation of General Burgoyne. 

I was honored with the command of conducting 
him and his troops from Saratoga to Cambridge, for 
the better supplying of whom, and the conveniency 
of the inhabitants of the country through which they 
marched, I divided them into two divisions ; the British, by Williamstown and Northampton ; the Germans, 
by Kinderhook and Springfield with Commissaries, 
Quarter-masters, and Wagon-masters for each, with 
particular directions to take bills for what supplies 
they received, and give orders on me for payment. 
This order not being fully attended to, I was obliged 
to send Quarter-master Story back to Albany to col 
lect the outstanding accounts. When that is done, I 
shall charge General Burgoyne with the whole, in onegeneral account ; and as many of the charges, in my 
opinion, are unjust, and others extravagantly high, 
large sums being charged by the inhabitants for da 
mages in burning fences, destroying hay, grain, flax, 
&c.. also for clothing, furniture, &c., stolen out of their 
houses (these charges I know General Burgoyne will 
object to), the inhabitants look to me, and expect I 
shall see them paid. 
To acquit myself of censure, I am determined to 
lay them before the General Court, and desire that 
a Committee may be appointed to examine them, 
and make what deductions shall appear to them to 
be just, which I hope will give satisfaction to both 
parties. When this is done, I have to present it to 
him for payment, and then advertise the inhabitants 
to come and receive their moneys. I shall lose no 
time in bringing the whole to a close as soon as 
possible. 

Thus, Sir, I have given an account of what I have 
been doing, and still have to do, at this post, which 
I hope will meet your Excellency s approbation. 

I know of no detachments from my brigade left at 
any post. I shall advertise and order on all officers 
and soldiers who are absent with or without furloughs, 
as well as those recovered in hospitals. In the mean 
time, I beg leave to observe to your Excellency, that 
I have given three years service to my country, in 
which I have ruined my constitution, and so much 
impaired my health, that I am by no means fit or 
able to serve her in the field another campaign. 
These reasons, I hope, will have such weight with 
your Excellency as to recommend and urge to Con 
gress in favor of my dismission, without offering ano 
ther, which is notorious to the world ; and which is, 
that the pay is so small, under the present establish 
ment, compared with the enormous high price of 
clothing and the necessaries of life, that no officercan support himself in camp. That being the case, 
what must become of his family ? This is a matter 
of general complaint, which, I hope, will be redressed, 
or I fear the consequences. 

Yesterday, arrived in Marblehead a ship of fourhundred tons burden. She sailed from Halifax with 
VOL. n. 7 
two hundred and eighty-two prisoners, under convoy 
of a ship of war bound for Rhode Island. She parted 
from the ship in a gale of wind, when the prisoners 
took charge of her, and brought her in safely. 

The same day arrived a prize ship, mounting twenty 
nine-pounders, taken by the ship Portsmouth, laden 
with wines and English goods, bound to York. I 
am, Sir, with great truth and esteem, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

JOHN GLOVER. 



FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Flemington, 9 February, 1778. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I cannot let go my guide without taking this op 
portunity of writing to your Excellency, though I 
have not yet public business to speak of. I go on 
very slow r ly; sometimes drenched by rain,, sometimes 
covered by snow, and not entertaining many hand 
some thoughts about the projected incursion into Ca 
nada, If successes were to be had, it would surprise 
me in a most agreeable manner, by that very reason 
that I do not expect any shining ones. Lake Champlain is too cold for producing the least bit of laurel, 
and, if I am not starved, I shall be as proud as if I 
had gained three battles. 

Mr. Ducr had given to me a rendezvous at a ta 
vern, but nobody was to be found there. I fancy 
that he will be with Mr. Conway sooner than he has 
told me. They will perhaps conquer Canada before 
my arrival, and I expect to meet them at the Go 
vernor s house in Quebec. 

Could I believe, for one single instant, that this 
pompous command of a Northern army will let yourExcellency forget a little us absent friends, then I 
would send the project to the place it comes from. 
But I dare hope that you will remember me some 
times. I wish you, very heartily, the greatest public 
and private happiness and successes. It is a very 
melancholy idea for me, that I cannot follow yourfortunes as near your person as I could wish ; but 
my heart will take, very sincerely, its part of every 
thing which can happen to you; and I am already 
thinking of the agreeable moment when I may come 
down to assure your Excellency of the most tender 
affection and highest respect. I have the honor to 
be, &c. 

LAFAYETTE. 



FROM GOVERNOR LIVINGSTON. 

Trenton, 16 February, 1778. 

SIR, 

I have received your Excellency s favor of the 14th 
instant, this day, and that of the 4th, a few days 
since. 

It would give me pleasure to consent to let threetroops of Jersey horse enter into the Continental service till the opening of the next campaign, as it 
would not only give me an opportunity of obliging 
your Excellency, but would be of service to the troops 
in acquiring skill and experience, which they would 
afterwards introduce into our other squadrons. But, 
from our present situation, I think we could not spare 
more than one. 

With your request of the 14th I shall comply, as 
far as possible, and endeavour to procure, to-morrow, 
a resolution of both Houses to authorize the President and Council of Safety to impress wagons for a 
limited time. But these,, Sir, are very temporary ex 
pedients. It is impossible for this State to cure the 
blunders of those whose business it is to provide the 
army ; and, considering what New Jersey has suffered 
by the war, I am pretty certain it cannot hold out 
another year, if the rest will not furnish their pro 
portionable share of provisions ; and, for my own part, 
though I would rather spend the remainder of niy 
days in a wigwam at Lake Erie, than be the most 
splendid vassal of any arbitrary prince on earth, I 
am so discouraged by our public mismanagement, and 
the additional load of business thrown upon me by 
the villany of those who pursue nothing but accu 
mulating fortunes to the ruin of their country, that I 
almost sink under it. I do not say this, Sir, to discourage you from applying to me at any time for 
any thing that is in my power to do, assuring you 
that it always gives me particular pleasure to contri 
bute in the least to alleviate that burden of yours, to 
which mine does not deserve to be compared. 

I shall pursue the plan, pointed out by the Com 
mittee of Congress, for procuring horses. I am, with 
the greatest esteem, 

Your Excellency s most humble servant, 

WILLIAM LIVINGSTON. 



FROM CAPTAIN HENRY LEE. 

Dover, 21 February, 1778. 

This country does not answer our expectation with 
respect to wagons. Consequently, the conveyance of 
the salt provision, &c., collected at this place, will 
not be so expeditious as could be wished. A drove 
of cattle, from seventy to a hundred head, will set 
out to-morrow from Middletown. JWe_do_ business very 
regularly, visiting, in our route, each and every farm, 
and taking with^jus every article necessary for ourarmy. Very little discontent prevails among the in 
habitants, and that only from among the notoriously 
disaffected. This State is void of all government ; 
therefore we can meet with no aid from the civil. 
They have a form, but there is no spirit or energy. 
The situation of the country, the want of government, 
and the artifices of the friends to the British army, 
render these lower countries an asylum to deserters 
from the Continental army. Several officers are now 
here for the business of apprehending deserters, but, 
though very active, they meet with little success, be 
cause they have no aid from government. The As 
sembly is now convened at this place. The active 
and spirited members wish a letter to the House 
from your Excellency on this head. They think many 
good consequences would result from it. I am in 
formed that there cannot be less than hundred 
deserters, who live on the fruits of their labor in this 
country. Some men of power and influence encourage 
this abominable practice by their private countenance. 

Perhaps if your Excellency would address the Le 
gislature on the subject, and at the same time furnish me with directions and authority to apprehend 
and deliver to the Provost such persons as are noto 
riously guilty of this high crime against the interest 
of the States, great advantages might accrue to the 
army. I am convinced it would encourage the re 
cruiting service. 

I must again beg that your Excellency will order 
a proper person, with money to pay those persons 
with whom I must contract debts in the execution of 
7* 
my commission. I have promised the people that 
they shall be paid, and shall be much distressed if 
my promise is not fulfilled. I have the honor to be, 
with the most perfect respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

HENRY LEE. 



FROM GOVERNOR COOKE. 

Providence, 23 February, 1778. 

SIR, 

I have been favored with your Excellency s letter 
of the 3d instant, inclosing a proposal, made to you 
by General Varnum, for recruiting the two Continental battalions raised by the State. 

I laid the letter before the General Assembly, at 
their session on the second Monday in this month, 
who, considering the pressing necessity of filling up 
the Continental army, and the peculiarly difficult cir 
cumstances of this State, which rendered it in a man 
ner impossible to recruit our battalions in any other 
way, adopted the measure. Liberty is given to every 
effective slave to enter the service during the war; 
and, upon his passing muster, he is absolutely madefree, and entitled to all the wages, bounties, and 
encouragements, given by Congress to any soldier en 
listing into their service. The masters are allowed at 
the rate of one hundred and twenty pounds for the 
most valuable slave, and in proportion for those of 
less value. The number of slaves in this State is not 
great, but it is generally thought that three hundred 
and upwards will be enlisted. I am, with great re 
spect, Sir, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

NICHOLAS COOKE. 
FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SULLIVAN. 

Camp, Valley Forge, 2 March, 1778. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

Nothing can be more painful to me, than the repe 
tition of a request, which is known to be disagreeable to a Commander, to whom America in general, 
and myself in particular, stand so much indebted. 
After so polite a refusal as I have once had, I should 
have remained forever silent upon the subject, did 
not pure necessity, which knows no law, compel me 
to repeat my request. I sincerely lament my being 
compelled to discover my situation and my feelings, 
and hope that a long silence upon the subject will 
be looked upon by your Excellency rather as evi 
dence of patience, than as a mark of my having the 
gift of complaining without cause. I shall repeat 
facts. 

When Britain first began to send troops to Boston, 
I began, at great expense, to manoeuvre troops as well 
in the eastern part of Massachusetts as in our own 
State. This not only occasioned a loss of time, but 
the loss of money was inevitable. I then served the 
public part of two years in Congress. Between the 
sessions of Congress I undertook to dismantle the 
fort at Piscataway. The Continent have received and 
used the cannons, small arms, powder, &c., which were, 
at my expense, removed into the country, at the distance of a number of miles, for which I have never 
had the least reward, nor have I the least probability 
of it. Since I have been in the service I have been 
rather unfortunate. I have been robbed at Long Is 
land, New York, New Rochelle, and at Peekskill. The 
last of these losses I never suspected, till I was on 
my return from New England, and had arrived within 
a mile of the place. I lost, at those several times, ten 
suits of clothes complete, a large quantity of linens, 
all my camp equipage, a valuable military library, 
&c. &c. I have, notwithstanding, weathered out the 
campaign, but have neither clothes nor equipage to 
begin another, or money to purchase. I have lost 
three horses in the service, which I am not able to 
replace ; and though one of them was killed in action, 
and the others in different service, Congress will 
make no recompense. 

Under these circumstances, I have but two ways 
left. One is to quit the service entirely, and the 
other, to quit it for a season, to prepare myself for 
greater fatigue and losses. I need not mention to 
your Excellency how inadequate the eight 
allowed by Congress, is to the support of an officer; 
my first letter has hinted it ; I am sure your Excel 
lency can see the justice of the hint. I have men 
tioned two ways of relief for myself. My first letter 
has shown the necessity, as well as a letter I wrote 
to Colonel Harrison, from Princeton, in June last. 
Could I be permitted to have my choice, it would be 
the former, as I have suffered too much and received 
too little for the fatigue I have endured. If this 
can be procured without trouble to your Excellency, 
and without my incurring your Excellency s censure, 
it will much oblige, dear General, him that is, with 
every sentiment of gratitude and respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

JOHN SULLIVAN. 


FROM THE REVEREND TIMOTHY D WIGHT.* 

8 March, 1778. 
MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 

The application, which is the subject of this letter, 
is, I believe, not common in the American regions; 
yet I cannot but hope it will not, on that account, be 
deemed impertinent or presumptive. For several years 
I have been employed in writing a poem, on the Con 
quest of Canaan, by Joshua. This poem, upon the first 
knowledge of your Excellency s character, I deter 
mined, with leave, to inscribe to you. If it will not 
be too great a favor, it will certainly be remembered 
with gratitude. 

I am not insensible that the subject of this request 
is delicate ; as consent on the part of your Excellency 
cannot possibly add to your reputation, and may be 
followed by consequences of a disagreeable nature. 
Of the merit or demerit of the work, your Excellency 
cannot form a guess, but from the character of the 
writer, with which you will be made acquainted by 
General Parsons, who does me the honor to inclose 
this in one from himself. All that I can say upon 
the subject (and I hope I may assert it with pro 
priety) is, that I am so independent a Republican, 
and so honest a man, as to be incapable of a wish 
to palm myself upon the world under the patronage 
of another, as to be remote from any sinister view 
in this application, and to disdain making the proffer, 
slight as it is, to the most splendid personage, for 



* At this time a Chaplain in General Parsons s brigade, at West Point.

whose character I have not a particular esteem. I 
am, with the greatest respect, your Excellency s 
Most obedient and most humble servant, 

TIMOTHY D WIGHT, JR. 



FROM THOMAS WIIA11TON. 

In Council, Lancaster, 10 March, 1778. 

SIR, 

In answer to your Excellency s letter of the 7th 
instant, I beg leave to inclose to you extracts of a 
letter to his Excellency the President of Congress, 
from this Council, and of a representation from the 
Council and the General Assembly to Congress, by 
which your Excellency will see that attention has 
been given to the supplying of the army with wa 
gons, and what is the opinion of the Council respecting the difficulties attending this business. 

There is not any State on this Continent which 
has been so oppressed with Continental business as 
this has been, from the beginning of the present con 
troversy to this hour. Its exertions have been so 
zealous and unremitting, that no time has been lost 
in inquiries after groundless charges of neglect madeagainst it, which have been generally calculated to 
excuse indolent or improvident officers, or to disgrace 
the government established in it. The amazingly 
difficult task, which your Excellency has to perform, 
while you are embarrassed with perpetual applications 
and complaints of officers, who are not fully acquainted with their duty, must too forcibly convince you 
how near to an impossibility it is to conduct very 
extensive business without the subordinate officers discharging, in some sort, their duty ; and it is from the 
example of your Excellency alone, that it is believed 
to be possible to conduct the affairs of a large army, 
under the difficulties which you have had to contend 
with. Equal abilities or success in attempts of this 
kind are not to be expected in many instances. And 
this Council must acknowledge that they are not 
equal to the task imposed on them, if it is under 
stood to be their duty to furnish every Deputy Quarter-master with four or five wagons, whenever they 
are wanted, and to give equal attention to every other 
department of the State and army. This, indeed, 
seems to be expected of them; for there is, at present, 
an absolute dependence on the Council to supply the 
common rations of the soldiery now in the borough. 
An earnest desire to serve the general cause, and a 
zealous attachment to its interest, are the only mo 
tives which could possibly induce the Council to undertake such business in any extremity. 

The unparalleled patience and magnanimity with 
which the army, under your Excellency s command, 
have endured the hardships attending their situation, 
unsupplied as they have been through an uncommonly 
severe winter, is an honor which posterity will con 
sider as more illustrious than could have been derived to them by a victory obtained by any sudden and 
vigorous exertion. The latter often depends on some 
circumstance trifling in itself, while the former is derived from a determined perseverance through the 
greatest difficulties, which virtue and a truly patriotic 
spirit only can inspire. 

I have the honor to be, &c., 

THOMAS WHARTON, JR. 
FROM GENERAL CADWALADER. 

Maryland, 12 March, 1778. 

DEAR SIR ; 

I should have troubled you with a few lines if any 
thing had occurred to me that might, in the least, 
tend to promote the service. You receive such a mul 
titude of letters, that I can hardly think myself ex 
cused in taking up so much of your time as to thank 
you for the civilities I received from you at camp. 

I shall be happy to hear that you have passed the 
winter undisturbed; and that you have been able to 
keep your army together. My fears about provisions 
and forage, I confess, still give me great pain. 

Recruiting in this and the next county below suc 
ceeds better than I expected. One half of the quota 
required of each county is, I am w r ell informed, madeup, and the remainder will soon be completed. The 
farmers are in great fear of a law to draft the mili 
tia; and they are exerting themselves to the utmost 
in assisting the recruiting officers. 

There is no person who more sincerely wishes suc 
cess to the cause of America than I do ; and I should 
have esteemed it an honor to have been continued in 
the command I had in Pennsylvania, if the Govern 
ment had been such a one as promised that freedom 
and happiness for which we are contending with 
Great Britain. I now no longer look upon myself as 
a resident of that State, and am at a loss to know 
what part I shall act in this. As soon as the cam 
paign opens, I shall endeavour to make myself useful 
in some way or other. 

The importance of Billingsport to us, if we should 
be able to act offensively, has not, I dare say, escaped 
your notice. But I am apprehensive the enemy know 



TPIE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 85 

too well its consequence to neglect to take possession 
of it before we dare to do it. Five or six hundred 
men might defend it against a storm ; but would it 
be possible to keep it till we could collect force 
enough to make an attempt by siege dangerous to 
Philadelphia? The possession of this post may re 
quire such a variety of movements, that it appears to 
me a very considerable number of boats will be necessary. 

Be pleased to present my compliments to Mrs. 
Washington. With the sincerest esteem and respect, 
I remain, 

Your most obedient, and very humble servant, 

JOHN CADWALADER. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LINCOLN. 

Hingham, 17 March, 1778. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

Would not an early attempt upon the city of New 
York, by part of the Continental troops and the 
eastern militia, be attended with great probability of 
success ? Indeed, if there was but a small prospect 
of our carrying the city, it appears to me that ourcollecting a respectable body of men in its vicinity 
would be attended with many good effects ; as there 
by we should probably divide the enemy, put them 
on the defensive, and oblige them to govern their 
movements by ours. We should be in a good situation to guard the North River, and even give succourto the northern parts of the State of New York, 
should Britain be so infatuated as to attempt a second 
invasion thereof. We should then receive an easy 
supply of provisions and forage. We should draw the 

VOL. II. 8 
enemy from an open champaign country to one strong 
by nature, less favorable to their designs, and more 
friendly to ours. We should have our rear open to 
a strong and plentiful country, filled with men friend 
ly to the common cause. We should bring back the 
war to a climate more healthy, at least for the New 
England people, than a southern one, for which rea 
son the militia could with greater ease be drawn 
forth. We should avoid those inconveniences, which 
necessarily arise from the want of provisions and fo 
rage, when our whole force is collected in one camp, 
and have an opportunity of fighting the enemy in 
detachments, which is of importance to us, as a con 
siderable proportion of our men will be undisciplined. 

I hope these suggestions do not convey the most 
distant idea of a measure injurious to the Southern 
States. Nothing can be farther removed from my 
mind than the thought that the cause can be sup 
ported but by our most vigorous, united, and confi 
dential exertions. We are all embarked on the same 
bottom, and shall be saved or lost together. Should 
the Union be broken, and we find ourselves sinking, 
in vain will the Southern States lay the blame of the 
sad event upon the Northern, or the Northern re 
criminate upon the Southern. 

I am happy to inform your Excellency, that my 
wounded leg daily acquires strength, and there is no 
present appearance of any further exfoliations. It is 
a little shorter than the other. However, the defect 
I hope to supply by a corked shoe, and that it will 
not be long before I shall be able to walk.* I am, 
dear General, with sentiments of regard and esteem, 
Your affectionate, humble servant, 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN.

action of Behmus s Heights. 
FROM COUNT PULASKI. 
(Translation.) 

Yorktown, 19 March, 1778. 
SlR ? 

Without going into a detailed history of niy life, 
which would be too long, it will suffice to say to 
you, in the language of an old soldier and of a 
citizen, that, in coming to America, my sole object 
has been to devote myself entirely to her welfare 
and glory, in using every exertion in my individual 
power to secure her freedom. 

I think the nation was satisfied of my sentiments 
when it saw that I accepted the post of BrigadierGeneral of cavalry, though a long service, and my 
former rank of Commander-in-chief of the army of 
Poland, had given me a right to expect a higher po 
sition. But the sole desire to distinguish myself by 
my zeal in the cause of the United States, has disposed me to sacrifice my repose and my life to its 
support, at all times, and in whatever position. I 
venture to flatter myself, Sir, that my conduct at the 
head of the cavalry has proved this to the complete 
satisfaction of the people and the Honorable Congress ; 
happy, General, if I may now be assured of that con 
fidence, on your part, to which I aspire, and if, as I 
hope, you will honor with your approbation a plan 
which I have conceived with a sole view to the 
public good. Here it is, just as I have conceived it 
to be best adapted to benefit the army and the 
public. 

The corps placed under my command shall be in 
dependent, and formed of the two companies of 
horse and of six companies of infantry. If the Board 
of War, on which it will depend, shall see fit to en 
large it, on seeing, by experience of its courage and 
conduct, that it might be thus made of greater uti 
lity, it will be for them to decide. 

The duty of the Commandant-m-chief of this corps 
will be always to observe, very close at hand, all the 
movements of the enemy ; to take upon himself dif 
ferent enterprises, of the nature of surprises, ambus 
cades, affairs of posts, rear-guards, protecting flanks, 
&c., and to advise the Commander-in-chief of the 
army, and the Board of War, of every thing which 
he shall find to be of interest. It is easy to see 
that the whole system of the Commander of such a 
corps is simply one of active operation. So that, 
without enlarging on the advantages to be derived 
from it, it is easy to see that a corps which shall 
have no other object than to surprise the enemy, to 
watch them incessantly, and attack them at all points 
by continual surprises, must be of great utility. 

The corps will be recruited from the people of the 
country, from deserters, and from prisoners of war, 
agreeably to the letter of General Washington. 

I would propose, for my subaltern, an experienced 
officer, by name Kow r acz, formerly a Colonel and partisan in the Prussian service. And as my plan is to 
employ all the other officers whom I personally know 
to be capable of serving with distinction and honor, 
after obtaining the consent of the Honorable Con 
gress for the execution of the plan, I shall have the 
honor to mention them. 

The muskets for the infantry, the pistols for the 
lancers, the sabres, and the horses, to be furnished 
me as soon as possible. I will undertake to execute 
the rest; and as it is difficult to find leather for 
boots, saddles, &c., I request an order upon the Commissary of Leather to furnish it to me, and upon the 
different Commandants where my recruits may be, for 
quarters and rations. 

I hope that the instructions may be such, that onethird of the cost of equipping the corps may be furnished at once ; another third, in proportion as the 
corps is filled up ; and so on. 

You enjoy, General, the most distinguished, estima 
tion in our army. I reverence your virtue and yourvalor; and your military knowledge gives me a 
confident hope, in presenting this view, of the success 
of a plan which is only interesting to me through 
my desire to make myself useful to the nation. 

I hope, General, that you will do me the favor to 
obtain a prompt decision. 

C. PULASKI. 



FROM THE REVEREND JOHN ETTWEIN. 

Bethlehem, 25 March, 1778. 

SIR, 

Being informed by Dr. Shippen, the Director-General of the Military Hospitals, of an intention or pro 
posal to fix the general hospital at Letiz, one of the 
settlements of the United Brethren, eight miles from 
Lancaster, and that he gave it as his opinion, that 
in that case the inhabitants of said Letiz might be 
moved to Bethlehem and Nazareth, and finding said 
proposition founded upon misinformation and a very 
wrong notion of the constitution of these infant set 
tlements of the United Brethren, commonly called 
Moravians ; I humbly beg leave to give your Excel 
lency a short and true description of the Brethren s 
settlements in general, and of Letiz in particular. 
8* 
The Brethren s church in Germany, with a view to 
propagate the Gospel among the heathens, and to 
plant a nursery of missionaries to the Indians and 
negroes, as also to provide one or more places where 
their here-and-there dispersed and persecuted mem 
bers might find rest and liberty of conscience, did, 
in the year 1736, send a number of their members 
to make a settlement in Georgia, where the Trustees 
had promised them all indulgence in regard to their 
particular principles ; but being very ill-treated by 
the populace, on account of the war with the Span 
iards, they left Georgia, moved to Pennsylvania, and 
began this place, called Bethlehem, in the forks of 
Delaware, in 1741. 

Their poverty, and the wild state of these parts, 
made them deny many conveniences of this life, and 
they lived in simplicity and brotherly love, as onefamily, worked all for the benefit of the whole, and 
desired nothing but food and raiment; if one or the 
other had some private property, he deposited it, or 
disposed of it as he pleased, for his own interest, 
for there was no communion of goods, though it 
seemed so. 

In this way they began several other settlements ; 
but finding more and more difficulties to go on in 
this economy, it was, by common consent, altered in 
the year 1762 ; so that all who had a mind to carry 
on their art or trade, and usual occupation, for their 
own emolument, were assisted to do it. The steward 
of the single brethren, in their name and behalf, be 
came debtor for the debt of the house and stocks in 
their possession. So did the single sisters with their 
house. To encourage and to support honesty and 
fair dealing, the tavern, mill, and merchant store. 
were reserved for the benefit of the Society; and a 
few others, who required a large stock, and great 
risk, were also left to it. Each branch bears its ex 
penses, as salaries, rent, and interest of the stocks, 
&c., and the yearly gain or overplus is appropriated 
to the funds for maintaining the ministers, schools, 
missionaries, old and infirm, and their widows, or 
phans, and children of missionaries. 

In this economical regulation we lived very happy 
in brotherly love and union, and enjoyed the blessings of God attending it. But it has been the cause 
of two very erroneous opinions, or ideas, in the mind 
of strangers, concerning these settlements, of very grie 
vous consequences for them, namely, as if they were 
still as one family, and as if they were very rich. 
Both are great mistakes, if taken in a natural sense ; 
for every congregation, and every family and private 
person, has to take care of itself, so as it is custo 
mary in other places, though we do help and assist 
each other a little more than is nowadays custom 
ary. All the moneys for transporting so many hundreds from the inner part of Germany to America, to 
buy lands, and great sums expended in building and 
providing stocks, have been borrowed, and very little 
paid off. 

In the year 1757, upon request of some friends, a 
little town was laid out in Lancaster county, and 
called Letiz (in remembrance of the place where, 
just three hundred years before, the first Brethren s 
settlement was begun by some of the followers of 
John IIuss in Bohemia). Some brethren were settled 
there. With borrowed money they built three good 
fine houses ; one with a hall, where they can have 
divine service, till they shall be able to build another 
place of public worship. This house has, besides the 
hall, a few rooms where one of our bishops and the 
minister of the place dwell. On one side of it, the 
single brethren, and on the other the single sisters, 
build houses, on their own account. As well the sin 
gle men as the single women in these houses have 
their own separate economy. Each house has two 
persons to take care of their temporal and spiritual 
welfare ; each person residing in the house is paid for 
his labor, and pays weekly a certain sum for boarding and lodging, to the House economy. The yearly 
profit in that economy is for the sick and superan 
nuated, or others who cannot earn a livelihood. 

All the other houses in said Letiz, except the 
tavern and a house where a shopkeeper lives, about 
eighteen in number, are the property of private families, who built and fitted them, convenient for their 
several trades and occupations. Amongst them are 
two taverns, one whitesmith, one gunsmith, one organbuilder, one skinner, the rest shoemakers, weavers, &c. 

The single brethren were turned out of their wellregulated economy and different trades, and their 
house, to their great inconvenience and damage, con 
verted into a hospital, which is also the case of those 
in Bethlehem. 

Should your Excellency agree to Dr. Shippen s 
proposal, three hundred souls w r ould be inexpressibly 
distressed, and the single brethren and sisters, and 
all the families at Letiz, by their removal, would be 
entirely ruined in their property their useful occu 
pations, to the loss of the public, would be stopped; 
and it would be impossible to accommodate them 
with lodgings at Bethlehem and Nazareth, where AVC 
are so crow r ded together that it is a great hinderance 
to our lawful callings, wherein we provided for ourselves and served the public. 

I pray, therefore, most humbly, in the name of the 
Bishop and Elders of the United Brethren, that yourExcellency would please to grant to the Brethren s 
settlements in the fork of Delaware and at Letiz, 
near Lancaster, and at Hope, in Sussex county, West 
Jersey, protection for their persons and property, 
against all such oppressive and destructive measures. 

It is our duty to comfort and to help, as far as we 
are able, all the distressed, and to serve the public 
in our callings, wherever we can. We have done it 
with a willing heart, and intend, by the grace of 
God, to do so as long as we live. 

Recommending your Excellency to God s favor and 
protection, I am, with deepest respect, 

Your Excellency s most humble servant, 

JOHN ETTWEIN. 

P. S. The bearer, Mr. llasse, is well informed of 
our circumstances, and can give your Excellency further explanation of one thing or the other, if it is 
desired. 



FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Albany, 25 March, 1778. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

How happy I have been in receiving your Excel 
lency s favor of the 10th present, I hope you will 
be convinced by the knowledge of my tender affec 
tion for you. I am very sensible of that goodness, 
which tries to dissipate my fears about that ridiculous Canadian expedition. At the present time we 
know which was the aim of the honorable Board, 
and for which project three or four men have rushed 
the country into a great expense, and risked the reputation of our arms, and the life of many hundred 
men, had the General, your deceived friend, been as 
rash and foolish as they seem to have expected. 0, 
American freedom, what shall become of you, if you 
are in such hands ! 

I have received a letter from the Board, and a re 
solve from Congress, by which you are directed to 
recall me and the Baron de Kalb, whose presence is 
deemed absolutely necessary to your army. I believe 
that of General Conway is absolutely necessary to Al 
bany, and he has received orders to stay there, which 
I have no objection to, as nothing, perhaps, will be 
done in this quarter but some disputes of Indians 
and Tories. However, you know I have wrote to 
Congress, and as soon as their leave will come, I 
shall let Conway have the command of these few 
regiments, and I shall immediately join my respect 
able friend ; but till I have received instructions for 
leaving that place from yourself, I shall stay, as 
powerful Commander-in-chief, as if Congress had never 
resolved my presence absolutely necessary for the 
Great Army. 

Since your last letter, I have given up the idea 
of New York, and my only desire is to join you. 
The only favor I have asked of your Commissioners 
in France, has been, not to be under any orders but 
those of General Washington. I seem to have had 
an anticipation of our future friendship ; and what I 
have done out of esteem and respect for your Excel 
lency s name and reputation, I should do now out of 
mere love for General Washington himself. I am 
glad to hear General Greene is Quartermaster-General ; it is very interesting to have there an honest 
man and a friend of yours. 

But I feel the greatest pain not to hear any thing 
about reinforcements. What can you do with a 
handful of men ? And my poor division, whom I was 
so desirous of instructing, clothing, managing myself 
in the winter, and whom, I was told, I should find 
six thousand strong at the opening of the campaign! 
Don t your Excellency think that I could recruit a 
little in General Greene s division, now that he is 
Quartermaster-General ? By that promotion I find 
myself very proud to be the third officer of yourarmy. 

With the utmost respect and affection, I have the 

honor to be, &e., 

LAYFAYETTE. 



FROM GENERAL BURGOYNE. 

Cambridge, 4 April, 1778. 

SIR, 

I beg you to accept my sincerest acknowledgments 
for your very obliging letter. I find the character, 
which I before knew to be respectable, is also per 
fectly amiable ; and I should have few greater pri 
vate gratifications in seeing our melancholy contest 
at an end, than that of cultivating your friendship. 

I shall take particular care of your letter to Mr. 
Fairfax. He is a gentleman much esteemed. I hopethere is no reason to apprehend his death ; I heard 
no such report when I left England, last spring, nor 
have I seen it in any of the magazines since, most 
of which have come to my hands. I have the honor 
to be, with great respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

JOHN BURGOYNE.*

as part of a speech in Parliament, May 2Gth, 1778, with the following preliminary remarks ; "I accompanied my letter to Congress by 
one to General Washington, wherein, upon an opinion of his charac 
ter, I asked him for his support to an application that could not in 
terfere with the public duties of our respective situations. I shall 
beg leave to read his answer as part of my speech ; and I do it. 
Sir, not only lest, in these times of doubt and aspersion, I should 
incur censure for holding private correspondence with an enemy, but 
likewise because I think the letter, though from an enemy, does 
honor to the human heart." Parliamentary Register, Vol. IX. p. 221. 

While General Burgoyne was at General Schuyler s house, in Al 
bany, he wrote as follows to Lord George Germain, October 20th, 
1777, concerning the American troops. 

"I should now hold myself unjustifiable, if I did not confide to 
your Lordship my opinion, upon a near inspection, of the rebel troops. 
The standing corps, which I have seen, are disciplined. I do not 
of the 27th of February with an information to Con 
gress, that one gentleman of the late Committee on 
the Ticonderoga inquiry had retired, and that it was 
impracticable for me to give that attention which 
was due to an affair of such importance. A new 
Committee was immediately appointed. These gen 
tlemen, some eight or ten days ago, offered a report, 
when Mr. Duer interposed arguments, which induced 
the House to postpone the consideration for two 
days. 

I have taken the liberty to name that gentleman, 
because his declared motives for delay were coupled 
with assurances of particular considerations respecting 
General Schuyler. This very morning I called on 
Mr. Duer, and reminded him of his engagements, 
urging the painful situation in which his friends and 
the other General Officers remained. He replied, " I 
will soon bring on that business." Your Excellency s 
present letter will prove a further incitement. I 
have very long felt for the gentlemen who are sub 
jects of the inquiry ; and, although it was with ex 
treme reluctance I obeyed the order of Congress to 
be of the original Committee, after having urged 
such reasons for exemption as appeared to me very 
forcible, yet I cannot charge myself with delinquen 
cy at any stage in the course of our proceedings. 
To account for the uncouth and entangled state of 
this inquiry, would not be half so difficult, as it 



hazard the term, but apply it to the great fundamental points of 
military institution; sobriety, subordination, regularity, and courage. 
The militia are inferior in method and movement, but not a jot less 
serviceable in woods. My conjectures were very different after the 
affair of Ticonderoga, but I am convinced they were delusive; and 
it is a duty to the state to confess it. The panic of the rebel troops 
is confined, and of short duration ; the enthusiasm is extensive and 
permanent." Ibid. Vol. XL p. 480. 

VOL. II. 9 
might be impertinent to the proper line of my correspondence. From this consideration I shall only 
add, that I trust your Excellency s present applica 
tion will have that weight which is justly due.

FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Yorktown, 8 April, 1778. 

SIR, 

I had the honor of writing to your Excellency, the 
4th, by Jones ; since which I have presented to Con 
gress your Excellency s favors of the 1st, 3d, and 4th. 
Upon reading the first, I took occasion to intimate 
to Mr. Duer the distressed situation of his friend 
General Schuyler, as described by the General himself in a late letter of the 15th of March, and this 
morning suggested again to the House the demands 
of all the General Officers, subjects of the suspended 
inquiry. I shall repeat the same to-morrow ; and, 
having just now obtained the concurrence of gen 
tlemen in private conversation, that Congress are 
guardians of the honor of their officers, I flatter 
myself there will be no further delay of this busi 
ness. 

Your Excellency will receive, under the present inclosure, an act of Congress of the 7th, for promoting 
Captain Lee to the rank of Major of horse, and to 
the command of a separate corps. I perceive it is 
not expressed in the act; but I am warranted to as 
sure your Excellency it is the particular desire of 
Congress that suitable declarations of that gentleman s 
merit should be expressed, either within the intended 
commission, or by annexing to it the above-mentioned 
act, a certified copy of which Major Lee will receive 
by the present despatch.* 

Consideration of Colonel Lee and Major Swasey s 
application is postponed a few days for particularreasons. I shall direct the Secretary of Congress to 
collect the dates of the late resignations of Colonels 
in the Virginia line, and transmit an account to yourExcellency, when obtained. 

Your Excellency s last letter of the 4th is at present the subject of a special Committee. It is proba 
ble a report will be offered to-morrow morning. 

Previous to the receipt of your Excellency s ad 
vices, Congress had determined to make a purchase 
of divers articles, set forth in Captain Cottineau s 
schedule of his cargo ; and for this purpose a gentle 
man will proceed, to-morrow, on his journey to Cape 
Lookout, by whom your Excellency s letter will go 
forward. I have the honor to be, with the highestesteem and regard, Sir, 

Your Excellency s obedient and humble servant, 

HENRY LAUEENS, President.

commanded, distinguished honor; and it being the determination of 
Congress to reward merit ;

FROM THE REVEREND ANDREW BURNABY.* 

Greenwich, 9 April, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

Availing myself of the present moment of tranquil 
lity, I sit down to renew a correspondence, which 
has been long interrupted, either by my residence in 
Italy, or by that common calamity which I am per 
suaded we both sincerely lament. Yet, how shall I 
resume a subject, which, by naturally carrying us 
back to those happy days when our acquaintance 
commenced, and obliging us to compare them with 
that sad and unfortunate reverse which has since 
happened, must necessarily affect us both with con 
cern ? A civil war, spreading enmity and distrust 
where affection and confidence ought naturally to prevail, is a circumstance which not only we, but every 
one not lost to humanity, must, I persuade myself, 
most seriously deplore. 

And is there no way to stop the further progress 
of this ruin, and heal the wounds which have been 
opened by so dire a calamity? Must the parent and 
the child be forever at r variance? And can either of 
them be happy, independent of the other? You, my 
dear Sir, know too well the circumstances and inte 
rest both of Great Britain and America, not to per 
ceive the impossibility of it. Great Britain and 
America, united, will constitute the fairest and happiest state in the world; but, divided, they will be

Revolution, and who published his Travels after his return to England. 
This letter seems to have been designed to prepare the way for the 
Commissioners, who were coming out empowered to negotiate a recon 
ciliation upon the terms embraced in what were called Lord North s 
Conciliatory Bills. 
quite the reverse. It is not even possible that Ame 
rica should be happy, unconnected with Great Britain. 
Will the union, for example, which is at this time so 
firm among the Americans, from the sense of a common cause, be permanent, when they are totally in 
dependent? Are there no circumstances in the state 
of each Colony, no ingredients in the character of 
their respective inhabitants, which render this morally 
impossible ? A worse and more disastrous war than 
the present will, in such case, not fail, in the space 
of half a century, to desolate America from border to 
border. Remember the States of Greece after the re 
treat of the Persians; remember the Peloponnesian 
war. 

France, too; is it to be supposed, however specious 
and fair her conduct and promises may be at present, 
that she can in reality be a well-wisher to America? 
I doubt not of her professions, indeed, nor even of 
her readiness, in case of any appearance of a recon 
ciliation taking place between us, to make war sooner 
than suffer it to come to a conclusion. But will it 
be from affection to America that she will do so? 
Et sic notus Ulysses ? Will it not rather be from 
hope that Great Britain and America may weaken 
each other, and then fall a common prey to her in 
sidious arts ? There can be no doubt of it. You 
yourself have most sensibly experienced the perfidy 
of that false and treacherous people. The interest of 
Great Britain and America is the same ; the same 
lineage, the same language, the same liberty, the 
same religion connecting them; but that of America 
and France is diametrically opposite, absolutely irre 
concilable. 

That union and harmony, then, which so happily 
subsisted between us in the year 1763, ought to be 
9* 
again revived, and forever preserved hereafter invio 
late and sacred. This, I am convinced, is the ardent 
wish of every good and honest man in this kingdom, 
whether in the highest or the humblest stations. In 
deed, the appointment of the present commission is an 
incontrovertible proof of it. Whatever errors or mis 
understandings there may have happened during the 
course of this unfortunate business, it is time that 
they were rectified, and that the wounds were on 
both sides healed. Let us mutually forget our past 
misfortunes, and unanimously strive to recover ourformer happiness and friendship. Let affliction teach 
us wisdom and moderation. 

You, my dear Sir, whose virtues have raised you 
to so eminent and conspicuous a situation, may, by 
using and exerting your endeavours, contribute very 
much to the completion of so divine a purpose ; and 
thereby acquire more glory, and confer more real 
and lasting service, both to your own country and to 
mankind in general, than perhaps ever yet happened 
to the lot of any one man. May Heaven give you 
the power, as I doubt not the inclination, to effect 
so great and virtuous a design! 

Allow me, before I take leave of you, to inquire 
after Mrs. Washington and my friends. I hope they 
are well; and desire that you will recall me to their 
remembrance. You will find, by a very imperfect 
and I fear injudicious, account of my travels in Ame 
rica, which I have taken the liberty to send you, 
how deep a sense I retain of the kindness and civil 
ities of my American acquaintance. I hope Mrs. 
Washington will not think that I have spoken too 
slightly of the Virginian ladies. If she does, be so 
good as to remind her, in a whisper, that I w r as at 
that time in love with a lady whom I had left in 
England ; and, of course, was half blind to the beauty 
of every one else. I was not, however, insensible to 
her merit; and I would add, if it were not for fearthat she would suspect me of flattery, that the happiness of her acquaintance obliged me to speak that 
truth of the Virginian ladies, which, in my present 
judgment, I think the most honorable testimony I 
could bear to their virtue, "that they make the best 
wives and best mothers in the world." 

Wythe is, I take for granted, as philosophical and 
Socratic as ever, and as deeply absorbed in Grecian 
literature. Be so good as to present my best affec 
tions to him. Our friend, Small, is, alas ! no more. 
He died about two years ago, leaving a considerable 
fortune, but a much more considerable character be 
hind him. 

I am, myself, in possession of every blessing in life ; 
a respectable preferment, an independent fortune, a 
wife after the Virginian model, four sons and a daugh 
ter, and, above all things, of the most perfect friend 
ship and affection for yourself; being, dear Sir, with 
the highest respect and gratitude, your most faithful 
and most obliged humble servant, 

ANDREW BURNABY. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OP CONGRESS. 

Yorktown, 14 April, 1778. 

SIR, 

In obedience to the direction of Congress, I am to 
acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th 
instant. Congress, with great concern, perceive that 
your sensibility is wounded by their resolutions. 
Placing the firmest confidence in your prudence, abilities, and integrity, they wish to preserve that harmony with you, which is essential to the general 
weal. You may rest assured, that, far from any in 
tention to give you pain, their resolutions have no 
other motives or end but the public good. They 
therefore hope that you will not, in future, be distressed by apprehensions as injurious to their honor 
as they are to your own feelings. 

However different the views of Congress may seem 
to you now from what you supposed them to be 
when you entered into your late engagements with 
General Howe, Congress certainly had nothing in 
view but a proper respect to the dignity, safety, and 
independence of these States. The duplicity of Ge 
neral Howe, and authentic information that the gen 
tlemen appointed by you to negotiate the cartel held 
opinions repugnant to the sense of Congress, con 
strained them, in a matter of such high moment as 
forming a general cartel, to express their sentiments 
in an explicit manner, lest they might have only to 
lament, when it was out of their power to remedy, a 
misapprehension on points deeply affecting, in their 
judgment, the safety and honor of these States. 

Congress expected you would consider their resolu 
tions of the 30th ultimo in the light of private in 
structions, calculated to show their sense with respect 
to the general outlines of the proposed cartel ; a 
practice usual with the supreme power of every State 
in similar cases. You observe that a strict adherence 
to all the resolutions of Congress must, of necessity, 
destroy all idea of a cartel ; but, as a distinction can 
easily be made betwixt such of the resolutions of 
Congress as flow from general principles of policy, 
and those which arise from circumstances which have 
rendered a variation from time to time necessary, it 
is conceived that an attention to this discrimination 
will rid you of those embarrassments, which you may, 
at first view, think yourself entangled with. The re 
solution of Congress of the 19th December, respecting 
the mode of settlement for supplies to the enemy s 
prisoners, seems not to have been sufficiently attended to. It is left at the option of the enemy to pay 
either in coin, dollar for dollar, or in provisions 
equal in quantity and kind to what is furnished. 
Whatever objections may be made against the first 
mode, there surely cannot be a more just and equal 
ratio than the latter. General Burgoyne lately madethe same objections on this point, which are carried 
to you; but, on being reminded of the alternative 
offered by the resolution, he acquiesced, and the vict 
ualling-ships are now actually delivering provisions 
in payment for what they received. The Commis 
saries of Prisoners, on each side, may pass receipts 
for the rations received, expressing the quantum of 
each article received for the subsistence of the pri 
soners in the power of the contracting parties, and 
the balance may be paid in provisions or in coin, at 
the option of either party. 

The mode suggested by you is liable to this strong 
objection; that it would lay us under the necessity 
of furnishing the enemy s prisoners with us, as well 
as ours with them, with provisions; which certainly 
would be a capital advantage to them, if we consider 
the distance whence they must derive their supplies. 
The resolution of the 30th December was a measure 
naturally flowing from the treason acts, which the 
respective States have passed in consequence of the 
express recommendation of Congress. On a mature 
deliberation, they are convinced that a deviation from 
it would be subversive of our character as an independent people, in consistence with sound policy. No 
act of Congress can suspend the operation of the 
laws of the different States, and therefore they can 
not consent that any measure should be adopted in 
the proposed cartel, which may contravene this reso 
lution. 

It does not, however, appear to Congress that any 
embarrassment will arise in this matter, unless the 
enemy should insist upon an article in the cartel, 
that Americans, taken in arms, shall be entitled to the 
benefits of an exchange. Under the terms u officerfor officer, soldier for soldier," which are generally 
used in cartels, traitors would no more be included 
by the laws of nations than deserters. The carrying 
this resolution into practice can depend only on the 
will of the several States, who, in this respect, must 
be presumed to be governed by principles of policy. 
of which they must necessarily be competent judges. 
With respect to the resolution concerning General 
Lee, at his request Congress are willing that you 
should waive his exchange for Major-General Prescott, 
as a preliminary article. It is, however, their inten 
tion that no cartel be acceded to, unless it be ex 
pressly admitted therein, that General Lee be ex 
changed for General Prescott, 

Congress have taken measures for purchasing such 
articles of Captain Cottineau s cargo as are necessary 
for the army. 

By order of Congress, 

HENRY LAURENS, President. 
FROM JOHN BANISTER,* 

York, 16 April, 1778. 

SIR, 

In consequence of a letter from Governor Henry 
to the Virginia Delegates, directing the payment of 
thirty thousand dollars, as an additional bounty granted to the soldiers who have reenlisted into the Vir 
ginia regiments, I am to inform you, that the money 
shall be paid in any manner you may please to 
direct. 

It was with the most painful sensibility that I pe 
rused your last letter, on the subject of the present 
state of the army, and I am equally concerned in re 
flecting, that I do not see effectual measures taken 
to ward off the impending blow. 

As to the establishment, I am under no doubt of 
its being adopted, and put upon a ground of stability. 
Its not having taken effect as yet, has been owing to 
a thin representation. Virginia, the leader in this 
great business, for want of the constituent number to 
form a representation, remains a cipher, without suf 
frage, at this momentous period. Did I not fear to 
intrude upon your hours of essential business, I should 
sometimes write- to you, for my own information, on 
military subjects ; here being the greatest ignorance 
in every occurrence of that kind, mixed with an in 
activity, that permits affairs of the greatest magnitudeto lie dormant, and give place to local trifles. I have 
said with freedom, in few words, what has often oc 
curred since I have been here. I wish I had the 
capability to apply an instant remedy, for nothing 
procrastinated will do. However, the military esta

blishment will come out soon. God knows what other 
regulations may take place. Virginia s drafted men 
will come on soon, and I believe may amount to 
seventeen hundred, instead of two thousand voted, as 
it is highly probable more men desert of those compelled into service, than if they had entered volunta 
rily. Colonel Harrison s artillery regiment are on 
their march. Would volunteers, provided they can be 
had, be of service to your operations ? Certain it is. 
they will not come out in such numbers as some have 
conjectured; but I believe a considerable body, per 
haps two battalions, may be induced to venture their 
persons, in this time of danger. 

The order on the Paymaster, if it is to go through 
his hands, will and eighty dollars ; the eighty

Meade to pay. I am, with the highest regard and 
attachment, your Excellency s

Piccadilly, 17 April, 1778. 

Notwithstanding the different parts, Sir, we have 
taken in the unhappy differences still subsisting be 
tween Great Britain and America, I. flatter myself 
there yet remains a mutual share of esteem between 
your Excellency and me ; and I hope you do mo the 
justice to think, that should the Commissioners, by 
whom I have the honor of sending this, be fortunate 
enough to accomplish a reconciliation, it will give me 
the highest pleasure. When I inform your Excellency

FROM GENERAL CADWALADER. 

Maryland, Kent County, 27 April, 1778. 

MY DEAR SIR, 

I was on the Western Shore when your favor by 
Captain Lee reached my house ; and as I was daily 
expected home, General Dickinson did not forward it; 
by which means I cannot have the pleasure of seeing 
you so soon as I could wish. 

I alwa}^s proposed spending the active part of the 
campaign in camp, but I did not conceive the enemy 
could possibly take the field till towards the 1st of 
June, owing to the difficulties of subsisting their 
horses before that time; and, therefore, I have not 
made the necessary preparation for setting off imme 
diately, agreeably to your wishes. But, be assured, I 
shall exert myself, to the utmost, in getting some 

VOL. II. 10 
matters of importance to my private affairs settled ; 
after which, I shall lose no time in paying my compliments to you in camp. 

The wishes you kindly express, to see me engaged 
in the service, I esteem the greatest honor; but an 
appointment to any command, at this time, would pro 
bably create great complaints ; which, instead of occa 
sioning, I wish to prevent. I have not the vanity 
to think my assistance at camp can be important to 
the service ; but, small as it may be, I conceive it my 
duty to offer it at this critical time ; reflecting, that 
if it is of no value to my country, it will cost it 
nothing. 

Be pleased to present my compliments to the gen 
tlemen of your family; and believe me to be, with 
the greatest respect and esteem, your affectionate and 
most obedient, humble servant, 

JOHN CADWALADER. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Yorktown, 27 April, 1778. 

SIR, 

I had the honor of writing to your Excellency the 
24th instant, by McKlosky. Yesterday, about half 
past 5 o clock, P. M., your Excellency s favor of the 
25th was brought to me in Congress, and was imme 
diately presented. The person who had been the 
bearer of it was anxious to obtain a receipt of the 
letter to express the time of delivery, and he complained of unnecessary detention half the day at the 
Suscjuehanna Ferry. This intimation will answer his 
purpose. 

I am directed, by Congress, to request your Excel 
lency will immediately require all officers, civil as well 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. HI 

as military, in the army, who are at present delin 
quent, to comply with the terms of an act of Congress 
of the 3d of February last, by taking the oath of 
allegiance and abjuration, and that your Excellency 
will be pleased to cause the necessary certificates as 
speedily as possible to be returned, and if occasion 
shall be given, which is supposed to be scarcely possible, the name or names of such persons as shall 
refuse. 

The bearer hereof will deliver three packets, con 
taining about six hundred blanks, which will hasten 
the business of administering oaths. More shall be 
sent by the next messenger. 

In considering the article of provision to be madefor officers, who shall continue in the army to the end 
of the war, Congress had proceeded so far last night 
as resolving, that one half the present pay be con 
tinued during life, without exceptions of country, to 
all such officers as shall also take the oath of allegi 
ance, and actually reside within the United States. 
This resolution, and the whole plan for the militaryestablishment, is subject to further discussion, respecting the propriety of transmitting it to the several 
States for concurrence. I have the honor to be, with 
the highest respect and esteem, Sir, 

Your most obedient and very humble servant, 

HENRY LAURENS, President. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Yorktown, 27 April, 17 78. 

SIR. 

The newspapers which I received, from your Excel 
lency, in company with the honor of your Excellency s letter of the 18th, afford me sometimes amuse 
ment in intervals from the necessary duties of my 
present station ; and I am particularly indebted to 
your Excellency for the notice which is included in 
the kindness of this favor. 

Your Excellency is too well acquainted with the 
integrity of your own heart, and too well assured of 
the good opinion of your countrymen., to admit any 
anxious impression from the forgeries of an enemy. 
I am disposed to vote for every exertion in ourpower, in order to defeat their designs against us, 
except following such of their examples as will, when 
related in history, greatly abate from that character 
for generosity, which England, and upon good ground, 
once boasted. The late attempt, by publishing forged 
resolves of Congress within a garrisoned town, imme 
diately under the eye of a Commander-in-chief, appears to me to be mean and scandalous, and must be 
considered in the same light by every good English 
man, military, or in public or private life. 

We are now 7 verging towards a most important 
crisis, when all the wisdom of these States will be 
required. Permit me, Sir, to lay before you my pri 
vate sentiments. If the time shall come for appointing a deputation for treating with British Commis 
sioners on terms for establishing peace, 1 hold it necessary that able men be called forth for that purpose from any place within the Union, without con 
fining our election within any one State or body. I 
entreat your Excellency s pardon for this freedom, and 
that you will believe me m to be, with the most sin 
cere esteem and attachment, Sir, 

Your obliged, and most obedient servant, 

HENRY LAURENS. 
FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SULLIVAN. 

Providence, 1 May, 1778. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I should have long since wrote your Excellency, 
was there any thing in this quarter worth engaging 
your attention. I found, upon my journey home, that 
there was not the least probability of the enemy s 
attempting to rescue General Burgoyne and army. I 
therefore went to New Hampshire, where I tarried 
about twelve days. Upon my arrival there, I found 
no troops worth mentioning, and, by the inclosed re 
turn, your Excellency will see we are little better 
now. Connecticut has not sent us a man; Massachu 
setts, but fifty ; New Hampshire, owing to my pushing the matter, have theirs principally on the roads. 

The three last-mentioned regiments will leave me 
to-morrow; their time expires this night. When yourExcellency has viewed this return, you will be surprised at the indolence of the enemy. They are 
three thousand six hundred strong, of British and 
Hessians, besides a small regiment of Greencoats, 
made up of deserters and refugees from us. This 
regiment consists of one hundred and twenty-seven, 
and is commanded by one Whitmore. They have 
drafted none from Rhode Island, this year, except 
fifty-four to join the light infantry of their Grand 
Army. Those sailed with Lord Howe. The enemy 
are busy in fortifying the Island, and are much afraid 
that we are about to attack them. I wish the deception may continue. Captain Whipple, in the Pro 
vidence frigate, passed their shipping, with a strong 
gale of wind, the night of the 30th ultimo, under a 
severe fire, which he warmly returned, and got safe 
to sea, 

10* 
We have nothing new in this quarter, save that 
General Pigot politely requested nie to disperse his 
handbills among the people, which I refused, and delivered them over to the Assembly.* I since hear, 
that while I was viewing the sea-coast below the 
enemy, the populace rose and burnt them under the 
gallows. When any thing worth your Excellency s 
notice occurs, I shall give you the earliest intelligence. Interim, I have the honor to be, dear General, with the highest sentiments of gratitude andesteem, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

JOHN SULLIVAN.

contents, and of the favorable dispositions of Great Britain towards 
the American Colonies, I hope you will excuse my taking the liberty

will be so obliging as to order them to be dispersed throughout the 
Province of llhode Island.

" ROBERT FICOT, M. G." 

The following is an extract from General Sullivan s reply, dated 
April 27th. 

" I received your favor of the 21th instant, requesting me to disperse, among the inhabitants of this State, sundry copies of Bills, said 
to have been read in the British House of Commons on the 19th 
of February last, which copies were delivered with your letter. 

" The inhabitants of this State acknowledge no authority but that 
of the civil magistrates and the laws of the land (with which au

any kind amongst them. The Legislature of this State is the only 
power which can regularly take your request into consideration. To 
FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Yorktown, 3 May, 1778. 

SIR, 

My last trouble to your Excellency was dated the 
30th ultimo, by Rosse. The present will cover an 
act of that date for ascertaining the rank and pay 
annexed to Brevet commissions. Whether this is, or 
is not, intended to have a retrospective effect, I think 
is not clearly expressed by the letter ; and, as I apprehend such operation may, in many instances, give 
umbrage, I shall embrace the first proper opportunity 
of obtaining an explanation of the act, or information 
to my own understanding. 

I despatch this messenger principally to inform 
your Excellency of an event, the knowledge of which 
may nevertheless very probably have reached camp 



that body I have, therefore, commended your desire, and with it havo 
lodged the copies you sent. 

" Had proposals of this kind been properly and sincerely made by 
the Court of Britain to the Supreme Authority of America, before 
the wanton cruelty which has marked the progress of the British 
arms in this country had taken place, or prior to our declaring ourselves independent, and entering into alliances with foreign powers, 
they would have been accepted with sentiments of gratitude. But at 
this time, all proposals, except for a peace upon honorable and equal 
terms, must be ineffectual." 

Copies of the same Bills were sent to Governor Trumbull by Go 
vernor Tryon from New York. The following extracts are from 
Governor Trumbull s answer. 

" Your letter of the 1 7th instant, from New York, is received, with 
its inclosures, and the several similar packets of various addresses 
with which it was accompanied. 

"Propositions of peace are usually made from the supreme author 
ity of one contending power to the similar authority of the other; 
and the present is the first instance, within my recollection, where a 
vague, half-blank, and very indefinite draft of a Bill, once only read 
before one of three bodies of the Legislature of a nation, has ever 
been addressed to the people at large of the opposite power, of an 
before this can arrive there, as our messenger from 
France, Mr. Simeon Deane, had spoken, everywhere 
on his journey to York, of the treaties between the 
Court of Versailles and the United States of Ame 
rica, which were executed on the 6th of February. 
1778. These were read in Congress late last eve 
ning, and will probably be ratified and published in 
the course of the present week, except a secret arti 
cle, which it is also probable is very well known 
abroad. Be this as it may, I view the treaties of 
alliance and commerce, although not free from excep 
tion, as circumstances of advantage to these United 
States, and which afford a bottom for vast improve 
ments. I beg leave, therefore, to congratulate with 
your Excellency, and with every friend to the great 
American cause. I shall move Congress, to-morrow, 
to order duplicates of the treaties to be immediately 
transmitted to your Excellency ; in the mean time 
this of a letter from Doctor Franklin and Mr. 

Deane, which will go inclosed, will communicate the 
great outlines. I have the honor to be, with the 
highest esteem and regard, Sir,

overture of reconciliation. There was a day, when even this step 
from our then acknowledged parent State might have been accepted 
with joy and gratitude. But that day, Sir, is passed irrevocably. 

" If peace be really the object, let your proposals be addressed 
properly to the proper power, and your negotiations honorably con 
ducted. We shall then have some prospect of (what is the most 
ardent w T ish of every American) a lasting arid honorable peace. The 
British nation may then, perhaps, find us as affectionate and valua 
ble friends, as we now are determined and fatal enemies ; and derive from that friendship more solid and real advantage, than the 
most sanguine can expect from conquest." Lebanon, April 23d. 
FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Yorktown, 5 May, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

In a public letter, which I had the honor of writing to your Excellency the 3d instant, by Major 
Price, I sent a number of handbills calculated for 
giving satisfactory information to the public, who were 
anxious to learn the recent intelligence from France. 
One article of this has been questioned, respecting 
the King of Prussia s promise, the only part of the 
performance that can be called mine. I believe my 
authority is good. Izard, under the 16th February, 
informs me, " the King of Prussia has given the most 
explicit and unequivocal assurance, that he will be 
the second power in Europe to acknowledge the in 
dependence of America." It is true our Commission 
ers, in their public advices, are not so express, nor 
are they, in my opinion, so full and clear in some 
other respects, as they might have been. 

Human nature pervades every human breast. A 
residence at Paris will not exempt men from infirm 
ities of the mind ; nor is even the momentous concern 
of guardianship to thirteen United States, an infant 
world in danger of being crushed by the hand of 
violence, paramount to those curses upon mankind, 
pride and covetousness, sources from whence all the 
evils of this life spring. Our Ambassadorial Commis 
sioners, of which your Excellency cannot be ignorant, 
are unhappily divided in sentiments. Jarrings and 
appeals have followed. Intelligence, intended for the 
public, loses part of that fulness and perspicuity, 
which would have appeared in candid and united 
counsels. I have seen so much of the world as to be 
guarded against surprise at any thing. No inconsiderable benefit results from attempts to reconcile, and 
even sweeten, the most untoward circumstances which 
happen in one s journey through it. I apprehend it 
would break in on your Excellency s time,, otherwise 
I would have troubled you with Mr. Izard s letter, not 
merely for information, but for a hope that something 
might be devised for promoting concord between ourfriends yonder, or the public good, by a wise couperation. But I will not dwell upon this subject. 

Last night I had the honor of receiving your Ex 
cellency s favor of the last of April, and am happy 
in finding a confirmation of my sentiments respecting 
persons proper for treating with the expected depu 
tation from our adversary. I fear the determination, 
where only this point can be determined, will be con 
trary. Be it so ; thank God we have here some men 
of abilities and integrity. I hope we shall make a 
judicious choice. The act of Congress of the 22d 
April will blot out pages of the British instructions. 
The Commissioners from that side will perceive a 
necessity for taking a new departure from the Tower 
of Independence ; and what happened in France, on 
the 6th of February, will oblige them to shape a new 
course. From the absence of the Commissioners, I 
presume they had not sailed from England on the 
10th of March. It may have been found expedient, at 
St. James s, to vest them with more ample powers, it 
they meant to come, than were originally intended, 
and under new sanctions of Parliament ; a work of 
slow progress. The people would have much to say. 
That the nation were more than a little agitated, appears from a letter, which I take the liberty of in 
closing for your Excellency s perusal. I have like 
wise a letter from the mercantile line in London, 
which proves to me the people in general had very 



THE AMEBICAN REVOLUTION. 119 

sensibly felt the weight of the war, were ardently desirous of peace, and anxious lest Congress should re 
ject the intended propositions. 

The long, arid, as I humbly think, unnecessary delay of the army arrangement, is very afflicting. I 
know it must give extreme pain to your Excellency. 
It is improper for me to touch upon the cause, espe 
cially when it is so well known that Congress have 
been engaged in very important business. The plan 
introduced for that part of it which is intended toestablish a half-pay for officers during life, I have 
been uniformly averse from, and in a committee of 
Congress delivered my objections. These appear to 
me, at this moment, of more weight, because they have 
not been removed by the reasonings which have been 
offered against them, and I may, without vanity, think 
myself not obstinate. I am open to conviction, and 
always, without murmuring, submit to a majority. I 
view the scheme as altogether unjust and unconstitutional in its nature, and full of dangerous conse 
quences. It is an unhappy dilemma to which we 
seem to be reduced. Provide for your officers in 
terms dictated to you, or lose all the valuable soldiers 
among them ; establish a pension for officers, make 
them a separate body, to be provided for by the 
honest yeomanry, and others of their fellow-citizens, 
many thousands of whom have equal claims upon 
every ground of loss of estate, health, &c,, or lose 
your army and your cause. That such provision will 
be against the grain of the people, has been unwarily 
testified by its advocates, whom I have heard con 
verse upon the subject. Indeed, they have furnished 
strong ground for opposition against an immediate 
compliance with the demand. If we cannot make 
justice one of the pillars, necessity may be submitted to at present; but republicans will, at a pro 
per time, withdraw a grant which will appear to have 
been extorted. 

Were I in private conversation with an officer on 
this point, I should not despair of fairly balancing 
every grievance he might suppose to be peculiar to 
the army, by instances of losses and inconveniences 
in my own property and person ; and I count myself 
very happy, compared with thousands who have as 
faithfully adhered to our original compact. It is said, 
gentlemen did not think the war would have con 
tinued so long. Forgive me, Sir, a ludicrous remark 
which I made early in our contest, indeed in Eng 
land, before the commencement of the contest. " I 
know my countrymen are good for the quarter, but I 
have doubts of their going the course." There is a 
certain versatility, habitual if not almost constitu 
tional, in men born south of thirty-eight degrees of 
latitude, in these States. Circumstances, which have 
occurred in the progress of this war, have given 
strength to my observation. 

There are, within that division of America, not only 
objects inviting, but temptations almost irresistible, to 
change, to say nothing of the general train of educa 
tion. Hence, it is easy to account for a resignation of 
a commission, which had been anxiously solicited by 
scores. The want of something is made an excuse, 
and even sometimes by worthy characters, who do 
not suspect themselves. Would to God, gentlemen 
had followed the noble, patriotic example of their 
Commander-in-chief, a plan which, reflection will show 
them in a shade of disgrace, would never have found 
place in their minds. How superior are many of the 
gentlemen, now in my contemplation (for I know 
many with whom I do not converse), to the acceptance of a half-pay, contributed to by widows and or 
phans of soldiers who had bled and died by their 
sides ! shackled with a condition of being excluded 
from the privilege of serving in offices, in common 
with their fellow-citizens voted in every House of 
Assembly as the drones and incumbrances of society, 
pointed at by boys and girls, there goes a man, who 
every year robs me of part of my pittance. I think, 
Sir, I do not overstrain. This will be the language 
of republicans ; how pungent, when applied to gen 
tlemen who shall have stepped from the army into a 
good remaining estate ; how much deeper to some, 
who, in idleness and by speculation, have amassedestates in the war ! 

This, Sir, is a large field. Virtue and honor might 
be summoned to answer, but it is time for me to for 
bear. I am obliged to write in haste, called upon by 
particular public duties. Besides, I feel a full assurance, notwithstanding the present seeming contra 
riety, that my sentiments, when fully explained, will 
not differ essentially from your Excellency s. I must 
not, however, conclude without these declarations, that 
I am not among those to whom may be applied, 
" Our God and soldier we adore, in time of danger, 
&c." I am most heartily disposed to distinguish the 
gallant officers and soldiers, by the most liberal marks 
of esteem, desirous of making proper provision for all 
who shall stand in need. I would not except even 
some of the brave, whose expenses have been prince 
ly in extravagance, while they complained of insuffi 
ciency of pay. 

I have ever detested, and never practised, Parlia 
mentary jockeyings for procrastinating an unpalatable 
business, which, as a silent auditor and spectator, I 
have, within some time past, known to be alternately 

VOL. II. 11 
adopted. I most sincerely wish the army had been 
wisely attended to. The high esteem I from grati 
tude bear for your Excellency, whose sufferings from 
a contrary conduct I know must have been great, 
as well as my love of despatch, makes me wish it ; 
and I lament that, in some degree, we are likely to 
be indebted more to the policy and deep projects of 
other men for our deliverance, than to our own wis 
dom and fortitude. I am, with the most sincere re 
spect, and the most respectful affection and esteem, 
dear Sir, 

Your most obliged servant. 

HENRY LAURENS. 



FROM ELIAS BOUDINOT, COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS. 

Baskingridge, 13 May, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

On my arrival at Morristown, I found LieutenantColonel Campbell, who proposed my going with himto New York, as he thought he could aid me great 
ly in furthering t some immediate relief to our suffering prisoners. By Colbnel Allen I received General 
Clinton s permission to attend Colonel Campbell, and 
then proceeded to New York. I found Major-General 
Daniel Jones in the command, and General ValentineJones Commandant of the city. Both these gentle 
men appear determined to give every relief to prison 
ers that is in their power. They treated me with 
uncommon civility, and granted me every thing I 
asked. 

The exchange, I took with me, was completely carried into execution, with the addition of twenty-five 
officers and about twenty privates, being for the servants of General Burgoyne, Colonel Campbell, and 
others. General Jones has given me the strongest 
assurances that our officers and privates will not have 
reason again to complain of unnecessary severity ; in 
deed, their whole system appears to be changed, or 
at least in confusion. I cannot but mention the service I received from Colonel Campbell, who seems 
determined to interest himself in mitigating the rigors 
of captivity, which he appears well acquainted with. 

Many of our officers, who are now exchanged, are 
at a loss to know what to do, there being no provi 
sion made for them ; and having left both property 
and friends, they are anxious for any employment in 
which they may hope for some satisfaction for the 
multitude and severity of their sufferings. 

As I am much engaged to get my accounts in pro 
per order, I shall remain here till that is done, unless I receive other orders from your Excellency, 
which I beg to be favored with, if you think my 
immediate presence necessary at camp. If a succes 
sor to my department has been nominated, I should 
be much obliged by the information. I have the 
honor to be, with the greatest regard and esteem, 
your Excellency s 

Most obedient, and most humble servant, 

ELIAS BOUDINOT. 



FROM RICHARD HENRY LEE, IN CONGRESS. 

York, 16 May, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

The unfortunate cause, which hath prevented me 
from attending to your last favor sooner, will, I hope, 
be my excuse. The long sickness and death of my 
much-loved brother of Bellevue, has for some time 
past confined me in Virginia, and removed every other 
consideration from my mind. I now embrace the first 
good opportunity of sending you the pamphlet of 
forgeries, that I formerly mentioned. It is among the 
pitiful arts of our enemies, to endeavour at sowing 
dissension among the friends of liberty and their country. With me, such tricks can never prevail. 

Give me leave, dear Sir, to congratulate you on 
the happy event of our treaty with France being so 
effectually concluded. Congress have ratified it on 
their part, and ordered the ratification to be delivered 
in due form. This will be announced to the public 
immediately. The counsels of France have been go 
verned, in this affair, by true magnanimity and sound 
policy. It was magnanimous in his Most Christian 
Majesty, not to avail himself of our situation to demand unequal and oppressive terms; and it was wise 
to leave the commerce of America open to all the 
maritime states, which will prevent their jealous} 
and enmity, and make them foes instead of friends to 
England. Great Britain has its choice now of mad 
ness or meanness. She will not war with the house 
of Bourbon and North America at the same time ; so 
that I incline to think meanness will be her choice, 
as best befitting her present state and the minds of 
her rulers. It will probably happen, that the tradeof France will not now be interrupted ; and thus, by 
affording no pretext for war, the whole force of ourenemies may be devoted to one last and vigorous 
campaign against us. As wise men, we ought to be 
prepared for such an event, by collecting a strong 
army, and by every other means that can discourage 
and defeat such intentions of our inveterate enemies. 
Being disappointed this campaign, must infallibly compel the acknowledgment of our independence, and 
keep the world, for some time longer, in peace. Eng 
land alone will pay, for her wickedness and folly, by 
the loss of North America. 

Our information is good, that very few troops can 
come here from Germany ; and private letters, as well 
as public papers, say that the plan of getting regi 
ments by subscription, though much boasted of at 
first, has fallen very low. From the Highlands of 
North Britain some men will be obtained, and per 
haps a few from England and Ireland, but there 
seems no reason to suppose that their every exer 
tion can add more than four or five thousand to the 
present force in North America. But this will re 
quire a very considerable strength, on our part, to 
make the event certain. An unsettled dispute be 
tween the Emperor and the King of Prussia (w r hich 
England will undoubtedly foment) concerning the di 
vision of the estate of the late Elector of Bavaria, 
has threatened a rupture in Europe, not for our ad 
vantage, because the former of these princes being 
with us, the latter might be disposed to favor the 
views of Great Britain, to our injury. 

Alderman Lee writes, that there is some hope of 
this being negotiated happily. An intelligent corre 
spondent in England writes to Alderman Lee, that it 
was uncertain whether Lord North s Bills would be 
agreed to or not, but that they were industriously 
sent over here, and circulated, to prevent our treaty 
with France from being concluded. Vain and unwise 
men ! Their means are always destructive of their 
ends. North s delusive and indecent propositions 
have accelerated an adoption of the agreement with 
France. 

I am much concerned to find, in Virginia, such 
11* 
want of method and industry in collecting and bringing forward the drafts. When I came away, there 
were all the men (amounting to forty-one or two), 
both of the former and the latter drafts, remaining 
in King George, merely for want of an officer to 
bring them away ; and I am misinformed if it is not 
the case in other counties. As far as I have been 
able to learn, it is probable that, if dexterous recruiting officers were properly furnished for the business, 
and sent out, almost all these veterans, that have 
been discharged from our nine regiments, would ree nlist in a short time. I am, with sincere esteem, dearSir, 

Your most affectionate and obedient servant, 

RICHARD HENRY LEE. 

P. S. Alderman Lee says, they talk of sending 
Lord Westcote and Hans Stanley here, to treat with 
us, and that they are to bring half a million of gui 
neas to bribe the Congress. From their own corrup 
tions, these men reason to the corruption of all others. 

I had almost forgot to mention, that four expresses 
were sent from St. James s, on the subject ^of Generals Howe and Clinton. The latter had leave to go 
home ; the Court was disgusted with the , former, and 
had recalled him, but recollecting that Clin/ton might 
be come away, another messenger was sent to stop 
HOW T O, if that should be the case. I hope-d,hey are 
both gone.* 



* These rumors appear to have had little foundation. 
FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Valley Forge, 19 May, 1778. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

Agreeably to your Excellency s orders I have taken 
the oath of the gentlemen officers in General Woodford s brigade, and their certificates have been sent 
to the Adjutant-General s office. Give me leave, now, 
to present you with some observations delivered to 
me by many officers in that brigade, who desire me 
to submit them to your perusal. I know, Sir, (be 
sides I am not of their opinion in the fact itself), 
that I should not accept for you the objections those 
gentlemen could have had, as a body, to any order 
from Congress; but I confess the desire of being 
agreeable to them, of giving them any mark of 
friendship and affection, which is in my power, and 
acknowledging the kind sentiments they honor me 
with, have been my first and dearest considerations. 

Besides that, be pleased to consider that they be 
gan by obeying orders, and want only to let their 
beloved General know which were the reasons of their 
being rather reluctant (as far as reluctance may comply with their duty and honor) to an oath, the 
meaning and spirit of which was, I believe, misunderstood by them. I may add, Sir, with a perfect 
conviction, that there is not one among them but 
would be* thrice happy, were occasions offered to them 
of distinguishing yet, ly new exertions, their love for 
their country, their zeal for their duty as officers, 
their consideration for the civil superior power, and 
their love for your Excellency. 

AVith the greatest respect and most tender affec 
tion, I have the honor to be, &c., 

LAFAYETTE. 
FROM EDMUND RANDOLPH. 

Williamsburg, 21 May, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

It rnay ? perhaps, be some entertainment to you, to 
be informed of the proceedings of the present Assem 
bly. 

After choosing Colonel Harrison Speaker, by a 
great majority, they seemed to be determined against 
every act of legislation which did not, in some measure, tend to the security of independence. The 
sense of the House was taken, as to their inclination 
to proceed upon the report of the revisers of the 
laws; but it was decided that the general business 
of the Commonwealth should be postponed until the 
military arrangements were absolutely settled. But I 
wish the prospect of success was equal to the ardor 
of the law-makers. They have, indeed, a bill, now 
committed to the whole House, for raising two thou 
sand volunteers, to reenforce your Excellency. They 
have annexed numberless seducing advantages, in or 
der to obtain recruits. , But the demon of avarice, 
and spirit of extortion, seem to have expelled pure 
patriotism from the breasts of those who usually compose armies. A regiment of horse is voted, also, to 
consist of three hundred and fifty. This, I conceive, 
will be soon completed, as many men of family and 
fortune propose to enter as privates. 

An act has passed the House of Delegates, agreeably to the recommendation from your Excellency 
and Congress, for the oblivion of past treasons. The 
persons in this country, who will be the objects of 
this law, are few in number, and I am afraid the 
time allowed for their coming in is too short for our act to have any effect in the army. A battalion of 
infantry is to be raised, for garrison duty, at the 
ports and harbours of this State. General Nelson 
leaves Williamsburg to-day, on his way to camp ; but 
it cannot be ascertained, before his arrival at Fredericksburg, what number of troops he will carry with 
him. I am, dear Sir, your Excellency s 

Much obliged, affectionate, humble servant, 

EDMUND RANDOLPH. 



FROM GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

In Congress, 27 May, 1778. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I have a word to say to you upon the subject of 
promotion, which we have just now finished, or rather 
unfinished, at least if that matter was before in an 
unfinished situation. That famous incomprehensible 
Baltimore Resolution (unluckily perhaps) introduced 
a very tedious debate, which terminated, at length, 
by rejecting the whole of what the Committee re 
ported with relation to the promoting of officers. 

You may be a little surprised when I tell you, 
that upon the whole matter I believe this is best. 
But how? It is true, I confess, that much ground of 
heart-burning is left under the Baltimore Resolution 
governing these matters, by the mysterious trinity of 
seniority, merit, and quota. Let me, however, on the 
other hand, observe, that to tie up the hands of the 
Republic, as to the officers whom they are to appoint, 
is utterly inconsistent with the republican principles 
of Government, which ought to prevail among us. 
No danger, it is true, can arise at present; but, my 
dear Sir, we are laying foundations ; and how posterity, in future wars, may build on the foundations 
laid by ancestors, whom they will certainly reverence, 
no man can be hardy enough to assert. 

What, then, you will say, is the effect of the new 
rule ? In my poor opinion, it is no rule. What, 
then, is the use of the Resolution ? Nothing more 
than an apology for officers whom it may be found 
necessary to supersede. Congress, in effect, seem to 
have pledged themselves to their constituents, that 
they will pay a due attention to the quota of troops 
furnished by the States respectively, to the seniority 
of the several officers, and to that degree of military 
ability which nature or industry may have conferred 
upon deserving individuals. You ask me, what is to 
be the rule below the degree of a General Officer? I 
answer, that Congress could not, with propriety, make 
any rule. They have given to the States the power 
of appointing the officers in their own regiments. Of 
consequence, therefore, it would be idle to restrict 
them as to the persons whom they shall appoint. It 
will, therefore, be necessary to make application to 
the several States on the occasion. They have al 
ready, I believe, in most instances, given you the 
necessary power; and if so, then to fix the order of 
promotion will be only a limitation of such power. 
What are my ideas on the occasion, you will see 
by the letter I inclose, directed to Governor Clinton, 
which you will do me the honor to transmit to him. 
I am, dear General, 

Most sincerely, yours, 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

Yorldown, 28 May. We are going on with the arrangement of the army with charming rapidity, after 
a long stop. A very, very little time will, I hope, 



. THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 131 

complete it. I hear you expect soon to be in Phila 
delphia. In my opinion, the instant the enemy eva 
cuate it, the best disciplined troops in the army 
should be marched in, and the several inhabitants or 
dered, on pain of military execution, to confine them 
selves to their houses. Proper persons should then 
be sent to the several stores, to make out lists of 
the goods contained in them. From these lists you 
should mark the articles which may be necessary for 
the army, the hospital, and the like. The next step 
should be to levy a contribution, of at least one hundred thousand pounds sterling, in hard money, which 
ought to be apportioned upon the inhabitants, according to their wealth and disaffection. They may then 
be permitted to go about their usual occupations. 
But the Quarter-master should take proper stores, and 
therein lodge, under guard, the articles by you marked ; and receipts should be by him given, at the rate 
such goods sold immediately before the evacuation; 
and duplicates of such receipts forthwith transmitted 
to the Treasury Board. The propriety of these steps 
I will not dilate upon. But, should they be pursued, 
I think the most beneficial consequences would accrue 
to the public. I am, once more, yours, 

GOTJVEENEUE MORRIS.

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

I was honored with your kind favor of the 7th 
ultimo, on the 19th, accompanying your valuable present, the epaulettes and sword-knot.* You will per

mit me to return my most cordial thanks for them, 
and to assure your Excellency that this testimony of 
your approbation of my conduct fills me with the 
highest sentiments of duty and affection, will always 
be remembered with the warmest gratitude, and ranked among the first honors which have been conferred 
upon me in life. I must have been insensible, in 
deed, not to have felt this honorary, and very parti 
cular mark of respect ; blind, not to have discerned 
the candor and friendship with which I have been 
treated, from my first being honored with a command 
under your Excellency; criminally inattentive, not to 
have noticed the concern you have expressed for my 
safety and perfect recovery ; and must ever be unhappy in reflection, should I not pay you that tri 
bute of love and esteem which justice and gratitudeindispensably demand. 

My leg hath acquired such degree of strength, that 
I can bear considerable weight on it. There have 
been lately several exfoliations the openings are now 
small; the limb is free from pain and inflammation, and 
puts on a better appearance than it hath ever before. 

By the advice of my surgeons, for the sake of a 
ride, I came to this town, the week before the last, 
with Mrs. Lincoln. She w r as immediately taken with 
the smallpox, in the natural way, and now lies very

FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Yorktown, 8 June, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 
My colleague, Mr. Drayton, having shown me, about 
a fortnight ago, the draft of a report which he had 
prepared, stating charges against the General Officers 
who lately abandoned Ticonderoga, and flattering me 
with assurances that he would soon offer it to Con 
gress, I delayed replying to your Excellency s favor 
of the 29th ultimo, hoping for ground to intimate 
that that business was ready to be despatched to yourExcellency, for the further necessary order ; but, to 
my great mortification, it continues to be procrasti 
nated. Some of the gentlemen of the Committee are, 
or have been, desirous of new lights. In a word, Sir, 
I am quite in opinion with those gentlemen who say, 
"the not proceeding in this matter is cruel and op 
pressive," although I am as well convinced the delay has not been calculated or intended to distress 
the parties affected. It has arisen from a vapid, desultory habit, which, if I am not mistaken, I have 
seen squander millions, and endanger States. I speak 
with warmth, and, I believe, with equal truth. On 
my country s account, as well as from a feeling for 
the culprit officers, I am really ashamed of our con 
duct respecting the particular affair in question. How 
ever, as I can always take a decent freedom with my 
colleague, who is really a diligent man, I will not let 
him pass a day unreminded of the necessity for bringing forward his report. I sent off a messenger to 
day, with a letter to Lancaster, at his request, for 
collecting somewhat relative to the business, and I 
think he hinted, that when that ingredient should be 
obtained, the report would be complete. 

Frequent items have been given in public of the 
disagreements of our Commissioners. This day a pri 
vate perusal of papers, treating on that subject, gave 
me much pain. I fear an investigation, upon the arrival of Mr. Dearie, who is every hour expected, will 

VOL. II. 12 
spread the trouble wide. I have suppressed all that 
has been written to me, and have sealed my lips, ex 
cept to your Excellency and one other gentleman. I 
know all the gentlemen yonder, some of them very 
intimately; know their tempers and habits, and think 
I can mark out causes ; but I can only deplore their 
impolitic, and, I was going to say, school-boy jarrings, 
and dread the consequences of a heated and injudi 
cious discussion on this side. 

Wi. Late last night your Excellency s public let 
ter of the 7th w r as brought to me. I shall lay it 
before Congress at 10 o clock. Lord Abingdon s pro 
test does honor to Mr. Morris, of New York ; the 
merit of our resolves, of 22d April, is fairly to be 
ascribed to him.* 

I have lately much regretted that I had it not in 
my power to transmit to your Excellency some of the 
English papers which we had received, and which, 
indeed, came originally into my own hands ; but judged it my duty to present them to the House, w T here 
they were so and so suddenly dispersed, as to 

deprive me of the reading even of one of them; yet 
I dare not say I will take better care another time ; 
my own duty will be r to do as I have done. 

In order to save time, I have sent to the Secre 
tary s office a young man to copy the resolves of 
Congress, required by your Excellency, and which 
will be found here inclosed. 1 am, with the most 
sincere regard and esteem, Sir, your Excellency s 
Much obliged, and most obedient servant, 

HENRY LAURENS.

FROM GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

Yorktown, 9 June, 1778. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I have sent to your address three bundles, containing the several materials collected by the Committee 
for arranging the army. This business being now put 
under your care, I trust you will be enabled speedily 
to put your arm} " in the situation you wish, excepting always the deficiency of numbers, which is, upon 
the whole, well enough, since thereby it happens that 
less of the resources of the country are consumed ; 
and this is certainly a war of resources. The opinion 
of Congress, relative to Philadelphia, you have doubt 
less ere this received. Mine did not arise from any 
pleasure I take in the distresses of my fellow-crea 
tures ; still less from that horrid love of proscriptions, 
which, however dictated, certainly disgraces human 
nature. Simply, I wished that our enemies should be 
mulcted before they were received into our bosom, 
and that we might thereby possess ourselves of the 
sinews of war. 

Should there be still other desiderata as to the 
army, which, indeed, I well know there are, pray let 
me hear of them in a letter, to which I shall call 
the attention of the House, who have now entangled 
themselves in such an infinity of matter, that some 
management is really necessary to lead them to the 
most serious and important objects. The Committee 
had written to Governor Clinton for his assistance in 
arranging the regiments not with you. So much as 
I received in answer to that application you will find 
among the bundles. Whatever may come to hand, 
regarding Gansevoort s regiment, I shall do myself 
the honor to transmit immediately. I am called away. 



136 LETTEllS TO WASHINGTON. 

Should Mrs. Washington be still in camp, which, I 
confess., is rather unlikely, pray present my respects 
to her. I have the honor to be, dear General. 

Yours sincerely, 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



FROM GEORGE JOHNSTONE.* 

(Private.) 

Philadelphia, 10 June, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

I beg to recommend to your private civilities my 
friend Dr. Ferguson. He has been engaged, from his 
early life, in inculcating to mankind the virtuous 
principles you practise. 

* The Earl of Carlisle, Governor George Johnstone, and William 
Eden, in concert with Sir Henry Clinton, were the British Commis 
sioners for negotiating with Congress on the terms of Lord North s 
Conciliatory Bills. They arrived in Philadelphia on the Gth of June. 
Dr. Adam Ferguson was Secretary to the Commissioners. Governor 
Johnstone also wrote a letter of the same date as the above to the 
President of Congress, who replied as follows. 

" Yorktown, 14 June, 1778. 
" DEAR SIR, 

"Yesterday I was honored with your favor of the 10th, and thank 
you for the transmission of those from my dear and worthy friends, 
Mr. Oswald and Mr. Manning; had Dr. Ferguson been the bearer of 
these papers, I should have shown that gentleman every degree of re 
spect and attention, that times and circumstances admit of. 

" It is, Sir. for Great Britain to determine whether her Commis 
sioners shall return unheard by the Representatives of these United 
States, or revive a friendship with the citizens at large, and remain 
among us as long as they please. 

" You are undoubtedly acquainted with the only terms on which 
Congress can treat for accomplishing this good end ; terms, from which, 
although writing in a private character, I may venture to assert with 
great assurance, they never will recede, even admitting the continu 
ance of hostile attempts, and that, from the rage of war, the good 
people of these States shall be driven to commence a treaty westward 
of yonder mountains. And permit me to add, Sir, as my humble 
I also take the liberty of transmitting to your care 
some letters from disconsolate relations, who look up 
for relief from the measures in view, persuaded you 
will forward them safe. I beg to be esteemed, in 
every private consideration, your great admirer, 

And obedient servant, 

GEORGE JOHNSTONE. 



FROM FRANCIS DANA.* 

York, 11 June, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 
I had the honor, last evening, of your favor of the 

opinion, the true interest of Great Britain, in the present advance of 
the contest, will be found in confirming our independence. 

" Congress, in no hour, have been haughty ; but to suppose that 
their minds are less firm in the present than they were when desti 
tute of all foreign aid, even without expectation of an alliance ; when, 
upon a day of general public fasting and humiliation, in their house 
of worship and in the presence of God, they resolved to hold no 
conference or treaty with any Commissioners on the part of Great 
Britain unless they shall, as a preliminary thereto, either withdraw 
their fleets and armies, or, in positive and express terms, acknowledge 
the independence of these States, would be irrational. 

" At a proper time. Sir, I shall think myself highly honored by a 
personal attention, and by contributing to render every part of these 
States agreeable to you ; but, until the basis of mutual confidence 
shall be established, I believe, Sir, neither former private friendships, 
nor any other consideration, can influence Congress to consent that 
even Governor Johnstone, a gentleman who has been so deservedlyesteemed in America, shall see the country. I have but one voice, 
and that shall be against it. But, let me entreat you, my dear Sir, 
do not hence conclude that I am deficient in affection to my old 
friends, through whose kindness I have obtained the honor of the 
present correspondence ; or, that I am not, with very great personal 
respect and esteem, Sir, 

" Your most obedient and most humble servant, 

" HENRY LAURENS." 


9th instant, requesting me to repair to camp, to as 
sist in the business of arranging the army, as soon 
as possible. Although I am impressed with the necessity of that business being finished without delay, 
yet I cannot, in duty to the State I represent, quit 
Congress till the Confederation is ratified, which I 
hope will be done in a few days. In the mean time, 
the arrangement may go on, as General Heed will 
doubtless be at hand to assist you. He has paid a 
particular attention to the battalions of this State ; 
those of Maryland, on account of their distance from 
your camp, the Committee could make no inquiry 
about. These, also, may be arranged without any 
assistance from me ; and, indeed, I know nothing 
about either of them. Those to which I paid a particular attention were the battalions of New Hamp 
shire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Jersey, and Vir 
ginia ; the last of which may be settled by conferring 
with the General Officers of that line, whose recommendation w r e followed. 

I will get the necessary papers from Mr. Morris, 
and forward them to you, with the hope of taking 
some labor from off your hands. I should have been 
happy to have given my immediate attendance in 
camp. I trust by the time you, with the assistance 
of General Heed, may have gone through the batta 
lions of this State, Maryland, and Virginia, to have 
the pleasure of affording you in this business all the 
assistance in my power. I am, dear Sir, with much 
respect and esteem, 

Your most obedient and obliged, humble servant, 

FRANCIS DANA. 

P. S. Should Mrs. Washington be with you, you 
will be pleased to make my most respectful compli 
ments acceptable to her. 
FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL KNOX. 

Artillery Park, 15 June, 1778. 

SIR, 

I feel myself so embarrassed in the duties of the 
department,, of which I have the honor to be the 
head, by the Regulations of Congress of the 12th of 
February last, that I beg the favor of your Excel 
lency to represent the matter to that honorable body 
for further consideration. The awkward situation in 
which I am, without any of the powers appertaining 
to the rank of Commanding Officer of Artillery, the 
expectations from me, without the ability to comply, 
and the bad consequences that may arise to the service in general, induce me to make this representa 
tion ; and I hope the importance of the subject will 
be a sufficient excuse for the trouble it may give 
your Excellency or Congress. 

In all considerable armies in Europe, a General 
Officer has the command and direction of the artil 
lery, and the preparation of every thing pertaining 
to the ordnance department, and of all species of 
arms and accoutrements, offensive and defensive, be 
longing to a soldier. As his charge is very exten 
sive, he is allowed, for his assistance, commissaries, 
clerks, conductors, founders, and artificers, of all 
branches necessary to his profession; all of whom 
are immediately under his direction and receive his 
orders, and he receives orders and renders an account 
of his conduct to the State that employs him. 

In the British service, the Master-General of Ord 
nance, or the Commander-in-chief of the Artillery, has 
a Board of Ordnance, over which he presides, and 
regulates every thing relating to the artillery. This 
Board consists of the Surveyor-General of the Artillery, Clerk of the Ordnance, Storekeepers, and Clerk 
of the Deliveries. There cannot be an instance pointed out, in any service, where the Commissaries or 
Clerks are made independent and unamenable to the 
Commanding Officer of Artillery, as in the Regula 
tions of the Ordnance Department of February 12th. 

It is certainly proper that every head of a depart 
ment should have the direction of all parts of it; 
otherwise he cannot be considered as amenable for 
any deficiencies, which are out of his power to reme 
dy. In the late Regulations, the Commander of the 
Artillery has no power to give the dimensions or 
construction of any carriages or cannon, however erro 
neous they may be ; or directions for making postfires, tubes, fuzes, and a thousand other matters, in 
which his profession and the reputation of his corps 
are intimately concerned, and on which the success 
of actions may depend. 

I have made such minutes for alterations of the 
Regulations alluded to as appear to be indispensably 
necessary for the good of the service, and annexed 
them to the resolves. If the Honorable Congress 
think proper to adopt them, I shall be happy, as I 
shall then be in a post to serve my country with 
reputation. I am, with the greatest respect, yourExcellency s 

Most obedient, humble servant, 

HENRY KNOX. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Yorktown, 18 June, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 
It has not been in my power ; with any convenience, to make an earlier acknowledgment of yourExcellency s favor of the llth. 

There were letters in the Commissioners packet 
only for Congress, and particular members then present in the House. One, for Mr. E. Rutledge, unsealed, and several, also unsealed, were brought, as 
being taken from the express. The utmost caution 
is necessary, in the present conjuncture of our affairs ; 
and, therefore, had any suspicious directions turned 
up, such should have passed under the eye of Con 
gress. The idea of opening other people s letters is 
exceedingly abhorrent to me ; but I think Congress 
have a power over letters equal, at least, to that 
which necessity obliges them sometimes to exercise 
over persons; but Governor Johnstone is too well 
hackneyed in the ways of men to trust his deep 
schemes within our reach. 

His private letter to me, by the by, is, notwithstanding all his good sense, no proof of an infallible 
judgment; I am sure it is one of his having mis 
taken his man. I take the liberty of transmitting it, 
together with my intended answer, and the letters 
from Mr. Osw r ald and Mr. Manning, under this cover, 
for your Excellency s perusal. There are some traits 
in Mr. Oswald s, which strongly imply a determina 
tion, on the part of Great Britain, but reserved as 
the ultimatum, to submit to our independence. I am 
much inclined to believe the Commissioners now are, 
or soon will be, vested with powers for that purpose. 
Mr. Oswald is a gentleman of solid understanding 
and quick perception, of a very large, independent 
fortune, much exceeding a quarter of a million ster 
ling ; often consulted by administration. For the 
goodness of his heart, I refer you to this particularpart of his character; he is no placeman, but muchesteemed by the first men of each of the political 
parties. Great reliance may be placed upon what he 
writes, or even hints. 

Yesterday there was an extraordinary motion on 
our floor for calling upon members to lay before 
Congress such letters as they had received from the 
Commissioners, or other persons, meaning persons in 
Great Britain, on political subjects. I could not for 
bear offering some objections. It appeared to be a 
dangerous attempt to stretch the power of Congress. 
My letters had been read by many members, and 
were at the service of every gentleman who should 
request a perusal; but I would never consent to 
have my property taken from me by an order from 
my fellow-citizens, destitute of authority for the purpose. This circumstance, and some remarks that fol 
lowed, have induced me to put Governor Johnstone s 
letter, and my intended answer, into Mr. Drayton s 
hands, who is collecting materials for displaying the 
Governor s good designs, and no doubt he will, ac 
cording to his usual tone, add pretty severe strict 
ures. Among other papers, I transmit to your Excel 
lency copies of the Commissioners Address to Con 
gress, and of their commission. These are to be pub 
lished by order. If no mistake was made, the copy 
of the answer of Congress was sent to your Excel 
lency yesterday, in my public letter.* 



* These papers, with many others relating to the proceedings of the 
Commissioners, may be found in Almon s liemcnibrancer, Vol. VII. p. 8 
et seq. ; Vol. VI II. pp. 40-72. 

The following is an extract from a letter written by Josiah Bartlett, 
a Delegate in Congress from New Hampshire, to Mr. "YVhipple, of the 
same State, dated Yorktown, June 20th. 

" I have the pleasure to inform you that every member of Congress 
was firm and steady, never to make a peace, but on the principles 
of absolute independence. I am sorry that the answer was deferred some 
I pray God to support and direct your Excellency 
in this moment of extraordinary trial ; and I am, with 
the most sincere esteem and regard, dear Sir, yourmuch obliged and obedient humble servant, 

HENRY LAURENS. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL ARNOLD. 

Philadelphia, 10 o clock, P. M. ; 
22 June, 1778. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

Your Excellency s favor of the 21st, respecting the 
militia, I received at three o clock this evening, and 
immediately had as many inhabitants collected at the 
Coffee-House as I could notify. Fifty volunteers have 
engaged to go with General Cadwalader, who this 
minute informs me he expects to collect a consider 
able number more in the morning, in the city. I 
cannot flatter myself with procuring many in the 
vicinity. These are unarmed. Search is making for 
all the arms in the city. I have ventured to order 
Colonel Jackson to march at three o clock to-morrow 
morning, with the troops under his command. These, 
with the volunteers, and four hundred men now in 
the enemy s rear, will make a formidable body. Their 
places are supplied by Colonel Proctor s regiment, who 
will do garrison duty until a sufficient number of 



days, on account of the zeal of some members for sealing the letters 
up, and sending them back, without reading, in consequence of some 
harsh expressions against the King of France. However, it was over 
ruled, as you will see, and a more proper method, in my opinion, taken. 
What will be their next steps, time only will discover. In the packet 
to Congress were inclosed a great number of letters to the separate 
members. Some from Governor Johnstone to such of the members as 
he was acquainted with, and others from other persons in England, who 
had any acquaintance with them." 
convalescents can arrive from Valley Forge ; for which 
purpose I intend giving an order, which, I trust, will 
meet your Excellency s approbation. 

One hundred and odd deserters from the enemy 
have arrived in town this day. The whole number 
is little short of three hundred, and great numbers, I 
am informed, are scattered through the Jerseys. 

Your Excellency s favor of yesterday, by the In 
dians, was delivered to me this evening. Particularattention shall be paid to the contents. I am, with 
the greatest respect and esteem, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GATES. 

Peekskill, 25 June, 1778. 
SIR, 

To prevent the enemy s army, now marching across 
the Jerseys, from receiving any considerable reenforcement from the troops in and near New York, I 
propose moving the main body of this army to the 
White Plains, and shajl take a strong camp in that 
neighbourhood. I have all my cavalry, and a consider 
able body of infantry, now properly posted between 
the two rivers, to intercept the enemy s parties, and 
cut off their communication with the interior country, 
which has also given the alarm of an attack being 
meditated upon New York, as confirmed by good in 
telligence, which Colonel Graham assures me he has 
received. Probably the slow movements of the enemy, joined to the obstructions thrown in their way, 
may so retard their march through the Jerseys as 
to give your Excellency an opportunity to harass 
them exceedingly with your dragoons and light infantry, aided by the militia, which will most assuredly 
produce, amongst other good things, a considerable 
desertion, and, perhaps, finally such an opening as 
may enable your Excellency to make a glorious finishing of the war. I should apprehend the enemy s re 
sources for provisions on their march must be scanty ; 
and, if they are once obliged to take a fixed position, 
or force your army from a very strong one, their 
desperation may be their ruin. 

In order to eke out the magazine, I have increased 
the quantity of flour and rice, and reduced the meat. 
Of the two former we have large supplies. I think a 
quantity of cured shad might be sent us from the 
southward. I am, Sir, 

Your Excellency s most obedient humble servant, 

HORATIO GATES. 



FROM COLONEL HAMILTON. 

Robins s Tavern, 8 miles from Allentown ; 
12 o clock; 26 June, 1778. 

SIR, 

We have halted the troops at this place. The enemy, by our last reports, were four miles from this 
(that is, their rear), and had passed the road which 
turns off towards South Amboy, which determines 
their route towards Shrewsbury. Our reason for halting is the extreme distress of the troops for want 
of provisions. General Wayne s detachment is almost 
starving, and seem both unwilling and unable to march 
further, till they are supplied. If we do not receive 
an immediate supply, the whole purpose of our detachment must be frustrated. 

This morning we missed doing any thing from a 
deficiency of intelligence. On my arrival at Crau
VOL. II. 13 
berry yester-evening, I proceeded, by desire of the 
Marquis, immediately to Hightstown and Allentown, 
to take measures for cooperating with the different 
parts of the detachment, and to find what was doing 
to procure intelligence. I found every precaution was 
neglected no horse was near the enemy, or could be 
heard of till late in the morning; so that, before we 
could send out parties and get the necessary informa 
tion, they were in full march; and, as they have 
marched pretty expeditionary, we should not be able 
to come up with them during the march of the day, 
if we did not suffer the impediment we do on the 
score of provisions. We are entirely at a loss where 
the army is, which is no inconsiderable check to ourenterprise. If the army is wholly out of supporting 
distance, we risk the total loss of the detachment in 
making an attack. 

If the army will countenance us, we may do some 
thing clever. We feel our personal honor, as well as 
the honor of the army and the good of the service 
interested, and are heartily desirous to attempt what 
ever the disposition of our men will second, and pru 
dence authorize. It is evident the enemy wish to 
avoid, not to engage us. 

Desertions, I imagine, have been pretty consider 
able to-day. I have seen eight or ten deserters, and 
have heard of many more. We have had some little 
skirmishing by detached parties. One attacked their 
rear-guard with a degree of success, killed a few, and 
took seven prisoners. I am, with great respect and 
regard, Sir, 

Your obedient servant. 

ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 

P. S. The Marquis and General Dickinson send 
their compliments. My writing renders theirs unnecessary. 

An officer just comes in, who informs me that he 
left the enemy s rear five miles off, still in march, 
about half an hour ago. To ascertain still more fully 
their route, I have ordered a fresh party on their 
left, towards the head of their column. They have 
three brigades in rear of their baggage. 



FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Hightstown, at a quarter after 7, 26 June, 1778. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I hope you have received my letter from Cran 
berry, where I acquaint you that I am going to 
Hightstown, though we are short of provisions. When 
I got there, I was sorry to hear that Mr. Hamilton, 
who had been riding all the night, had not been able 
to find anybody who could give him certain intelligence ; but, by a party who came back, I hear the 
enemy are in motion, and their rear about one mile 
off the place they had occupied last night, which is 
seven or eight miles from here. I immediately put 
Generals Maxwell s and Wayne s brigades in motion, 
and I will fall lower down, with General Scott s, with 
Jackson s regiment, and some militia, I should be 
very happy if we could attack them before they halt, 
for I have no notion of taking one other moment but 
this of the march. If I cannot overtake them, we 
could lay at some distance, and attack to-morrow 
morning, provided they don t escape in the night, 
which I much fear, as our intelligences are not the 
best ones. I have sent some parties out, and I will 
get some more light by them. 

I fancy your Excellency will move down with the 
army, and if we are at a convenient distance from 
you, I have nothing to fear in striking a blow, if op 
portunity is offered. I believe that, in our present 
strength, provided they do not escape, we may do some 
thing. General Fornian says that, on account of the 
nature of the country, it is impossible for me to be 
turned by the right or left ; but that I shall not quite 
depend upon. 

An officer, just from the lines, confirms the account 
of the enemy moving. An intelligence from General 
Dickinson says, that they hear a very heavy fire in 
the front of the enemy s column. I apprehend it is 
Morgan, who had not received my letter; but it will 
have the good effect of stopping them, and, if we 
attack, he may begin again. 

Sir, I want to repeat to you, in writing, what I 
have told to you, which is, that, if you believe it, or 
if it is believed necessary or useful to the good of 
the service and the honor of General Lee, to send 
him down with a couple of thousand men, or any 
greater force, I will cheerfully obey and serve him, 
not only out of duty, but out of what I owe to that 
gentleman s character. 

I hope to receive soon your orders, as to what I 
am to do this day or to-morrow ; to know where you 
are, and what you intend ; and would be very happy 
to furnish you with the opportunity of completing 
some little advantage of ours. 

LAFAYETTE. 

P. S. The road I understand the enemy are moving by, is the straight road to Monmouth. 
FROM COLONEL HAMILTON. 

28 June, 1778. 



The result of what I have seen and heard con 
cerning the enemy is, that they have encamped with 
their van a little beyond Monmouth Court-House, and 
their rear at Manalapan s River, about seven miles 
from this place. Their march to-day has been very 
judiciously conducted, their baggage in front and 
their flying army in the rear, with a rear-guard of 
one thousand men, about four hundred paces from 
the main body. To attack them in this situation, 
without being supported by the whole army, would 
be folly in the extreme. If it should be thought 
advisable to give the necessary support, the army 
can move to some position near the enemy s left 
flank, which would put them in a very awkward 
situation, with so respectable a body in their rear ; 
and it would put it out of their power to turn either 
flank, should they be so disposed. Their left is 
strongly posted, and I am told their right also. By 
some accounts, one part of his army lies on the road 
leading from the Monmouth road to South Aniboy. 
It is not improbable that South Amboy may be the 
object. 

I had written thus far when your letter to the 
Marquis arrived. This puts the matter on a totally 
different footing. The detachment will march to 
morrow morning, at three o clock, to Englishtown. I 
am, with great esteem and respect, 

Your obedient servant, 

ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 
13* 
FROM BRIGADIER-GENERALS WAYNE AND SCOTT. 

Englishtown. 30 June, 1778. 

SIR, 

We esteem it a duty, which we owe to our country, ourselves, and the officers and soldiers under ourcommand, to state the following facts to your Excel 
lency. 

On the 28th instant, at five o clock in the morning, 
we received orders to march with the following detachments, namely, Scott s and Varnum s brigades, 
Colonels Butler and Jackson in front, amounting to 
seventeen hundred men Colonels Wesson, Livingston, 
and Stewart, with one thousand men, commanded by 
General Wayne ; a select detachment of fourteen hundred men, rank and file, under General Scott, with 
ten pieces of artillery properly distributed among the 
whole. 

About eight o clock, the van under Colonel Butler 
arrived on the left of Monmouth Court-House, on 
the rear of the left flank of the enemy, who were in 
full march, moving in r great haste and confusion. At 
this time our main body, under General Lee, were 
formed at the edge of a wood about half a mile distant from the Court-House. General Wayne, who 
was in front reconnoitring the enemy, perceiving that 
they had made a halt, and were preparing to push 
Colonel Butler with their horse and a few foot, gave 
direction for him to form and receive them, and at 
the same time sent Major Byles to General Lee, re 
questing that those troops might be advanced to 
support those in front, and for the whole to form on 
the edge of a deep morass, which extends from the 
east of the Court-House on the right a very considerable distance to the left. The troops did arrive in 
about an hour after the requisition, and were generally formed in this position. 

About the same time, General Scott s detachment 
had passed the morass on the left, and the enemy s 
horse and foot, that had charged Colonel Butler, were 
repulsed. The number of the enemy now in view 
might be near two thousand, though at first not more 
than five hundred, exclusive of their horse. The 
ground we now occupied was the best formed by 
nature for defence of any, perhaps, in this country. 
The enemy advanced with caution, keeping at a con 
siderable distance in front. General Scott, having 
viewed the position of the enemy, as well as the 
ground where about twenty-five hundred of our troops 
were formed, repassed the morass and took post on 
the left, in a fine open wood, covered by said morass 
in front. 

Whilst this was doing, General Wayne, perceiving 
that the troops on the right, from the wood to the 
Court-House, were retreating, sent Major Fishbourn 
to General Lee, requesting that the troops might re 
turn to support him. In the interim General Waynerepassed the morass, leaving Colonel Butler s regi 
ment to keep post on the right flank of the enemy. 
Generals Scott and Wayne then went together along 
the morass to the Court-House, when Major Fishbourn returned, and said that General Lee gave no 
other answer, than that he would see General Waynehimself, which he never did. The enemy, having now 
an opening on the right of General Scott, began to 
move on, when General Wayne and General Scott sent 
to General Lee to request him at least to form, to 
favor General Scott s retreat ; but this requisition met 
with the same fate as the last. The troops kept still 
retreating, when General Scott, perceiving that he 
would not be supported, filed off by the left. General Wayne ordered Colonel Butler to fall back also. 
Thus were these several select detachments unac 
countably drawn off without being suffered to come 
to action, although we had the most pleasing pro 
spect, from our numbers and position, of obtaining 
the most glorious and decisive victory. After this, 
we fortunately fell in with your Excellency. You 
ordered us to form, part of those troops, whose con 
duct and bravery kept the enemy in play, until you 
had restored order. 

We have taken the liberty of stating these facts, 
in order to convince the world that our retreat from 
the Court-IIouse was not occasioned by the want of 
numbers, position, or wishes of both officers and men 
to maintain that post. We also beg leave to men 
tion, that no plan of attack was ever communicated 
to us, or notice of a retreat, until it had taken place 
in our rear, as we supposed by General Lee s order. 
We are, &c., 

ANTHONY WAYNE, 
CHARLES SCOTT. 



FROM COLONEL MORGAN. 

Middletown, 9 o clock, 2 July, 1778. 

SIR, 

I came to this place early yesterday morning ; the 
enemy had left it the night before ; their main body 
is encamped about three miles from the town ; their 
rear within a mile ; we are in full view of each other. 
I am, and have been ever since I came out, at a 
great loss for light-horse, having none with me. Ge 
neral Scott sent me a sergeant and six, whose horses 
were tired, and were rather an incumbrance, as they 
could scarcely raise a gallop. Major Jameson was 
here yesterday. I applied to him. for a few ; he sent 
Captain Harrison, who staid with me about two hours, 
when Colonel Moylan sent for him. and his party. 
Colonel Moylan certainly has reasons for so doing; 
but, Sir, you know the cavalry are the eyes of the 
infantry, and without any, my situation must not be 
very pleasing, being in full view of the enemy s whole 
army. 

My advance engaged their rear yesterday. They 
reenforced, and sent a column on each flank. We re 
treated to a hill at this end of the town. They 
retreated to their own ground; a few were killed. 
I had one slightly wounded ; but had no horse till 
Cornet Dorsey luckily came up. I am, with esteem, 
Your most obedient and humble servant, 

DANIEL MORGAN. 



FROM WILLIAM HENRY DRAYTON.* 

Philadelphia, 5 July, 1778 

SIR, 

While I am sensible that I hazard your Excellency s 
censure of my discretion, yet I cannot resist the impulse I feel to pay you my little tribute of thanks 
for the important victory of Monmouth, and to ex 
press how much I feel myself tenderly and anxiously 
interested in every thing respecting your safety and 
glory. Your Excellency s invariable conduct naturally 
exposes you to such intrusions, and I rely upon it 
that your good nature will pardon this. 

Personally almost unknown to you as I am, yet, 

* A Delegate in Congress from South Carolina. 
Sir, this obstacle is too weak to prevent a gratifica 
tion on my part which gives me the highest pleasure. 
Somehow or other, nature has composed me of mate 
rials which are apt to force the bounds of common 
decorum, when my affections and gratitude are ex 
cited. 

That your Excellency s life may long be preserved 
in your glorious and disinterested defence of yourcountry, and in the enjoyment of the fruits of yourlabors and victories, is my most fervent prayer ; being, Sir, your Excellency s 

Most obliged and most humble servant, 

WILLIAM HENRY DRAYTON. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia. 7 July, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have had the honor of presenting, to as many 
members of Congress as have been convened in this 
city since the adjournment from York, your Excel 
lency s several favors, of the 28th and 30th of June, 
and 1st instant, and, at their special instance, have 
caused them to be printed, for the information of the 
public. 

I arrived here on Tuesday last, but hitherto have 
not collected a sufficient number of States to form a 
Congress; consequently I have received no commands. 
Your Excellency will therefore be pleased to accept 
this as the address of an individual, intended to assure 
you, Sir, of my hearty congratulations with my countrymen on the success of the American arms, under 
your Excellency s immediate command, in the late 
battle of Momnouth, and more particularly of my own 
happiness in the additional glory achieved by yourExcellency in retrieving the honor of these States in 
the moment of an alarming dilemma. 

It is not niy design to attempt encomiums upon 
your Excellency. I am as unequal to the task as 
the act is unnecessary. Love and respect for yourExcellency is impressed on the heart of every grate 
ful American, and your name will be revered by posterity. Our acknowledgments are especially due to 
Heaven for the preservation of your Excellency s per 
son, necessarily exposed, for the salvation of America, 
to the most imminent danger in the late action. That 
the same hand may at all times guide and shield 
your Excellency, is the fervent wish of, dear Sir, 

Your much obliged and faithful humble servant, 

HENRY LAURENS. 



FROM COUNT D ESTAING. 



At Sea, 8 July, 1778. 

SIR, 

I have the honor of imparting to your Excellency 
the arrival of the King s fleet, charged by his Ma 
jesty with the glorious task of giving his allies, the 
United States of America, the most striking proofs 
of his affection. Nothing will be wanting to my happiness, if I can succeed in it. It is augmented by 
the consideration of concerting my operations with a 
General such as your Excellency. The talents and 
great actions of General Washington have insured 
him, in the eyes of all Europe, the title, truly sublime, 
of Deliverer of America. Accept, Sir, the homage that 
every man, that every military man, owes you ; and 
be not displeased that I solicit, even in the first 
moment of intercourse, with military and maritime 
frankness, a friendship so flattering as yours. I will 
try to render myself worthy of it by iny respectful 
devotion for your country. It is prescribed to me 
by orders, and my heart inspires it. 

I have the honor of rendering an account to Con 
gress of the letter I write to your Excellency. M. 
de Chouin, Major of Infantry in the King s service, 
has orders to present you this. I pray you to grant 
the most extensive confidence to all this officer shall 
tell you on my part. He is a near relation to M. 
de Sartine. This Minister has been long since known 
for his attachment to the common cause. It is less 
the desire of pleasing a statesman, honored with the 
confidence of the King, which has determined me to 
send to you M. Chouin, than an opinion of his mili 
tary knowledge, the clearness of his ideas, and the 
precision with which he will communicate mine. I 
beseech you to grant him your kindness. I have the 
honor to be, with respect, Sir, your Excellency s 
Most humble and most obedient servant, 

ESTAING. 



FROM COUNT D ESTAING. 

In the Eoad without Sandy Hook, 13 July, 1778. 

SIR, 

The desire of communicating speedily with yourExcellency determines me to make a debarkation on 
the coast of Jersey, in a village which, according to 
the map, is to the northward of the river Shrewsbury. 
If our common enemy are in possession, and can be 
driven from it, I shall fulfil the object of my descent. 
An instant of liberty will suffice for a good patriot 
to show himself. Every citizen will be eager to con 
vey my homage to the Deliverer of his country. The 
first moments are so precious, above all upon sea, 
that it may be of the greatest importance for me 
to be informed, four-and-twenty hours sooner or later, 
of the projects of your Excellency. I have orders to 
second them. I dare assure you that I will do it to 
the utmost of my power. To act in concert with a 
great man is the first of blessings; it is one of those 
which flatter me the most in the commission with 
which I am honored. An apprehension that the let 
ter, of which I have now the honor to send a dupli 
cate, may not come to hand till late, makes me ha 
zard a step, the motive for which must be the excuse. 
I have the honor to be, 

ESTAING. 



FROM COUNT D ESTAING. 
In the Road without Sandy Hook, 17 July, 1778. 

SIR, 

The bar of the River Shrewsbury, the officer, sailors, 
and boats that I have lost in the waves, have not 
hindered Colonel Laurens from braving them twice, 
to come and deliver me himself the letter that you 
did me the honor to write me on the 14th of this 
month. The desire of communicating with you alonewould have induced me to hazard a descent myself 
the first, and with four grenadiers as my only sup 
port, in a place, the debarkation of which is as difficult as it was unknown ; and where there existed not 
a single spot proper for embarkation. The sacrifice 
of several of my men appeared to me less affecting, 
as it was the sole means of communication I could 
have. 

I have occupied myself less with discovering the 
number of English vessels of war in the Road of 

VOL. II. 14 
Sandy Hook, than the means of entering it. I sup 
pose there are fourteen vessels of war, a throng of fri 
gates, and a multitude of transports. This superiority 
of number, and the goodness of the English navy, 
will not hinder me from attacking Lord Howe in his 
retrenchment, and under his batteries, if the depth of 
the water do not forbid me. I only received threepilots yesterday ; they have need of re-collecting their 
ideas, and are at this time sounding the river. The 
hope of giving you something positive on this head 
engaged me to pray your estimable, well-informed, 
and most amiable Aid-de-camp, to pass a bad night 
on board the Languedoc. 

He will give you an account, Sir, of the regret I 
shall feel, if this powerful mark of friendship, which 
the King has given his allies, who are so dear to 
him, should not prove of so great utility as he might 
promise himself. 

I will not enter into any further detail in this let 
ter. Mr. Laurens will tell you more than I can 
write. But it will be very important that the arrival of so great a naval succour should produce at 
the same time a general effort by land. If, unfortu 
nately, that should be impossible, you are too good a 
patriot and too good a soldier not to feel the neces 
sity I shall be under of going to seek elsewhere an 
opportunity of injuring our common enemy. The 
places that you shall point out to me will appear to 
me preferable, whenever naval circumstances and the 
state of my supplies will permit. It is with the 
greatest pleasure that I learn, from M. Gerard, the 
King s Minister, that you are clothed with the most 
ample powers to treat with me on military opera 
tions. I cannot act, either far or near, under the aus 
pices of a greater master. You are a master; and 
you know that, the instant one thing becomes , we 

ought to attempt another. 

I have received a printed list of the eleven Eng 
lish vessels of the line, which are announced to us on 
very good part. This news, published by the order 
of Congress, acquires an authenticity which merits the 
highest attention. 

Accept my compliments upon your last victory. 
Even were not the success of America our own, by 
the intimate bands which bind us together, it would 
be impossible, as a soldier and as a man, not to participate in it. It is natural to love to see one laurel 
more adorning the brow of a great man. I have the 
honor to be, with respect, 

Your very humble, and very obedient servant, 

ESTAING. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 
(Private.) 

Philadelphia, 18 July, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

Yesterday I had the honor of writing to your Ex 
cellency a public letter by James Martin, and also 
of presenting to Congress your Excellency s favor of 
the 14th, which the House received with satisfaction. 

Permit me, Sir, to recommend to your Excellen 
cy s protection two packets from the Sieur Gerard to 
Count d Estaing, which will accompany this. I have 
assured Monsieur Gerard that it is altogether unnecessary to urge your Excellency to give these des 
patches the quickest safe passage to the Vice-Admiral. 

Prizes are finding the way into the Delaware. One, 
laden with rum, limes, &c., intended for the enemy s 
refreshment, embraced one of our wharves the evening before last, and I learn a rich ship is on her way 
up. 

I have this moment received a second letter from 
the British Commissioners. If I dared to venture an 
opinion, from a very cursory reading of the perform 
ance, it would be that this is more puerile than any 
thing I have seen from the other side since the commencement of our present dispute, with a little dash 
of insolence, as unnecessary as it will be unavailing. 
If the Marquis de Vienne will indulge me, till I 
return from Congress, your Excellency will find a 
copy of that letter within this. At present, as he is 
on the wing, I must send to obtain his permission ; 
and in order to be quite ready, in case he shall re 
fuse to wait, I conclude this with repeated assurances 
of being, with the highest esteem and respect, dearSir, your Excellency s 

Obliged and obedient, humble servant, 

HENRY LAURENS. 

P. S. Returned from Congress at 9 o clock. A 
resolve, relative to the Commissioners letter, that it 
ought not to be answered, &c., with the letter, will 
appear in print. 



FROM COLONEL HAMILTON. 

Black Point. 20 July, 1778. 



SIR, 

Inclosed I transmit your Excellency a letter from 
Count d Estaing. lie has had the river sounded, and 
finds he cannot enter. He will sail for Rhode Island 
to-morrow evening ; in the mean time, he is making 
demonstrations to deceive the enemy, and beget an 
opinion that he intends to operate in this quarter. 
He would sail immediately, but he waits the arrival, 
or to hear, of a frigate which carried M. Gerard to 
Delaware, and which he appointed to meet him at 
Sandy Hook, so that he fears his sudden and unex 
pected departure, before she arrives, might cause her 
to be lost. He will not, however, wait longer than 
till to-morrow evening. We have agreed that five 
cannon, fired briskly, shall be a signal of his arrival 
by day, and the same number, with five sky-rockets, 
a signal by night. 

In communicating this to General Sullivan, the Count 
wishes not a moment may be lost, and that he may 
be directed to have persons stationed on the coast, 
and intermediate expresses to facilitate the communication between them. Pilots will be a material arti 
cle. He begs every thing may be forwarded as much 
as possible, and as many troops collected as may be. 
He would be glad if a detachment could march from 
your army, or could be sent by water, for which purpose he would send covering ships and some vessels 
he has taken by way of transports ; but he cannot 
think of losing so much time as seems necessary. If 
the water scheme could shorten it, it would be a 
happy circumstance. He recommends it to your at 
tention, and that you would take measures, if the end 
can be better answered in this way, and meet himwith information of the part he may have to act to 
execute the plan. I perceive he can with difficulty 
debark four thousand troops, but he will try to do it. 
I am, Sir, 

Your most respectful and obedient servant, 

ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 
14* 
P. S. I hope your Excellency will excuse my not 
being myself the bearer of these particulars ; the end 
may be answered by letter. Mr. Neville is anxious 
to get on. I have just heard of despatches arrived 
from you ; I don t know but they may contain some 
thing new, which may make the Count wish a good 
conveyance to return an answer. My stay till to 
morrow morning may answer that end. I shall not 
delay coming forward. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Camp at the Plains, 21 July, 1778. 

SIR, 

Your Excellency has made me very unhappy. I 
can submit very patiently to deserved censure ; but 
it wounds my feelings exceedingly to meet with a 
rebuke for doing what I conceived to be a proper 
part of my duty, and in the order of things. 

When I left your Excellency at Haverstraw, you 
desired me to go forward and reconnoitre the country, and fix upon some proper position to draw the 
troops together at, I was a stranger to all this part 
of the country, and could form no judgment of a 
proper place, until I had thoroughly examined the 
ground. 

Croton River was the only place I could find 
suitable to the purpose, all circumstances being 
taken into consideration. I wrote your Excellency 
what I had done, and where I was, that if you had 
any thing in charge I might receive your orders. I 
wrote you the reasons for my not waiting upon you 
in person were, I had many letters to answer, and 
many matters to regulate in my department, which 
prevented me from returning.* Besides which, it 
was almost half a day s ride, the weather exceeding 
hot, and myself not a little fatigued. And here I 
must observe, that neither my constitution nor 
strength is equal to constant exercise. 

As I was a stranger to all the lower country, I 
thought it absolutely necessary for me to come for 
ward. A thorough knowledge of the country is not 
easily obtained ; such a one, at least, as is necessary 
to fix upon the most eligible position for forming a 
camp. The security of the army, the ease and con 
venience of the troops, as well as to perform the du 
ties of my office with a degree of reputation, all 
conspired to make me wish to fix upon the properest 
ground for the purpose. This it was impossible for 
me to do, unless I came on before the troops. And 
I must confess I saw no objection, as your Excel 
lency had wrote me nothing to the contrary, and 
what I wrote naturally led to such a measure. 

I expected you on every hour, and was impatient 
to get forward that I might be able to give some 
account of the country when you came up. Before 
I left Crompond, I desired Mr. Pettit to wait upon 
you at your arrival, and take your orders, and if 
there was any thing special to forward it by ex 
press. 

If I had neglected my duty in pursuit of pleasure, 
or if I had been wanting in respect to your Excel
* General Greene was appointed Quartermaster-General by Con 
gress on the 3d of March, and he had since performed the duties of that 
office in addition to his regular service in the army as Major-General. 
The Quarter-master s department had become much deranged during 
the preceding campaign, and General Greene was prevailed upon to 
accept the appointment as the most proper person, by his energy and 
ability, to bring it into order, and establish an effective system. 
lency, I would have put my hand upon my mouth, 
and been silent upon the occasion ; but, as I am not 
conscious of being chargeable with either the one or 
the other, I cannot help thinking I have been treated 
with a degree of severity that I am in no respect 
deserving. And I would just observe here, that it is 
impossible for me to do my duty if I am always at 
head-quarters. I have ever given my attendance 
there as much as possible, both from a sense of duty 
and from inclination ; but constant attendance is out 
of my power, unless I neglect all other matters ; the 
propriety of which, and the consequences that will 
follow, I submit to your Excellency s consideration. 

Your Excellency well knows how I came into this 
department. It was by your special request, and you 
must be sensible there is no other man upon earth 
would have brought me into the business but you. 
The distress the department Avas in, the disgrace that 
must accompany your operations without a change, 
and the difficulty of engaging a person capable of 
conducting the business, together with the hopes of 
meeting your approbation, and having your full aid 
and assistance, reconciled me to the undertaking. 

I flatter myself, when your Excellency takes a, view 
of the state things were in when I first engaged, 
and consider the short time we had to make the 
preparations for the opening campaign, and reflect 
with what ease and facility you began your march 
from Valley Forge, and continued it all through the 
country r notwithstanding we went great part of the 
way entirely out of the line of preparations, you 
will do me the justice to say I have not been negli 
gent or inattentive to my duty. 

I have, in every respect, since I had my appoint 
ment, strove to accommodate the business of the department to the plan of jour Excellency s operations. 
And I can say, with great truth, that ever since I 
had the honor to serve under you, I have been more 
attentive to the public interest, and more engaged in 
the support of your Excellency s character, than ever 
I was to my own ease, interest, or reputation. 

I have never solicited you for a furlough to go 
home to indulge in pleasure, or to improve my in 
terest, which, by the by, I have neglected, going on 
four years. I have never confined myself to my 
particular line of duty only. Neither have I ever 
spared myself, either by night or day, where it has 
been necessary to promote the public service under 
your direction. I have never been troublesome to 
your Excellency, to publish any thing to my advan 
tage, although I think myself as justly entitled as 
some others, who have been much more fortunate, 
particularly in the action of the Brandywine. 

I have never suffered my pleasures to interfere 
with my duty ; and 1 am persuaded I have given 
too many unequivocal proofs of my attachment to 
your person and interest, to leave a doubt upon yourmind to the contrary. I have always given you my 
opinion with great candor, and executed your orders 
with equal fidelity. I do not mean to arrogate to 
myself more merit than I deserve, or wish to excul 
pate myself from being chargeable with error, and in 
some instances negligence. However, I can speak, 
with a becoming pride, that I have always endea 
voured to deserve the public esteem, and your Excel 
lency s approbation. 

As I came into the Quarter-master s department 
with reluctance, so I shall leave it with pleasure. 
Your influence brought me in, and the want of yourapprobation will induce me to go out. 
I am very sensible of many deficiences, but this 
is not so justly chargeable to my intentions, as to 
the difficult circumstances attending the business. It 
is almost impossible to get good men for the con 
ducting all parts of so complex a business. It may, 
therefore, naturally be expected that many things 
will wear an unfavorable complexion ; but, let who 
will undertake the business, they will find it very 
difficult, not to say impossible, to regulate it in such 
a manner as not to leave a door open for censure, 
and furnish a handle for reproach. I am, with all 
due respect, your Excellency s 

Most obedient, humble servant, 

NATHANAEL GREENE. 



FROM COLONEL HAMILTON. 

Newark, 23 July, 1778. 

SIR, 

I wrote to your Excellency, the evening of the 
20th, by Major Neville. I remained in the neigh 
bourhood of Black Point till the afternoon following. 
The Count had received his expected despatches from 
Congress, and was to sail, as I mentioned before, the 
first fair wind. At Brunswick, yesterday, Mr. Caldwell joined me. He was immediately from the Point, 
and brought intelligence that the fleet got under 
way yesterday morning. The wind, unfortunately, 
has been much against them, which is so much the 
more to be regretted, as they are rather in want of 
water. I need not suggest to your Excellency that 
an essential part of the Ilhode Island plan is, to take 
every possible measure to watch the enemy s motions, and to establish the expresses from place to 
place, to give the Count instant information of any 
movement among their fleet. This will enable himto be in time to intercept them, should they attempt 
to evacuate New York while he is at Rhode Island, 
and will, in general, facilitate the intercourse and co 
operation between him and your Excellency. 

I have nothing new to communicate, besides what 
was sent by Major Neville, and what I now send. 
All the ideas interchanged between the Count and 
myself were such as w r ere familiar before I left 
head-quarters. He was to go to Rhode Island, and, 
in conjunction with General Sullivan, endeavour to 
possess himself of the enemy s ships and troops there, 
if; on his arrival, he had good reason to think it 
could be effected without further assistance. If not, 
he will be glad of a reenforcement from you in the 
most expeditious manner possible. What manner you 
think will be most expeditious, you will adopt; and, 
if his aid may be useful, he will afford it as soon as 
he is informed of it. 

This being the case, my immediate presence at 
head-quarters is the less necessary, as to this busi 
ness ; and I hope your Excellency will indulge me, 
if I do not make all the despatch back which a case 
of emergency would require, though I do not mean 
to delay more than a moderate attention to my frail 
constitution may make not improper. 

ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 
FROM GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Pouglikccpsic, 24 July, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have received your letter of the 23d instant, 
inclosing one to General Schuyler, which I immedi 
ately forwarded to him. I am sensible that, however 
distressing the situation of our western frontier may 
be, your Excellency has taken every method to afford it security that is in your power, consistent 
with the general good of the service. I would not 
wish, therefore, that any representation of mine should 
occasion a diminution of your present force ; and, as 
Colonel Graham s regiment is composed of men who 
are intimately acquainted with every part of the 
country between the enemy s lines and yours, and 
may be of peculiar service where they now are, I 
would beg leave to submit to your Excellency s further consideration, whether it would not be most ad 
visable to continue it with you at present; in which 
case, I will endeavour to call out a larger proportion 
of the militia for the defence of the frontiers. This, 
I think, the militia ought cheerfully to submit to, as, 
if they were not required for that service, it would 
be but reasonable that they should march to reenforce the army under your Excellency s immediate 
command. 

I have already ordered out one fourth part of the 
militia of Orange and Ulster to the western frontier 
of those counties, who will amount to near six hundred men, and have directed them to take their sta 
tions so as to secure the most important passes leading into the settlements. If they do this, and are 
vigilant, I trust that part of the country will experi 
ence a degree of safety. In addition to this, I have 
issued positive orders to Brigadier-General Ten Broeck, 
and the commanding officers of the several regiments 
in Tryon county, to detach one fourth of their militia 
(such regiments as may be necessary for the safety 
of the northern frontier excepted) for the protection 
of the western frontier in that quarter, and to act 
under and assist Colonel Butler in any offensive operations which may be thought necessary to be carried on by him against the enemy. 

Colonel Butler (whose march, on receiving the in 
telligence I lately transmitted to your Excellency, I 
wished to be hastened) was this morning at New 
Windsor, and will proceed directly to Albany, and 
from thence to Schoharie or Cherry Valley, as General Stark (whose department he will then be in) 
shall direct; and, if joined by Alden s regiment, and 
the detachment of militia which I have ordered out, 
they will form a pretty respectable force in that 
quarter. In the mean time, if I should receive any 
new intelligence that may render its augmentation 
necessary, it shall immediately be communicated to 
your Excellency. I propose, if nothing extraordinary 
happens to prevent it, to do myself the pleasure of 
waiting on your Excellency next week. I am, with 
the highest esteem and respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

GEORGE CLINTON. 



FROM COLONEL JOHN LAURENS. 

Point Judith, 40 miles from Providence, 
25 July, 1778. 

SIR, 

I had the honor of writing to your Excellency from 
Lebanon the 23d instant. The day following, at three
VOL. II. 15 
o clock in the afternoon, I arrived at Providence. As 
soon as I had delivered to General Sullivan yourExcellency s despatches and instructions, I set out for 
this place with Colonel Wall, and an ample number 
of pilots, whom General Sullivan had provided and 
put under his command. Colonel Wall is a man of 
character and property, perfectly acquainted with the 
coast, &c. Those under him are experienced pilots, 
and men of responsibility. We arrived here at nineo clock this morning, having been detained till that 
time in procuring a party of militia, and making arrangements both for securing such boats as we shall 
want for our own immediate use, and such as, with 
out this precaution, might be employed in communicating intelligence to the enemy. 

We have agreed with four whaleboat privateers, 
belonging to Connecticut, manned with enterprising, 
experienced mariners, and pressed four belonging to 
this State. We have given them to understand that 
the frigate, lying at Connecticut River, is to push 
out of the Sound, and that we are to meet her with 
hands to enable her to go round and join the French 
fleet, for which purpose their boats are necessary. 
The number that we have is amply sufficient for ourbusiness, and now we are in readiness. Two senti 
nels will be posted, in an advantageous place, whose 
business will be to attend to whatever signals may 
be given from the seaboard ; besides which, Colonel 
Wall, the master pilots, and myself, will alternately 
hold watch, arid keep our attention awake. Till last 
night, twelve o clock, unfavorable winds have prevailed. If the gale, which we have at present, does 
not prove inconstant, it will not be long before we 
are called upon. Our situation commands a view of 
the several entrances to Newport; and Block Island 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 1*71 

is directly opposite to us, so that nothing can pass 
to or from Newport unnoticed. 

General Sullivan estimates the enemy s land force 
here at seven thousand. The state of their shipping, 
he informs me, is as follows ; in the east channel 
(or that between Seconet Point and Rhode Island), 
tAVO galleys and one small frigate ; in the west chan 
nel (or that between Boston Neck and Connanicut 
Island), two small frigates ; in the middle, or main 
channel, two frigates ; at Newport, two or three fri 
gates. As General Sullivan will probably write to 
your Excellency, I forbear descending to farther particulars. He has been indefatigable, and nothing on 
his part will be wanting. I have the honor to be, 
with the greatest respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

JOHN LAURENS 



FROM COUNT D ESTAING. 



At Sea, 3 August, 1778. 

SIR, 

It is difficult to console one s self for the obstacles, 
as numerous as insurmountable, which stopped me at 
Sandy Hook. The importance of New York, the happiness of fighting the English fleet, and the extreme 
satisfaction of acting directly with you, made me desire, with the greatest ardor, the possibility of entering. I offered, to too little purpose, in an assembly 
of your experienced pilots, a recompense of fifty 
thousand crowns to him who should find us a suffi 
ciency of water. It is only by action that my regret 
can be diminished, and as yet we do nothing. Yourforesight and your orders have, nevertheless, antici 
pated my wants, and rendered my delays less long. 
The re enforcement you have so properly sent, will, as 
I am informed, arrive this evening, and it will, most 
assuredly, be on the part yon have so wisely and expeditionsly taken, that our success will depend. 

General Sullivan has done me the honor to come 
and see me, and to communicate his views. I will 
second them with all my power. He is full of that 
spirit of activity and combination, with which you 
inspire all those who have served under your orders. 
I believe him as fully persuaded as I am of the necessity of acting. The intrenchments that are visible 
above Connanicut increase daily. They are numerous. 
The time I have been at sea begins to make me lose 
a number of men with the scurvy. The extreme 
difficulty of procuring water at Shrewsbury, and the 
tardiness with which it is collected here from differ 
ent places, have long since obliged me to retrench 
our allowance. The officers and men support this 
terrible privation with courage and patience ; and we 
have acquired a virtue which has, hitherto, been re 
fused us, the virtue of perseverance. We doubtless 
owe it to the flattering hope of being useful to allies, 
whom our national taste had itself given us, before 
the orders of the King had prescribed it. 

The gentlemen, your Generals, will acquit them 
selves better than I of the duty of rendering you an 
account of the certain state of the preparations going 
on, and of the small burning of three English vessels, 
which guarded the eastern channel. I will confinemyself by repeating to you, what I cannot well describe, the zeal and the infinite pains of LieutenantColonel Laurens. He is on the wing the four-andtwenty hours round, to procure us refreshments and, 
when this is done, remains on board during a very 
long day with all the patience of an old sailor. We 
are indebted to him for a hospital established on 
shore, and for disembarrassing us of our prisoners; 
which, in our situation, form two important articles. 

I desire much that the present expedition may be 
speedily terminated, to give me leisure to employ 
myself with purging the Sound of the English ves 
sels which now infest the navigation. I have received Colonel Sears with all the consideration and all 
the confidence which those merit whom you are 
pleased to send me, and, when it shall be time for it, 
I will consult him with the greatest eagerness. Ac 
cept the homage of the attachment and respect, with 
which I have the honor to be, Sir, 

Your most obedient and most humble servant, 

ESTAING. 

P. S. Since writing my letter, I received that 
which you had the goodness to address me, on the 
26th of July, by Major-General Greene. I am going 
to look for him on shore, that he may not lose any 
of the present precious moments. The reputation of 
this General Officer made his arrival to be wished. 
His influence on his countrymen, and his knowledge 
of the country, will render him formidable to ourcommon enemy. You know how to divine whatever 
we stand in need of; and, from what I have seen, 
the discerning and employing men proper to the busi 
ness in hand, seems to be one of the qualities which 
compose the illustrious character you bear. This is, 
perhaps, the most important part of the great Ge 
neral. 



15* 
FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Providence, 6 August, 1778. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I have received your Excellency s favor by General Greene, and have been much pleased with the 
arrival of a gentleman, who, not only on account of 
his merit and the justness of his views, but also by 
his knowledge of the country, and his popularity in 
this State, may be very serviceable to the expedition. 
I willingly part with the half of my detachment, 
though I had a great dependence upon them, as you 
find it convenient to the good of the service. Any 
thing, my dear General, you w r ill order, or even wish, 
shall always be infinitely agreeable to me, and I will 
always feel happy in doing any thing which may 
please you, or forward the public good. I am of the 
same opinion as your Excellency, that dividing ourContinental troops among the militia will have a bet 
ter effect than if we were to keep them together in 
one wing. 

You will receive, by General Sullivan, an account 
of his dispositions, preparations, &c. I therefore have 
nothing to add, but that I have been on board of 
the Admiral the day before yesterday. I saw among 
the fleet an ardor, and a desire of doing something, 
which would soon turn into impatience if we don t 
give them a speedy occasion of fighting. The officers cannot contain their soldiers and sailors, who are 
complaining that they have been these four months 
running after the British, without getting at them ; 
but I hope they will be soon satisfied. 

The Count d Estaing was very glad of my arrival, 
as he could open freely his mind to me. He ex 
pressed the greatest anxiety on account of his wants 
of every kind, provisions, water, &c. He hopes the 
taking of Rhode Island will enable him to get some 
of the two above-mentioned articles. The Admiral 
wants me to join the French troops to those I command, as soon as possible. I confess I feel very 
happy to think of my cooperating with them ; and, 
had I contrived in my mind an agreeable dream, I 
could not have wished a more pleasing event than 
my joining my countrymen with my brothers of Ame 
rica, under my command, and the same standards. 
When I left Europe, I was very far from hoping such 
an agreeable turn of our business in the American 
glorious revolution. 

Though I have no account, neither observations, to 
give to your Excellency, as I am here a man-of-warof the third rate, I will, after the expedition, scribble 
some lines to you, and join, to the account of General 
Sullivan, the assurance that I have all my limbs ; and 
that I am, with the most tender affection, and entire 
confidence, yours, with high respect, 

LAFAYETTE. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SULLIVAN. 
Head-Quarters, on Rhode Island, 13 August, 1778. 

DEAR GENERAL&gt; 

In my last I had the honor to inform you of my 
being in possession of the enemy s works on the 
north part of Rhode Island, and of the arrival of the 
British fleet the moment we had landed; as also of 
the sailing of Count d Estaing in quest of them. As 
this unfortunate circumstance deprived us of the assist 
ance we promised ourselves from the French troops, 
I waited on the ground till the 10th, at night, when, 
finding my numbers had increased sufficiently to warrant my advancing to the town, without waiting the 
return of the fleet, I issued orders for the army to 
inarch the llth, at six in the morning. But fortune, 
still determined to sport longer with us, brought on 
a storm so violent that it last night blew down and 
almost ruined all the tents I had. The arms, of 
course, were rendered useless, and almost the whole 
of our ammunition ruined. The much greater part 
of the army have no kind of coverings, nor would 
tents, if they had them, prove a sufficient security 
against the severity of the storm. My men are 
mostly lying under the fences, half covered with 
water, without ammunition, and with arms rendered 
useless. 

The communications between us and the main are 
cut off by the violence of the wind, which will scarce 
ly permit a whaleboat to pass. Should the enemy 
come out to attack us, our dependence must be upon 
the superiority of our numbers and the point of the 
bayonet. How our militia may behave on such an 
occasion, I am unable to determine. To retreat is 
impossible; therefore we must conquer or perish. 
Perhaps, under such circumstances, an attack upon 
us might be of great advantage. Several men have 
perished from the severity of the weather, and I ex 
pect more will, as I see no probability of the storm 
ceasing. All our hopes of assistance from the French 
fleet are at an end, as this storm must have driven 
them far off from tin s post, and, I am very apprehensive, quite off the coast. To combat all these mis 
fortunes, and to surmount all these difficulties, requires 
a degree of temper and persevering fortitude, which I 
can never boast of, and which few possess in so am 
ple a manner as your Excellency. I will, however, 
endeavour, by emulating the example, to rise superior 
to the malevolence of fortune and my present lament 
able situation, as quick as possible; and, if Heaven 
will cease to frown, endeavour to gratify your Ex 
cellency s desires. I am sorry your Excellency s let 
ter, respecting the enemy s burning their shipping, 
did not arrive till they had burnt and sunk the whole 
of their vessels of war, and sunk almost all the other 
vessels, to block up the channel. 

The letter of your Excellency, inclosing that to the 
Count d Estaing, did not arrive till after he had sailed. The intelligence from the Council of Massachu 
setts, informing that Admiral Byron, with thirteen 
large ships of the line, was spoken with off the West 
ern Islands, also arrived the day after he sailed. This 
account says that Byron was spoken with on the 29th 
of June. The fleet which arrived here, and the Count 
was in pursuit of, was Lord Howe s fleet, among which 
were only five sail of the line. The rest, smaller ves 
sels of war, and transports. They landed no men 
here. 

I was apprehensive that some such event as this 
might happen to deprive me of the Count s assist 
ance. This induced me to call for more men than I 
should otherwise have done. The numbers of the 
enemy are nearly thus : 

Two Hessian regiments, GOO each, . . 1,200 
Two Anspach, 500 each, . . . 1,000 
Brown and Fanning, . . . . 600 
22d, 38th, 43d, and 54th British, 400 each, 1,600 
Two Hessian regiments, 500 each, . . 1,000 
Whitman s regiment, . . . . 100 

5,500 
To these we may add one thousand seamen, 1,000 

6,500 
My numbers on the Island are about nine thou 
sand, rank and file. Deserters come out in great 
numbers. 

I have the honor to be ; my dear General, &c., 

JOHN SULLIVAN. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SULLIVAN. 

Camp, before Newport, 23 August, 1778. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

The Fates have decreed that you shall receive no 
thing but disagreeable intelligence from this quarter. 
Major-General Greene and the Marquis returned, the 
night before last, from the French Admiral. My let 
ter, their entreaties, and General Greene s written re 
monstrance, drawn up on board the Languedoc, have 
only produced the letter which I inclose. It seems 
that the Captains of the French fleet are so incensed 
at the Count d Estaing s being put over them, he being but a land officer, that they are determined to 
prevent his doing any thing that may redound to his 
credit or our advantage. The Count himself wished 
to come in, but his Captains were, to a man, for leaving us. I then drew up a letter, in behalf of all the 
officers of the army, and sent on board ; but he, though 
the wind was not fair for Boston, put oil to sea night 
before last. This letter was followed by the inclosed 
protest, both of which I have ordered after him, in ;i 
fast-sailing privateer. I arn, however, well persuaded 
that nothing will alter the determinations of the Captains, and that he will follow their counsel, though ho 
knows they wish his ruin. 

This sudden and unexampled procedure renders my 
situation exceeding delicate. The enemy have twice 
attempted to relieve the place by reinforcements ; the 
last fleet had four thousand troops on board. Should 
they make another attempt, they must succeed. They 
will then have near ten thousand troops on the Is 
land, and the command of the water on every sideof us, as we have been obliged to dismantle our forts 
at Bristol and Tiverton to forward our operations 
against the town. 

I inclose to your Excellency a copy of the ques 
tions proposed by me to the General Officers and 
Commandants of brigades this day. I also inclose to 
your Excellency a copy of the protest sent after the 
Count d Estaing. As my situation, at present, can 
promise nothing to advantage, except from a sudden 
attack, I wish the opinions of the officers may justify 
me in making this last effort. I have the honor to 
be, my dear General, 

Yours, most affectionately, 

JOHN SULLIVAN. 

P. S. I offered the Count, in my letter, to make 
the attack the moment he would land the troops, and 
put them in the boats I had prepared for them. 
General Greene and the Marquis assured him that 
we would not require the stay of his fleet and troops 
more than forty-eight hours. But nothing could in 
duce him to assist us with either, a single moment. 



FROM COLONEL LAURENS. 

Camp, before Newport, 23 August, 1778. 

SIR, 

I am just returned from a fruitless pursuit of the 
French squadron. General Sullivan will inform yourExcellency of the fatal determination of the Count s 
officers in a Council of War, as well as of the several 
remonstrances, and final solemn protest, made by the 
American Generals. The Admiral s ship being dismantled, fore and aft, at the moment he had overtaken 
the British fleet, and was promising himself an important victory, another ship of the line being in 
like manner dismantled, and a seventy-four gun ship 
being separated from the squadron, all the effects 
of a most dreadful storm which suddenly arose, were 
regarded as sufficient reasons, added to the expecta 
tion of Admiral Byron s arrival, for abandoning the 
American troops in the midst of a very important ex 
pedition, and reducing them to the necessity of making a desperate attack or a precipitate retreat. 

The honor of the French nation, the honor of the 
Admiral, the safety of his fleet, and a regard for the 
new alliance, required a different conduct ; but the 
Count s hands w r ere tied. The cabal of marine officers, who wish his destruction because he was intro 
duced from the land service into their corps, left 
him, it is said, no choice. I cannot, however, but be 
of opinion, that a solemn protest might, by affording 
a justification for his acting in direct contradiction to 
the unanimous voice of his officers, have induced himto remain here. lie might have been furnished, at 
this place, with all the means of refitting which he 
can expect at Boston. lie might have been as well 
secured against a superior force ; and, in case he had 
chosen to fight, he would have been in better condi 
tion in still water, with dismantled vessels, where 
every one knows that, with springs upon his cables, 
he might fight his artillery as w r ell as if he had 
masts and sails ; whereas, at sea, in case of a separa 
tion from his fleet, the Languedoc may fall a prey 
to a vessel of half her force. 
As I find that I am detaining the express, and I 
am sure General Sullivan will have written your Ex 
cellency more fully than my present hurry and con 
fusion of ideas, for want of sleep, will permit me to 
do, I must entreat your Excellency s excuse for closing my letter abruptly. I have the honor to be, with 
the greatest respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

JOHN LAURENS. 



FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Camp, before Newport, 25 August, 1778. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

I had expected, in answering your first letter, that 
something interesting would have happened that I 
might communicate to your Excellency. Every day 
was going to terminate our uncertainties; nay, every 
day was going to bring the hope of a success, which 
I did promise myself to acquaint you of. Such was 
the reason of my deferring what my duty and inclination did urge me to do much sooner. I am now 
indebted for two favors of yours, which I beg leave 
to offer here my thanks for. The first letter reached 
me in the time we expected to hear again from the 
French fleet; the second I have just received. My 
reason for not writing the same day the French fleet 
went to Boston was, that I did not choose to trouble 
your friendship with the sentiments of an afflicted, 
injured heart, and injured by that very people I came 
from so far to love and support. Don t be surprised, my dear General; the generosity of your honest 
mind would be offended at the shocking sight I have 
under my eyes. 

VOL. II. 16 
So far am I from a critical disposition, that I will 
not give you the journal of our operations, neither 
of several instances during our staying here, which, 
however, might occupy some room in this letter. I 
will not even say to you, how contracted was the 
French fleet, when they wanted to come in at their 
arrival, which, according to the report of the animadverters, would have had the greatest effect; how 
surprised was the Admiral, when, after a formal and 
agreed convention, one hour after the American General had given a new written assurance, our troops 
made the landing a day before it was expected ; how 
mortified the French officers were to find out that 
there was not a gun left in these very forts, to whose 
protection they w 7 ere recommended. All these things, 
and many others, I W 7 ould not take notice of, if they 
were not at this moment the supposed ground upon 
which it is said that the Count d Estaing is gone on 
to Boston. Believe me, my dear Sir, upon my honor, 
the Admiral, though a little astonished by some in 
stances of conduct on our part, did consider them in 
the same light as you and myself would have done ; 
and, if he is gone off, it is because he thought himself obliged by necessity. 

Let us consider, my dear General, the motions of 
that fleet, since it was proposed by the Count d Es 
taing himself, and granted by the King in behalf of 
the United States. I will not go so far up as to re 
member other instances of the affection the French 
nation have for the Americans. The news of that 
fleet have occasioned the evacuation of Philadelphia. 
Its arrival has opened all the harbours, secured all the 
coasts, obliged the British navy to be together. Six 
of those frigates (two of them I have seen sufficient 
for terrifying all the trading people of the two Carolinas) are taken or burnt. The Count d Estaing went 
to offer battle, and act as a check to the British navy, 
for a long time. At New York it was agreed he 
should go to Rhode Island, and there he went. They 
prevented him from going in at first; afterwards he 
was desired to come in, and so he did. The same 
day we landed, without his knowledge, an English 
fleet appears in sight. His being divided into threeparts by our directions (for, though he is a Lieu 
tenant-General, he never availed himself of that title), 
made him uneasy about his situation. But, finding 
the next morning that the wind was northerly, being 
also convinced that it was his duty to prevent any 
reinforcement at Newport, he goes out, under the 
hottest fire of the British land-batteries; he puts the 
British navy to flight, and pursues them, and they 
were all in his hands when that horrid storm arrived 
to ruin all our hopes. Both fleets are divided, scat 
tered. The Caesar, a seventy-four gun ship, is lost; 
the Marseillais, of the same size, loses her masts, and, 
after that accident, is obliged to send back [permit 
to escape ?] an enemy s ship of sixty-four ; the Languedoc, having lost her masts, unable to be governed 
and make any motions, separated from the others, is 
attacked by a ship of the line, against which she 
could only bring six guns. 

When the storm was over, they met again in a 
shattered condition, and the Csesar was not to be 
found. All the Captains represented to their General, 
that, after a so long navigation, in such a want of 
victuals, water, &c., which they had not yet been 
supplied with, after the intelligence given by General 
Sullivan, that there was a British fleet coming, they 
should go to Boston; tout the Count d Estaing had 
promised to come here again, and so he did, at all 
events. The news of his arrival and situation canie 
by the Senegal; a frigate taken from the enemy. Ge 
neral Greene and myself went on "board. The Count 
expressed to me, not so much to the envoy from Ge 
neral Sullivan, as to his friend, the unhappy circum 
stances he was in. Bound by express orders from the 
King to go to Boston in case of an accident or supe 
rior fleet, engaged by the common sentiment of all 
the officers, even of some American pilots, that he would 
ruin all his squadron in deferring his going to Boston, 
he called a new Council of War, and, finding every 
body of the same opinion, he did not think himself 
justifiable in staying here any longer, and took leave 
of me with true affliction, not being able to assist 
America for some days ; which has been rewarded with 
the most horrid ungratefulness. But no matter. I am 
only speaking of facts. The Count said to mo these 
last words : "After many months of sufferings, my men 
will rest some days ; I will man my ships, and, if I 
am assisted in getting masts, &c., three weeks after 
my arrival I shall go out again, and then we shall 
fight for the glory of the French name, and the inte 
rests of America," 

The day the Count went off, the General American 
Officers drew up a protestation, which, as / had been 
very strangely called there ^ I refused to sign ; but I 
wrote a letter to the Admiral. The protestation and 
the letter did not arrive in time. 

Now, my dear General, I am going to hurt yourgenerous feelings by an imperfect picture of what I 
am forced to see. Forgive me for it ; it is not to the 
Commander-in-chief, it is to my most dearest friend. 
General Washington, that I am speaking. I want to 
lament with him the ungenerous sentiments I have 
been forced to see in many American breasts. 
Could you believe that, forgetting any national 
obligation, forgetting what they were owing to that 
same fleet, what they were yet to expect from them, 
and, instead of resenting their accidents as those of 
allies and brothers, the people turned mad at their 
departure, and, wishing them all the evils in the 
world, did treat them as a generous one would be 
ashamed to treat the most inveterate enemies ? You 
cannot have any idea of the horrors which were to 
be heard on that occasion. Many leaders themselves, 
finding they were disappointed, abandoned their minds 
to illiberality and ungratefulness. Frenchmen of the 
highest character have been exposed to the most disagreeable circumstances; and yet, myself the friend 
of America, the friend of General Washington, I am 
more upon a warlike footing in the American lines 
than when I came near the British lines at Newport. 

Such is, my dear General, the true state of mat 
ters. I arn sure it will infinitely displease and hurt 
your feelings. I am also sure you will approve the 
part I have taken in it, which was, to stay much at 
home with all the French gentlemen who are here, 
and declare, at the same time, that any thing thrown 
before me against my nation, I would take as the 
most particular affront. 

Inclosed I send you the general orders of the 24th, 
upon which I thought I was obliged to pay a visit 
to General Sullivan, who has agreed to alter them in 
the following manner. Remember, my dear General, 
that I don t speak to the Commander-in-chief, but 
to my friend ; that I am far from complaining of any 
body. I have no complaints at all to make to you 
against any one ; but I lament, with you, that I have 
had an occasion of seeing so ungenerous sentiments 
in American hearts. 
16* 
I will tell you the true reason. The leaders of the 
expedition are, most of them, ashamed to return, after 
having spoken of their Rhode Island success in proud 
terms before their family, their friends, their internal 
enemies. The others, regardless of the expense France 
has been put to by that fleet, of the tedious, tire 
some voyage which so many men have had for their 
service, though they are angry that the fleet takes 
three wrecks of the whole campaign to rent them 
selves, cannot bear the idea of being brought to a 
small expense, to the loss of a little time, to the 
fatigue of staying some few days more in a camp at 
some few miles off their houses ; for I am very farfrom looking upon the expedition as having miscarried, and I see even a certainty of success. 

If, as soon as the fleet is repaired (which in case 
they are treated as one is in a country one is not at 
war with, would be done in three weeks from this 
time), the Count d Estaing was to come around, the 
expedition seems to offer a very good prospect. If 
the enemy evacuates New York, we have the whole 
Continental army ; if not, we might, perhaps, have 
some more men ; what number, however, I cannot 
pretend to judge. All that I know is, that I shall 
be very happy to see the fleet cooperating with General Washington himself. 

I think I shall be forced, by the Board of General Officers, to go soon to Boston. That I will do as 
soon as required, though with reluctance, for I do not 
believe that our position on this part of the Island is 
without danger ; but my principle is, to do every 
thing which is thought good for the service. I have 
very often rode express to the fleet, to the frigates, 
and that, I assure you, with the greatest pleasure ; on 
the other hand, I may, perhaps, be useful to the fleet. 
Perhaps, too, it will be in the power of the Count to 
do something which might satisfy them. I wish, my 
dear General, you could know as well as myself, how 
desirous the Count d Estaing is to forward the public 
good, to help your success, and to serve the cause 
of America. 

I earnestly beg you will commend, to the several 
chief persons of Boston, to do every thing they can 
to put the French fleet in a situation for sailing soon. 
Give me leave to add, that I wish many people, by 
the declaration of your sentiments in that affair, could 
learn how to regulate theirs, and blush at the sight 
of your generosity. 

You will find my letter immense. I began it oneday and finished it the next, as my time was swal 
lowed up by those eternal Councils of War. I shall 
have the pleasure of writing you from Boston. I am 
afraid the Count d Estaing will have felt to the 
quick the behaviour of the people on this occasion. 
You cannot conceive how distressed he was to be 
prevented from serving this country for some time. 
I do assure you his circumstances were very critical 
and distressing. For my part, my sentiments are 
known to the world. My tender affection for General 
Washington is added to them; therefore, I want no 
apologies for writing upon what has afflicted me, both 
as an American and as a Frenchman. 

I am much obliged to you for the care you are so 
kind as to take of that poor horse of mine ; had he 
not found such a good stable as that at head-quarters, 
he would have cut a pitiful figure at the end of his 
travels, and I should have been too happy, if there 
had remained so much of the horse as the bones, the 
skin, and the four shoes. 

Farewell, iny dear General; whenever I quit you, 
I meet with some disappointment and misfortune. I 
did not need it, to desire seeing you as much as possible. With the most tender affection and high re 
gard, I have the honor to be, &c. 

LAFAYETTE. 

Dear General ; I must add to my letter, that I 
have received one from General Greene, very differ

seems there very sensible of what I feel. I am very 
happy when placed in a situation to do justice to 
any one. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Camp, near Newport, 28 August, 1778. 

SIR, 

Your Excellency s favor of the 21st came to hand 
the evening of the 25th. 

In my last I communicated to your Excellency the 
departure of the Count d Estaing with his fleet, for 
Boston. This disagreeable event has, as I apprehend, 
ruined all our operations. It struck such a panic 
among the militia and volunteers, that they began to 
desert by shoals. The fleet no sooner set sail, than 
they began to be alarmed for their safety. This mis 
fortune damped the hopes of our army, and gave 
new spirits to that of the enemy. 

We had a very respectable force, as to numbers ; 
between eight and nine thousand, rank and file, upon 
the ground ; but of these we attempted to select a 
particular corps to possess ourselves of the enemy s 
lines, partly by force, and partly by stratagem; but 
w r e could not make up the necessary number that 
was thought sufficient to warrant the attempt, which 
was five thousand, including the Continental and 
State troops. This body was to consist of men, who 
had been in actual service before, not less than ninemonths. However, the men were not to be had, and, 
if they could have been found, there was more against 
it than for it. Colonel Laurens was to have opened 
the passage by landing within the enemy s lines, and 
getting possession of a redoubt at the head of Easton s beach. If we had failed in the attempt, the 
whole party must have fallen a sacrifice, for their 
situation would have been such that there was no 
possibility of getting off. 

I shall inclose your Excellency a plan of the enemy s works, and of their strength, from the best ac 
counts w r e are able to get. They have never been 
out of their lines since the siege began, till, night be 
fore last, Colonel Bruce came out with one hundred 
and fifty men, to take off a small picket of ours, 
posted at the neck of Easton s beach. He partly suc 
ceeded in the attempt, by the carelessness of the old 
guard. He came over after dark, and lay in ambush, 
that when the new guard went down to take their 
post, the enemy came upon their backs before they 
discovered them, it being very dark. We lost twen 
ty-four privates and two subalterns. Ten of the 
picket got off. 

Our strength is now reduced from nine thousand 
to between four and five thousand. All our heavy 
cannon on garrison carriages, and heavy and superflu 
ous stores of every kind, are removed to the main, 
and to the north end of the Island, where we intend 
to intrench and attempt to hold it, and w r ait the 
chance of events. General Hancock is gone to Boston to forward the repairs of the fleet, and to prepare the mind of the Count for a speedy return. 
How far he will succeed, I cannot pretend to say. I 
think it a matter of some doubt yet, whether the 
enemy will reenforcc, or take off this garrison. If 
they expect a superior fleet from Europe, they will 
reenforce ; but, if not, they will remove the garrison. 

Your Excellency may rest assured, that I have doneevery thing in my power to cultivate and promote a 
good understanding, both with the Count and the 
Marquis, and flatter myself that I am upon very good 
terms with them both. The Marquis s great thirst 
for glory, and national attachment, often run him into 
errors. However, he did every thing to prevail on 
the Admiral to cooperate with us, that man could 
do. People censure the Admiral with great freedom, 
and many are imprudent enough to reproach the 
nation through the Admiral. General Sullivan very 
imprudently issued something like a censure in ge 
neral orders. Indeed, it was an absolute censure. It 
opened the mouths of the army in very clamorous 
strains. The General was obliged to explain it away 
in a few days. The fermentation seems to be now 
subsiding, and all things appear as if they would go 
smoothly on. The Marquis is going to Boston, also, 
to hasten the Count s return, and, if possible, to get 
the Erench troops to join the land forces here, which 
will more effectually interest the Count in the success 
of the expedition. 

Eive sail of British ships have got into Newport 
within two days past. We have heard nor seen no 
thing of the fleet of transports your Excellency 
mentioned, in your letter to General Sullivan of the 
23d. If they arrive with a large reenforcenient, ourexpedition is at an end, unless it is by way of 
blockade, and that will depend upon the French 
fleet s being superior to that of the British, 
General Sullivan has done every thing that could 
be expected, and had the fleet cooperated with us as 
was at first intended, and agreeably to the original 
plan of the expedition, we must have been successful. 
I wish it was in my power to confirm General Sulli 
van s prediction of the 17th, but I cannot flatter my 
self with such an agreeable issue. I am sensible he 
is in common very sanguine, but his expectations 
were not ill-founded in the present case. We had 
every reason to hope for success, from our numbers, 
and from the enemy s fears. Indeed, General Pigot 
was heard to say, the garrison must fall, unless they 
were speedily relieved by a British fleet. If we could 
have made a landing upon the south part of the 
town, two days would have put us in complete possession of it. Nothing was wanting to effect this, but 
the cooperation of the fleet and French forces. The 
disappointment is vexatious and truly mortifying. 
The garrison was so important, and the reduction so 
certain, that I cannot with patience think of the 
event. The French ship that was missing has got 
into Boston. The rest of the fleet have not got there 
yet, or at least we have no accounts of their arrival. 

We are verv anxious to learn the condition of Lord 

/ 

Howe s fleet. The French seventy-four that has got 
into Boston had an engagement with a British sixtyfour. The Captain and Lieutenant of the former were 
both wounded; one lost a leg, the other an arm. 

Our troops are in pretty good health, and well furnished with provisions, and every thing necessary for 
carrying on the expedition. 

Our approaches were pushed on with great spirit, 
while we had any hopes of the fleet cooperating with 
us ; but the people lost all relish for digging, after 
that. 
People are very anxious to hear the issue of General Lee s trial. Various are the conjectures ; but 
everybody agrees he is not acquitted. 

August olst. Camp Tiverton. I wrote the foregoing, and intended to have sent it by the express 
that went off in the morning, but while I was writing, I was informed the express was gone; and the 
change of situation and round of events that have 
since taken place, have prevented my forwarding 
what I had wrote, as matters seemed to be coming 
to a crisis. 

On the evening of the 29th, the army fell back to 
the north end of the Island. The next morning, the 
enemy advanced upon us in two columns upon the 
east and west road. Our light troops, commanded by 
Colonel Livingston and Colonel Laurens, attacked the 
heads of the columns about seven o clock in the morning, but were beat back they were reinforced with 
a regiment upon each road. The enemy still proved 
too strong. General Sullivan formed the army in or 
der of battle, and resolved to wait their approach 
upon the ground we were encamped on, and sent 
orders to the light troops to fall back. The enemy 
came up and formed upon Quaker Hill, a very strong 
piece of ground, within about one mile and a quarter 
of our line. We were well posted, with strong works 
in our rear, and a strong redoubt in front, partly 
upon the right of the line. 

In this position a warm cannonade commenced, and 
lasted for several hours, with continual skirmishes in 
front of both lines. About two o clock the enemy 
began to advance in force upon our right, as if they 
intended to dislodge us from the advanced redoubt. 
I had the command of the right wing. After advancing four regiments, and finding the enemy still gaining ground, I advanced with two more regiments of 
regular troops, and a brigade of militia, and at the 
same time General Sullivan ordered Colonel Livings 
ton, with the light troops under his command, to ad 
vance. We soon put the enemy to the rout, and I 
had the pleasure to see them run in worse disorder 
than they did at the battle of Monniouth. Our troops 
behaved with great spirit; and the brigade of militia, 
under the command of General Lovell, advanced with 
great resolution and in good order, and stood the fire 
of the enemy with great firmness. Lieutenant-Colonel 
Livingston, Colonel Jackson, and Colonel Henry B. 
Livingston, did themselves great honor in the transactions of the day; but it s not in my power to do 
justice to Colonel Laurens, who acted both the General and the partisan. His command of regular troops 
was small, but he did every thing possible to be 
done by their numbers. He had two most excellent 
officers with him, Lieutenant-Colonel Henry and Ma 
jor Talbot, 

The enemy fell back to their strong ground, and 
the day terminated with a cannonade and skirmishes. 
Both armies continued in their position all day yes 
terday, cannonading each other every now and then. 
Last night we effected a very good retreat, without 
the loss of men or stores. 

We have not collected an account of the killed and 
wounded, but we judge our loss amounts to between 
two and three hundred, and that of the enemy, to 
much more. 

We are going to be posted all round the shores 
as a guard upon them, and in that state to wait for 
the return of the fleet, which, by the by, I think will 
not be in a hurry. 

VOL. II. 17 
It is reported that Lord Howe arrived last night 
with his fleet and the re enforcement mentioned in 
your Excellency s letter to General Sullivan. If the 
report is true, we got off the island in very good 
season. 

The Marquis went to Boston the day before the 
action, and did not return until last night, just as we 
were leaving the Island. He went to wait upon the 
Admiral, to learn his further intentions, and to get 
him to return again and complete the expedition, if 
possible. 

I observe your Excellency thinks the enemy design 
to evacuate New York. If they should, I think they 
will Newport also; but I am persuaded they will do 
neither for the present. 

I would write your Excellency a more particularaccount of the battle and retreat, but I imagine General Sullivan and Colonel Laurens have done it alrea 
dy, and I am myself very much unwell. I have had 
no sleep for three nights and days, being severely 
afflicted with the asthma. I am, with great respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

NATHANAEL GREENE. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 
(Private.) 

Philadelphia, 29 August, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

I did myself the honor of writing to your Excel 
lency yesterday, by Jones, to which I beg leave to 
refer. 

This morning, upon inquiry, I was confirmed in my 
belief that the former Camp Committee had made no 
application to Congress for gold or silver, to be deposited in your Excellency s hands for public uses; 
wherefore, I suggested to two or three members the 
necessity and utility of establishing such a fund, and 
prevailed upon one of the gentlemen to move the 
House for that purpose. The motion was accepted, 
and, without a pause, the sum of five hundred guineas 
voted. These I shall presently receive, and, if possi 
ble, convey them to your Excellency under the pro 
tection of Captain Josiah Stoddard, of the light dra 
goons. 

I have just received new addresses to Congress 
from the British Commissioners at New York. Go 
vernor Johnstone, in graceless and almost scurrilous 
terms, without exonerating himself from the charges 
alleged against him, submits to the decree of inter 
diction, lately pronounced by Congress.* Nor do the 
gentlemen, late his coadjutors, so highly resent the 
proceedings on our part, as to refuse to treat with 
out the support of the Governor s name. 

Your Excellency will judge best from their respect 
ive performances on the present occasion ; copies of 
which shall- accompany this letter. 

I take the liberty of inclosing, with the present 
despatches, a letter directed " To Lieutenant-Colonel 
Laurens," under a flying seal, and to request yourExcellency to peruse a paragraph contained in it, 
which speaks of a Monsieur Gal van. 

Monsieur Gerard is exceedingly affected by the late 
determinations on the water, near Rhode Island, and 
has communicated his sentiments to me with great 
candor. Good accounts from General Sullivan will do 



* See Governor Johnstone s manifesto in Almon s Remembrancer, 
Vol. VH. p. 15. 
more towards recovering him from a slight intermit 
tent, which really seized that gentleman, immediately 
after he had received Monsieur Chouin s letter, than 
four ounces of bark. Indeed, I never saw people in 
general more anxious than my acquaintance, under 
the present suspense. Within the next two hours, I 
make no doubt, there will be fifty inquirers for news 
within this door. I remain, with the utmost regard, 
dear Sir, 

Your Excellency s obliged and humble servant, 

HENRY LAURENS.* 



FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Tivcrton, 1 September, 1778. 



MY DEAR GENERAL, 



That there has been an action fought where I 



* The following extract from a letter written by Mr. Andrew Adams, 
a Delegate in Congress, to Mr. Samuel Ly man, dated August 17th, presents an interesting sketch of the mode of doing business in Congress, 
at this period. 

"I do not know that I Qan better gratify your curiosity at present, 
than by giving a general account of the proceedings of Congress. Ac 
cording to order we should meet at nine, and adjourn at two ; but, in 
fact, we meet about ten, and sit till three, four, and five, before we ad 
journ. This you will say is very inconvenient, but it leaves us much 
leisure. But you will consider, that much of the business is transacted 
by special Committees in the recess of Congress. Besides these, there 
is a Marine Board, a Navy Board, a Treasury Board, a Commercial 
Board, and a Committee of Foreign Affairs, who have no other time to 
do their business but in the recess of Congress. These Boards are at 
present almost wholly composed of members of Congress. Some of them 
meet at six in the morning, and sit till eight constantly every day ; others 
meet at five in the afternoon, or immediately after they dine, and sit 
till night, and sometimes till late. I believe there are but very few 
members but what are employed in some of these ways, so that those 
who do their duty have not much leisure to spare. 

; The debates in the House are similar to those in the British House 
of Commons. There are here, as in most other assemblies, some very 
could have been, and where I was not, is a thing 
which will seem as extraordinary to you as it seems 
so to myself. After a long journey, and a longer 
stay from home (I mean from head-quarters), the 
only satisfactory day I have, finds me in the middle 
of a town. There I had been sent, pushed, hurried, 
by the Board of General Officers, and principally by 
Generals Sullivan and Greene, who thought I should 
be of great use to the common cause, and to whom 
I foretold the disagreeable event which would happen to me. I felt, on that occasion, the impression of 
that bad star, which, some days ago, has influenced 
the French undertakings, and which, I hope, will 
soon be removed. People say that I don t want an 
action ; but, if it is not necessary to my reputation 
as a tolerable private soldier, it would, at least, add 
to my satisfaction and pleasure. However, I was 

sensible speakers, and some very loud talkers. You may make one ex 
ception, and then conceive a House composed of very able, sensible gen 
tlemen, but belonging to different States, whose laws, manners, genius 
of the inhabitants, and indeed almost every thing else, are very differ 
ent." 

Mr. Hosmer, another Delegate from Connecticut, wrote as follows to 
Governor Trumbull, on the 31st of August. 

" I wish I could with truth assure your Excellency that, in my view, 
our affairs are in a happy train, and that Congress has adopted wise and 
effectual measures to restore our wounded public credit, and to establish 
the United States, their liberty, union, and happiness, upon a solid and 
permanent foundation. I dare not do it, while my heart is overwhelmed 
with the most melancholy presages. The idleness and captiousness of 
some gentlemen, maugre the wishes and endeavours of an honest and 
industrious majority, in my apprehension, threaten the worst conse 
quences. The Southern States are fixed against holding Congress more 
than once a day. Our hours are fixed from nine in the forenoon to two 
in the afternoon. If these were punctually attended, it would be, per 
haps, as much as could be spared from Committees, and other busi 
ness which must be done out of Congress hours. Nine States make a 
Congress. Some States have Delegates so very negligent, so much immersed in the pursuit of pleasure or business, that it is very rare we 
can make a Congress before near eleven o clock; and this evil seems 

17* 
happy enough to arrive before the second retreat; it 
was not attended with such trouble and danger as it 
would have been, had not the enemy been so sleepy. 
I was thus once more deprived of my fighting ex 
pectations. 

From what I have heard, from sensible and candid 
French gentlemen, the action docs great honor to 
General Sullivan; he retreated in good order; he op 
posed very properly every effort of the enemy; he 
never sent troops but well supported; and displayed 
great coolness during the whole day. The evacuation 
I have seen extremely well performed; and my pri 
vate opinion is, that, if both events are satisfactory 
to us, they are very shameful to the British Generals and troops they had, indeed, so many finechances to cut us to pieces ; but they are very good 
people. 

Now, my dear General, I must give you an ac 
count of that journey for which I have paid so dear. 
The Count d Estaing arrived the day before in Boston. I found him much displeased at a protest, of 

incapable of a remedy, as Congress has no means to compel gentlemen s 
attendance, and those who occasionally delay are callous to admonition 
and reproof, which have been often tried in vain. 

" When we are assembled, several gentlemen have such a knack of 
starting questions of order, raising debates upon critical, captious, and 
trifling amendments, protracting them by long speeches, by postponing, 
calling for the previous question, and other arts, that it is almost impossible to get an important question decided at one sitting, and if it is 
put over to another day, the field is open to be gone over auain, precious time is lost, and the public business left undone. I am sorry to 
add, that the opposition between States, the old prejudices of north 
against south, and south against north, seem to be reviving, and are 
industriously heightened by some who, I fear, would be but too well 
pleased to see our Union blasted, and our independence broken and 
destroyed. 

" I wish what I have written may not seem too much like complaining of Congress ; but, besides that I am sure it is a just picture of ourpresent situation, when I look back and see how little has been done


THE AMEKICAN REVOLUTION. 199 

which you have heard, and many other circumstances 
which I have reported to you. I did what I could 
on the occasion ; but I must do the Admiral the jus 
tice to say, that it has not at all diminished his 
warm desire of serving America. We waited together 
on the Council, General Heath and General Hancock, 
and were very well satisfied with them. The last onedistinguished himself very much by his zeal on the 
occasion. Some people in Boston were rather dissa 
tisfied ; but when they saw the behaviour of the Council, Generals Heath and Hancock, they, I hope, will 
do the same ; I therefore fear nothing but delays. 
The masts are very far off; provisions difficult to be 
provided. The Count d Estaing was ready to come 
with his land forces, and put himself under General 
Sullivan s orders, though dissatisfied with the latter; 
but our new circumstances will alter that design. 

I beg you will pardon me once more, my dearGeneral, for having troubled and afflicted you with 
the account of what I had seen after the departure 
of the French fleet. My confidence in you is such, 
that I could not feel so warmly upon this point 
without communicating it to your Excellency. I 
have now the pleasure to inform you that the clis
since I came here, and consider how much there was to do, and the 
vast importance that it should be done without loss of time, I feel my 
self under an obligation to account for my own conduct, among others, 
and can think of no better way to do it, than by telling the truth; 
which I do the more freely, because I can appeal to every gentleman in 
Congress, whether any blame rests upon Connecticut, whether she has 
ever been an hour unrepresented, or whether any time hath been lost 
by the remissness, or captiousness, or long-windedness of her Delegates. 
Besides, though while hopes of a speedy reform prevailed, I thought it 
prudent to be silent, now those hopes have vanished, I thought it best, 
and my duty, to state our real, though unhappy situation to your Ex 
cellency, that we might have the benefit of your wisdom and advice in 
concerting proper measures to retrieve us from the unhappy lethargy 
(shall I call it frenzy?) into whicli we have fallen." 
content does not appear so great. The French hos 
pital is arrived at Boston, though under difficulties, 
which, however, I think I have diminished a good 
deal by sending part of my family, with orders to 
some persons, and entreaties to others, to give them 
all the assistance in their power. Now, every thing 
will be right, provided the Count d Estaing is enabled 
to sail soon. Every exertion, I think, ought to be 
employed for that purpose in all the several parts of 
the Continent; masts, biscuit, water, and provisions 
are his wants. I long to see that we have again the 
command, or at least an equal force, upon the Ame 
rican seas. 

By your letters to General Sullivan, I apprehend 
that there is some general move in the British army, 
and that your Excellency is going to send us reenforcements. God grant you may send us as many 
as, with the militia, will make a larger army, that 
you might command them yourself! I long, my dearGenera], to be again with you, and to have the 
pleasure of cooperating with the French fleet under 
your immediate orders. This will be the greatest I 
can feel; I am sure every thing will then be right. 
The Count d Estaing (if Rhode Island is again to be 
taken, which I ardently wish) would be extremely 
happy to take it in conjunction with General Washington, and it would remove the other inconve 
niences. 

I am now intrusted, by General Sullivan, with the 
care of Warren, Bristol, and the Eastern Shore. 1 am 
to defend a country with very few troops, who are 
not able to defend more than a single point. I can 
not answer that the enemy won t go and do what 
they please, for I am not able to prevent them, only 
with a part of their army, and yet this part must 
not land far from me. But I answer, that, if they 
come with equal or not very superior forces to those 
I may collect, we shall flog them pretty well ; at 
least I hope so. My situation seems to be uncertain, for we expect to hear soon from your Excel 
lency. You know Mr. Tousard, a gentleman of my 
family. He met with a terrible accident in the last 
action ; running before all the others, to take a piece 
of cannon in the midst of the enemy, with the greatest excess of bravery, he was immediately covered 
with their shots, had his horse killed, and his right 
arm shattered to pieces. He was happy enough not 
to fall into their hands ; his life is not despaired of. 
Congress was going to send him a commission of 
Major. 

Give me joy, my dear General. I intend to have 
your picture, and Mr. Hancock has promised me a 
copy of that he has in Boston. He gave one to 
Count d Estaing, and I never saw a man so glad at 
possessing his sweetheart s picture, as the Admiral 
was to receive yours. 

In expecting, with the greatest impatience, to hearfrom your Excellency as to what are to be the general plans, and your private movements, I have the 
honor to be, with the highest respect, the warmest 
and most endless affection, dear General, &c., 

LAFAYETTE. 



FROM COLONEL LAURENS. 
(Private.) 

Providence, 2 September, 1778. 

SIR, 

I had the honor of writing to your Excellency previous to the action of the 29th. My letter was committed to the care of Major Gibbs, and he destroyed 
it as soon as the engagement commenced, to guard 
against accidents. As your Excellency has already 
received minute accounts of the transactions of that 
day from those who saw them in a more collective 
view than the nature of my command afforded me. 
any further relation is rendered unnecessary. I shall 
confine myself, therefore, to congratulating your Excel 
lency on the happy termination of an expedition, 
which at one period was threatened with the most 
tragical catastrophe. The advantages gained in the 
affair of Portsmouth, and the brilliant retreat which 
succeeded it, by doing honor to the American arms, 
consoled us in some degree for the loss of our grand 
object. 

The movements which your Excellency has observed at New York, the arrival of seventy sail of vessels 
in the road of Newport, the appearance of twenty 
sail off Boston, are circumstances which keep us in 
suspense with respect to the enemy s intentions. Ge 
neral Greene has requested that I would remain in 
this quarter till they can be interpreted. In the mean 
time, he agrees with me, that if the enemy mean to 
act offensively here, a few days % preparation will be 
required. I have thought it incumbent on me. as 
part of the commission with which your Excellency 
honored me, to wait on Count d Estaing, and ask if 
he has any despatches for head-quarters. It will be 
my greatest happiness if I can be useful in explaining the causes of mutual jealousy and uneasiness 
which have existed between the officers of the allied 
powers here, and be any ways instrumental in restoring that harmony which the common interest re 
quires. 

I foretold, to the Marquis, the influence which the 
Count s departure from the road of Newport would 
probably have upon the minds of the people, and the 
danger of its reviving those absurd prejudices which 
we inherited from the British nation. Unhappily the 
mischief has become more extensive by the unguarded expressions of some men of rank, who listened to 
their chagrin rather than good policy. Reflection, 
however, begins to induce a more cautious behaviour, 
and I am in hopes that the confidence of the people 
in our new allies will be restored. 

The Count s sensibility was much wounded by the 
manner in which the protest was delivered to him. 
In a letter to General Sullivan he declares, that this 
paper imposed on the Commander of the King s 
squadron the painful but necessary law of profound 
silence ; that he had taken occasion, however, rela 
tively to some other business, to acquaint him, that, if 
the Council of Boston accepted his offer (which was 
to repair to Rhode Island at the head of his land 
troops, and receive General Sullivan s orders), he 
would promise the most implicit obedience on the 
part of his troops, and set them the example of it ; 
that the extreme sensibility, which composed the 
French national character, in every thing that relates 
to their honor, required that the French Commanderin-chief should, by his sentiments for the American 
General, and by a conspicuous measure, announce that 
French delicacy could not be wounded in a moment 
of passion, which arose from disappointment, felt alike 
by both parties. In a postscript he requested that 
the Marquis de la Fayette may explain matters be 
tween them. The expressions of the Count s letter 
are rather obscure; but, by discovering an inclination 
to make great personal sacrifices, it is, in my opinion, 
a foundation for restoring harmony and a good understanding. General Sullivan s answer, I hope, will 
improve it. I have the honor to be, with the greatest attachment and respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

JOHN LAUREXS. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SULLIVAN. 

Providence, 3 September, 1778. 

Mr DEAR GENERAL, 

I had last night the honor of receiving your Excel 
lency s favor of the 1st instant, and impatiently wait 
your Excellency s sentiments on the steps I have 
taken since the 29th ultimo, an account of which has 
been transmitted by Major Morris. 

The justice of the observations, in your Excel 
lency s letter, respecting the departure of the French 
fleet, are so obvious, that, if a consciousness of my 
duty to yield implicit obedience to your Excellency s 
commands did not ever make that obedience a plea 
sure, the reasoning alone must have pointed out 
the part I have to act. I have the pleasure to in 
form your Excellency, that, though the first struggles 
of passion on so important a disappointment were 
scarcely to be restrained, yet, in a few days, by taking advantage of the subsiding passion, I found means 
to restore the former harmony between the American 
and French officers of the army. The Count d Estaing 
and myself are in the same friendship as heretofore. 
The reason of the protest has been explained to him, 
and he is now perfectly satisfied. He has offered to 
come on with his land forces, and do every thing 
which I may request of him and his troops ; but this 
step has become unnecessary. 
The reason of drawing the protest was this; The 
Count himself wished to remain with us, but was, by 
his Captains, overruled in Council. As deviating from 
the voice of his Council would be attended with ill 
consequences to him in case of misfortune, it was 
supposed that the protest might justify his deviating 
from the voice of his Council, and acting a part 
agreeable to his own sentiments, and those of the co 
operating army. Prudence dictated it as our duty to 
keep it secret from all but him, your Excellency, 
and the Congress ; and no publication of it was ever 
thought of on our part ; and your Excellency may 
rely on my exertions to prevent it. Every thing in 
my power shall be done for repairing the injury sus 
tained by the French fleet. 

The fleet off Boston harbour, of which I gave yourExcellency an account yesterday, are eight ships of 
the line, ten frigates, one sloop, and a schooner. 
There can be no doubt of its being Lord Howe s fleet, 
watching the motions of the French fleet, to facilitate 
the relief of Rhode Island, and perhaps to cover the 
retreat of the British army from Rhode Island and 
New York, to other places where they are more 
needed. Those ships were out of sight yesterday 
morning at eight o clock, but I hear they afterwards 
hove in sight again. The report here is, that six 
thousand troops have arrived at Newport. I know 
they are numerous, but cannot as yet ascertain the 
number. Your Excellency will please transmit a copy 
of this letter to Congress ; and believe me to be, with 
every sentiment of gratitude, respect, and esteem, 
your Excellency s 

Most obedient and very humble servant, 

JOHN SULLIVAN. 

VOL. II. 18 
FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Boston, 16 September, 1778. 

SIR, 

The growing extravagance of the people, and the 
increasing demand for the article of forage in this 
quarter, have become a very alarming affair. Hay is 
from sixty to eighty dollars a ton, and upon the 
rise.* Corn is ten dollars a bushel, and oats four; 
and every thing else, that will answer for forage, in 
that proportion. Carting is nine shillings a mile by 
the ton, and people much dissatisfied with the price. 
I have represented to the States of Rhode Island 
and Connecticut the absolute necessity of legislative 
interposition, to settle the prices of things upon some 
reasonable footing, of all such articles and services as 
are necessary for the use of the public in my department. I am going to do the same to the Council of this State. What effect it will have, I cannot 
say; but, if there is not something done to check 
the extravagance of the people, there are no funds 
in the universe that will equal the expense. 

The late affray that happened in this place, be 
tween the people of the town and those of the fleet, 
has been found to originate from a parcel of soldiers 
belonging to the Convention troops, and a party of 
British sailors which were engaged on board a priva 
teer. The secret enemies to our cause, and the British officers in the neighbourhood of this place, are 
endeavouring to sow the seeds of discord as much as 



* Continental currency. At this time, the Continental money passed 
in Massachusetts at the rate of somewhat more than six paper dol 
lars for one silver dollar, and prices of course rose in the same pro 
portion. See Felt s Historical Account of the Massachusetts Currency, 
p. 186. 
possible between the inhabitants of the place and the 
French belonging to the fleet. The French officers are 
well satisfied this is the state of the case, and it 
fills them with double resentment against the British. 
The Admiral and all the French officers are now 
upon an exceeding good footing with the gentlemen 
of the town. General Hancock takes unwearied pains 
to promote a good understanding with the French 
officers. His house is full from morning till night. 

I had a letter from the Marquis, day before yester 
day. He writes me he is endeavouring to represent 
every thing in the most favorable colors to the Court 
of France, in order to wipe away the prejudices that 
the letters of some of the more indiscreet may make 
upon that Court, All the French officers are extrava 
gantly fond of your Excellency; but the Admiral 
more so than any of the rest. They all speak of you 
with the highest reverence and respect. General 
Hancock made the Admiral a present of your picture. 
He was going to receive it on board the fleet by 
the firing a royal salute. But General Hancock 
thought it might furnish a handle for some of the 
speculative politicians to remark the danger of cha 
racters becoming too important. He therefore dissuaded the Admiral from carrying the matter into 
execution. 

I find, by your Excellency s letter to General Sul 
livan, that you expect the enemy are going to eva 
cuate New York, and that it is probable they are 
coming eastward. I can hardly think they mean to 
make an attempt upon Boston, notwithstanding the 
object is important; and, unless they attack Boston, 
there is no other object worthy their attention in 
New England. I am rather inclined to think they 
mean to leave the United States altogether. What 
they hold here now, they hold at a great risk and 
expense. But, suppose they actually intend to quit 
the Continent, they will endeavour to mislead ourattention, and that of our allies, until they can get 
clear of the coast. The Admiral is fortifying for the 
security of his fleet; but I am told his batteries are 
all open in the rear, which will be but a poor secu 
rity against a land force. General Heath thinks 
there ought to be some Continental troops sent here : 
but the Council will not turn out the militia; they 
are so confident the enemy are not coming here. If 
your Excellency thinks the enemy really design an 
attack upon Boston, it may not be useless for you 
to write your opinion to the Council Board, for I 
suspect they think the General here has taken the 
alarm without sufficient reasons. The fortifications 
round this place are very incomplete, and little or 
nothing doing upon them. I have given General 
Heath my opinion what parts to take possession of, 
if the enemy should attempt the place before the 
Continental army gets up. From four to five hundred troops have arrived at Halifax; their collective 
strength will make a formidable army. 

I wish to know your Excellency s pleasure about 
my returning to camp. I expect Mrs. Greene will 
be put to bed every day. She is very desirous of 
my stay until that event; and, as she has set her 
heart so much upon it, I could wish to gratify her, 
for fear of some disagreeable consequences, as women 
sometimes, under such circumstances, receive great 
injury by being disappointed. 

General Sullivan granted me leave to come here 
upon the business of my department. I expect to 
return in a few days. Major Gibbs is with me, and 
is going to Portsmouth. 
This is the third letter I have wrote since I have 
had a line from your Excellency. Should be glad to 
hear from you when at leisure. 

I am your Excellency s obedient servant, 

NATHANAEL GREENE. 



FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Camp, near Warren, 24 September, 1778. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

I am going to consult your Excellency upon a 
point, in which I not only want your leave and opinion, as the Commander-in-chief, but also your candid 
advice, as the man whom I have the happiness to 
call my friend. In an address from the British Com 
missioners to Congress, the first after Johnstone was 
excluded, they speak in the most disrespectful terms 
of my nation and country.* The whole is under 
signed by them, and more particularly by the Presi 
dent, Lord Carlisle. I am the first French officer in 
rank of the American Army; I am not unknown to 
the British; and if somebody must take notice of 
such expressions, that advantage does, I believe, be 
long to me. Don t you think, my dear General, that 
I should do well to write a letter on the subject to 

* The British Commissioners had said, alluding to France, " They 
remain astonished at the calamities in which the unhappy people of 
these Colonies continue to be involved, from the blind deference 
which their leaders profess towards a power that has ever shown 
itself an enemy to all civil and religious liberty, and whose offers, his 
Majesty s Commissioners must repeat, whatever may be the pretended 
date and present form of them, were made only in consequence of 
the plan of accommodation concerted in Great Britain, and with a 
view to prevent the reconciliation proposed, and to prolong this destructive war." 

18* 
Lord Carlisle, wherein I should notice his expressions 
conveyed in an unfriendly manner? I have men 
tioned something of this design to the Count d Estaing, but wish entirely to fix niy opinion by yours, 
which I instantly beg, as soon as you may find it 
convenient. 

As every thing is perfectly quiet, and General Sul 
livan is persuaded that I may, with all safety, go to 
Boston, I am going to undertake a short journey to 
wards that place. The Admiral has several times 
expressed a desire of conversing with me ; he has 
also thrown out some wishes that something might 
be done towards securing Boston; but it seems he 
always refers to a conversation for further explana 
tion. My stay will be short, as I don t like towns, 
in time of war, w r hen I may be about a camp. If 
your Excellency answers me immediately, I may 
soon receive your letter. 

I want much to see you, my dear General, and 
consult you about many points; part of them are re 
specting myself. If you approve of my writing to 
Lord Carlisle, it would be a reason for coming nearyou for a short time/ in case the gentleman is displeased with my mission. 

With the most perfect respect, confidence, and affection, I have the honor to be, &c., 

LAFAYETTE.* 



* The proposed challenge was entirely disapproved by Washington, 
in his answer to the above letter. (Washington s Writings, Vol. VI. 
p. 78.) But the challenge was sent, and it was properly declined by 
the Earl of Carlisle, on the ground that he was " solely responsible 
to his country and king, and not to any individual, for his public 
conduct and language." 
FROM COLONEL OTHO H. WILLIAMS. 

Paramus, Monday, 26 September, 1778. 

I am exceeding sorry to be the author of bad 
news; but lest a more imperfect account should reach 
head-quarters, I think it my duty to acquaint yourExcellency of the misfortune sustained by Colonel 
Baylor s corps. Early on Sunday, the Colonel re 
moved with his regiment from Paramus to Harring 
ton, a small place two or three miles from Tappan, 
and took quarters. Between three and four this 
morning, the enemy, conducted by a number of the 
inhabitants, surrounded his pickets and effectually surprised the whole regiment. At eleven o clock (the 
hour of writing this) Captain Stith, a sergeant, and 
twelve or thirteen men, who escaped, have arrived at 
this place. Captain Stith says, being surprised at 
his quarters, he ran out of the house, and seeing, or 
rather hearing a body of horse, which he took for 
his own troop, he ordered them to form, adding, the 
British troops are near us. He was instantly at 
tacked, and finding himself surrounded, asked for 
quarter, which they refused; he then fired his pistol 
and escaped. 

About sunrise we heard a very brisk fire, for a few 
minutes, at Tappan, supposed to be a feeble resist 
ance of the militia at that place. Some of the 
wounded, just arrived, say that the enemy did not 
stay to take away the horses which were in the sta 
bles; that they saw about twenty of Colonel Baylor s 
horsemen killed, and about twelve or fourteen mor 
tally wounded with bayonets. A party is just goneto bring off the wounded and horses, if possible ; and 
other parties are sent to discover the route and numbers of the enemy. Captain Stith says they were in 
great force, but as it was dark, he could not form 
any opinion of their numbers. He thinks Colonel 
Baylor and Major Clough are certainly taken, as he 
saw the British troops at their quarters, which were 
near his own. It is possible, he says, that some of 
the officers on their right may have escaped towards 
Kakiat, to which place the enemy were directing 
their march by the last accounts. 

I came to the Jerseys with a view of relieving a 
friend from captivity, and have had the happiness to 
meet him, with a number of others, about forty, who 
were exchanged this day week. Several are now waiting, at Morristown, a favorable opportunity to pay their 
duty at head-quarters. Coining here on my way to 
camp, at this critical time, Major Pell, who commands 
at this place, has done me the honor to advise with 
me what measures are most eligible for him to adopt. 
The sick, and the few stores he had, are sent towards 
Pompton. He will continue to be near the enemy, 
but, as his party is weak, will be under the neces 
sity of changing his post often, to elude the treache 
ry of the inhabitants. r General Winds has taken post, 
with about one thousand militia, on an eminence 
near Hackinsac. I cannot learn that General Max 
well has moved from Elizabethtown. Many reports 
are, that the enemy have landed there, and at New 
ark ; but the last and best accounts contradict them. 

I intend to join my regiment to-morrow, as I can 
not be of any further service to Major Pell, who is 
active and vigilant. Your Excellency s 

Most obedient, humble servant, 

OTHO II. WILLIAMS.*

ber, as follows. 

" I am this moment returned from the enemy s pickets, where I went 
FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Boston, 28 September, 1778. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

The news I have got from France, the reflections 
I have made by myself, and those which have been 
suggested to me by many people, particularly by the 
Admiral, increase more than ever the desire I had 
of seeing again your Excellency. I want to commu 
nicate to you my sentiments, and take your opinion 
upon my present circumstances. I look upon this as 
of high moment to my private interests. On the 



to ask permission to remain with the wounded at this place. I found 
the picket (a subaltern and twenty) about two miles below this, but understood that they have parties on all the roads leading to Hackinsac, 
that have no fixed station, but patrol constantly. The first battalion of 
light infantry is close in the rear of their pickets. 

" The wounded left here are, Colonel Baylor, the Surgeon, and oneprivate of his regiment, a militia-man, and an old man seventy-threeyears of age, a resident; whom, besides shooting him through the thigh, 
they severely beat. Major Clough died yesterday morning, and this day 
was buried. Colonel Baylor has a wound in his thigh with a bayonet, 
another in his groin, and several cuts in his hand with a broadsword. 
I do not think that any of his wounds are very dangerous ; his intes 
tines are free from injury. He is in good spirits, and free from all bad 
symptoms. His patrols were taken, which occasioned his being surprised. Dr. Crosby was here an hour ago, and tells me that, besides 
the men that you have seen escaped, sixteen have come into Paramus, most of them wounded ; two are since dead. 

" I understand, from Sir James Manning, who commands the in 
fantry, that they are soon to quit Jersey, and that Sir Henry Clin 
ton and Lord Cornwallis are both returned to New York. The officer that commanded the picket told me, that Sir James Wallace 
came express from New York to the General, and that a picket was 
arrived. He did not mention any news; and I think he would 
not have concealed it, if he had any to tell that was favorable to 
them. 

" I did not obtain the permission I desired. Sir James desired I 
would come to their pickets to-morrow, and he would have it ready 
with such necessaries as Colonel Baylor was in need of." 
other hand, I have some ideas, and some intelligence 
in reference to public interests, which I am very desirous of disclosing to your Excellency. I am sure, 
my dear General, that your sentiments upon my pri 
vate concerns are such, that you will have no objec 
tion to my spending some hours with you. 

The moment at which the fleet will be ready is 
not very far, and I think it of importance to have 
settled my affair with you before that time. I am 
going to write to General Sullivan on the subject, 
and, if he has no objection, I ll go immediately to 
head-quarters; but should he make difficulties, I beg 
you will send me that leave. I intend to ride ex 
press, in order that I may have time enough. You 
may think, my dear General, that I don t ask, what 
I never asked in my life a leave to quit the post 
I am sent to without strong reasons for it; but the 
letters I have received from home make me very 
anxious to see you. 

With the most tender affection and highest re 
spect, &c., 

LAFAYETTE. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GATES. 

Danbuiy, 30 September, 1778. 

SIR, 

I am this moment honored with the receipt of yourExcellency s letter of to-day s date. 

I am sorry for the disgrace we have suffered in 
the Jerseys; but imagine that the enemy take ad 
vantage of the supine ness that constantly seizes ourpeople, w r hen they have been long unmolested. This 
is an evil, that even the best officers cannot remedy. 
General McDougall s division will be put upon 
the march immediately, as your Excellency has commanded. 

Your Excellency will excuse me when I say, I like 
not the divided state of your army. The enemy are 
upon the qui-vive ; they have the advantages of a 
river, to navigate upon each of our flanks. To divideis to conquer, in politics. I hope it may not, with 
regard to us, prove so in the war. 

I hope Lord Stirling and General Maxwell will an 
swer all your Excellency s expectations in the Jerseys ; they certainly are best acquainted with that 
country. 

Inclosed is a letter I have this moment received 
from Major Tallmadge. Your Excellency will please 
to order Colonel Pettit to supply the necessary articles. I am, Sir, your Excellency s 

Most obedient, humble servant, 

HORATIO GATES. 



FROM RICHARD HENRY LEE. 

Philadelphia, 5 October, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

I hope the measures you have taken will be effect 
ual to the purpose of reenlisting the army, because 
it is an object of great importance; and I readily 
admit the propriety of first trying those methods 
which promise fewest ill consequences. Danger will 
only arise from pressing such too far, and urging 
the experiment too long. I very much fear, Sir, that 
the knowledge of depreciation has reached the most 
uninformed, and, therefore, that every evil which can, 
will happen to us from this cause. But I am not 
without hope that such measures will be adopted as 
may, before it is too late, restore our currency to its 
proper value. 

It is, indeed, no easy matter to judge of the designs of the enemy. They have created to themselves 
a great choice of difficulties. I "believe they would 
willingly change their war of conquest to one of re 
venge altogether ; but revenge must be postponed to 
safety. General Clinton s army is the only hope of 
Canada, Nova Scotia, the Floridas, the West Indies, 
and, I may safely add, much so of Great Britain and 
Ireland. Whilst this is the case, although Boston, in 
its present situation, is a very tempting object, I can 
not think they will undertake it. However, what 
can be attempted, may be attempted, and wisdom 
points to precaution. If it be true, and our inform 
ation comes pretty direct, that Dominica has fallen, 
that Jamaica and St. Kitts are in jeopardy, and that 
Keppel has fled from the fleet of France, we may sup 
pose that our enemies can make no long stay with 
us. Distance and land-carriage distress us greatly in 
the article of bread provision- to which is added an 
artificial scarcity, created in the midst of plenty, by 
an infamous set of engrossers, who have raised the 
price of flour from four dollars a hundred to five 
and six pounds. I hope the measures we are taking 
with these gentry will make them suffer in a way 
most hurtful to them. 

Mr. Eustis had quitted this city before your letter 
came to hand, and as he is gone to the army, I have 
inclosed the letter in this. I am, with much esteem 
and regard, dear Sir, your most obedient and very 
humble servant, 

RICHARD HENRY LEE. 
FROM COLONEL LAMBERT CADWALADER.* 

Philadelphia, 7 October, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

A few days since, I received your Excellency s 
letter in Maryland, dated White Plains, inclosing onefrom the Commissioners of Arrangement, respecting 
my not performing the duties incident to my station, 
and desiring I may be ordered to my regiment, with.out being previously exchanged ; and that, in case 
of refusal, there would be a vacancy, to which an 
active officer might be entitled to succeed. 

The motives, which seem chiefly to have influenced 
them in their determination, are, first, the complaints 
of the officers in the Pennsylvania line ; secondly, 
that I am under no obligation, from the terms of 
my enlargement, not to act against the enemy with 
out returning an officer of the same rank ; and, third 
ly, that I have, in no instance since my liberation, 
been considered in the light of a prisoner of war by 
the enemy. 

Although no definitive steps with respect to me, as 
I am informed, have been taken, yet I cannot but 
look upon it as a hardship, that the Commission 
ers should undertake to pass sentence without affording me an opportunity of representing the rea 
sons which have induced me to observe a line of 
conduct so contrary to their opinion and judgment. 
This circumstance, I hope, will plead my excuse for 
troubling your Excellency with the motives and prin 
ciples which have directed my conduct in a case so 

* Colonel Cadwalader had been taken prisoner at the assault on Fort, 
Washington, in November, 1776. See Washington s Writings, Vol. IV. 
p. 188. 

VOL. II. 19 
new and uncommon; and which, I trust, will have 
the desired effect with the Commissioners. 

As soon as I was known, after 1 was made prison 
er, I Avas treated with the utmost politeness and hu 
manity by the enemy; and General Prescott having 
applied to General Howe in iny behalf, from a high 
sense of some civilities shown by my father, procured me my liberty without parole. It was an act of 
generosity, which I felt very sensibly, but the offer 
I did not accept, although I had the opinions of some 
officers who were near me in favor of it. 

The idea I entertained of my situation was, that a 
compliment of the highest nature was paid me in 
the manner of liberating me, and that the point of 
honor of sending in an equivalent before I took an 
active part in the army was left to me. Some few. 
however, when I returned home, being of opinion I 
might instantly join the army without an exchange. 
I thought proper to apply to General Gates, who was 
then in town, and advise with him, he being an old 
officer, and one who had been bred in a military 
school. He replied, he would give his opinion as a 
man of honor and my friend, and that, was he in my 
situation, he would not act before he was exchanged. 

About this time I received your Excellency s let 
ter, making me an offer of sending in to General 
Prescott to fix upon some friend of his, who was 
prisoner among us, to be returned to them on the 
same terms on which I was set at liberty. 

This I most joyfully and thankfully accepted, as a 
mode which would remove every difficulty on my 
part, and place me on an equal footing with the 
other officers of the army. But an order to take up 
all the Field-Officers in our possession, and confinethem, in retaliation of the hard usage of General Lee 
prevented its taking place. 
I then ventured so far to trespass on your good 
ness as to propose sending in such a number of in 
ferior officers as would be equivalent to my rank in 
the army, which, as I have been informed, is a 
usual article in the cartels of Europe. 

This, as far as I recollect, you wrote me was 
out of your power, and inconsistent with the cartel 
settled between the two armies, and could not be 
done. I then thought I had nothing to do but wait 
my exchange in course. 

Some officers of the British army, taken at Prince 
ton, as my brother informed me, having mistaken 
him for me, and heard I was with the army again, 
publicly declared, if I was taken prisoner by the 
enemy, they would have put me to death. 

Sir William Erskine s opinion, given to Colonel 
Fitzgerald at Brunswic, after the above, was, that 
I was perfectly free to take an active part without 
exchange. But, since the evacuation of Philadelphia, 
happening at the City Tavern, in conversation with 
Mr. Willing, he told me that General Howe had ex 
pressed his opinion with respect to me, in the fullest manner ; and, in doing this, his surprise I should 
take an active part without being exchanged. Mr. 
Willing told him he had been misinformed, for that 
he knew I had not joined the army. General Howe 
then instanced my forcing some recruits for the regi 
ment, who had mutinied on board a shallop in this 
city. Mr. Willing said, if I had fallen into their 
hands they would have treated me with great rigor. 

It is unnecessary to mention to your Excellency 
the opinions of a great number of gentlemen in and 
out of the army, corresponding with my own, on the 
manner of my being set at liberty, because I did it 
in a former letter. I did not think it necessary to 
trouble you with every incident, as it fell out, rela 
tive to me, but the conversation between Mr. Willing 
and General Howe is, I believe, quite new to you. 

Whenever I join the army, I hope to be put on a 
footing with the other officers in it; nor can it be 
expected that I should run the hazard of having the 
propriety of my conduct, in case of falling into the 
enemy s hands, made a subject of discussion for a 
Court-Martial, or what is worse, perhaps, for a whimsical, capricious commanding officer, disposed to take 
advantage of ex parte evidence, or to receive the 
mere say-so of any man who may expect to advance 
his interest by showing his rancor against me. 

Having thus stated to your Excellency the motives 
and reasons, on which my conduct has been formed, 
I must beg leave to persist in it, notwithstanding the 
interested discourses of some officers in the Pennsyl 
vania line. 

I have derived no emolument of any kind from 
the public, since I have been in my present situation. My view has been to serve in the army till 
our affairs should wear a favorable appearance, and 
then to quit it, but to apply for a command, if we 
should be again threatened ; and I hope I shall not 
be precluded from this privilege by any partial determination of the Commissioners of Arrangement : 
as it is, and ever has been, my fixed principle that 
it is better not to be, than survive the loss of those 
blessings which are the objects of this contest and 
be a witness of the dreadful scenes which would pro 
bably be acted in this country on so unfortunate an 
occasion. I have the honor to be, with the greatest 
respect and regard, 

Your most obedient servant, 

LAMBERT CADWALADER. 



TPIE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 221 

FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 10 October, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

An accident, which has very seldom happened to 
me in the course of thirty years business, has deprived me of the honor of making an earlier, and 
puts it out of my power even now to make a more 
proper acknowledgment of three of your Excellency s 
favors, which I remember to have been indebted for, 
antecedent to the receipt of this of the 3d instant, 
which now lies before me. Those, in removing my 
desks and their contents from one part of the house 
to a more convenient, I have mislaid among my pri 
vate papers, and, after as much search at different 
times, and particularly this morning, as the fleeting 
and pressing moments which I dare borrow from 
public attentions have permitted me to make, remain 
undiscovered, although I am sure they are safe in a 
wrong class. 

I recollect, however, and shall never forget, a new 
obligation, which, in one of them, your Excellency 
was pleased to lay on me by a very kind notice of 
my son s behaviour at Rhode Island, and that you 
had returned the gold which I sent to head-quarters, 
by Jones, and also the letters of Governor Johnstone, 
Mr. Oswald, and Mr. Manning. In the present cir 
cumstances of Great Britain, rendered deplorable by 
the waste of another campaign on this Continent, by 
the loss of Dominique, in the West Indies, and of 
a great marine battle at her own doors, it is exceedingly difficult to determine what will be her next 
step, although I do not think it is to see the only 
measures remaining for her salvation. 

With respect to South Carolina, I cannot yet treat 
19* 
the idea of an attack, as altogether chimerical. I 
am well warranted to say the British Administration 
held that State and Georgia in reserve, for a stroke 
of necessity, which might, at any time, be made with 
success, and they well know the immense value of 
those States, and great things may be done by drawing their forces to one point. They may, indeed, 
have stayed a day too late. Be that as it will, I 
have fully advertised my countrymen; and, if the 
alarm, shall prove to have been unnecessarily sounded, 
their intermediate exertions towards a defence will 
do them no real injury. Congress have ordered the 
proceedings of the Court-Martial on Major-General 
St. Clair to be printed, and have appointed Friday, 
the 16th, for considering and determining on those 
of the Court on Major-General Lee. 

I have nothing further to offer at present, Sir, but 
the repeated assurances of being, with the highest 
sense of esteem and respect, your Excellency s 
Most obedient and most humble servant, 

HENRY LAURENS. 



FROM COLONEL BAYLOR. 

19 October, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

You have been informed of my unfortunate surprise 
of the 28th ultimo, and, I make no doubt, of the cir 
cumstances ; but I think it my duty to make them 
known to you, and at the same time to justify my 
conduct. 

On the 26th of September I was at Paramus with 
the regiment, where we had been four days. I di 
rected Major Clough, on the 26th, to send the Quarter-master out to provide quarters for the regiment 
within four or five miles of Paramus, and at the 
same distance from the enemy that we then were, 
and at the same time gave him my reasons for so 
doing; which he approved of. They were, that I 
was apprehensive that the enemy would, if we re 
mained more than three or four days in one place, 
attempt what they executed in two days afterwards. 

On the morning of the 27th, I marched the regi 
ment to the quarters provided for us at Harrington, 
and made it my business, the moment I arrived 
there, to make every necessary inquiry about the 
roads leading from the enemy s encampment to ourquarters, and also went out and examined the country myself. I was of opinion it was the most secure 
place I could have stationed myself in, and that it 
was convenient to gain the earliest intelligence of the 
movement of the enemy, as it would have been had 
they not received the most particular intelligence of 
our guard and patrol. 

There were two roads leading from the enemy s 
camp to our quarters, one on each side of the Hackinsac River. They joined at a bridge, at half a mile 
distance from our quarters, where I myself fixed a 
guard, of a sergeant and twelve men, with particularorders to keep a patrol of two men out on each of 
these roads constantly. They were to patrol a mile 
below the guard, and to be relieved every hour. The 
guard were ordered to keep the strictest look-out on 
the bridge; and I have reason to believe that these 
orders were punctually obeyed. 

On the 28th, early in the morning, the enemy 
marched up on the west side of the Hackinsac River, 
within half a mile of the distance the patrols went 
down the roads ; they there sent off a detachment 
through the fields some distance from the road, until 
they had got above the guard, which they cut off 
without our hearing of it. All communication being 
cut off from our parties, they marched up to ourquarters; and executed the horrid massacre of which 
Dr. Griffith will inform you the particulars, as appears from the depositions. 

I am happy to inform you that my wounds are 
nearly well, and that I hope soon to regain my 
former state of health. I am, with respect, 

Your most obedient and very humble servant, 

GEORGE BAYLOR, 



FROM COUNT D ESTAING. 

Boston Road, 20 October, 1778. 

SIR, 

Those who have the happiness to be under yourExcellency s orders, find in you a father. The Marquis de la Fayette has a superior title to your Excel 
lency s affection ; he respects, admires, and loves you. 
I had the honor of asking you whether you permit 
ted him to send his cartel to Lord Carlisle, to satisfy 
myself whether you were informed of it. You were so 
kind as to acquaint me that you had not seen the 
cartel. I thought, from that circumstance, that you 
would forbid the execution of it ; I am still persuaded that this is the case. Such marks of zeal, brav 
ery, and sensibility, are never authorized in Europe, 
by its Generals ; they might fruitlessly rob the re 
spective nations of their best subjects. Besides, Am 
bassadors, Commissioners, and men in office, are sup 
posed to speak only in consequence of orders which 
they have received. As public organs, they owe an 
account only to their own government of the things 
which they hazard. Nations revenge their own in 
juries ; those Avho have most reason and strength on 
their side are the most sparing in opprobrious terms, 
and despise them ; they respect their enemies, while 
they endeavour to subdue them; they surpass them 
in wisdom, when they refrain from such offensive 
terms, which, one would think, should be only the 
useless resource of those who would dissemble their 
injustice. 

I could not, then, but presume that Lord Carlisle 
would not accept a cartel, which he would have doneextremely well to refuse. Older than M. de la Fayette, the experience which age gives tranquillized me 
upon the two subjects which I have just submitted 
to your Excellency, and which made me regard the 
cartel, till now, as almost null. It appeared to me a 
consequence of the interesting character which led 
this brave and amiable Frenchman into the service 
of the United States ; to have entreated your inter 
position in this affair would have appeared like a 
doubt of your doing it. 

The delicacy of my countryman might likewise 
have been wounded, if it should have been known 
that your refusal had been solicited by me. I do 
not hesitate, however, Sir, to make the request. I 
am this moment informed that General Hancock told 
M. de Chouin yesterday, that the English Commis 
sioner had provided himself with a substitute. Can he 
have been guilty of choosing a bully?* It is impossible that you should have suffered a doubtful ex 
pression in this cartel to have had such an effect. 
This challenge can only regard my Lord Carlisle, and 
could not have been construed otherwise. Your Ex

cellency certainly will not have suffered it. Pardon 
an ill-placed uneasiness, if, in consequence of General 
Hancock s phrase, I require you, as chief of the French, 
to hinder an individual to take upon himself alone a 
concern which is precious, which regards us all, and 
which is granted by his Majesty to the zeal of his 
navy and army. I have the honor to be, with re 
spect, Sir, your Excellency s 

Most humble and most obedient servant, 

ESTAING. 



FROM GOUVERNEUE MORRIS. 

In Congress, Philadelphia, 11 November, 1778. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

As Congress have delegated to a Committee, of 
which I have the honor to be a member, the super 
intendence of the Commissary and Quarter-master s 
department, this, together with our finances, which we 
have long been cobbling at, hath obliged me to con 
sider, in a more complete view, the state of ouraffairs, than my former detached attention would per 
mit, or, indeed, than my natural indolence would have 
led to, unsolicited by necessity. While I write to 
you, you must read and interpret with the eye and 
the mind of friendship, and suppose a greater mo 
desty of disposition than the language may indicate. 
For, though I by no means believe myself equal to 
the smallest of the objects thrown upon me, yet, in 
speaking of them, I must give a loose to my imagi 
nation and my pen; nor can I find either leisure or 
inclination to attend to style. 

First, then, it is a position clear, that we must 
act according to our powers, and not our inclina 
tions. It is, I am afraid, as clear, that your army 
will want subsistence, if kept together. Neither the 
Quarter-master nor Commissary departments can, in 
the mercantile phrase, do the needful while you 
are where you are. I take it, the number of the 
enemy, and the season, are against active operations 
on their part. Their situation, the season, our natural 
and political circumstances, are equally against them 
on our part. To ravage the country, and to cover it 
from being ravaged, are then the two objects. The 
first is base, and, beyond a certain degree, impracti 
cable. The second is, to a certain degree, dangerous 
and ideal. If it is reduced to a question, for in 
stance, whether the counties of Bergen and Westchester shall be protected by our arms, or the losses 
paid for, I am ready to purchase the whole of both 
in fee, and lay them waste, by way of saving money. 
The like, I take it, will hold good with respect to 
the environs of Rhode Island. 

I cannot, therefore, help being of opinion, that few, 
very few, troops should remain in the eastern depart 
ment; but that many of them, if many there be, 
and a part of your army, should be cantoned along 
through the towns about the middle of Connecticut 
River. The post in the Highlands cannot, indeed, be 
neglected, and perhaps, for the better support of it, 
another post may be necessary about Fredericksburg. 
To supply them with provisions will be very difficult, 
and, whenever the frosts shall become severe, these 
posts will require much fewer men, and therefore it 
may be good policy to place those whose times are 
near expiring on that ground. The sick can, perhaps, 
be better and safer kept at Albany than elsewhere; 
and then a part of your force will be there to cover 
them, mount the necessary guards, &c. At Newark 
and Elizabethtown, advanced parties may be posted 
to cover the interior country and communication. A 
considerable body at Morristown will be necessary to 
secure the magazines, which may there be drawn to 
a point from all the communications, and there, most 
properly, because perfectly secure, and because na 
turally a good forage country. 

A small body of men will be necessary, for the 
sake of order, at Sussex Court-House, Easton, Coryell s, Brunswic, Princeton, &c. Amboy will, I ima 
gine, be too dangerous, as, by landing at the Blazing 
Star, or, in very cold weather, on the meadows be 
tween that and Amboy, they might be cut off. A 
part of the army might be quartered at Trenton. 
Bordentown, and Burlington, and a part at Valley 
Forge. The wagons of every kind, and horses, should 
be sent away from those not exposed. The advanced 
posts will require a few good horses, but they should 
have very little baggage, and only light, very light, 
artillery. A few good cavalry also may be requisite 
for the videttes. 

I cannot conceive that any clanger can arise from 
such dispersion of the army, and I am confident they 
can in that way be much better fed. My principal 
view is, I confess, this, that almost all the horses of 
the army may travel southward, perhaps as far as 
beyond the Potomac in the two counties of Frederic, 
and in Washington and Barclay counties, there to be 
boarded with the farmers, by which means they will 
be fit for use as early as the season will permit. 
The cavalry might be quartered in little villages, and. 
if the officers are good, the men as well as horses 
might improve. This peace and ease would help re 
cruiting ; but I have said too much already. 

However, as I have disposed of your army, pray 
let me now dispose of their General. I think Philadelphia would be a very proper place for him. In 
short, Sir, you must contrive to spend some time 
near Congress, and I am confident you will do more 
good by establishing a good understanding between 
them and the army, forwarding its business, and the 
like, than can be conceived. To all this I add, that, 
if the General, the Quarter-master, and the Commis 
sary-General are on this spot, all the arrangements for 
the next campaign will be properly made. One thing 
more, and I have done. It is, that I wish most earnestly to see you. Adieu. I am, yours, 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



FROM COLONEL WOOD. 

Williamsburg, 12 November, 1778. 

SIR, 

I have been here near three weeks, without being 
able, as yet, to get a final determination on any part 
of the business I came to transact. On my arrival, 
I discovered that the whole legislative body were 
highly pleased, with a thorough persuasion, that the 
war was at an end, that the British troops were em 
barking, and that there was not the most distant 
probability they would again return to the Continent. 

On Governor Henry s laying your Excellency s let 
ter before the House, I was happy to find it effect 
ually roused them from, their lethargy. They imme 
diately appointed Mr. Mason, Mr. Page, Mr. Nelson, 
and Mr. Parker a Committee, to confer with me on 
the state of the troops belonging to the Virginia line. 
I informed the Committee of the reduction that had 
taken place in the Virginia regiments, owing to the 

VOL. ii. 20 
great deficiency in the quota assigned to the State; 
that this measure had disgusted a number of the 
officers, who, I was confident, would leave the service 
at the close of the campaign; that it would take two 
thousand seven hundred and thirty-one, rank and file, 
to complete the regiments on the present establish 
ment, making a deduction for eight hundred drafts, 
whose time of service expires in February next ; 
that, by some default in the execution of the act of 
Assembly, one half of the drafts had never joined 
the army, but still remain in their respective counties; recommending proper exertions for apprehending 
them, and obliging them to serve for the time they 
have been absent, agreeably to law; that desertion 
prevails, particularly among the troops raised on the 
frontiers, owing, in my opinion, to that pernicious 
measure of sending a body of men for the protection 
of the settlement on Kentucky, which does not con 
sist of more than sixty men, most of whom are land 
robbers and runaways from the different States, which 
has formed a harbour for deserters, and every other 
species of villains. Besides, the idea was ridiculous 
to think of extending our territory, when we ought_ 
to be making use of every exertion to secure what 
we already occupy. 

That a number of enlistments have expired this 
fall, many of whom might have been reenlisted, had 
your Excellency been made acquainted with the ad 
ditional bounty allowed by the Assembly, and been 
furnished with the necessary sum to have answered 
that purpose ; that reserving a sufficient tract of 
country for the army, will have a good effect; but 
that opening a Land-Office, at this time, will be a 
means of many officers resigning, will make the men, 
acquainted with the back country, uneasy under their 
confinement, and would, in my opinion, effectually 
prevent the reenlisting any of those whose times of 
service are near expiring; that the most effectual 
mode for raising a sufficient number of men to fill 
up the regiments, will be to hold out a generous 
bounty, to proportion the number of men to be furnished by each county, according to the number of 
their militia, and limit a time by which they shall 
be raised ; in failure of which, an indiscriminate 
draft to take place. By this means it will induce 
every individual, from motives of interest, to contri 
bute towards increasing the bounty, and in effect to 
become recruiting officers ; that offering large rewards 
for apprehending deserters, and to oblige them to 
serve at least double the time of their absence, will 
be attended with good consequences. In all those 
propositions the Committee unanimously concurred, 
and reported them to the House, which were agreed 
to by a great majority of the House, and bills ordered to be brought in agreeably to the resolutions. 

I have preferred the officers memorial respecting 
the lands which they have been promised by Go 
vernment. It is still depending before a Committee ; 
but I have the pleasure to inform your Excellency, 
that I have the greatest reason to believe they will 
be unanimous in increasing the proportion of both 
officers and men, and that they will reserve a very 
large and valuable part of the back country for their 
use ; indeed, I am happy to find they discover a real 
inclination to make the situation of their troops, in 
every respect, as agreeable as possible. 

A great part of the present session has been taken 
up in considering the grants made by the Cherokees 
to Henderson and Company, which they have at last 
declared totally void. Disagreeable as my present 
situation is, I shall continue here till the bill for 
recruiting the regiments passes, and other matters 
respecting the army are considered; which I am 
afraid will not be long before Christmas, if I am to 
judge from their manner of doing business. What 
makes my stay so very disagreeable is, that my wife 
is in a declining and very dangerous situation, and 
that I had not time to stay more than two days 
with her, on my way from camp. If she should not 
be recovered on my return, I must beg your Excel 
lency s indulgence to stay some short time with her, 
if my absence can be dispensed with. 

I have discovered the most shameful neglects, in 
the Executive Department in this State, respecting 
the clothing and other necessaries furnished by the 
Assembly for the Virginia troops. It appears that 
clothing, liquors, and other necessaries, to the amount 
of near two hundred thousand pounds sterling, have 
been sent on, addressed to a Mr. Hollingsworth, a De 
puty Quartermaster-General at the head of Elk, who, 
from every information I can obtain, has sent a great 
proportion of them to the Clothier-General and Con 
tinental Stores, instead of forwarding them to the 
Virginia agent, for the use of their troops. I have 
represented this matter to the Assembly, who have 
directed a strict inquiry to be made, which, I hope, 
will be a means of our being better supplied in fu 
ture. 

I shall be exceedingly happy if my poor endea 
vours meet with your Excellency s approbation. I 
have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, 
Your Excellency s very obedient servant, 

JAMES WOOD. 
FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 20 November, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

I feel myself doubly honored by your favor of the 
14th instant, from the confidence of General Washington in the free communication of his sentiments, 
and in the coincidence of his ideas with my own 
upon a question, upon the wise decision of which the 
inheritance, possibly the establishment of the freedom 
and independence of these States, seem to depend. 
The respect, Sir, that I owe you demands an imme 
diate reply, and yet the variety of avocations in 
which I am engaged does not afford me moments for 
arranging or expressing my thoughts suitably to the 
importance of the subject. I am, nevertheless, en 
couraged to proceed, without hesitation, from a con 
viction that, were I to deliver my opinions at full 
length, I should be obliged to borrow your Excel 
lency s words, which I have the honor of assuring 
you, Sir, are, in more than one instance, repetitions 
of my own, and that in every other, one excepted, 
our sentiments on this momentous discussion exactly 
accord. 

I believe, and upon good ground, the scheme for 
an expedition into Canada, in concert with the arms 
of France, originated in the breast of the Marquis deLafayette, encouraged, probably, by conferences with 
Count d Estaing, and I also believe it to be the off 
spring of the purest motives, so far as respects that 
origin; but this is not sufficient to engage my con 
currence in a measure big with eventual mischiefs. 
As deeply as my very limited time and faculties had 
suffered me to penetrate, I had often contemplated 
our delicate connection with Erance ; and, although it 
20* 



234 LETTERS TO W A SIIINGT ON. 

is painful to talk of one s own foresight; had viewed 
and foretold, fifteen months ago, the humiliating state 
to which our embryo independence would be reduced 
by courting from that nation the loan of more money 
than should be actually necessary for the support of 
the army and of our unfortunate navy. 

I was one of the six unsuccessful opponents to the 
resolution for borrowing money from France for paying the interest of our Loan-Office certificates. We 
have, in this single article, plunged the Union into a 
vast amount of debt; and, from neglecting to exert 
our very small abilities, or even to show a leadingdisposition to cancel any part of the former demand 
against us, our bills for that interest are now floating, 
in imminent danger of dishonor and disgrace. Fully 
persuaded of the true value of national honor, I 
anxiously wished to support our own by a propriety 
and consistency of conduct, and I dreaded the conse 
quences of subjecting our happiness to the disposal 
of a powerful creditor, who may, upon any specious 
grounds, interpret national honor to our destruction. 
I warned my friends against the danger of mortgaging these States to foreign powers. Every million 
of livres you borrow implies a pledge of your lands ; 
and it is optional in your creditor to be repaid at 
the Bank of England, with an exorbitant premium, 
or to collect the money due to him in any of yourports, and according to his own mode, whenever na 
tional interest shall require the support of pretended 
national honor. 

Hence your Excellency will perceive what were 
my feelings, when the propositions for subduing Ca 
nada, by the aid of a French fleet and army, were 
first broached to me. I demurred exceedingly to the 
Marquis s scheme, and expressed some doubts of the 
concurrence of Congress. This was going as far as 
I dared, consistently with iny office, or considering 
him as a gentleman of equal honor and tenacity. 1 
trusted the issue of his application to the sagacity 
of Congress; the business was referred to a Commit 
tee., who conferred with the Marquis; their report 
was framed agreeably to his wishes; but the House 
very prudently determined to consult the Commanderin-chief previously to a final determination; and al 
though your Excellency s observations are committed, 
I am much mistaken if every member in Congress is 
not decided in his opinion in favor of them. If the 
prosecution of so extensive an object is, from the 
present state of our army and funds, impracticable 
on our part, it becomes altogether unnecessary to 
discuss the point in a political view. And I trust 
the Marquis will be satisfied with such reasonings, in 
apology for our desisting from the pursuit of his fa 
vorite enterprise, as our circumstances will dictate. 

The immense debts which we are involved in, 
abroad and at home, demand the utmost serious at 
tention, and call for an exertion of the collected wis 
dom of all these States, in order to secure what we 
have saved from the ravages of the enemy. I am 
very short-sighted if there be, at this time, any en 
couragement for attempting distant conquests. I have 
been uniformly averse from every proposition which 
is intended to dissipate our strength and to accumu 
late our debt. Events have confirmed my opinion; 
and at this instant, taking in view all circumstances, 
I have doubts of the policy, and more of the success, 
of the pending expedition against East Florida. Con 
gress will probably recommend to the States to raise 
a tax of near twenty millions the ensuing year. This, 
I hope, will have a good effect, by returning many 
of us to first principles, from which we have been too 
long wandering. This almost intolerable burden will 
rouse and animate our fellow-citizens ; they will pro 
bably send men of ability to investigate causes, to 
inquire into expenditures, and to call delinquents for 
unaccounted millions to severe reckonings ; they will 
do, what they have hitherto shamefully neglected, pass 
necessary laws for this purpose. 

This heavy tax, and the prospect of increasing impositions, w r ill show our constituents the necessity for 
consolidating our strength, as well as the impropriety 
and danger of new extensive military enterprises. 
Virtue and patriotism were the motto of our banners, 
when we entered this contest. Y/here is virtue, 
where is patriotism, now; when almost every man 
has turned his thoughts and attention to gain and 
pleasures, practising every artifice of change-alley, or 
Jonathans ; when men of abilities disgracefully neg 
lect the important duties for which they were sent 
to Congress, tempted by the pitiful fees of practising 
attorneys; when members of that body artfully start 
a point, succeed, and then avail themselves of the 
secrets of the House, and commence monopolizers, 
and accumulate the public debt for their private 
emoluments ? I believe many such tricks have been 
acted. The particular instance which I allude to cost 
these States a large sum of money without putting 
the criminal to the expense of a blush. When men, 
in almost every important public department, are ac 
tually concerned in commerce, incompatible with the 
strict duties of their respective offices; when the most 
egregious delinquents meet with support in Congress, 
and escape examination. I am tired, and fear tiring 
you, Sir, with this horrible, half-finished picture. 1 
will therefore leave it, but not before I add that the 
United States of America are in most deplorable cir 
cumstances ; that the requisitions of a foreign Minister 
have fixed the eyes of Europe upon them; that their 
weaknesses, their wickednesses, are no longer hidden, 
and that the States respectively are much to blame, 
and that, without speedy reformation, their shame 
and ruin collectively will folloAV. 

The disaster of Admiral Byron s fleet, and the 
successful departure of Count d Estaing s, are events 
much in our favor; that is to say, if we are pleased 
to make a wise improvement of them; but, from ex 
perience fearing the contrary, I am almost tempted 
to wish they had not happened. These fortunate cir 
cumstances will lull us to sleep again, and, while ourally is gaining honor, aggrandizement, and the highest national advantages, we shall be sinking into a 
state little better than tributary and dependent. Be 
this as it may, the world will ever honor by acknow 
ledging the virtues of the man, who, from my inmost 
soul, I believe keeps us at this moment from crumb 
ling. I have the honor to be, with the most sincere 
respect and esteem, dear Sir, 
Your much obliged and obedient humble servant, 

HENRY LAURENS. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL CADWALADER. 

Philadelphia, 4 December, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

The honorable command given me lately by Con 
gress, would have been very agreeable, if I had not 
conceived the war to be near the close.* You may 

* He had been appointed a Brigadier-General in the Continental 
army on the 10th of September, with the command of the cavalry, 
but he declined the appointment. 
remember, in the last conversation I had with yourExcellency, I gave my reasons fully for declining any 
command in the army. 

It is no small mortification to me, that, by not en 
tering early into the service, I lost the opportunity 
of sharing the honors which many officers have gained by serving under your command. 

The civilities I received from you, whilst I remained in your family at camp, will ever be remembered 
with gratitude ; and if our affairs should again take 
an unfortunate turn, be assured you have not a friend 
more ready than I shall be to share your dangers. 

I most sincerely wish you may live to see the 
liberties of your country established upon the broadest foundation ; which I know has ever been youronly object, from the beginning of this contest. I 
am, clear Sir, with the greatest esteem, 

Your most obedient and very humble servant, 

JOHN CADWALADER. 



FROM EDWARD RUTLEDGE. 

Charleston, 18 December, 1778. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

Your much esteemed favor of the 5th of October 
was put into my hands a few clays ago by General 
Lincoln. I sincerely thank you for your recollection 
of me, and for introducing to my acquaintance a 
gentleman of his character and merit. lie is much 
caressed ; and you may be assured that I shall pay 
him, and every other person whom I shall know you 
to regard, all the attention in my power. 

I wish I could prevail on myself to pass over that 
part of your letter, in which you remind me of onelong since written by you and unanswered, for I 
really blush when I even think of it; but I cannot 
be silent on the subject, or permit you to entertain 
the most distant idea, that a conduct, which was 
really founded in affection, could have proceeded from 
a different motive. Believe me, my dear General, the 
true reason of my silence was the uniform declara 
tion of every person who came from your camp, that 
every moment of your time was occupied by import 
ant business ; and, though I wished for the continu 
ance of a correspondence which afforded me the highest satisfaction, yet I could not permit myself to add 
a single feather to the weight which already pressed 
upon you. Affairs, however, now wear an appearance very different from what they did, and I will 
resume, with much pleasure, a correspondence which 
was laid aside with the greatest regret. 

You tell me that matters are much changed in the 
army and politics, since we last parted. God knows 
they are so, and in more senses than one. In many, 
they afford me very sensible concern ; and, if I am 
not much mistaken in my conjectures, the worst is 
yet to come. For, if report, and loud report too, is 
to be credited, that spirit of cabal and destructive 
ambition, which has elevated the factious demagogue 
in every republic of antiquity, is making great head 
in the centre of these States ; and, if not soon extin 
guished, will do more essential injury to the cause 
of America than the swords of Sir Harry and his 
whole army. I have given my opinion to several 
members of Congress, with great freedom, on this 
subject; and, if the situation of my private concerns 
would admit of it with the least degree of conven 
ience, I would give it them in person. But they are 
much opposed to such a step; and however pleasing 
it might be to me, to give my sentiments of men 
and measures, I must, at present, forego the gratifica 
tion. 

General Lincoln, it seems, is directed by Congress 
to undertake an expedition against St. Augustine ; 
but I believe it will hardly be attempted tin s win 
ter. The season is now far advanced, and but few 
things in readiness. We have not eighteen hundred 

O O 

Continentals in this State ; and your experience,, as 
well as the untimely fate of poor Montgomery, has 
sufficiently taught us how unavailing it is to attempt 
a siege with an impatient militia. Should he think 
himself obliged to it, I shall wish him success ; but 
if you do not hear that he has planted the Ameri 
can standard on the ramparts of the Castle, you must 
not be disappointed. The reduction of the place is 
certainly of importance to the more Southern States, 
as it affords assistance to the Indians, and a place 
of refuge to banditti, called the Florida Scout, who 
are committing continual depreciations on the fron 
tiers ; and, as they live by plunder, it is not to be 
supposed that they will cease their incursions till 
Augustine is our own. But to have made it so, Con 
gress should have concerted measures earlier and bet 
ter than they have ; for, attributing to them the best 
intentions, I do not think they will avail. 

Mrs. Middleton and Mrs. Rutledge desire me to 
present their best respects to you ; and I beg that 
you will believe me, my dear General, to be at all 
times and on all occasions, amongst the most sincere 
and affectionate of your friends. 

EDWARD RUTLEDGE. 
FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LINCOLN.* 

Charleston, 19 December, 1778. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

Immediately on my arrival here, I called for a re 
turn of the troops and Continental stores in this 
State, and the State of Georgia, but I have not yet 
obtained them ; otherwise, I should have done myself 
the honor of inclosing them; but, from all I can 
learn, there are very few Continental stores in either 
of the States. 

The troops have been supplied by this State ; and 
the heads of the several departments of Medical, 
Commissary, and Quarter-master, when supplies were 
necessary, have applied to the civil authority (there 
being no military chest here), who granted them, or 
not, as their own judgments dictated, which mode of 
doing business often created dissensions between the 
civil and military, and a militation of orders. 

In this situation I found matters, and that the 
army (to use Major-General Howe s own words) "had 
been in a state of abject dependency on the civil 
authority." Indeed, the Continental officer commanding in the department has not had it in his power, 
from the want of supplies which he could control, to 
march the troops without the consent of the Presi 
dent of this State, however urgent the necessity. I 
hope things will be better settled, and that I shall 
never be driven to the hard necessity of altercating 
with the civil power, than which nothing would be 
more disagreeable. 

* It was resolved in Congress, on the 25th of September, " that Ma 
jor-General Lincoln take command in the Southern department, and 
repair immediately to Charleston, South Carolina." 
VOL. II. 21 
The enemy from St. Augustine lately marched into 
Georgia. They summoned a small fort in Sunbury, 
but, satisfied with the spirited answer given by the 
officer commanding it, retreated over the Altaniaha 
River. They plundered negroes, cattle, c., to a 
considerable amount. I am not able to learn whether 
they have left the State or not. What was their 
original motive, whether a diversion of the troops 
here, whether to cooperate with a force from Xew 
York, or to secure a quantity of provisions, is not 
yet determined. I think the latter is most probable, 
though there are some reasons to suppose they ex 
pected to act in conjunction with a body from Xcw 
York. 

There are here very few troops, and I think a 
very small proportion of those called for by Congress 
will arrive. By the next opportunity, I hope to for 
ward the returns of the troops, and of the few Con 
tinental stores in this department. I have the honor 
to be, dear General, with the greatest esteem and 
affection, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 



FROM GOVERNOR LIVINGSTON. 

Elizabetlitown, 21 December, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have to acknowledge your Excellency s favors 
of the IGtli and 17th instant. 

From your Excellency s known disposition to afford 
this State all the assistance which the circumstances 
of your troops will permit, I think the reasons assigned., in your letter of the 16th, against sending 
a detachment into Monmouth, have their weight ; 
and one is often obliged to make those applications 
against one s own judgment, for the satisfaction, and 
through the solicitations, of others. 

I am happy to find your Excellency concur with 
me in sentiment respecting the prisoners lately be 
longing to the British ship, stranded on our coast ; 
and I have acquainted Colonel Beatty that they are 
to be considered as the prisoners of this State, and 
to be delivered to the order of Mr. Boudinot, ourCommissary. I am exceedingly pleased with the 
plan your Excellency proposes, in your letter of the 
17th, for suffering flag-boats to pass only once a 
month, except on extraordinary occasions. For the 
inhabitants of the States, who have no military busi 
ness to transact, it is quite sufficient ; and the inconvenience of being delayed for that space of time, 
when such establishment is found necessary for the 
public good, ought to be, and by all true Whigs 
will be, cheerfully acquiesced in. Indeed, of all 
those who have applied to me for recommendations 
to the commanding officer at Elizabethtown, to go to 
Statcn Island or New York, not above one in twenty 
appeared entitled to. that indulgence ; and many of 
them were as venomous Tories as any in the country. It is either from a vain curiosity (extremely 
predominant in women), cloaked with the pretence 
of securing their debts or effects, in which they 
seldom, if ever succeed ; or, for the sake of buying 
tea and trinkets (for which they would as soon for 
feit a second Paradise, as Eve did the first, for the 
forbidden fruit), that they are perpetually prompted 
to those idle rambles. I have, accordingly, been 
very sparing in gratifying their requests ; but have 
often had the mortification to find that many of 
those whom I had denied, were, notwithstanding, 
successful in their subsequent addresses to the mili 
tary officers, who, from a mistaken complaisance, 
seemed incapable of resisting the solicitations of 
those eloquent and pernicious vagrants. The men 
are still more seriously mischievous, and go with 
commercial motives, and to secure capital quantities 
of British merchandises. 

By a late law, our Legislature has made it penal 
for any of the inhabitants of this State to go into 
the enemy s lines without your Excellency s pass or 
mine ; and I am sure I shall not find myself disposed to grant any but in cases in which the prin 
ciples of charity or humanity evidently appear to 
require it. 

I hope the capture of the thirty Dutch vessels by 
the enemy on their passage to the West Indies, on 
pretence of their being intended for America, laden 
with French goods, will animate their High Mighti 
nesses to vindicate their rights, and protect their 
commerce. I have the honor to be, with the highestesteem, Dear Sir, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

WILLIAM LIVINGSTON. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LINCOLN. 

Purysburg, on the banks of the Savannah, thirty miles 

from its mouth, South Carolina; January 5, 1779. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

On the evening of the 25th ultimo, I received 
information at Charleston, that the enemy had arrived, with upwards of twenty ships, at Tybee, nearthe mouth of the River Savannah, and in a harboursouth of the river. The few troops at Charleston were 
immediately put in motion, and marched for Georgia, 
On my way, I met an express from General Howe, 
who w^as in Georgia, informing that, on the morning 
of the 29th, the enemy landed, in force, a little 
below the town of Savannah ; and that he, with five 
or six hundred men, occupied the heights in front of 
it ; but, upon perceiving that the enemy had turned 
his right, at some considerable distance, through a 
swamp he thought impassable, ordered a retreat, 
which he effected with part of the troops, though 
the enemy, it is said, were twenty-five hundred or 
three thousand strong. His loss, in men and officers, 
I inclose. What stores were lost, I cannot yet learn; 
among them were six field-pieces. One of the fieldpieces only was under the direction of Major-General 
Howe. 

The General speaks well of his officers and men ; 
and that more than they did, could not have been 
expected. lie retreated over the Savannah. I met 
him here, where we are collecting the troops. Ourwhole force at this place amounts to about fourteen 
hundred. As soon as a body of men, equal to covering the State of Georgia, can be collected, we shall 
recross the Savannah. It ought to be with a respect 
able force, for the communication with this State is 
frequently cut off by the Savannah overflowing its 
banks, which renders the causeways impassable in 
boats or otherwise. There are no strong grounds in 
this country; many of the inhabitants of the State 
are unfriendly; and, besides, the country abounds 
with navigable rivers; all of which the enemy command, and through which they can, at any time, fall 
in our rear. 

21* 
I have met with almost every disappointment since 
I came into this department. After an encourage 
ment to expect a force consisting of seven thousand 
men, besides the militia of South Carolina and Geor 
gia, I have now only fourteen hundred. I was as 
sured that there were a great plenty of supplies 
and military stores ; instead of which, there were no 
field-pieces, arms, tents, camp utensils, lead (and very 
little powder), intrenching tools; and, in short, hardly 
an article in the arsenal or Quartermaster-General s 
store, under the direction of the Commanding Officerin this department. This deficiency of stores did not 
arise from the neglect of the Commanding Officer, 
but the want of a military chest. I forbear; the 
subject is disagreeable ; for you to hear, will be 
painful. 

I expected, before now, to have had the honor of 
forwarding to your Excellency a return of the troops 
here, but the distracted state of affairs still prevents it. 

I have daily the unhappiness to see families of 
affluence fleeing before the enemy, reduced in a few 
hours to a state of want. 

My w r ound, which was nearly closed when I left 
camp, is opening again, and in a worse condition 
than it was seven months ago ; but I flatter myself 
nothing worse than some small exfoliations will take 
place. I am, my dear General, with the highest sen 
timents of esteem, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 

January Qth. Last evening I heard that the enemy were reenforced by troops from St. Augustine, 
and now amounted to four thousand ; and that Colonel Campbell, the Commander of the British forces 
in Georgia, had left Savannah, and marched, with his 
main body, up the river, whether with a design to 
cross and attack this post or not, is uncertain. 



FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Boston, 5 January, 1779. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

In my difficult situation, at such a distance from 
you, I am obliged to take a determination by my 
self, which I hope will meet with your approbation. 
You remember that, in making full allowance for 
deliberations, the answer from Congress was to reach 
me before the 15th of last month, and I have long 
since waited without even hearing from them. Nay, 
many gentlemen from Philadelphia assure me Con 
gress believe that I am gone long ago. Though my 
affairs call me home, private interests would, how 
ever, induce me to wait for your Excellency s letters, 
for the decision of Congress about an exchange, in 
case I should be taken, and for the last determina 
tions concerning the plans of the next campaign. 

But I think the importance of the despatches I 
am the bearer of; the uncertainty and improbability 
of receiving any others here (my giving intelligence 
at Versailles may be for the advantage of both na 
tions) ; the inconvenience of detaining the fine fri 
gate, on board of which I return; and the danger of 
losing all the men, who desert very fast, are reasons 
so important as oblige me not to delay any longer. 
I am the more of that opinion, from Congress having 
resolved to send, about this time, three fast-sailing 
vessels to Franco, and the Marine Committee having 
promised me to give the despatches to such officers 
as I would recommend. It is a very good way of 
forwarding their letters,, and sending such as yourExcellency may be pleased to write me. I beg you 
will send copies of them by the several vessels. 

To hear from you, my most respected friend, will 
be the greatest happiness I can feel. The longer the 
letters yon write, the more blessed with satisfaction 
I shall think myself. .1 hope you will not refuse me 
that pleasure as often as you can. I hope you will 
ever preserve that affection, which I return by the 
to nd. crest sentiments. 

How happy, my dear General, I should be to conie 
next spring, principally, as it might yet be proposed, 
I need not to say. Your first letter will let me 
know what I am to depend upon, on that head ; and. 
I flatter myself, the first from me will confirm to 
you that I am at liberty, and that most certainly I 
intend to come next campaign. 

My health is now in the best condition, and I 
would not remember I ever was sick, were it not for 
the marks of friendship you gave me on that occa 
sion. My good doctor has attended me with his 
usual care and tenderness. He will see me on board, 
and then return to head-quarters; but the charge of 
your friend was intrusted to him till I was on board 
the frigate. I have met with the most kind hospi 
tality in this city; and, drinking water excepted, the 
doctor has done every thing he could to live happy. 
He dances and sings at the assemblies most charm 
inl. 






The gentlemen who, I hope, will go to France, 
have orders to go to head-quarters ; and I flatter my 
self, my dear General, that you will write me by 
them. I beg you will let the "bearer of this, Captain 
Lacolombe, know that I recommend him to yourExcellency for the commission of Major. 

Be so kind, my dear General, as to present my 
best respects to your lady, and the gentlemen of yourfamily. I hope you will quietly enjoy the pleasure 
of being with Mrs. Washington, without any disturb 
ance from the enemy, till I join you again ; I also 
hope you will approve of niy sailing, which, indeed, 
was urged by necessity, after waiting so long. 

Farewell, my most beloved General ; it is not with 
out emotion I bid you this last adieu, before so long 
a separation. Don t forget an absent friend, and be 
lieve me, forever and ever, with the highest respect 
and tenderest affection. 

On board the Alliance, 10 January. 1779. 

I open again my letter, my dear General, to let 
you know that I am not yet gone ; but, if the wind 
proves fair, I shall sail to-morrow. Nothing from 
Philadelphia ; nothing from head-quarters. So that 
everybody, as well as myself, is of opinion that I 
shall be WTong to wait any longer. I hope I am 
right, and I hope to hear soon from you. Adieu, my 
dear and forever beloved friend, adieu. 

LAFAYETTE. 



FROM PHILIP MAZZEI. 

Colle, in Albemarle, 27 January, 1779. 

SIR, 

Although I had not in my power to pay you my 
respects as often as I did wish, the notice you were 
pleased to take of me, when I came into the country, will, I hope, apologize for the liberty I take of 
asking the honor of ypur commands for Franco and 
Italy, which I am certain to receive, if lodged with 
the Governor or Mr. Blair, in Williamsburff. 

O 

I am going to Europe with the most sanguine ex 
pectations of success in my endeavours to promote 
whatever may be of present and future advantage to 
this Continent. Mr. Ilarvie and another gentleman 
told me, some time ago, that you had inquired what 
success I have had, and what prospect I have, rela 
tive to the new branches of agriculture which I have 
attempted to introduce in our country. Experience 
has convinced me that this country is better calculated than any other I am acquainted with for the 
produce of wine ; but I cannot say the same in re 
gard to oil and lemons. It is true that we cannot 
call what I have had as yet a fair trial, the seasons 
having been, by all accounts, much worse than any 
man remembers. And it is not improbable that the 
same seasons would not have been so detrimental to 
the plants, if they had previously acquired age and 
vigor. One spring as bad as those we have had 
ever since I came, except the last, would, in Italy 
and the south of France, have destroyed all the young 
vines and many of the old. Here many of my vines, 
planted under several disadvantages, have not only 
survived repeated severe spring frosts, but they are 
now more vigorous and luxuriant than vines of the 
same age would be in those countries, and have 
sooner produced grapes in respectable quantity and 
as good. 

Should I be so happy as to succeed in my endea 
vours abroad, I hope soon to return with the means 
of prosecuting my undertaking with vigor; in which 
case my veneration for your personal merit, and the 
natural desire of seeing the Deliverer of our country, 
must excuse me for assuming to go and give you, in 
person, an account of what I shall have done to that 
place of rural felicity, where I wish you may long 
enjoy the fruits of your heroism. With profound re 
spect I have the honor to be, Sir, your Excellency s 
Most humble and most obedient servant, 

PHILIP MAZZEI. 



FROM THOMAS PAINE. 

Philadelphia, 31 January, 1779. 

SIR, 

Hearing that you leave this place to-morrow, I beg 
you to accept a short reason why I have not waited 
on you. 

I have been out nowhere for near these two months. 
The part I have taken in an affair, that is yet depending, rendered it most prudent in me to absent 
myself from company, lest I should be asked ques 
tions improper to be answered, or subject myself to 
conversation that might have been unpleasant. That 
there has been foul play somewhere, is clear to every 
one and where it lies, will, I believe, soon come 
out. 

Having thus explained myself, I have to add my 
sincerest wishes for your happiness in every line of 
life, and to assure you that, as far as my abilities 
extend, I shall never suffer a hint of dishonor or 
even a deficiency of respect to you to pass unnoticed. 
I have always acted that part, and am confident that 
your virtues and conduct will ever require it from 
me as a duty, as well as render it a pleasure. 

I never heard either Colonel R. or Colonel T. Lee 
express a sentiment in your disfavor. I can answer 
for nothing farther. I likewise take the liberty of 
mentioning to you that, at the time some discontents 
from the army and the country last winter wore doing you great injustice, I published the fifth number 
of the CRISIS, in which I hoped, by bringing yourformer services in view, to shame them out, or at 
least to convince them of their error. I was then at 
Lancaster, and on my return to Yorktown I saw the 
Foreign Committee, of which Colonel E. II. Lee was 
chairman, had sent off despatches to France. The 
copy was in his handwriting, and in these despatches 
he inclosed that pamphlet, and spoke of it as "the 
general sentiments of America on what the enemy 
had so boastingly called their successes." 

I am very desirous of bidding you farewell, and 
intend making you a short visit to-day for that purpose, notwithstanding the reasons I have before men 
tioned. I am, with every wish for your happiness, 
Your obedient, humble servant, 

THOMAS PAINE. 



FROM ROBERT RUTHERFORD. 

Berkley County, Virginia, 8 February, 1779. 

DEAR SIR, 

It is with singular pleasure I congratulate yourExcellency on the short relaxation from the utmost 
exertions in the field, where you have rendered yourcountry most essential services, and gained lasting 
honor to yourself. I have not ventured to trouble 
you with letters, truly sensible how many and great 
were the important matters that must necessarily engage your unceasing attention ; but your safety, ho 
nor, and happiness, were ever very near to inc. 

I well know the generous goodness of your heart 
in the case of every brave officer, or common senti 
nel, and that nothing on your part will be wanting 
to alleviate their sufferings ; but the bearer, Ma 
jor Drake, my neighbour, and of whose integrity I 
have long been convinced, being now on his way to 
New York, I cannot withhold my particular recommendation of him to your Excellency s notice, and 
hope that Congress will cooperate with you in all 
possible means for the ease and advantage of him, 
and every other officer of distinguished merit. 

It is with much concern I find the resolve of 
Congress, respecting the money emissions of May 
20th, 1777, and April llth, 1778, giving great and 
general alarm, tending to depreciate the currency, as 
the holders of these emissions are really deprived of 
the use of their money for six months, as it in a 
great measure ceases to pass here in payments; and, 
what is an additional misfortune, our Assembly have 
laid on an enormous assessment, in payment of which 
not one shilling of this money can be applied, as 
the sheriffs cannot make any part of their collections 
by the 1st of June. Assuredly Congress have not 
taken the whole matter into the account, as I am 
informed that large sums of this money are now in 
the possession of the subjects of Spain upon the Mis 
sissippi, they being enjoined by the Governor of Or 
leans to receive it, not to mention many other obvi 
ous objections ; so that I am sensible it will be con 
sistent with the wonted justice and prudence of that 
august body, without loss of time, to revise and 
greatly change the terms of that resolve. 

It is now with me conclusive, that nothing will 
VOL. n. 22 
answer our purpose but adopting a former recommendation of Congress in the several States (though 
I then thought it impolitic), that of fixing some 
bounds to our produce, manufactures, &c. ; at the 
same time that I should be for allowing very liberal 
prices, even five or six times as -much as formerly 
(if the demand obliged the purchaser to bid so high), 
and to encourage manufactures in the highest degree; 
but not to suffer the mechanic, the extortioner, those 
in the character of tavern-keepers, and a few others, 
to swallow up the States. Foreign trade will, of 
course, be regulated by the demand for European 
articles ; if they are very high, w T e shall purchase the 
fewer of them. 

Indian affairs do not strike me in an agreeable 
point of view ; for certainly we can expect no real 
friendship from that troublesome and formidable people, till we supply them upon equal terms, at least, 
with our enemies, and convince them, in every other 
respect, of our justice, equality, and moderation to 
wards them. 

I cannot enlarge upon many other matters, having 
already given your Excellency too much trouble ; and 
I shall only add my ardent wishes, that you may 
continue to be the peculiar care of a superintending 
Providence ; that your life may be prolonged for the 
temporal saving of the United States, and to enjoy, 
with the most perfect felicity, your family, friends, 
and fortunes amidst the grateful acclamations of a 
great and generous people. I am joined by my 
brother and our families. Pray make my compli 
ments agreeable to your good lady. I am, with 
great affection, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

ROBERT RUTIIEIIFOHD. 
FROM GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Poughkeepsie, 3 March, 1779. 

DEAR SIR, 

Although there have been no hostilities committed 
by the enemy during the winter on the western 
frontier of this State, the inhabitants, particularly of 
Tryon county, are so strongly impressed with apprehensions of danger on the opening of the spring, that 
many of them have already, and I am informed that 
most of them will speedily, remove into the interior 
parts of the country, unless they can have reason to 
expect more perfect protection than we were able to 
afford them last year. Within a few weeks I have 
received repeated applications from them on this sub 
ject, intimating their intentions to abandon their set 
tlements, unless I could assure them that such measures would be pursued as would render them se 
cure ; and, as I am sensible that nothing short of 
spirited offensive operations against the savages can 
effect this, I find myself particularly embarrassed. 
If I am much longer silent, they will remove, and 
to encourage them to continue might, in the event, 
be cruel. 

I would therefore wish, if offensive operations are 
really intended in that quarter, that I might have 
such intimation of it as would enable me to give 
general assurances to the inhabitants to induce them 
to continue on their farms, which, considering the present general scarcity of bread, will be a capital ob 
ject, as that county is one of the principal granaries 
of this State. I am also induced to make this appli 
cation to your Excellency, as our Legislature is now 
sitting, and discover a disposition to enable me k 
call out a body of men for the ensuing season to 
cooperate with such Continental troops as your Ex 
cellency may destine for this service. 

I am advised that Lieutenani&gt;Colonel Willett, Vv r ho 
has an influence among the people of Tryon county 
(from his exertions at Fort Schuyler when invested 
by St. Leger), might be serviceably employed in arranging the militia there for a few months, and I 
would be glad to have it in my power to call himto that service, if I should esteem it necessary ; and 
this, I presume, might be done without injuring his 
regiment, as it is completely officered. 

I will be much obliged to your Excellency for any 
late intelligence which you are at liberty to commu 
nicate. I am, with the highest respect and esteem, 
Your most obedient servant, 

GEORGE CLINTON. 

P. S. I omitted mentioning that, if we raise any 
number of men, we shall be at a loss to arm them 
fit for the field, unless we can be supplied by the 
public, the arms to be returned at the expiration 
of the time allotted for the service. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GATES. 

Boston, 4 March, 1779. 

SIR, 

Yesterday I had the honor to receive your Excel 
lency s letter of the 14th ultimo, from Middlebrook. 
I am sorry to find your Excellency seems to have 
given over all thoughts of penetrating into Canada 
by the route of Coos, after the preparations made for 
that purpose, at an incredible expense. 
I am satisfied you could not have advised with 
two men, upon this Continent, better acquainted with 
the practicable routes to the River St. Lawrence, than 
General Bayley and Colonel Hazen, the latter being 
an officer of great merit and service, and who long 
resided upon the River Sorel ; and the former, the 
best of any acquainted with the country between 
Coos and Lake St. Peter s, who likewise has the most 
extensive influence upon the brave and numerous in 
habitants in the northern parts of the States which 
lie near Canada. As your Excellency advised with 
them, and determined upon the route by Coos, I beg 
leave to express my astonishment at the sudden 
change of your sentiments, and relinquishment of that 
plan. 

To go into Canada by Lake Champlain, before the 
enemy s fleet are taken or destroyed, is almost impracticable ; to attempt it by Lake Ontario, before 
Niagara is taken, and vessels upon that Lake are re 
moved, is still more difficult, as the Fort at La Galette must be reduced before the passage down the 
River St. Lawrence is open to Montreal. I believe 
that, in the present state of our army, and the actual 
situation of our magazines, to attempt a serious inva 
sion of Canada, by whatever route, would prove unsuccessful, unless the fleet of our allies should, at the 
same time, cooperate with us, by sailing up the River 
St. Lawrence. In that case, the enemy s force would 
all (their fleet excepted) move down the river, to 
succour Quebec ; and our armament from Coos, as 
sisted by the Canadians, who would flock to meet us, 
might march in the utmost security from Coos to 
Lake St. Peter s. The Upper Canada would then be 
wholly ours, and the English fleet on Lake Champlain, thus rendered useless, would be destroyed by 
22* 
its own crews, before these should be ordered down 
the river, to make the best of their way to Quebec. 

I much lament the amazing and needless expense 
that is incurred by the preparations making on the 
upper part of Hudson s River; for, I am confident, 
no force of ours can get into Canada by either of the 
routes from Albany, in 1779. 

The last paragraph of your Excellency s letter 
alarms me exceedingly. There is no magazine of 
flour in all these States ; and to have no hopes of 
procuring one, either by land or sea, is a most me 
lancholy consideration. 

The Navy Board, here, just now acquainted me 
with their having lost all hopes of any supply of 
rice from South Carolina, that State having laid an 
embargo on that article. With very great respect 
and esteem, I am, Sir, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

HORATIO GATES. 



FROM THOMAS CHITT^NDEN, GOVERNOR OF VERMONT. 

Bennington, G March, 1779. 

SIR, 

I am directed, by my Council and the General 
Assemby of this State, to recommend to your Ex 
cellency the present unhappy situation of the inhabit 
ants of the northern frontiers of this State, and to 
pray your Excellency s interposition for their future 
relief. 

The contiguous situation of those inhabitants to the 
enemy, has rendered their safety peculiarly uncertain, 
from the first commencement of the present war. 
The many alarms, occasioned by the approaches of 
the enemy, have kept its inhabitants in such a fluc 
tuating condition, as has rendered it impracticable for 
them to have secured any considerable supplies of 
provisions for the subsistence of their families before 
hand. The encroachments of the army, under the 
command of Lieutenant-General Burgoyne, into this 
State, in the year 1777, their daring attempt to destroy this town, and the public stores then deposited 
here, commanded the attention, as well as the most 
vigorous exertions of those inhabitants ; and, although 
there were at that time very plentiful crops of grain, 
corn, hay, &c., on the ground, yet the enemy prevented the inhabitants from securing any considera 
ble part of it. 

By their continuing in service, for the purpose 
of reducing General Burgoyne to a submission, the 
season of the year was so far advanced, as to put 
it out of the power of those inhabitants to make the 
necessary preparations for a crop of winter grain, on 
which they have had their greatest dependence, since 
the first settlement of this part of the country. 

They are, therefore, the principal part of them, re 
duced to an Indian cake, in scant proportion to the 
number of their families ; and by the destruction of 
their sheep by the enemy, and their loss of them 
otherwise, as well as of their flax, their bellies and 
backs are become co-sufferers. 

In this deplorable situation, may it please yourExcellency, they remain firm and unshaken, and being generally well armed and accoutred, are ready, on 
any sudden emergency, and on the shortest notice, 
to face and encounter their inveterate foe undaunted ; but, on viewing their present circumstances, it 
may be your Excellency may be prevailed on to 
make such provision for the security of those frontiers (which are no less so to three other States), as 
to prevent the fatal necessity of continuing those in 
habitants in constant service the ensuing summer. 

With this will be communicated a copy of Briga 
dier-General Clinton s letter, of the 25th ultimo, by 
which your Excellency will perceive his readiness to 
grant every relief in his power. 

In consequence of his advice, I have ordered the 
continuance of the company of militia therein named, 
and an addition of fifty men, exclusive of officers, to 
join them immediately. 

If, after all that has been exhibited on this sub 
ject, it should be found inconsistent to adopt any 
other measures in the case, I desire an order may be 
granted for the subsistence and pay of the officers 
and soldiers, that may be found necessary to be raised from time to time, within this State, for the purpose aforesaid. 

The bearer hereof, Joseph Fay, Esq., in whose at 
tachment to the common cause your Excellency may 
repose the greatest confidence, will be able to give 
any further intelligence in the premises, and particu 
larly wait any advice or directions your Excellency 
may please to communicate. I am, Sir, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

THOMAS CIIITTENDEN. 



FROM GOVERNOR HENRY. 

Williainsburg, 13 March, 1779. 



SIR, 

The reasons hinted in your Excellency s last favor 
are certainly of such weight as to prevent the flagof-truce vessels, coming with stores, &c., for the Convention troops, from proceeding further than Hamp 
ton Road. Orders are, therefore, issued to-day, for 
vessels of our own to be ready at that place to con 
vey the stores upwards to their destination, under 
the superintendence of proper Commissaries. 

My last accounts from the South are unfavorable. 
Georgia is said to be in full possession of the enemy, 
and South Carolina in great danger. The number of 
disaffected there is said to be formidable, and the 
Creek Indians inclining against us. One thousand 
militia are ordered thither from our southern counties ; but a doubt is started whether they are by law 
obliged to inarch. I have also proposed a scheme to 
embody volunteers for this service; but I fear the 
length of the march, and a general scarcity of bread, 
which prevails in some parts of North Carolina and 
this State, may impede this service. About five hundred militia are ordered doAvn the Tennessee River, 
to chastise some new settlements of renegade Cherokees that infest our south-western frontier, and prevent 
our navigation on that river, from which we began 
to hope for great advantages. Our militia have full 
possession of the Illinois, and the posts on the Wabash; and I am not without hopes that the same 
party may overawe the Indians as far as Detroit. 
They are independent of General Mclntosh, whose 
numbers, although upwards of two thousand, I think 
could not make any great progress, on account, it is 
said, of the route they took, and the lateness of the 
season. 

The conquest of Illinois and Wabash was effected 
with less than t\vo hundred men, who will soon be 
reenforced ; and, by holding posts on the back of the 
Indians, it is hoped may intimidate them. Forts 
Natchez and Morishac are again in the enemy s hands ; 
and from thence they infest and ruin our trade on 
the Mississippi, on which river the Spaniards wish to 
open a very interesting commerce with us. I have 
requested Congress to authorize the conquest of those 
two posts, as the possession of them will give a co 
lorable pretence to retain all West Florida, when a 
treaty may "be opened, and, in the mean time, ruin 
our trade in that quarter, which would otherwise be 
so beneficial. I can get no answer to this applica 
tion, although it is interesting to our back settle 
ments, and not more than four hundred men required 
for the service. 

I beg pardon for intruding these several subjects 
upon you. If you find leisure to make any observa 
tions upon them, they will be highly acceptable. 
With every sentiment of regard and esteem, I am, 
dear Sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

PATRICK HENRY. 



FROM GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Pouglikeepsie, 18 March, 1779. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have had the honor of receiving your Excel 
lency s letters of the 4th and 6th instant, and am 
happy in being thereby enabled to give such general 
assurances of protection to the frontier inhabitants as, 
I have reason to hope, will prevent their deserting 
their settlements. This your Excellency may be as 
sured will be done, with the utmost regard to that 
secrecy which is necessary to insure success in of 
fensive operations ; and, therefore, the greatest care 
will be taken not to give them the most remote idea 
of any such intention. 
The Legislature, before they adjourned, empowered 
me to embody one thousand men for the defence of the 
northern and western frontiers, or such other service 
as I should judge proper to employ them in. This 
was the most they conceived the State, under its 
present distressed situation, was able to raise ; and 
the greater part of them were intended to join the 
troops to be employed in defensive operations against 
the savages. Since the rising of the Legislature, I 
have received the resolve of Congress for filling up 
the Continental battalions ; and this will put me under the necessity of taking at least one half of these 
levies for the purpose, as it would be impracticable 
to convene the Legislature in season to make any 
new provision for that service, even though our cir 
cumstances would admit of it. 

I do not imagine we shall be able to derive any 
considerable force from the inhabitants, whose settle 
ments have been destroyed. Their losses and conse 
quent distresses are so great, that it requires the ut 
most industry to support their families ; and the pay 
in the army, considering the depreciated state of ourcurrency, would not be competent for this purpose. 
The most of their young men are already engaged in 
the Continental battalions. Some, however, from a desire of revenge for their losses, will, at all events, 
engage ; and the neighbourhoods that have been less 
distressed will furnish a considerable proportion, who, 
being as well acquainted with the country, will be 
equally serviceable. 

In order to deceive the enemy into a belief that 
we intend acting on the defensive only, I submit to 
your Excellency the propriety of erecting one or two 
small posts on the nearest navigable waters of the 
Susquehanna, They would not only answer the 
above purpose, but serve also as a security to the 
settlements, and, of course, induce the militia to en 
gage in the service with greater alacrity. I am not 
sufficiently acquainted with the country to determinewith certainty the particular places best calculated 
for such posts ; but, from the general idea I have of 
the country, I am led to believe that Unadilla, and 
where the Susquehanna empties out of the Lakes 
west of Cherry Valley, would be the most eligible. 
These posts might be maintained by militia, at least 
while the other troops were employed in offensive 
operations. I have the honor to be, with the highestesteem and regard, dear Sir, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

GEORGE CLINTON. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SULLIVAN. 

Mill Stone, 1C April, 1779. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

As your Excellency has honored me with an 
appointment to command the intended expedition/ 1 "- I 
must beg leave to lay my sentiments before you in 
writing ; as words used in conversation may vanish 
in air, and the remembrance of them be lost, while 
writing will remain, either to justify my opinion, 
or to prove that it was erroneous. The variety of 
reasons, which I urged yesterday, for passing with 
the main body up the Mohawk River, and down by 
Wood Creek to the Cayuga Lake, still have their 
weight in my mind ; but, as General Schuyler writes 

* An expedition against the hostile tribes of the Six Nations of 
Indians. See the Instructions in Washington s Writings, Vol. VI. 
p. 2G4. 
that they cannot be supplied with provisions, the 
plan must be given up, and that of passing with 
the main body up the Susquehanna adopted. 

The force which I have requested for that quarter, is three thousand effective men, after all proper 
deductions are made for guards at the several posts, 
for boatmen, hospital guards, tenders, &c. &c. That 
these should be collected before we enter the Indian 
country, appears to me essentially necessary, as it 
is supposed that the principal opposition we shall 
meet will be between Wyoming and Tioga. Should 
this be the case, as seemed to be the general opinion in Council yesterday, we can derive no advan 
tage from the party on the Mohawk River, as they 
are not to join us until we have established a post 
at Tioga. Should they attempt to join us before, 
they must be defeated in passing down the Susquehanna ; and, should our numbers be such as to 
admit of a defeat before we arrive at Tioga, as we 
can have no communication with the other party, 
and they are to regulate themselves by a plan fixed 
before we march, they will remain ignorant of ourdefeat, and of course proceed at the time appointed, 
and in all probability fall into the hands of the 
enemy. If we are to expect the principal opposition 
before we arrive at Tioga, it is absurd to reckon, 
for part of our force, troops who are not to attempt 
joining us before we have passed the principal dan 
ger. 

Indeed, I have no great dependence upon the 
advantages to be derived from so small a party in 
that quarter. It was yesterday said, that we might 
expect fourteen hundred Indians to oppose us in ourmarch. Your Excellency will permit me to say, that 
fourteen hundred Indians, perfectly acquainted with 

VOL. ii. 23 
the country, capable of seizing every advantage which 
the ground can possibly afford, perfectly acquainted 
with the use of arms, inured to war from their youth, 
and, from their manner of living, capable of enduring every kind of fatigue, are no despicable enemy, 
when opposed to three thousand troops, totally unac 
quainted with the country and the Indian manner of 
fighting, and who, though excellent in the field, are 
far from having that exactness with fire-arms or that 
alertness in a wooded country, which Indians have. 
As so many facts have contributed to prove this, it 
will be unnecessary for me to say more upon the 
subject. If I was not a party concerned in this ex 
pedition, and my opinion was asked of the force necessary to insure success, I should give it, that the 
force of each party should be equal to the highestestimate of the enemy s force in that country, that 
they might be able to form a junction at all events, 
and put the matter beyond possibility of doubt; and, 
after that, they would be enabled to detach and con 
quer the country in an eighth part of the time that 
they would, if obliged, for their own safety, to keep 
in a body. I know that the estimated force of the 
Indians is small ; but, when I consider that under 
rating the number of the enemy has been a prevailing error with us since the commencement of the 
war, that we have had persons from among them, both 
inhabitants and deserters, and have had the proceedings, debates, and calculations of Parliament before us, 
and yet have frequently mistaken their number more 
than one half, I cannot suppose but that we are still 
liable to fall into the same error, where we can have 
no evidence, and every thing told us respecting them 
is a mere matter of opinion. In addition to this, let 
me repeat what I observed yesterday, which is the 
probability of a force being sent from Canada by 
way of Lake Ontario. I also beg leave to observe 
that, when our advancement upon the Susquehanna is 
known, it will probably be conjectured that our in 
tention is against Niagara, which will induce the 
enemy strongly to reenforce that post. This they 
may do in a fortnight, as it is but one hundred and 
ten miles from Montreal to Oswegachie, and their 
vessels can take troops from thence to Niagara in 
three or four days; and, when they find that our in 
tention is against the Indian settlements, those troops 
will undoubtedly join them. From these considera 
tions it must appear that the demand I have madeis far from being unreasonable, even exclusive of 
the party sent on their flanks. I well know that 
Continental troops cannot be spared for this purpose, 
but good militia should undoubtedly be called for. 
The expedition is undertaken to destroy those Indian 
nations, and to convince others that we have the 
power to carry the war into their country, whenever 
they commence hostilities. Should we fail in the at 
tempt, the Indians will derive confidence from it, and 
grow more insolent than before. 

I beg leave further to mention, that, in my opinion, the troops selected for this expedition are by no 
means equal to those they must expect to encounter ; 
especially the Pennsylvania troops, as they are prin 
cipally made up of old countrymen, who are totally 
unacquainted with that kind of fighting, which they 
must adopt. I have conversed with General St. Clair 
upon this head, who is fully of my opinion. The 
best troops, in my opinion, for this expedition, are 
General Poor s brigade, who are all marksmen, and 
accustomed to the Indian mode of fighting. I think 
the Jersey troops good ; the York troops I know nothing of; the other broken corps I can say nothing 
about., only that, when they come to act in a body 
with others, much cannot be expected from them. 

Thus have I submitted my sentiments to your Ex 
cellency, and trust that my reasoning upon the sub 
ject must prove, that three thousand good and effect 
ive men, at least, will be necessary to march from 
Tioga, exclusive of those which your Excellency may 
think proper to direct to operate on the other flank 
of the enemy. I have the honor to be, with the 
most lively sentiments of esteem and respect, 
Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

JOHN SULLIVAN. 

P. S. Since writing the above, I have shown it to 
General St. Clair, who says that his sentiments correspond with mine in every particular. J. S. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.* 

Philadelphia, 21 April, 1779. 

DEAR SIR, 

Accept my thanks for the long and friendly letter 
of the 14th instant, which I have had the pleasure 
of receiving from you. It was, for many reasons, 
grateful to me. I value the esteem of the wise and 
virtuous, and had wished to know the particulars of 
transactions respecting which only vague and unsatis 
factory reports had come to my knowledge. Delicacy 
forbad my breaking the subject to you when here. 

* Mr. Jay was elected President of Congress on the 10th of Decem 
ber, 1778. 
I was sure of your politeness, but not certain of a 
more than usual degree of confidence. The latter has 
now been made manifest, and, permit me to assure 
you, it shall be mutual. 

The impression attempted to be made has not 
taken. It passed without a single remark. Yourfriends thought it merited nothing but silence and 
neglect. The same reason induced me to take no 
notice of it in my answer. I have perused the several papers with which you favored me. The delicacy, 
candor, and temper diffused through your letter, form 
a strong contrast to the evasions and design observ 
able in some others. Gratitude ought to have attached a certain gentleman to the friend who raised him. 
A spurious ambition, however, has, it seems, madehim your enemy. This is not uncommon. To the 
dishonor of human nature, the history of mankind 
has many pages filled with similar instances ; and we 
have little reason to expect that the annals of the 
present or future times will present us with fewer 
characters of this class. On the contrary, there is 
reason to expect they will multiply in the course of 
this revolution.* 

Seasons of general heat, tumult, and fermentation, 
favor the production and growth of some great vir 
tues, and of many great and little vices. Which will 
predominate, is a question which events not yet pro 
duced, nor now to be discerned, can alone determine. 
What parties and factions will arise, to what objects 
be directed, what sacrifices they will require, and who 
will be the victims, are matters beyond the sphere 
of human prevision. New modes of Government, not

270 LETTERS TO AV A SHIN GTON. 

generally understood, nor, in certain instances, approved; want of moderation and information in the 
people ; want of abilities and rectitude in some of 
their rulers; a wide field open for the operations of 
ambitious men, raised from low degrees to high sta 
tions, and rendered giddy by elevation and the ex 
tent of their views ; laws dictated by the spirit of 
the times, not the spirit of justice and liberal policy ; 
latitude in principles, as well as commerce; fluctua 
tion in manners and public counsels; suspension ofeducation; indifference to religion and moral obliga 
tion, &c., &c., are circumstances that portend evils, 
which much prudence, vigor, and circumspection are 
necessary to prevent or control. 

To me there appears reason to expect a long 
storm, and difficult navigation. Calm repose, and the 
sweets of undisturbed retirement, appear more distant 
than a peace with Britain. It gives me pleasure, 
however, to reflect, that the period is approaching 
when we shall become citizens of a better ordered 
State ; and the spending a few troublesome years of 
our eternity in doing good to this and future generations, is not to be avoided or regretted. Things 
will come right, and these States will be great and 
flourishing. The dissolution of our Governments threw 
us into a political chaos. Time, wisdom, and perse 
verance will reduce it into form, and give it strength. 
order, and harmony. In this work you are (in the 
style of one of your professions) a master builder ; and 
God grant that you may long continue a free and 
accepted one ! 

Thus, my dear Sir, I have indulged myself in thinking loud in your hearing ; it would be an Hibernicism to say in your sight, though, in one sense, more 
true. It is more than probable that I shall frequently 
do the like. Your letter shall be my apology, and 
the pleasure resulting from converse with those weesteem, my motive. I am, dear Sir, with perfectesteem and regard, 

Your most obedient servant, 

JOHN JAY. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Philadelphia, 24 April, 1779. 

SIR, 

Your Excellency s favor of the 22d was delivered 
to me this afternoon. I am happy to find you have 
wrote so fully to Congress, upon the disagreeable con 
sequences that may follow from starving the Quarter 
master s department at this critical season. I wish it 
may have the desired effect, and rouse their atten 
tion; but I must confess I am afraid the stupor is 
so great, that nothing can alarm their fears, or pro 
mote a spirit of industry. 

I had but very little prospect, from my own appli 
cation, of obtaining the necessary supplies of cash. 
What additional influence your Excellency s letter will 
give to my reasons and representation, time only can 
manifest. 

The treasury appears to be hard pressed on every 
side ; and the demands of this time are infinitely 
greater than it is in their power to satisfy with the 
greatest exertions, upon the present plan of striking 
money. The truth of the affair is, there lias been a 
great degree of negligence and want of timely atten 
tion, to prepare seasonably for the present demands. 
When I was in town in the winter, I reported to the 
Treasury Board what I thought would be absolutely 
necessary for the Quarter-master s department to the 
2d of March; not one half of which have we been 
able to get, although every thing has been urged to 
induce them to supply our wants. 

On my arrival here, I laid your Excellency s letter 
respecting wagoners, before a Committee of Congress. 
They immediately confirmed it by a resolution, not 
withstanding they had been hammering upon the 
business for almost two months, off and on; and 
finally had put it (before the receipt of your letter) 
upon a very restrictive plan. 

The business of financing is in a poor way. There 
is no plan found, or scheme digested, for mending ourmoney. There are a thousand projects on foot; but 
none appears to be taken up on a practical footing. 

There are complaints and murmurings in Congress 
against the people of this State, and the people of 
the State complain against the proceedings of Con 
gress. It is said, days and weeks together are spent 
upon the most trifling disputes in the world; and 
those generally of a personal nature. What will be 
the issue of this policy", I know not, 

I have wrote circular letters to all the deputies in 
my department on the east side of the Susquehanna, 
to enlist as many wagoners as they possibly can by 
the middle of next month; and to have all the pub 
lic teams forwarded so as to be in camp by that 
time. I expect our wagon-horses will fall short, as 
our agents have but a scanty supply of money. 
However, I will do the best I can. 

I wish to know whether I must increase the num 
ber of pack-horses. Orders have been given for onethousand; but General Sullivan thinks near five hundred more will be wanted. It does not appear so to 
me ; but I am not a good judge of the business. 
The Board of War are out of lead ; and I fear the 
ammunition will not be ready. This is only conjec 
tural. 

I wrote your Excellency before, that the Minister 
of France sets out for camp on Tuesday next. Don 
Juan will accompany him. There is a French ship 
just arrived from the West Indies; but I cannot 
learn that she brings any thing new. 

I intended to have set out for camp to-morrow, 
but I believe I shall not be ready until Monday in 
the forenoon. I have desired Congress to give rneleave to resign, as I apprehended a loss of reputa 
tion, if I continued in the business. They are not 
disposed to grant my request at all. But unless 
they change their system, or publish their approba 
tion upon the present, I shall not remain long in the 
business. I will not sacrifice my reputation for any 
consideration whatever. I am willing to serve the 
public ; but I think I have a right to choose that 
way of performing the service which will be most 
honorable to myself. I should be willing to serve in 
the department I am in for a proper consideration, if 
I could serve without the loss of reputation; but not 
without. 

I believe it has been a received opinion, that I 
was so very fond of the emoluments of the Quarter 
master s office, that nothing but absolute necessity 
would induce me to quit it, I will not deny but 
that the profits are flattering to my fortune, but not 
less humbling to my military pride; and he who has 
entertained such sentiments is a stranger to my feelings. While I had a prospect of pleasing your Ex 
cellency, the army, and the Congress, the service 
was agreeable ; but if a combination of circumstances 
changes these prospects, nothing shall induce me to 
continue in the business, even if the profits were 
made five times as large as they are. 

There is a great difference between being raised to 
an office and descending to one ; which is my case. 
There is also a great difference between serving where 
you have a fair prospect of honor and laurels, and 
where you have no prospect of either, let you discharge your duty ever so well. Nobody ever heard 
of a Quarter-master in history, as such, or in relating 
any brilliant action. I engaged in this business as 
well out of compassion to your Excellency as from a 
regard to the public. I thought your task too great, 
to be Commander-in-chief and Quarter-master at the 
same time. Money was not my motive. For you may 
remember I offered to serve a year unconnected with 
the accounts, without any additional pay to that which 
I had as Major-General. However, this proposition 
was rejected as inadmissible. Then I told the Com 
mittee that I would serve upon the same terms that 
Mr. Cox and Mr. Pettit could be engaged upon; and 
I have nothing more now, although I have a double 
share of duty, and am held responsible for all failures. 

Before I came into the department, your Excellency 
was obliged often to stand Quarter-master. However 
capable the principal was of doing his duty, he was 
hardly ever with you. The line and the staff were 
at war with each other. The country had been plundered in a way that would now breed a kind of civil 
war between the staff and the inhabitants. The man 
ner of my engaging in this business, and your Ex 
cellency s declaration to the Committee of Congress, 
that you would stand Quarter-master no longer, are 
circumstances which I wish may not be forgotten ; as 
I may have occasion, at some future day, to appeal 
to your Excellency for my own justification. 
One thing I can say, with truth and sincerity, that 
I have conducted the business with as much pru 
dence and economy, as if my private fortune had 
been answerable for the disbursements. And I be 
lieve your Excellency will do me the justice to say, 
the department has cooperated with your measures 
as far as circumstances were to be governed by me ; 
and this you had reason to apprehend would not 
have been the case had I not taken direction of the 
business. And here, in justice to my colleagues, I 
shall mention that I think them entitled to yourExcellency s personal esteem, from the warmth of 
their wishes, and a desire to promote your ease and 
convenience. 

I am more acquainted with Mr. Petti t s mode of 
doing business than I am with Mr. Cox s ; but I 
think the public under great obligations to the for 
mer for his method and economy. I am, with the 
most perfect esteem, your Excellency s 

Most obedient, humble servant, 

NATHANAEL GREENE. 



FROM PRESIDENT REED, OF PENNSYLVANIA.* 

In Council, Philadelphia, 24 April, 1779. 

SIR, 

Your Excellency s letter of the 20th instant has 
been laid before the Board, informing us that a 
Court-Martial will be held at camp on the 1st of 
May instant, "for the trial of General Arnold on the 
first, second, third, and fifth charges exhibited against 
him by this Board." 

* General Reed had been elected President of Pennsylvania on 
the 1st of December, 1779. 



276 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON 

We apprehend there must have been some mistake 
in the mode of transmitting this business to yourExcellency, as we never exhibited any other charge 
against General Arnold to Congress, than that of appropriating the public wagons of the State to private 
uses, and that only that he might remain to answer. 
Nor do we think it by any means consistent with 
the duty we owe the State to be considered in the 
light of parties, as thereby we may establish a prin 
ciple, under which we may either submit silently to 
injuries and insults, or follow military Courts into 
any part of the country, wherever the service may 
require the army to be. 

The light in which we have ever considered ourselves, and which we would wish to be considered 
by your Excellency, is as a public body, the representatives of the freemen of Pennsylvania, expressing our opinion of General Arnold s conduct, founded 
upon facts disclosed to us, and answering to our own 
knowledge, asking nothing of Congress but that he 
should not continue to command in this State. The 
history of this country affords many instances of this 
proceeding in the cas6s of oppressive Governors, and 
it is a right which we hold independent, and unac 
countable to any other power. No one doubts the 
right of a public body to praise, and this shows very 
strongly they have a power to censure, it only operating as an opinion, unaccompanied with any punish 
ment. 

In the present instance, General Arnold refused to 
give any explanation of his conduct, though civilly 
requested, or ever offered to disprove the facts al 
leged ; of course we were obliged to exercise ourjudgments upon the evidence and proofs we had. 
At the same time we perfectly approve the trial, being of opinion, that General Arnold s conduct deserves some military reprehension; and we doubt not 
the officers of the army will impartially weigh the 
duty they owe to the country, as well as the person 
charged ; and if the facts are proved, let the palliating circumstances, if there are any, operate on the 
sentence, not on the nature of the transaction. Such 
is the dependence of the army upon the transporta 
tion of this State, and such the feelings of the people upon this sort of duty, that, should the Court 
treat it as a light and trivial matter, and found an 
opinion upon any other grounds than the innocence 
of the charge, we fear it will not be practicable to 
draw forth wagons in future, be the emergency what 
it may, and it will have very bad consequences. 

We could have wished your Excellency had appointed a later day, or we could have had earlier 
notice. Your letter is dated the 20th instant, and 
was not received till the 22d; and, considering the 
distance of some of the witnesses, we fear it will not 
be possible to give them notice, much less to procure 
their attendance, and we presume no ex paric testi 
mony ought to be received by the Court, Our view 
of the matter was, and it was so considered by the 
Joint Committees, that we should transmit the papers 
to your Excellency, and inform you of the names of 
the witnesses to prove the several points ; that then 
your Excellency, by your own authority, or that of 
Congress, would have procured the attendance of the 
witnesses. Two officers of Congress, not in any re 
spect under our control, are material witnesses, of 
which we informed Congress, requesting they might 
not proceed to Carolina till their testimony could be 
had. No notice was taken of it, and they set off 
about a week ago, and, as we have reason to think, 

VOL. ii. 24 
with a view to be absent till the trial is over. 
Colonel Fitzgerald, who is also a material witness, 
we suppose is in Virginia. 

As substantial justice, not a mere formality, is undoubtedly your Excellency s object on this occasion, 
we submit to your judgment whether a competent 
time for the attendance of those witnesses, at least, 
who are within reach, and the adjustment of some 
previous points, will not make a further delay neces 
sary. These points are, at whose expense and by 
whose procurement are the witnesses to be had ; and 
whether the service will not admit of the sitting of 
the Court at some nearer point than camp. If that 
cannot be, we must rely upon your Excellency to 
give further directions for the accommodation of the 
persons who may attend in behalf of the prosecution. 
As the idea expressed in your Excellency s letter 
does not correspond with the resolve of Congress 
transmitted to us, and differs from that entertained 
by the Joint Committee of Congress, Council, and As 
sembly, in which it was expressly declared that this 
Board was not to be considered as a party, we trust 
the proceedings in this business will conform to this 
idea ; otherwise, besides the inconvenience above men 
tioned, we shall be liable to a charge of inconsistency 
not well founded. We are, Sir, with every sentiment 
of respect and regard, 

Your most obedient, humble servants, 

JOSEPH REED. 

P. S. By the time this will reach your Excellen 
cy, there will remain but three days, so that we shall 
be glad to have as early an answer as possible ; for 
we beg leave to assure you, that no other delay is 
sought but what is necessary to proceed to business 
with effect. 
FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Philadelphia, 26 April, 1779. 

SIR, 

Your Excellency s favor of the 24th I had the 
honor of receiving last evening. I dined yesterday 
with the Minister of France, and find him still deter 
mined to set out for camp to-morrow. He sets out 
at seven in the morning, and intends lodging at 
Trenton. On Wednesday, he will be in camp, if no 
accident attends him ; but at what hour, cannot be 
ascertained, as the place he dines at is not yet determined on. I intend to wait upon him some time 
this morning, and learn more particularly his stages. 
Don Juan accompanies him. 

I thank your Excellency for your generous and 
obliging offer. Most certain, my inclination leads me 
to a resignation.* My reputation I value more than 
any advantages of gain ; and I consider it in great 
danger. I wrote your Excellency lengthy upon this 
subject yesterday, and therefore shall say but little 
upon it to-day. I intend to write to Congress to 
day, upon the subject of my apprehensions and determination ; and, if they do not give me those kinds 
of assurances, which are necessary to guard my re 
putation from malice and detraction. I shall insist 
upon leaving the business. The politics of Congress 
are really alarming, and the state of the finances 
astonishing ; where they will end, time only can unfold. 

Mr. Holker made many inquiries yesterday, respecting the temper and disposition of our army. He 
seemed desirous to know, whether peace, upon a plan 

* Resignation of the office of Quartermaster-General. 
of independence agreeable to the state of the alli 
ance, would be satisfactory ; the fishery to be con 
fined to the limits of the States. This would wellnigh ruin the Eastern States. Upon the whole, I 
think there have been some overtures made upon the 
subject of peace. It is said Russia on the part of 
England, and Spain on the part of France, are to 
stand mediators. This is merely conjectural. Mr. 
Jay says the Congress have no official propositions 
of peace ; but I believe it is beyond a doubt there 
have been debates upon the subject for several days 
past, particularly with regard to the fishery. 

I spent last evening with Governor Reed. I took 
occasion to hint that General Sullivan was to command the western expedition. lie took the alarm at 
once, and insisted he had no hopes of success, if he 
was to direct the operations. So deep are the prejudices of human nature. I had several hours con 
versation with him; and, I believe, satisfied him, as 
far as is possible, that the appointment was the re 
sult of the maturest deliberation. We were in pri 
vate. 

If I leave the Quarter-master s department, I should 
be glad of the South Carolina appointment. How 
ever, I shall wish to consult your Excellency upon 
the affair. 

We have an agreeable piece of intelligence from 
the eastward ; which is, that Colonel Campbell and 
thirty or forty officers, and six or eight sail of transports, bound to Europe, were taken lately, by a cou 
ple of our frigates, and carried into Boston. 

I had letters, last night, from South Carolina, 
which indicate a great disgust between the State 
and the Congress. They think themselves neglected. 
There is a large number of public vessels now on 
pay in the harbour, loaded with rice, which want to 
sail ; but the State is so much soured, that they will 
not grant exclusive privileges to the Continental ves 
sels from the embargo. The express is waiting ; I 
can only add, that I am, with esteem and affection, 
Your Excellency s obedient servant, 

NATHANAEL GREENE. 



FROM GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

Philadelphia, 26 April, 1779. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

You must permit me most heartily to congratulate 
you upon the very important intelligence which Monsieur Gerard will confidentially communicate to you. 
It is, and ought to be, a secret even from Congress, 
for which I need give you no reasons, as you are 
but too well acquainted with them. Measures have 
already been taken for obtaining the necessary sup 
plies, which the Minister will detail to you. These 
you will undoubtedly assist, as far as may fall within 
your line. 

When the enemy went to the Southern States, I 
considered it as a kind of madness, and I think they 
will feel the consequences ; but certainly it cannot be 
worth while to lose a moment unnecessarily in that 
quarter, for the climate will fight for us during the 
summer, and what shall remain may be completed in 
the autumn, if the other objects succeed. The first 
then should be, to bring on a considerable quantity 
of rice, which, together with flour from the Middle 
States, must be transmitted eastward, for the ulterior 
operations. To accomplish New York, perhaps the 
western detachments may be useful, as a feint; but 
24* 
will it not bo still more effectual to risk almost a re 
treat, in case of attack, by detaching to Albany, as 
if in prosecution of an expedition to Canada, calling 
upon Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey, for a 
body of militia, to answer the immediate purpose of 
protecting the country, and the remote purpose of 
more consequence ? This would probably lull the 
enemy into security, and false intelligence might be 
superadded to deceive them. In a few days the 
force, nevertheless, would be collected from Fort Ed 
ward and the Mohawk River to Albany, brought 

/ O 

down to the Highlands by water, and cooperate, &c. 
A part, with the militia of Connecticut and New York, 
might alarm the enemy at Fort Knyphausen, and 
make the necessary preparations to throw a bridge 
over the river at Haerlem. The main body, by possessing themselves of the landing opposite to Greenwich, 
might, at a proper opportunity, be thrown across. 
The Jersey militia would keep Staten Island in alarm, 
and secure the posts in the rear. The other troops 
might be landed to attack, as the enemy lauded to 
attack you. This, with a fire upon the town, would, 
in all human probability, effect the purpose. 

That point gained, Hhode Island w r ould be an easy 
acquisition, as the whole force might then be turned 
to that object, and then the great end would follow 
in its course. The magnitude and importance of 
things like these speak for themselves. The practi 
cability will, I think, be made evident, when the 
means are considered. You will see the necessity of 
opening yourself fully to M. Gerard upon your designs, and taking, with him, all proper measures. Catr 
tie, carriages for heavy artillery, and the like, should 
be assembled at Portsmouth, or some such convenient 
place. You will have the advantage, on this occasion 
at least, to be sure of your secrets ; and, indeed, such 
steps may be taken, that, in the ignorance of the 
enemy as to the state and probable state of things 
in the West Indies, it will be impossible for them to 
develop the combination of incidents, so distinct as 
those which may be necessary at once to fulfil the 
objects in view, and blind them. 

Excuse the length and tediousness of this letter, 
and believe me, with all the sincerity of private friend 
ship, superadded to public esteem, affectionately, 
Your friend and humble servant, 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia. 26 April, 1779. 

DEAR SIR, 

The questions contained in your favor of the 23d 
instant, are as important as the manner of introducing them is delicate. While the maritime affairs of 
the Continent continue under the direction of a Com 
mittee, they will be exposed to all the consequences 
of want of system, attention, and knowledge. The 
Marine Committee consists of a Delegate from each 
State. It fluctuates, new members constantly coming 
in, and old ones going out. Three or four, indeed, 
have remained in it from the beginning, and have a 
proportionate influence, or, more properly, interest in 
it. Very few of the members understand even the 
state of our naval affairs, or have time or inclination 
to attend to them. But why is not this system 
changed? It is, in iny opinion, convenient to the fa 
mily compact. The Commercial Committee are equally 
useless. A proposition was made to appoint a Commercial Agent for the States, under certain regula 
tions. Opposition was made ; the ostensible reasons 
were various ; the true reason was, its interference 
with a certain commercial agent in Europe, and his 
connections. 

You will, if I mistake not^ find M. Gerard disposed 
to be open and communicative. He has acquired an 
extensive knowledge of our affairs. I have no reason 
to believe he will use it to our prejudice. There is 
as much intrigue in this State House as in the Vati 
can, but as little secrecy as in a boarding-school. It 
mortifies me, on this occasion, to reflect, that the rules 
of Congress on the subject of secrecy, which are fartoo general, and, perhaps for that reason, more fre 
quently violated, restrain me from saying twenty 
things to you, which have ceased to be private. 

The state of our currency is really serious. Where, 
or by what means, the progress of its depreciation 
will be prevented, is uncertain. The subject is deli 
cate, but the conduct of some men really indicates at 
least great indifference about it. It will not be many 
days before measures^ having a great though not 
immediate influence on this subject, will be either 
adopted or rejected. I shall then have an opportu 
nity of being more particular. I am, very dear Sir. 
with perfect esteem and regard, 

Your most obedient servant, 

JOHN JAY. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL MCJNTOSH. 

Ccimp [Pittsburg], 27 April, 1779. 

SIR, 
In obedience to your Excellency s desire, I am to 
inform you of the situation of the several posts west 
of the mountains, and will add the reasons for esta 
blishing them, which may enable you to judge the 
better of their propriety. 

When I went there first, I found Fort Pitt, in the 
fork of Ohio, Fort Randolph, at the point or mouth 
of Great KenhaAva, three hundred miles down the 
river Ohio, and Fort Hand on Kiskiminitas. fixed 
stations, and garrisoned by Continental troops; and 
they are still kept up, as there is an independent 
company, raised upon the application of Colonel G. 
Morgan, for the sole purpose of maintaining each, 
and would not weaken the force I had to carry on 
the expedition. Besides these, there were thirty or 
forty other little stations, or forts, at different times 
garrisoned by militia, between Wheeling and Pittsburg, upon the waters of the Monongahela, the Kiskiminitas, and in the interior parts of the settlements, 
which were frequently altered, kept, or evacuated, 
according to the humors, fears, or interest of the 
people of most influence, which General Hand was 
obliged to comply with, as his chief dependence was 
upon militia. Those I endeavoured to break up, as 
soon as I could, without giving too much offence to 
people whose assistance I so much required, as they 
were very expensive, and of little service ; and, for 
that end, authorized the Lieutenants of Monongahela 
and Ohio county, to raise a ranging company, jointly, 
of one Captain, one Lieutenant, one Ensign, threeSergeants, three Corporals, and fifty-four privates, to 
scout continually along the River Ohio, from Beaver 
Creek downwards, where the Indians usually cross to 
annoy these two counties, and would secure them 
equally alike ; and the Lieutenant of Westmoreland 
county to raise two such companies to scour their 
frontiers, and protect them from scalping parties of 
the Mingoes or Northern Indians, which would ren 
der their little forts useless, and keep our regulars 
entire for other occasions. 

I found also, upon inquiry, a number of stores, or 
magazines of provisions, built at public expense by 
our Purchasing Commissary, at great distances, difficult 
of access, and scattered throughout all the counties, 
which required a number of men at each, for commissaries, coopers, packers, guards, &c. These I also discharged gave the stores up ; as, by the report of a 
Court of Inquiry, all the provision in them, which 
was intended for our expedition, proved to be spoiled, 
and altogether useless, through neglect; and, in place 
of them, I had one general storehouse built, by a fa 
tigue party, in the fork of the Monongahela Iliver, 
where all loads from over the mountains are now discharged, without crossing any considerable branch of 
any river, and can be carried from thence, at any 
season, either by land or water, to Big Beaver Creek; 
to which place I opened a road, and built a strong 
post, with barracks and stores, by fatigue of the 
whole line, upon the Indian shore of the Ohio Iliver, 
for the reception of all our stores, clear of all ferries 
and incumbrances, while our troops and supplies were 
coming up ; and, in case I was disappointed in both, 
as I had many reasons to apprehend, it would secure 
a footing so far advanced into the enemy s country, 
be better prepared for another attempt, and show 
them we were in earnest. 

So late as the 3d of November, Mr. Lockhart appeared at Beaver, with the cattle, extremely poor 
after driving them four or five hundred miles, and 
meeting with many obstacles, and could not slaughter 
them for want of salt. The same day I received a 



THE AMERICAN EEVOLUTION. 287 

message from the savages, reproaching our tardiness, 
and threatening all their nations would join to op 
pose my progress to Detroit, at Sugar Creek, a few 
miles below Tuscarawas, where they intend giving 
me battle. Immediately upon this intelligence, I or 
dered twelve hundred men to be ready to march, 
though we had only four weeks flour, which Mr. 
Lockhart fortunately brought with him, and left Lieu 
tenant-Colonel Campbell, with the rest of the troops, 
at Beaver, to escort and send after me the longlooked for supplies, so often and repeatedly promised 
by our Deputy Quartermaster-General, Mr. Steel, when 
they arrived, and, in the mean time, to finish the 
fort and stores. 

We were fourteen days upon our march, about 
seventy miles, to Tuscarawas, as our horses and cattle 
tired every four or five miles from our first setting 
out, and were met there only by some Cochocking 
Delawares and Moravians, who informed me the Chippewas and Ottowas refused to join the other Indians, 
upon which their hearts failed them, and none came 
to oppose our march. But, unfortunately, a letter, by 
express, from Lieutenant-Colonel Campbell, a little 
afterwards, informed me that no supplies came yet, 
and we had very little to expect during the winter, 
nor could he get the staff to account, or give any 
reasons for their neglect and deficiencies, which disappointed all my flattering prospects and schemes, 
and left me no other alternative than either to march 
back as I came, without effecting any valuable purpose, which the world would justly reflect upon me 
for, after so much expense, confirm the savages in 
the opinion the enemy inculcates of our weakness, 
and unite all of them, to a man, against us ; or, to 
build a strong stockade fort upon the Muskingum, 
and leave as many men as our provision would allow, 
to secure it until the next season, and to serve as a 
bridle upon the savages in the heart of their own 
country ; which last I chose, with the unanimous approbation of my principal officers, and we were em 
ployed upon it while our provision lasted ; and, in the 
mean time, thought it necessary to make some propo 
sals to all the Indians, if they came in a certain fixed 
time, to offer terms, and prevent our being molested. 
I am the more particular in giving my reasons for 
building Fort Laurens, as Morgan. Steel, and their 

O 7 O ^ J 

dependents, for want of other matter, have cried it 
down, as a designed slaughtering-pen, impossible to 
maintain ; and endeavoured to prejudice the whole 
country against it, although the former laid the plan, 
that was afterwards adopted, for taking and keeping 
Detroit. 

I always was, and still am, firmly of the opinion, 
that the only way to subdue Indians effectually, is, 
to carry a chain of forts directly into their country, 
so near as to support each other, the last always 
having the most force, and keep possession as we go; 
and to make excursions at pleasure into their towns, 
when in force, and opportunity offers, or retreat to 
them when weak, ill-supplied, or in other cases of 
necessity, which will often happen in Indian wars, 
and they know well how to take advantage of. 

By the best information I can get, there is no na 
vigation above the Wabash (which is eight or ninehundred miles below Pittsburg) to Lake Erie, equal 
to Muskingum, the way of Cuyahoga, or, the Alleghany, the way of Presrjue Isle ; and both of these 
are very uncertain, to go up against the stream, as 
the waters are often too high and rapid, and oftcner 
too low. Yet they may be serviceable at times. The 
Scioto and Hockhocking are mere rapid creeks, of no 
account, and are not much better than Beaver, al 
though traders have frequently brought their loaded 
canoes down each, in time of high freshets. 

For any further particulars, respecting the western 
department, I will attend in person, and beg leave to 
refer you to my general orders, and private instruc 
tions and letters. I have the honor to be, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

LACHLAN MC!NTOSH. 

P. S. If your Excellency is already determined 
to attack the Seneca nation from the westward as 
well as from the Susquehanna, at the same time, I 
would give it as my humble opinion, that the two 
garrisons on the Indian side of the Ohio should be 
maintained, and go no farther that way at present ; 
and to erect posts, at proper distances, up along the 
River Alleghaiiy, as far as, or farther than Kushkushing, which may be done by fatigue, when the 
party is going up, if the river is then too low, or, 
if it is in good order for the boats, after they strike 
the blow intended, in concert with the other army. 
And I should apprehend the same would be neces 
sary up the Susquehanna, as far as Tioga, which, I 
think, must undoubtedly remove the northern as well 
as the western tribes over the great Lakes, or bring 
them to terms, as they cannot otherwise think of 
planting so near our garrisons ; and show them w r e 
mean to retaliate their injuries by keeping possession 
of their country. 



VOL. ii. 25 
FROM MAJOR-GENERAL ARNOLD. 

Philadelphia, 5 May, 1779. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I have been honored with your Excellency s two 
letters of the 26th and 28th April, and am extreme 
ly sorry to find it should be thought there was a 
necessity of postponing my trial to so late a period 
as June or July, from no other reason than the Pre 
sident and Council of this State representing that 
the period appointed for the purpose, and the previous notice given, w r ere too short to admit of the 
necessary evidence being produced in time. 

Their pretence of the witnesses being in Virginia 
and Carolina, and the time being too short to pro 
duce them, I can view in no other light than a base, 
pitiful evasion; evidently calculated to put off the 
trial, that my character, unjustly aspersed, may still 
suffer, while the villains who have injured me cow 
ardly cloak themselves under office. They have had 
three months to look for evidence, and cannot pro 
duce one against me v I suppose the gentlemen they 
mention being in Carolina are my two Aids, gonethere, as volunteers, to spend the summer. They left 
this city long since the Court-Martial was ordered, 
and might easily have been detained, had the Council thought proper to do it. 

Believe me, my dear General, the w : hole is nothing 
more than pretence and artifice to delay the matter, 
the final determination of which must make the Pre 
sident and Council appear to the world in their true 
colors, as a set of unprincipled, malicious scoundrels; 
who have prostituted their honor and truth, for the 
purpose of gratifying their private resentment against 
an innocent person. 
From a candid view of the charges and whole pro 
ceedings against me, contained in the papers transmitted to your Excellency, you must be fully per 
suaded I have been unjustly accused, and that I have 
been refused justice from Congress on the report of 
their Committee. 

From a knowledge of my public conduct, since I 
have been in the army, no man is a better judge if 
I have merited the treatment I have received. If 
your Excellency thinks me criminal, for Heaven s sake 
let me be immediately tried, and, if found guilty, 
executed. I want no favor ; I ask only for justice. 
If it is denied me from your Excellency, I have 
nowhere to seek it but of the candid public, before 
whom I shall be under the necessity of laying the 
whole matter. Let me beg of you, Sir, to consider 
that a set of artful, unprincipled men, in office, may 
misinterpret the most innocent actions; and, by raising the public clamor against your Excellency, place 
you in the same disagreeable situation I am in. 

Having made every sacrifice of fortune and blood, 
and become a cripple in the service of my country, 
I little expected to meet the ungrateful returns I 
have received of my countrymen; but, as Congress 
have stamped ingratitude as a current coin, I must 
take it. I wish your Excellency, for your long and 
eminent services, may not be paid in the same coin. 

I have nothing left but the little reputation I have 
gained in the army. Delay, in the present case, is 
worse than death ; and, when it is considered that 
the President and Council have had three months to 
produce" their evidence, I cannot suppose the ordering 
a Court-Martial to determine the matter immediately, 
in the least precipitating the matter, which, in justice, 
ought to have been determined long since, and Avhich 



292 LETTEKS TO WASHINGTON. 

the President and Council wish to put off until the 
campaign opens \ concluding, undoubtedly, that the 
service will then prevent the Court from sitting, the 
trial postponed until the end of the campaign, and 
their cruel and villanous purposes answered. I must, 
therefore, entreat your Excellency that a Court-Martial 
may be ordered to sit as soon as possible ; and, if 
the Court find sufficient reasons, they will of course 
adjourn to a longer time. Not doubting my request 
will be granted, I have the honor to be, with the 
highest respect and esteem, your Excellency s 
Most obedient, humble servant, 

BENEDICT ARNOLD.* 

* Many other particulars respecting Arnold s trial by a Court-Martial, the charges brought against him, and a correspondence between 
General Washington and the Council of Pennsylvania on the subject, 
may be seen in Washington s Writings, Vol. VI., APPENDIX, pp. 514-530. 

Some time before the date of this letter, General Arnold seems to 
have entertained the project of forming a settlement in the western 
parts of the State of New York. On the 3d of February, 1779, Mr. 
Jay, and the other Delegates in Congress from that State, wrote as 
follows to Governor Clinton. 

" Major-General Arnold has in contemplation to establish a settle 
ment of officers and soldiers who have served with him in the present war, and to lay the necessary foundation without loss of time. 
From a desire to become a citizen of New York, he gives our State 
the preference, and now visits your Excellency to make the neces 
sary inquiries, it being out of our power to give him any information. 
The necessity of strengthening our frontiers is as obvious as the po 
licy of drawing the attention of the people to that quarter in season. 
Virginia, we learn, has taken the lead, and already passed laws for 
laying out a district of country for settlement, and assigning farms 
for their own soldiers, as well as those of Maryland, Delaware, and 
New Jersey. A strong predilection, however, prevails in favor of ourState, on account of its situation for trade, the acknowledged excel 
lency of its Constitution, and the steady and vigorous exertions of 
its Government. Nothing, we are persuaded, will be wanting for 
its rapid settlement and cultivation, but a w r ise and liberal system for 
the distribution of the public lands. 

" To you, Sir, or to our State, General Arnold can require no re 
commendation. A series of distinguished services entitle him to respect 
and favor." 
FROM MAJOR-GENERAL PUTNAM. 

Camp, Reading, 7 May, 1779. 

DEAR SIB, 

I am now taking the earliest opportunity to ac 
quaint your Excellency with my arrival in camp, to 
resume the command of my division. 

In the course of my tour to the eastward, I was 
at Hartford, during the sitting of the Assembly, who 
supposed, from a resolution of Congress which then 
lay before them, that all the men raised for the pub 
lic service in this State, under whatever description, 
whether artillery, dragoons, or artificers, were to be 
considered and credited as part of the eight batta 
lions of infantry, which were assigned as a quota to 
this State for the year 1779. 

This sentiment I opposed, at the time that the re 
turn of the number wanting to complete the eight 
battalions to the present establishment was laid be 
fore them. However, instead of raising fourteen hundred men, the deficiency of the two brigades under 
my command, they have made such deductions as 
leave, by their calculation, but six hundred men to 
be raised, and these are to be procured by voluntary 
enlistment. In consequence of this resolution, very 
few recruits, I fear, will be brought into the field, 
unless your Excellency should think proper to make 
some representations upon the subject to the Assem 
bly, who will sit the next week at Hartford ; and this, 
I presume, will be of more efficacy than any other 
means whatever. 

From the letters which passed in my absence, and 
which I have seen since my return, I find there was 
reason to apprehend the enemy would have been in 
25* 
motion before this time, and that, upon these appearances, it was judged necessary for all the troops 
which were under my command to march for the defence of the posts on the North River, except the 
first Connecticut brigade, which is now held in readi 
ness for that purpose. 

Although I do not in the least doubt the necessity 
and propriety of these measures, or w r ish to be in 
formed of the secrets of the ensuing campaign, yet 
it is exceedingly natural for me to have some little 
curiosity about my future destination ; whether I am 
to command those troops which have been with me 
the winter past, or in some new department, or whe 
ther I am to remain to guard the huts at this place. 
For after General McDougall is reenforced with the 
whole of my division (which will augment his to a 
very respectable command), nothing is said concerning the part which I am to act. However disagreea 
ble the situation may be, I know there is a delicacy 
in thinking and treating on a subject, where one s 
self is so intimately concerned, beyond the limits of 
which, I hope I shall not be accused of passing. 

I am unhappy to inform your Excellency that, 
upon the removal of our detachments from the seacoast, the enemy have exhibited some specimens of 
enterprise, so little usual for them. A few nights 
since, a small party from a whaleboat landed at 
Fairfield, surprised and carried off Brigadier-General 
Silliman, of the militia, and his son Major Silliman. 
Last night, another party landed at Middlesex, nearNorwalk, in quest of one Captain Selleck, who happened to be absent; but a Mr. Webb, late a Lieu 
tenant in the train, two of the inhabitants, and theingenious Dr. Bushnell, fell into their hands. As the 
last-mentioned gentleman, who was there in the 
prosecution of his unrernitted endeavours to destroy 
the enemy s shipping, is personally known to very few 
people, it is possible he may not be discovered by 
his real name or character, and may be considered 
of less consequence than he actually is. 

I am this instant informed, that about fifty of the 
enemy s plunderers landed at Telleck s Farms this 
morning, and carried off every man his sheep, that is 
to say, fifty, before the militia could be collected to 
oppose them. These incursions I expect will be fre 
quent and troublesome, but I hope not decisive, or 
very important. I am your Excellency s 

Most obedient and very humble servant, 

ISRAEL PUTNAM. 

P. S. I designed to have suggested to your Ex 
cellency the difficulties I am apprehensive will arise 
in procuring forage for the baggage-horses and teams. 
The grass is by no means sufficient to support them; 
and dry forage will be furnished with great difficulty, and I fear in very small quantities. 



FROM GOVERNOR LIVINGSTON. 

Trenton, 8 May, 1779. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have received the honor of your Excellency s fa 
vor of the 4th instant, and am very far from differing with you in sentiment, that the militia of the 
country should be drawn out by the authority of the 
Government, rather than by the pecuniary reward at 
tached to their service. This has always been my 
opinion ; and I have used my utmost exertions to get 
our militia upon that footing ; but it is a thing rather 
to be wished than expected, as our Legislature have 
uniformly manifested a disinclination to use compul 
sion. And when it is considered that the five shil 
lings per day which they have added to the pay of 
the militia, is not equal to what they have lately donefor the standing troops, I flatter myself that it will not 
be attended with the disagreeable consequences which 
your Excellency apprehends. The truth is, the mili 
tia have, of late, been so extremely backward to come 
out in the monthly service, that, without some addition to their past allowance, it was universally apprehended that our frontiers would be entirely left to 
the mercy of the enemy. But, for the reason yourExcellency assigns, I wish it had been by way of 
bounty, instead of augmentation of wages. 

The confidence your Excellency is pleased to place 
in my friendship affects me with inexpressible plea 
sure. I hope, Sir, you will never have reason to 
think it misplaced ; and your friendship, in return 
(which, indeed, so bought, is too cheap a purchase), I 
shall always consider is the greatest felicity of my 
life. The communication of your sentiments, in the 
freest manner, upon my public measures, I shall not 
only esteem an honor done me, as a convincing mark 
of your confidence, but shall ever endeavour to improve to the public emolument, which I am sure 
will be the only motive that suggests them. 

Please to accept of my acknowledgments for yourpromise of continuing the troops, or the principal 
part of them, at their present stations, a few days 
beyond the period limited in your former letter. 

Our political stupor and security, owing to our last 
year s successful campaign, and a thirst for the mam 
mon of unrighteousness, is truly lamentable ; and I 
am entirely of your Excellency s opinion, that there 
is the greatest reason to believe, that a vigorous 
prosecution of the war is determined on the part of 
the enemy. The slowness of our progress towards 
completing our quota of your reenforceinents, affects 
me with unspeakable chagrin. And I can assure 
your Excellency, that I do not lose a day, without 
exerting myself to accelerate the motions of some 
gentlemen, who ought not to wait a prompter to 
that indispensable measure. With every sentiment 
of esteem, I have the honor to be, dear Sir, 

Your Excellency s most humble servant, 

WILLIAM LIVINGSTON. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LORD STIRLING. 

Valley of Lebanon, 10 May, 1779. 

DEAR SIR, 

As my business with the Legislature of New Jersey will require my being at Trenton on Wednesday 
next, a visit to camp this week, which I intended, 
would be inconvenient, as it would keep me con 
stantly on the roads, with horses not in the best 
order. My being at Trenton last week, I believe, 
was favorable to the affairs of the Jersey brigade. 
The officers, under orders of march, sent up a very 
spirited memorial to the Legislature, and strongly 
pointed out the mischiefs which would immediately 
follow, if an equitable provision was not instantly 
made for the officers and men of the brigade. How 
ever true and just, the legislature could not brook 
the thought of being frightened into the measure ; 
and some of the obstinate members talked of rather 
seeing the brigade disbanded, than submit to the 
appearance of being bullied. As I saw that the appearance was now the chief obstacle in the way, I 
proposed to some of the leading members the expe 
dient of withdrawing the memorial, and the Legislature taking the matter up (to all appearance) of their 
own mere motion. This was instantly agreed to on 
all sides, and in a few hours pretty ample resolves 
were made by both Houses. Among the rest it was 
ordered that two hundred pounds be paid to each 
commissioned officer, and forty dollars to each soldier, 
to enable them to pay their debts, and to fit them 
for the campaign. The money for this purpose is 
already gone to Elizabethtown. 

I am sorry to find that the Legislature is slow 
in all business, particularly in determining on the 
means of recruiting their brigades, in which, as yet, 
they have made but little progress ; but they pro 
mise to give it their serious attention this week. 
My business seems to have a favorable reception 
among them; but it must be followed up closely, or 
it may halt by the way. 

Lady Stirling, and, all the gentlemen and ladies of 
these two families, join in their most respectful compli 
ments to your Excellency and Mrs. Washington, with 
Your Excellency s affectionate, humble servant, 

STIRLING. 



FROM GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Poughkcepsic, 18 May, 1779. 



DEAR SIR, 

I was honored with your Excellency s confidential 
letter of the 3d instant on the 12th, at Kingston, 
whither I was called by an alarm on the frontiers 
of Ulster county, occasioned by the appearance of 
about one hundred Indians and Tories, at Shendeacon, 
a small settlement in the gorge of the mountains, 
about twenty miles west of Kingston, and twelve 
from Marbletown. They were joined at this place by 
twenty-seven Tories from the east of Hudson s River. 
mostly Hessian deserters from the Convention troops. 
The sudden assembling of the militia deterred them 
from penetrating farther into the country, and prevented them from doing any material injury. 

It is needless to remark to your Excellency, that 
the execution of military business by militia officers 
is (from the want of activity and knowledge) seldom 
attended with the necessary despatch. Add to this, 
the raising of the levies for the defence of the fron 
tiers, and for filling up the Continental battalions, 
has been unavoidably much interrupted and retarded, 
in the frontier regiments, by almost continual alarms, 
since the departure of Colonel Cortlandt s regiment 
from the former station. I have, therefore, found it 
necessary to order the levies in this county to ren 
dezvous on the western frontiers of Ulster and Orange 
counties, to serve as a cover to the settlements, and 
to afford the militia leisure to make their drafts. The 
officer who commands them has orders, the moment 
this is accomplished, to forward such part of them as 
are to be annexed to the Continental battalions, with 
such additional number as can be spared, consistent 
with the security of the frontier settlements in that 
quarter, to Albany, by detachments, without the least 
delay. From the best information I have been able 
to obtain, there is a collection of Indians (consisting 
of those who are called Esopus Indians and other 
stragglers) and Tories, at Shohawken and Kollitye, 
on the Delaware, at one of which places it is said 
they have erected a block-house, or some other small 
works of defence. Our accounts were, that they con 
sisted of upwards of one hundred, and we have the 
best evidence of their having been lately joined by 
a very considerable additional number of Tories and 
deserters. It is this banditti, that have committed 
the most of the mischiefs which have been done in 
the counties of Ulster and Orange, and have occasioned all the late distressing alarms. They are supplied 
with provisions from the different settlements on the 
Delaware by the disaffected inhabitants who live on 
the frontiers. They are perfectly acquainted with the 
back country, and, I am apprehensive, will be very 
troublesome, by rendering the supplies to our western 
army precarious, and by keeping the back settlements 
in perpetual apprehensions of danger. 

The amazing tract of uninhabited and mountainous 
country, which lies between the intended route of 
our army and the western settlements, will afford 
them a secure asylum, as long as they can procure 
provisions. I would therefore submit to your Excel 
lency the propriety of marching a body of men into 
these parts, sufficiently large to scour that country, 
and rout the enemy there, and destroy the settle 
ments which feed and harbour them. As these set 
tlements are scattered and remote from each other, 
and as the enemy may be succoured from the con 
tiguous Indian settlements on the Suscjuehanna, not 
less than five hundred men will be competent to 
perform this business effectually. If the measure is 
approved by your Excellency, I will most readily 
furnish that number from the militia for this short 
service, and undertake to conduct the business my 
self. Nothing will be wanted, but the means of 
transporting about ten days or two weeks provision, 
and some other little matters from the Quarter-mas 
ter s department, which cannot be obtained otherwise, 
and which, I presume, may be spared from thence, 
without inconveniency, for so short a period. The 
horses wanted may either be impressed in the country by the Quarter-master, or, if purchased, returned 
before the campaign is fairly opened on the sea-coast. 
I am the more desirous of having this business 
accomplished, as it will relieve the inhabitants of the 
frontier settlements from any farther apprehensions of 
danger, and induce many, who have already abandoned 
their farms, to return to them, and also enable us to 
spare a greater proportion of the levies, raised for 
the defence of the frontiers, who are now stationed 
at the different passes, where they at best afford but 
a very partial security, for active service. It may 
be thought most advisable to delay the matter until 
the army, intended for the western service, begin to 
move ; in which case this may serve as a favorable 
diversion. The intermediate time may be only suffi 
cient to get out the men and make the necessary 
preparations. I have the honor to be, with the most 
perfect respect and esteem, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

GEORGE CLINTON. 



FROM GOVERNOR TRUMBULL. 

Hartford, 29 May, 1779. 

SIR, 

I suppose your Excellency is not wholly unac 
quainted with the character of Mr. David Bushnell, 
the bearer. He has had a liberal education, and discovers a genius capable of great improvement, in ma
VOL. ii. 26 
thematical ; philosophic, and mechanical literature. His 
inventions for annoying the enemy s shipping are new 
and ingenious, and, I trust, founded on such principles 
as would insure success. The vigilance practised in 
guarding the shipping has, I suppose, been the only 
means of preventing such execution as would have 
been attended with very alarming and beneficial con 
sequences. He has, with persevering and indefati 
gable industry, pursued the object with very little 
prospect of any other reward than that of serving 
his country. 

Misfortune and accident have prevented the execu 
tion of this design ; but there is reason to believe 
the explosion of one of his machines, taken on board 
one of the enemy s ships some time since, has greatly 
alarmed their marine, and made them very cautious 
in their approaches to any of the neighbouring shores. 

It is a pity that so promising a genius should 
not be encouraged. I understand an establishment of 
miners and sappers is forming under, your Excellen 
cy s direction, and would therefore take the liberty 
to propose to your Excellency, whether a person of 
his particular genius might not be very useful in 
that department. 

If you should not have filled, and cannot probably 
fill, the offices with gentlemen of greater merit and 
genius, permit me to recommend Mr. Bushnell to the 
office of Captain in that service, which, from his abili 
ties, genius, and integrity, I should judge him capa 
ble to execute with honor and advantage. The Council 
of this State, now convened, join with me in this re 
commendation. I am, with very high respect andesteem, your Excellency s 

Most obedient and very humble servant, 

JONATHAN TRUMBULL. 
FROM MAJOR-GENERAL ST. CLAIR. 

Pompton, 7 o clock A. M., 3 June, 1779. 

SIR, 

Colonel Burr arrived here about three o clock, from 
General McDougall, and brings intelligence of the surrender of the Fort upon Verplank s Point, yesterday, 
about eleven o clock, by capitulation. The garrison 
are prisoners of war, and the officers have liberty to 
wear their side-arms. 

I have no letter from General McDougall; but he 
is clearly of opinion the enemy mean to attack the 
posts (at least Fort Arnold, the carrying of which 
would open to them the navigation of the river) 
in the Highlands. Colonel Burr informs me, that, 
by landing near where Fort Montgomery stood, and 
marching to the Forest of Dean, they would fall into 
a clove, which runs entirely round that ridge on 
which the forts are situated, and through which a 
road might be made almost as fast as an army could 
march. By this clove General McDougall thinks the 
forts will be invested. Betwixt this clove and Smith s 
is a chain of hideous mountains, but through them 
are, no doubt, many passes, with which they may 
be made acquainted by the inhabitants whom they 
have debauched, and would thereby be able to give 
much annoyance to any convoys that might pass by 
Smith s, supposing it necessary to make use of that 
road. 

It seems to be General McDougall s wish that I 
should move to New Windsor, and he thinks that the 
occupying Butter Hill might prevent the attack upon 
Fort Arnold from the upper side. At the same time 
the state of the provision is very alarming. Not 
much above three weeks in the respective forts, and 
the militia called in; and their principal dependence 
for further supplies is upon their being transported 
across the country, from Sussex or Delaware. 

I think I could easily reach New Windsor, or at 
least be so far advanced, through the clove, as to be 
out of all clanger of being intercepted. But it is necessary first to have intelligence from the river, lest 
the parts of your army on this side of it should be 
too much separated, and exposed to be beaten by 
piecemeal. This I will endeavour to procure, and act 
according to circumstances, of which I will take care 
to give your Excellency notice. Notwithstanding the 
general opinion, that the forts are the enemy s object, 
Colonel Burr mentions circumstances that leave it 
still doubtful. Their troops are landed at various 
places on the east side of the river, and at Ilaverstraw on the west; and, after the surrender of the 
fort, their largest armed vessel, supposed to be of 
eighteen guns, and a galley, which had passed be 
fore, were seen towing down again. 

As the passage through the clove is somewhat dan 
gerous for single persons, I shall send two horsemen 
back with Colonel Burr, and shall, through him, communicate to General McDougall verbally. It may, 
perhaps, be necessary to form a march through the 
clove, in which case, I shall leave my baggage at this 
place, to be forwarded afterwards, as your Excellency 
may think proper. 

Our provision wagons will not be able to supply 
us, when at a greater distance, four only being al 
lowed to each brigade, and three of these broke down 
upon the road. I am, Sir, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

ARTHUR ST. CLAIR. 


FROM MAJOR-GENERAL MCDOUGALL. 

Budd s, in the Highlands, opposite to 

West Point, 4 June, 1779. 
SlR ; 

The enemy having, as I have informed your Ex 
cellency, landed at Teller s Point, on the olst ultimo, 
the troops under my command took a position in the 
Highlands, with their van at the Village. The prin 
cipal stores being removed from thence, and the enemy having my flanks open on the North River, on 
which he could move undiscovered at night, I judged 
it expedient to retire to this place, to keep open my 
communication with West Point, as well as to secure 
the pass in my rear to Fishkill. General Parsons 
joined me the 2cl instant. I have now here the threeContinental "brigades, and a good body of militia. 

The State has made a very great exertion to 
remove the stores and collect provision. We have 
double the quantity of provision secured which you 
mentioned necessary in your letter of the 2d, for a 
certain purpose. Yesterday I informed you of the 
enemy s advancing near the Continental Village. He 
retired in the afternoon toward Peekskill. His con 
duct is exceedingly inexplicable ; and it is extremely 
difficult to determine what is his object. He has now 
been seven days on the river, and has not made the 
despatch which he might, toward West Point, if that 
is his object. One thing, however, is very clear, that 
he can pillage the country, by drawing our attention 
to the fort, without any risk, and can always em 
bark. Perhaps these movements may be designed to 
divert us from our western expeditions. 

General Patterson not having returned from fur26* 
lough ; I appointed General Parsons to command at 
West Point, as he is well acquainted with the post. 

Yesterday Lieutenant-Colonel Sherman, with threecompanies of light infantry, marched downwards to 
reconnoitre, and skirmish with the enemy. He pro 
ceeded to Fort Independence, at the mouth of Peekskill Creek, but saw nothing of the enemy, although 
his small parties went near Peekskill ; only heard the 
noise of cattle, driving towards King s Ferry. This 
morning he discovered all their shipping (except two 
galleys) in Peekskill Bay, standing downward, and a 
few boats off Fort Independence. 

Sir Henry Clinton commanded in person the body 
which I told you were advancing yesterday. He was 
exceedingly cautious in his advance, and very particu 
lar in his inquiries. He asked where I was; whether 
I had destroyed the bridge* over Peekskill Creek; 
what force I had; whether the militia were alarmed; 
the situation of the country toward Fishkill, if strong; 
whether there was a great body of men at West 
Point ; and whether your Excellency s army was in 
motion this w T ay. 

Colonel Burr, whom I sent to General St. Glair, 
returned this morning. The General told him he 
would be at New Windsor this night. Provisions 
were sent from Newburg to Chester for his troops, 
which has removed the difficulty he apprehended. 

By comparing these accounts, it appears the enemy 
has given over his design against West Point. Fort 
de Lafayette, on Verplank s Point, surrendered the 
1st instant. The inclosed is a copy of a letter of 
Captain Armstrong, who commanded it ; and the 
terms of capitulation. 



* This bridge was carried away by a freshet. 
It is now past two o clock, P. M., and I nave no 
account of the enemy s moving up. I have the ho 
nor to be, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

ALEXANDER McDouGALL. 



FROM COLONEL WILLIAM MALCOM. 

On the road leading from Fort Montgomery 
towards the Furnace, 11 o clock, A. M., 5 June, 1779. 

SIR, 

I have this moment seen Captain Christie, who has 
communicated his business, and I am thereby induced 
to send a gentleman, Captain Hughes, a volunteer, on 
to your Excellency w r ith information. The enemy s 
fleet, consisting of about seventy sail, many of them 
very small, are at King s Ferry; a body of their 
troops are on the east side of the river, extending 
from the ferry upwards ; a very few on Stony Point ; 
but the greatest part of their army are on board. 
They have one hundred and fifty flat-bottomed boats 
with them, which are in Peekskill Cove. 

It is true that they have penetrated as far as the 
Village, and have burnt a few huts, &c. ; but have 
got no stores at all, nor have we sustained any loss, 
but the block-house at the ferry, with eighty men, 
&c., of which, in my opinion, nothing else could be 
expected. 

I command the militia of this State, on the west 
side of the river, and am posted on the cross-road, 
leading from Fort Montgomery (seven miles ad 
vanced from the garrison) to the Furnace, with parties advanced on the passes from Haverstraw, and 
scouts as far as that place. 
Your Excellency may be assured that every thing 
in my power shall be done for the defence of the 
garrison. If a few companies of light infantry could 
be sent me, it would be useful ; if so, they must turn 
off near Junes s, in the clove. 

If your Excellency should want any further intel 
ligence, I shall be happy to furnish it, and render 
every service in my power. General McDougall, 
with Huntington s and Parsons s brigades, is ninemiles below Fishkill ; Nixon s, opposite the fort. 
The Governor is in the field, with the militia on 
the east side of the river, also with General Mc 
Dougall. General Parsons took command of Fort 
Clinton, on the 3d instant, in the evening. The 
garrison consists of Learned s, Patterson s, and the 
Carolina brigade, about seventeen hundred strong ; 
the militia with me, as yet, about six hundred. 

If the fort is invested, it will fall. I am clearthat the enemy must be opposed in the passes and 
in the woods. I therefore have posted myself here ; 
but without more light troops, not a great deal can 
be expected. 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

WILLIAM MALCOM. 

P. S. I am now of opinion that the enemy will 
give up their design against the fort. A few days 
ago I thought it in danger; but I am persuaded, a 
body of troops posted where I am, at all events, 
would answer valuable purposes. The baggage of 
the army, perhaps, will go by "Windsor; but it is 
perfectly safe, and shorter, to cross the troops at 
the fort. 


FROM MAJOR-GENERAL ARMSTRONG.* 

Philadelphia, 5 June, 1779. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I am for some time possessed of your Excellency s 
favor of the 18th ultimo, and perfectly convinced of 
the truth and importance of the contents, but have, 
and shall, punctually observe that degree of reserve, 
which is equally just as it can be agreeable to yourwishes. 

You are not mistaken when, on a late amplification 
of certain powers, you imagine Congress had an eye 
to something particular, or out of the common road. 

The fact was this; that we were taught to believe 
the return of the Count d Estaing to our coasts be 
fore this time, and that, by the assistance of his 
fleet, you will not be surprised that flattering and 
new manoeuvres should be formed in embryo, and the 
event of his coming be followed with hostile attacks 
on the enemy at New York and Rhode Island. Those 
sanguine ideas so far operated on the minds of 
some gentlemen, as led them to move, that your Ex 
cellency should be directed to recall General Sulli 
van, &c. ; but these motions were so far overruled, as 
to leave you to the exercise of your own judgment, 
on the campaign at large. But upon what ground 
we were amused with the coming of the Count, and 
these hopes have so early died away, are matters 
that to me require some farther explanation. 

The business of finance, although not yet finished 
according to the system proposed, has, nevertheless, 

* An officer of the Pennsylvania militia, and now a Delegate in Con 
gress, from that State ; distinguished for his military services on the 
frontiers in the previous war. For some time he was a Brigadier- General in the Continental service, which office he resigned in April, 1777. 
passed sundry stages apparently proper, and from 
which I expect, at least, a sudden period to the depreciation of our money. Indeed, the mere expecta 
tions of the populace, although our resolutions have 
not yet appeared, joined to the efforts of the sundry 
Committees in this State, have not only prevented a 
farther depreciation, but have actually lessened the 
price of several of the more, necessary articles of life. 

Foreign affairs continue to perplex and procrasti 
nate. Who shall be the great men over the water; 
and whether a common right in the fishery shall, like 
other claims of right and convenience, be made an ulti 
matum, in case Great Britain should offer to concedeour independence ; or whether the fishery, at least for 
the present, shall be left to the effect of our Minis 
ter s negotiation, are subjects of tedious and disagreeable debate. It may be feared these points are blended, the business itself, and who shall transact it. 
Whoever wishes to be the Minister, may wish the 
latitude of negotiation. Others apprehend the risk 
might be too great in the hands of a Minister. How 
ever this important matter may be, many things, unjust and impolitic, have been said and propagated 
about it (I mean the fishery), by making unnecessary 
obstacles about it, giving it an undue and unnatural 
weight in the business of peace, as though itself 
should be the only sine qua non of Great Britain. 
And, if left on the easy footing of negotiation, at 
least oblique insinuations have been held up to the 
people, that we might have our independence con 
ceded us whenever we please, and might have had 
peace before now ; and thus have the true grounds of 
the debate been much shaded by a parcel of false 
hypotheses and delusive stuff. 

It is also true, that several gentlemen, far removed 
from any expectation or wish to go to Europe, think 
the fishery ought to be left to the "best terms the 
Minister can make about it; being of opinion, that it 
is not essential to the well-being of these States ; that 
the Eastern States only, or more principally, must be 
gainers by it, viewing it as the only hinge upon 
which peace or war must turn. In this light, I con 
fess, I am neither willing or able to conceive it, be 
lieving that the real springs of peace or war must 
arise from sources considerably diiferent from that of 
the fishery. 

The army is also a topic of great consideration ; I 
mean its smallness and dissatisfaction. Glad would I 
have been to have it taken up in a series or chain 
long ago ; but our unpardonable, or at least unac 
countable delays on other business, have prevented 
that design, which, I am persuaded, if not early at 
tended to, must undo our cause. The business of 
half-pay for life, of which I have been fond, as the 
best compound of justice and gratuity to our soldiery, 
I find, will meet with more opposition in Congress 
than I had imagined. Many declaim against the po 
licy of that measure, but say they are ready to agreeto something tantamount, by reducing the necessaries 
of life to a moderate price, and making the pay good 
from the beginning, as though there had been no depreciation. Which of these modes Congress ought to 
adopt, I am at a loss to know; but would gladly 
urge the best. 

By a letter of the 6th instant, from Captain Kearsley, I am pleased to find he is returned to the service, and gone up the Susquehanna to join the troops 
with General Sullivan. 

Kearsley I take to be one of those officers, who 
will do his duty from principle, and make no doubt 
a line from your Excellency will at once please and 
fix him. 

Our reputed success on the llth of May, nearCharleston, becomes more and more doubtful, and 
may probably turn out to be only a change of route 
or manoeuvre, upon which Pulaski has charged and 
somewhat harassed their rear. Yet may we have some 
good news from General Lincoln, although the enemy s position, said to be in an island, must render 
his access difficult. The enemy s acquisitions of places 
on the North River are very interesting, and must 
call the attention of the States to strengthen the 
army, of which I am afraid little to the purpose can 
be done before the winter. With perfect respect, I 
have the honor to be, 

Your Excellency s affectionate, humble servant, 

JOHN ARMSTRONG. 



I have just seen an intelligent young gen 
tleman, who left Dublin on the 1st of March last ; 
who informs us that only about fifteen hundred troops 
were sent, he thinks, to Jamaica ; that Britain cannot 
soon send any considerable force to America, as no 
preparation of that sort was made when he left Ire 
land, but the prevailing opinion rather, that no more 
troops would be sent to the Continent of America 
this season ; that a great majority of the Irish were 
in love with the American cause, and much opposed 
to the late speeches of the King ; that the public 
orders for fasts and prayers for his Majesty s arms, 
were highly contemned by the first gentlemen in 
town and country, as farcical and hypocritical. 
FROM THOMAS JEFFERSON, GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA. 

Williamsburg, 23 June, 1779. 

SIR, 

I have the pleasure to inclose you the particulars 
of Colonel Clark s success against St. Vincent s, as 
stated in his letter but lately received; the messen 
ger, with his first letter, having been killed. I fearit will be impossible for Colonel Clark to be so 
strengthened as to enable him to do what he desires. 
Indeed, the express who brought this letter gives us 
reason to fear St. Vincent s is in danger from a large 
body of Indians, collected to attack it, and said, when 
he came from Kaskaskia, to be within thirty leagues 
of the place. 

I also inclose you a letter from Colonel Shelby, 
stating the effect of his success against the seceding 
Cherokees and Chuccamoggas. The damage done them 
was, killing half a dozen, burning eleven towns, and 
twenty thousand bushels of corn, collected probably 
to forward the expeditions which were to have been 
planned at the Council, which was to meet Governor 
Hamilton at the mouth of the Tennessee, and taking as many goods as sold for twenty-five thousand 
pounds. 

I hope these two blows, coming together, and the 
depriving them of their head, will, in some measure, 
effect the quiet of our frontiers this summer. We 
have intelligence, also, that Colonel Bowman, from 
Kentucky, is in the midst of the Shawanee country, 
with three hundred men; and hope to hear a good 
account of him. The inclosed order, being in its na 
ture important, and generally interesting, I think it 
proper to transmit it to you, with the reasons sup 
porting it. It will add much to our satisfaction, to 

VOL. ii. 27 
know it meets your approbation. I have the honor 
to be, with every sentiment of private respect and 
public gratitude, Sir, 

Your most obedient and most humble servant, 

THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

P. S. The distance of our northern and western 
counties from the scene of southern service, and the 
necessity of strengthening our western quarter, have 
induced the Council to direct the new levies from the 
counties of Youghiogania, Ohio, Monongalia, Frederick, 
Hampshire, Berkley, Buckingham, and Greenbrier, 
amounting to somewhat less than three hundred men, 
to enter into the ninth regiment at Pittsburg. The 
aid they may give there will be so immediate and 
important, and what they could do to the southward 
would be so late, as, I hope, will apologize for their 
interference. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL PARSONS. 

Wilton, 11 July, 1779. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

In my last I informed that the enemy landed last 
night. At four this morning, the enemy, on their ad 
vance, were met by the militia,, and some skirmishing 
ensued, but without any considerable effect on either 
side. At about six o clock, the troops under General 
Wolcott and my small detachment of one hundred 
and fifty Continental troops were joined, and took 
possession of an eminence at the north end of the 
town. The enemy advanced in our front, and on ourleft flank, until about nine o clock, when they were 
checked in their progress by the vigorous exertions 
of the parties of militia and Continental troops sent 
out to oppose them; and, in turn, were compelled to 
retire from hill to hill, at some times in great disor 
der. We continued to advance upon them until neareleven o clock, when, a column having nearly gained 
our right flank, the militia in the centre gave way, 
and retreated in disorder. This ga*ve the enemy possession of our ground. 

General Wolcott, who commanded, exerted himself, 
on this occasion, to rally the troops, and bring them 
to order again, but without effect, until they had re 
tired about two miles, when some troops, being again 
formed, returned to the aid of the right and left 
wings, who had retired but a small distance and in 
order. With these the enemy were pursued again, 
and retreated with precipitation to their ships. I 
have the pleasure to assure your Excellency the Con 
tinental troops, without exception, they being all en 
gaged, behaved with the greatest bravery. Captain 
Betts, who was the first engaged with the enemy, 
and who continued longest in action, deserves parti 
cular notice, for his great fortitude and prudent con 
duct in the battle. He continued advancing on the 
enemy until the centre of the main body gave way ; 
and he and his party, advanced near a mile at the 
time, by his prudence were able to effect a regularretreat, without any considerable loss. Captain Eells 
on the right, and Captain on the left, were also 

engaged; and, when obliged to retire, kept their or 
der, and retreated with regularity. A body of the 
militia (I think they were commanded by General 
Porter), and another considerable detachment, deserve 
honorable mention to be made of them. 

I am not yet able to ascertain our own or the 
enemy s loss; but in my next shall be able to give 
you a more particular account. In my handful of 
Continental troops, I have lost five men killed; Lieu 
tenant Gibbs, and six privates, wounded. I do not 
know of any missing. Some loss the militia have sus 
tained. I am satisfied the loss of the enemy must 
have been considerable. About twenty boats landed on 
the west side the harbour, at Sock, and immediately 
began to set fire to the buildings. They completed 
burning the town (Norwalk) at about twelve o clock. 
This appears to have been their sole business, as they 
did not stay to carry off any plunder of considerable 
value. A few Tory houses are left, which, I hope, 
our people will burn, as the owners are here, and 
have committed no act by which the public can seize 
them. I imagine Stamford will be the next object to 
wreak their hellish malice upon. To that place I 
shall repair to-morrow. I am fully persuaded that 
five hundred more men, such as the brave militia I 
have before mentioned, and the one hundred and fifty 
Continental troops, would have given the enemy a 
.total defeat. The numbers of the enemy were about 
two thousand ; our numbers between nine hundred 
and one thousand. I am, dear General, 

Your obedient Servant, 

SAMUEL II. PARSONS. 



FROM PRESIDENT REED. 

In Council, Philadelphia, 14 July, 1779. 

SIR, 

Your Excellency s favor of the 5th instant was 
duly received, and, though it was and is the uni 
versal opinion, that the number of men under General Sullivan is greater than can be fed, when he proceeds a little further on the expedition, yet we gave 
early and peremptory orders to the companies of 
rangers to join him, as soon as they were completed 
to any tolerable number. We also directed the mili 
tia of the adjoining counties to give all possible aid, 
as we were resolved that, should the expedition fail 
of success, no imputation should justly fall upon the 
State of Pennsylvania, Our prospects of raising these 
men were very flattering, the success in recruiting, 
for a little time, having equalled, or rather exceeded, 
our expectations ; but the Quarter-master s depart 
ment having occasion for a number of bateau-men, 
and offering forty-five pounds per month, and a ration 
and a half per day, were terms so superior to what 
we had to offer, that the service has languished ever 
since, and it is very doubtful whether they will, or 
can be completed. 

It is a general opinion, that the boatmen might 
have been procured upon more favorable terms ; but, 
as it was a necessary service, and well meant, we 
can only wish better information had been had. 
Every State and country is limited in its powers, 
and if its resources are drawn off in one service, 
they cannot be had in another. Five hundred are en 
gaged in this boat service, all of this State, besides 
which, the deputies, assistants, and helpers, amount 
to a great number. "We would not infer from this 
that they are unnecessary, but to account for the deficiencies of these companies, which otherwise would 
have been very complete. 

We beg leave to refer your Excellency to the in 
closed letter, which will show that no orders have 
been wanting on our part, and that there is every 
disposition in the officers under us to execute them, 
as far as they can. 
27* 
It is much to be wished that, instead of troubling 
your Excellency with this circuitous mode of applica 
tion, General Sullivan would address himself directly 
to us. We have assured him that we will endeavourto give him every aid and assistance in our power, 
and, when it cannot be done, we shall, at least, be 
able to give him sufficient reasons. We have not 
had a line from him since he left Easton; and, though 
we know from other advices that these companies 
had not joined, we had not any information on the 
subject from the General himself. 

We are very sensible, Sir, that this expedition has 
received all possible aid from you. It has also been 
fostered and cherished by this State. We have drawn 
off our wagons at four pounds ten shillings per day, 
which will not pay the drivers and shoe the horses. 
We have stopped a great number of ploughs. The 
encouragement of one hundred dollars, by Congress, 
was so small, that the State added shoes, shirts, leg 
gings, blankets, and arms, amounting to triple the sum. 
Our orders and measures since, would show your Ex 
cellency our anxiety on the subject in so striking a 
view as to exclude any supposition that any thing 
is omitted, in our power, to procure the desired suc 
cess. But we cannot change the course of things 
and order of Providence, to advance General Sulli 
van s views, be they ever so apparently salutary ; and 
we hope his recollection of past periods, wherein ho 
has seen you rise superior to disappointments and 
deficiencies far more important, will strengthen his 
mind to obviate those which may occur to him. With 
perfect esteem and respect, I have the honor to be, 
your Excellency s 

Most obedient, and very humble servant, 

JOSEPH REED. 
FROM MAJOR-GENERAL HOWE. 

Peekskill, Saturday, 17 [July], 1779. 

SIR. 

I joined the division at the Continental Village, the 
last evening, and arrived at this post at five this 
morning. I now only halt for the return of a recon 
noitring party, sent out last night, and shall imme 
diately proceed to execute your Excellency s orders. 
The field-pieces you suppose to have been taken on 
with the brigades, are not with them. General Nixon 
informs me there are not any attached to his bri 
gade y those of General Patterson I think to send 
for. 

Colonel Putnam informs me, that Peekskill would 
be a very precarious situation, as the enemy, by more 
than one road, and by a march of a few hours, might 
post themselves in our rear, and cut off the retreat ; 
and that, without horsemen to act as videttes, we 
could not receive information in time to prevent it. 
If, therefore, there should be occasion to take post in 
this neighbourhood, I shall endeavour to fix on a situ 
ation not liable to this inconvenience. 

Lest any difficulty should arise as to the pieces, I 
should be much obliged to you, Sir, to send such 
orders as may hasten them to me. I am, Sir, with 
the greatest respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

EGBERT HOWE. 

P. S. The field-pieces, attached to these brigades, 
I am just informed, are all at Fishkill.* 

* General Wayne s letters, giving an account of the storming of Stony 
Point, on the night of the 15th of July, are in Washington s Writings, 
Vol. VI., Appendix, p. 537. 
FROM MAJOR-GENERAL HOWE. 

Before Verplanck s Point, 17 July, 1779. 

DEAR SIR, 

I am now very near Verplanck s Point, which I 
have been reconnoitring, and shall still more fully 
inspect. "What I discern of the works appears to be 
properly constructed, and seems capable of considera 
ble defence, if the numbers and spirit of the garrison 
are adequate to the task. The troops, except such 
as I have fixed at particular passes, are with me. 
The heavy cannon are, by this time, I hope, at the 
Continental Village ; and I have sent to hasten them 
as fast as possible. The ammunition appointed for 
them was not over the ferry when I left it, I gave 
the officers orders to expedite it. 

Understanding from your Excellency, that the can 
non and the requisites for them had been ordered, 1 
did not presume to interfere before with the detail. 
I doubt not that, if your Excellency s orders have 
been complied with, I shall receive the ammunition 
with the pieces ; but the field-pieces, I informed you 
this morning, were at Fishkill. 

If works should be necessary to be thrown up, I 
am not furnished with one intrenching or other tool 
for the purpose. Should your Excellency think pro 
per, please order them, arid any other articles requi 
site. If the cannon do not get up in time to-day, 
shall retire till I meet them, if their security makes 
it necessary. 

The men are out of provisions to-day, and I have 
no Commissary to apply to for a supply. Will it not 
be convenient to your Excellency to order some, as 
I am without wagons to bring it? I had sent 
videttes down the roads you mentioned, before the 
receipt of your letter; but, as I am entirely unfurnished with horsemen, I was obliged to employ such 
of the country people as Colonel Putnam recommended. 

Early this morning I sent an express to General 
Heath, and am sorry I had not then your Excellen 
cy s instructions with regard to horse. If I can pro 
cure an express, I shall send to the general again, 
as horsemen are so essential to our situation. Being 
informed of a militia troop of horse about twelve 
miles distant, I have desired Captain Delaval, who 
commands them, to join me. Whether in this appli 
cation I shall be successful, remains a matter of 
speculation. 

Inclining to make short work of the enemy, I or 
dered the engineer to reconnoitre their works, which 
he did at a very short distance. He reports, that 
storming them, at present, would be ineligible. I 
take the liberty to refer your Excellency for ournumbers to Lieutenant Slade, not choosing to transmit a written return of them. With the greatest 
respect. I am your Excellency s 

Very obedient and humble servant, 

EGBERT HOWE. 

P. S. The chaplain of General Patterson s brigadejust informs me that, as he passed our cannon, he 
perceived the horses were jaded, and he thought they 
would not be up to-night. 

I think it necessary to add, that Colonel Putnam 
has informed me there is more danger of being dou 
bled between Continental Village and Peekskill, than 
between Peekskill and Verplanck s Point. 



322 LETTERS TO W ASIIINGT ON. 

FIIOM MAJOR-GENERAL MCDOUGALL. 

West Point, 7 o clock, P. M., 17 July, 1779. 
SlR ? 

Your Excellency s favor of this day is this moment 
received. Colonel Hamilton s, of equal date, reached 
me at three, P. M. Only eight of the boats written 
for can be procured, and are now ready. It is impossible, at this post, to furnish the horse-harness desired ; 
for few of the artillery, brought here, are accompanied 
with horse-harness. I have, however, directed the 
Quarter-master to write immediately to New Windsor 
for them. If they can be had, they will be sent 
with all possible despatch. The pettiaugers are or 
dered ; but watermen are so scarce for the demand, 
and many of them marched with Patterson s brigade, 
I fear the number necessary cannot be got to man 
the galley. Every effort, however, will be made. I 
have the honor to be 

Your Excellency s humble servant, 

ALEXANDER MCDOUGALL. 

P. S. If my conjectures are just, as to the use to 
be made of the galley, I fear it is out of our power 
to send her properly provided to take in heavy can 
non. 



FROM GOVERNOR JEFFERSON. 

Williamsburg, 17 July, 1779. 



SIR, 

I some time ago inclosed to you a printed copy of 
an order of Council, by which Governor Hamilton 
was to be confined in irons, and in close jail. This 
has occasioned a letter from General Phillips, of which 
the inclosed is a copy. The General seems to sup 
pose that a prisoner on capitulation cannot be put 
into close confinement, though his capitulation shall 
not have provided against it. My idea was, that all 
persons, taken in war, were to be deemed prisoners 
of war ; that those who surrender on capitulation (or 
Convention) are prisoners of war also, subject to the 
same treatment with those who surrender at discre 
tion, except only so far as the terms of their capitu 
lation or Convention shall have guarded them. In 
the capitulation of Governor Hamilton (a copy of 
which I inclose), no stipulation is made as to the 
treatment of himself, or those taken with him. The 
Governor, indeed, when he signs, adds a flourish of 
reasons, inducing him to capitulate, one of which is, 
the generosity of his enemy. Generosity, on a large 
and comprehensive scale, seems to dictate the making 
a signal example of this gentleman ; but waiving that, 
these are only the private motives inducing him to 
surrender, and do not enter into the contract of Co 
lonel Clark. 

I have the highest idea of the sacredness of those 
contracts which take place between nation and na 
tion at war, and would be among the last on earth 
who should do any thing in violation of them. I 
can find nothing in those books, usually recurred to 
as testimonials of the laws and usages of nature and 
nations, which convicts the opinions I have above ex 
pressed, of error ; yet there may be such an usage as 
General Phillips seems to suppose, though not taken 
notice of by these writers. 

I am obliged to trouble your Excellency, on this 
occasion, by asking of you information on this point. 
There is no other person, whose decision will so authoritatively decide this doubt in the public mind, 
and none with which I am disposed so to comply. 
If you shall be of opinion, that the bare existence of 
a capitulation in the case of Governor Hamilton, pri 
vileges him from confinement, though there be no article to that effect in the capitulation, justice shall 
most assuredly be done him. The importance of this 
question in a public view, and my own anxiety, under a charge of a violation of national faith by the 
Executive of the Commonwealth, will, I hope, apolo 
gize for my adding this to the many, many troubles 
with which I know you to be burdened. I have the 
honor to be, with the most profound respect and es 
teem, your Excellency s 

Most obedient, and most humble servant, 

THOMAS JEFFEHSON. 

P. S. I have just received a letter from Colonel 
Bland, containing information of numerous desertions 
from the Convention troops (not less than four hundred in the last fortnight). He thinks he has reason 
to believe it is with the connivance of some of their 
officers. Some of these have been retaken, all of 
them going northwardly. They had armed themselves 
with forged passports, and with certificates of having 
taken the oath of fidelity to the State, some of them 
forged, others really given by weak magistrates. I 
mention this to your Excellency, as perhaps it may 
be in your power to have such of them intercepted, 
as shall be passing through Pennsylvania and the 
Jerseys. 

Your letter, inclosing the opinion of the Board of 
Officers, in the case between Allison and Lee, is come 
safe to hand, after a long passage. It shall be an 
swered by next post. 


FROM MAJOR-GENERAL HOWE. 

Camp, near Yerplanck s Point, 
4 o clock, P. M.; Sunday, 18 July, 1779. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have received intelligence, three different ways, 
of the approach of the enemy. One informs me, that 
" several thousands of the enemy were, yesterday, onemile below White Plains, moving towards this place;" 
another, a verbal account, says that about two hundred of their horse were seen on some heights at 
New Bridge, by the informant. As I cannot doubt 
the credibility of these accounts, from the character 
of the persons who gave them, and as, consequently, 
there is the greatest reason to believe the enemy are 
making this effort to get me between two fires, duty 
and prudence enjoin me to avoid the snare. But, unwilling to risk too much on my own judgment, I have 
consulted that of the Brigadiers, who are of opinion, 
that no time should be lost to effect a retreat. Ano 
ther express is just arrived, and confirms me in the 
above. I shall take post on the most convenient part 
of my route, and inform your Excellency farther. I 
have the honor to be, with great esteem, your Excel 
lency s 

Most obedient and humble servant, 

EGBERT HOWE. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL HEATH. 

Bald Hill, 18 July, 1779. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

Yesterday, at half past nine o clock, A. M., I re 
ceived your orders to march for Peekskill. At twelve, 
VOL. ii. 28 
the division began their march ; marched fifteen miles,, 
and halted ; at three, this morning, pursued the march, 
and reached Peekskill at half past three, P. M. On 
my arrival, I found General Howe had sent off his 
cannon, and his division was filing off towards the 
Highlands. The enemy appeared to be advancing in 
force near the New Bridge. I threw my division in 
the rear, sent Patterson s to the Gorge, and Nixon s, 
Parsons s, and Huntington s to these heights, not being able to get further with the baggage. 

Early in the morning I shall send on the baggage 
into the Highlands, and follow with the troops, giving the enemy an offer of attacking us in rear, if 
they choose it. Sir Henry Clinton is once more disappointed, after marching all day on my flank. For 
tunately, I have formed a junction. Since I arrived 
here, I have been honored with yours of yesterday, 
inclosing one to General Glover. Immediately on the 
receipt of your letter, I sent off an express to hurry 
his brigade on, with all possible expedition, by the 
shortest and best route ; and directed the express to 
take fresh horses. I &lt; shall critically observe the mo 
tions of the enemy in the morning. I have the 
honor to be, with the greatest respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

WILLIAM HEATH. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL HEATH. 

Mandeville s, 19 July, 177!). 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I was honored with your favor of yesterday, on 
niy way from Bald Hill to this place. I had before 
ordered Parsons s brigade to encamp near Robinson s ; 
Huntington s, near the place where Parsons s encamped 
before they left this place; Patterson s, between that 
place and Danforth s ; Nixon s, at the gorge of the 
mountains. Glover s is not yet arrived. May I be 
permitted to request that, when it does, it may be 
attached to General Howe s division? 

By intelligence received since I had the honor to 
write in the morning, I learn that the enemy s ad 
vanced sentinels and videttes were posted, the last 
night, on the New Bridge. They appear to advance 
with the greatest caution. I think Major-General 
Howe was very fortunate in making his retreat the 
instant he did. Had he remained, I think he would 
have been Burgoyned; his intelligence being good, 
he escaped it. I have taken measures to obtain in 
telligence from every quarter on this side the river. 
Such as I receive shall be transmitted. I have or 
dered the light-horse to the left, and am determined 
to harass the enemy, if possible. I have the honor 
to be, with the greatest respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

WILLIAM HEATH. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL HOWE. 

Mandeville s, opposite West Point, 19 July, 1779. 

DEAR SIR, 

Deprived, as I was by the enemy s advances, of 
reducing their post at Verplanck e, which, but for 
that event, I persuade myself I should have effected, 
I had nothing left but to retreat, which I performed, 
and was so happy as to be joined by General Heath 
at Peekskill. My situation was critical, and it was 
well for me that I had found means to obtain tolerably exact information of the enemy s motions. 
Though disappointed of the ultimate end of my aim, 
if my conduct meets the approbation of my General, 
I shall be happy. 

I beg leave to suggest the exceeding weak state 
of my division, and venture to express a wish, that 
an addition could be made to it. General Heath 
mentions Glover s brigade as unattached. I have the 
honor to be, with all respect, your Excellency s 
Obedient and very humble servant, 

ROBERT HOWE. 



FROM COLONEL RICHARD BUTLER. 

Fort Montgomery, 9 o clock, 19 July, 1779. 

SIR, 

General Wayne, being indisposed, desires that I 
inform your Excellency that I remained to see the 
whole of the troops off the ground, and just as the 
last party moved, a cannonade from the enemy s ships 
began to cover their Janding. At five o clock they 
took immediate possession of the Point and disman 
tled w r orks, confining themselves within the morass 
that encircles the Point, on which they placed a 
guard, and confined themselves within their sentries. 

I observed some officers busily pointing from place 
to place, as if they were directing the repair of the 
works. I counted fifty-eight sail of shipping, of dif 
ferent kinds, in view, about twenty of which were 
square-rigged; and about ten of these I took to bo 
frigates and sloops of war, from eighteen to thirty 
guns. I think they had landed about six hundred 
men, and were still very busily landing. Four large 
transports were very full of men, that I think nonehad been sent from, as the boats were still plying 
from other vessels. They have many galleys and 
armed boats. The General thought it absolutely necessary your Excellency should have this intelligence 
immediately, and I have given it as circumstantially 
as in my power. I am, with respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

RICHARD BUTLER. 

P. S. It is my opinion they will soon march for 
West Point, from the number of small sail-boats they 
have, as they had no need for these to land at Stony 
Point, and they are empty. 



FROM WILLIAM FITZHUGH. 
Lower Marlborough [Maryland], 17 August, 1779. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I had the honor to receive your favor of the 25th 
of June, and should have wrote you long before this, 
but, as the meeting of our General Assembly was at 
hand, I waited for the event, in order to give you 
the result of their proceedings, especially relating to 
our army, speculating, engrossing, &c., &c. 

We have passed an act to provide annually for 
our officers one complete suit of regimentals, fourshirts, and an allowance of rum, sugar, tea, coffee, 
chocolate, tobacco, &c., at the current prices of such 
articles when the war commenced; and left it at the 
officer s choice to receive, if he pleased, seven hundred and fifty pounds currency, instead of the regi 
mentals and shirts; and have provided an allowance 
of rum and tobacco for the non-commissioned officers 
28* 
and soldiers. We have also continued the prohibition 
on the export of all kinds of provision, and passed 
an act to prevent forestalling and engrossing, and to 
appreciate our money, with very severe penalties ; 
and have appointed a Committee in every county to 
see it duly executed. By this act, all provisions purchased, except what may be thought sufficient to 
serve the family of the purchaser twelve months, are 
seizable for the public use; and there is such provi 
sion made, respecting the sale of goods and merchan 
dise, as will nearly amount to the stoppage of trade, 
and, I hope, will have a good effect, especially as we 
have, at the same time, laid a tax on all estates, real 
and personal, of thirteen pounds in the hundred, to 
be collected by the first day of November next. 

These several regulations, with heavy taxes, I think 
must shake the speculators, though there are several 
wealthy companies, w r ho have placed their agents from 
one end of the Continent to the other; and, at the 
head of one of them, Don Juan, a Spaniard, at Phila 
delphia, called the Spanish Ambassador. And much 
will depend on the measures adopted in other States. 
With respect to filling up our battalions, recruitingis to continue ; and W T C have made an additional al 
lowance, to every recruit, of a suit of clothes, a shirt, 
hat, shoes, and stockings. 

I am greatly obliged to your Excellency for the 
several judicious hints, contained in your letters of 
the 10th of April and 25th of June, particularly 
those relating to our officers, and the black tribe of 
speculators. They had much weight in our Legislature, and assisted our deliberations. I could wish 
that Congress would bend their attention to some 
general regulation respecting trade, forestalling, en 
grossing, and speculations, to be recommended to the 
whole United States. It would remove the evil effects 
of that jealousy which the States entertain of one an 
other, respectively, regarding their trade ; indeed, if 
adopted, the very foundation of its existence, and 
greatly strengthen the Union. 

I have reflected with concern on the long and 
tedious confinement of our prisoners at York and 
Long Island (I mean our officers, for I "believe the 
enemy have disposed of most of our private men) ; 
and on reading the report of our Commissioners, late 
ly appointed to settle a cartel, I find that the British declare they wish not to exchange for the officers 
of the Convention troops (Burgoyne s), until the regi 
ments, to which they belong, are also discharged. 
This is acknowledging an interest in their officers 
remaining prisoners, and, if not removed, will always 
operate against the settlement of a cartel. Separate 
the officers from the men, and the interest ceases. I 
believe it is not the custom of any nation to keep 
officers and privates prisoners of war together ; where 
fore, I presume, this singular instance has proceeded 
from some article of the Convention of Saratoga, 
Congress resolved that the Convention was broken on 
the part of Burgoyne, and therefore refused to comply with one capital article, which was, suffering the 
troops to embark at Boston to be transported to 
Great Britain. 

If the Convention was broken, as I have no doubt 
it was, why comply with any part or article of it? 
Does it not imply a contradiction unfavorable to the 
wisdom or justice of Congress ? I am confident, if 
that honorable body had reflected a moment on the 
impropriety and evil consequences of keeping such a 
number of officers and men together, they never 
would have suffered it, and would even now separate them immediately. The irnpoliey of this indul 
gence is equally obvious. Had the men been sepa 
rated from their officers, they would have mingled 
with the inhabitants of the several States, and most 
of them become good and useful citizens; we should 
have gained strength, and the enemy been weakened 
by it. Common soldiers, when they have an opportunity, are fond of quitting the military service, and 
especially on a Continent like this, where they can be 
so readily accommodated with the necessaries of life. 
Your Excellency will naturally conceive that 1 am 
rather sanguine on this subject, and may impute 
it to interest. It is true, I have the feelings of a 
father for a captive son, and sincerely regret his 
long detention from his country s service, as w r ell as 
improvement in his profession; but still am clear in 
opinion that justice, sound policy, and the public 
good, require an immediate separation of the officers 
from the soldiers or private men of that army. 

Be pleased to accept my thanks for the kind men 
tion you make of my son. I have not had a letter 
from him since the 10th of July. He was then very 
well, on Long Island, and seems satisfied with every 
thing except his loss of time. The letters, which I 
mentioned as stopped by an officer on the British 
lines, were not to have passed by head-quarters, but 
through the hands of our Commissary of Prisoners, 
via Philadelphia, I have now requested my son to 
send his letters by way of head-quarters, and I take 
the liberty to inclose you one for him. 

I very sincerely congratulate you on the success 
of our arms at Stony Point. It was a glorious action, 
and reflects much honor and credit on the brave officers and men who performed it. 

I have been lately afflicted with the gout, and am 
so blind that I cannot walk out without a guide. 
These infirmities, I am afraid, will disable me to con 
tinue in the public service ; though I am determined, 
if possible, to hold out until there is a happy end to 
the war. 

Mrs. Fitzhugh presents her respectful compliments, 
and joins with me in best wishes for your health 
and success in arms. I have the honor to be, with 
the warmest affection and regard, your Excellency s 
Most obedient and obliged humble servant, 

WILLIAM FITZHUGH. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 25 August, 1779. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have had the pleasure of receiving your favor of 
the 16th instant. Britain refused the mediation of 
Spain at a time when their spirits were elated by 
their successes in the West Indies and the Southern 
States, and by the accounts they received of discord 
in Congress, discontent among the people, and a pros 
pect of the evils with which we were threatened by 
the depreciation of our currency. Deceived by these 
illusory gleams of hope, they permitted their counsels 
to be guided by their pride. What reason they may 
have to expect succour from other powers is, as yet, 
a secret. M. Gerard is decided, in his opinion, that 
they will obtain none. The conduct of France, inestablishing peace between Russia and the Porte, has 
won the heart of the Empress ; and the influence of 
Versailles, at Constantinople, will probably give dura 
tion to her gratitude. The Emperor and Prussia are 
under similar obligations. The latter wishes us well, 
and the finances of the former are too much exhausted to support the expenses of war, without subsidies 
from Britain, who, at present, cannot afford them. 
There is no reason to suspect that the peace of Ger 
many will soon he interrupted. Britain may hire 
some troops there, but it is not probable she will be 
able to do more. Portugal and the Dutch, while di 
rected by their interest, will not rashly raise their 
hands to support a nation, which, like a tower in an 
earthquake, sliding from its base, will crush every 
slender prop that may be raised to prevent its fall. 

General Wayne s letter has been referred to the 
Committee of Intelligence for publication. 

You may remember, Sir, to have received a letter 
from me last winter, recommending the person who 
carried it as an honest man, and w r ho, in my opinion, 
w r ould, with great fidelity, do the business you wished, 
and I advised him, to undertake. 

In May last, I received a letter from him, informin 2; me of his having written to vou at the same 

O C! \J 

time, and mentioning a matter of very delicate na 
ture, which, I believe,- was omitted in your letter, as 
he gave mo reason to expect he would soon be here. 
I avoided particulars, not choosing to risk more on 
paper than was necessary. lie has not, however, been 
here, nor have I received a line from him for some 
time past. From this circumstance, I have been apprehensive of his having relinquished that business ; 
and the more so, as he intimated to me his doubts 
of its being well conducted, unless under your imme 
diate direction; that the views of the gentleman, with 
whom he first conversed on the subject, were not very 
extensive, and his attention to expense too great. 

The opinion I have of this man s usefulness leads 
me to mention these matters, that, if he has left the 
business, I might, if you think proper, press him to 
resume it. If he still perseveres, I do not wish to 
be informed of any other particulars. With perfect 
respect, and sincere regard, I am, dear Sir, 
Your most obedient servant, 

JOHN JAY. 



FROM MONSIEUR GERARD. 
(Translation.) 

Philadelphia, 18 September, 1779. 

SIR, 

My plan and my dearest desire were, personally 
to take leave of your Excellency, and to go once 
more to admire, in a near view, the greatest man 
and best citizen of America. But a multitude of 
business, some indisposition, and the uncertainty of 
the epoch of my departure, have deprived me of the 
infinite satisfaction which I promised myself from, the 
journey. Receive then, Sir, my adieus in writing, as 
well .as the assurances of all my respect, and of all 
my attachment. I shall count it among the most 
flattering events of my life, to have been able to 
merit some share in the esteem and in the confi 
dence of your Excellency. 

France knows as well as America, Sir, that which 
she ought to place in your talents, and in your man 
ner of thinking. Your attachment to the true inte 
rests of your country is the pledge of your disposi 
tions towards the alliance ; and I dare assure yourExcellency, that my Court knows how to do you 
justice, and that your personal glory and personal 
happiness are as precious to the French nation as 
they ought to be to the people of America, I have 
the honor to be, with the most respectful attachment, 
your Excellency s 

Most humble, and most obedient servant, 

GERARD. 



FROM GOVERNOR JEFFERSON. 

Williamsburg, 1 October, 1779. 

SIR, 

On receipt of your letter of August Gth, during 
my absence, the Council had the irons taken off the 
prisoners of Avar. When your advice was asked, we 
meant it should decide with us ; and, upon my re 
turn to Williamsburg, the matter was taken up, and 
the inclosed advice given. A parole was formed, of 
which the inclosed is a copy, and tendered to the 
prisoners. They objected to that part of it which re 
strained them from saying any thing to the prejudice of the United States, and insisted on "freedom 
of speech." They were, in consequence, remanded to 
their confinement in the jail, which must be considered as a voluntary one, until they can determine with 
themselves to be inoffensive in word as well as deed. 

A flag sails hence to-morrow to New York, to negotiate the exchange of some prisoners, By her I 
have written to General Phillips on this subject, and 
inclosed to him copies of the within, intending it as 
an answer to a letter I received from him on the 
subject of Governor Hamilton. I have the honor to 
be, Sir, 

Your most obedient, and most humble servant, 

THOMAS JEFFERSON. 


FKOM COLONEL HAMILTON AND BRIGADIER-GENERAL DUPORTAIL. 

Great Egg Harbour Landing, 
26 October, 1779. 

SIR. 

We are honored with two letters from your Excel 
lency, of the 10th and 21st, to the contents of which 
we beg leave to assure you of our strictest attention. 
That of the 18th has not yet come to hand. It 
is not improbable it has gone round by Lewistown, 
which has occasioned the delay. 

Colonel Hamilton wrote to your Excellency from 
Philadelphia, acquainting you with our arrival there, 
and our intention to proceed to Lewistown at Cape 
Ilenlopen; and from Great Egg Harbour, communicating our progress since, and our determination to esta 
blish ourselves at Bat Stove Furnace. We have since 
fixed on this place, about forty-four miles from the 
extremity of Cape May (eighteen miles short of the 
Furnace, which we found to be more remote than 
had been represented), and, as far as we are able to 
learn, from one hundred to one hundred and ten miles 
from Sandy Hook about fifty from Philadelphia. 
Your Excellency will easily perceive the reasons of 
our choosing this station. It did not appear to us, 
from our inquiries in Philadelphia, to be a point well 
ascertained that the fleet would stop at the Delaware; 
and the time which had elapsed made it the more 
possible, if the Count should be determined to prose 
cute any further operations on the Continent, that he 
would not lose time by a procedure of this sort, but 
might content himself with sending some transports, 
under escort of a few frigates, to receive the provi 
sions for the fleet, and proceed himself directly on to 
the Hook. On this supposition, our position at LewisVOL. ii. 29 
town was entirely ineligible. The distance at which 
we were from the city, as well as from the Hook, 
the delays that would consequently attend our intelligences from every quarter, the difficulty and impossi 
bility sometimes of traversing the Bay, made our first 
situation inconvenient in every respect, in the event 
of the fleet s proceeding immediately to the Hook. 
These considerations induced us to cross the Delaware, 
and take the position at which we now are, where, 
or in the vicinity, we propose to remain till the 
arrival of the Count, till intelligence from him decides the inutility of a longer stay, or till we receive 
your Excellency s orders of recall. 

We have now a better relation to the different 
points in which we are interested, and have taken 
the necessary precautions to gain the earliest notice 
of whatever happens. We have stationed expresses 
at the pitch of the Cape, and have established a re 
gular communication with Major Lee, and with the 
city. If the fleet should appear off the Delaware, we 
can be there in twelve hours after its first appearance ; and if at the Jlook, in less than four days, 
provided Major Lee is punctual in conveying the 
intelligence, arid the expresses from either side in 
bringing it. 

By recent information from Philadelphia (though 
not quite so distinct and accurate as we could wish), 
we find that, so late as the 4th of this month, the 
Count was yet to open his batteries against the enemy at Savannah. The time that will probably inter 
vene between this and their final reduction, the reembarkation of the Count s troops, the dispositions 
for sailing, and his arrival on this coast, may, we 
fear, exhaust the season too much to permit the co 
operation to which our mission relates. We do not, 
however, despair; for, if the Count has been fully 
successful to the southward, and should shortly arrive, 
which may be the case, the enterprise may possibly 
still go on. 

In a letter from Major Lee, of the 22d, he informs 
us that a vessel from Georgia arrived on the 16th, 
since which the two sixty-fours and the Renown, 
which were at the Hook, had fallen down towards 
New York, and the troops at the Hook had em 
barked, and gone to the city. At first sight this 
account alarmed us, and made us apprehensive that 
the enemy had received some favorable advices from 
the southward, which put them out of danger, and 
superseded the necessity of continuing their prepara 
tions for defence. But, on further reflection, we think 
it more probable that this is only a change of dispo 
sition; and that finding, on close examination, they 
would be unable to defend the Hook, they had determined to relinquish the attempt. This seems the 
more likely, as Major Lee mentions that a part of 
the hulks, sunk in the channel, had gotten afloat 
and drifted ashore. 

To this experience of the difficulty of obstructing 
the channel, may, perhaps, be attributed the change 
we suppose. And we are confirmed in this conjec 
ture by the evacuation of the two posts at King s 
Ferry, which appears, by your Excellency s letter, to 
have taken place on the 21st, five days after the 
supposed arrival of the. vessel from Georgia ; a proof 
that they had not received information of any deci 
sive good fortune on their side, or ill fortune on ours; 
and that they persisted in their defensive plan. We 
are persuaded, too, that their exultation would have 
given wings to any good news they might have re 
ceived, and that it would have reached us before this. 
Were the season less advanced, we should regret this 
change of disposition, because we believe the attempt 
to defend the entrance of the Hook would have been 
fruitless ; and it might have thrown a part of their 
ships and of their troops into our hands in the first 
instance, which could not fail to facilitate the suc 
cessive operations. 

But, at this late period, it may rather be an ad 
vantage. To force the passage, might have required 
land operations against the Hook, which would lose 
time, and expose the fleet to the hazard of winds, 
which would have rendered its situation critical. 
Now, the fleet may probably enter the Bay on its 
first approach, and be in security ; and the whole 
operation will be brought to a point, and may demand less time for its accomplishment. 

As a large number of fascines, ready for use, appears to us essential to any operations that may be 
undertaken, we presume your Excellency has been 
preparing, and will continue to prepare, as many as 
possible. We beg leave to suggest the utility of 
having at the same time a sufficient number of gabi 
ons and sand bags. Of the former, Colonel Gouvion, 
if your Excellency thinks proper, may bo charged 
with the construction. The latter may be made under the care of the Quarter-master at Philadelphia. 
Several thousands may be necessary. The usual di 
mensions are fifteen or eighteen inches long, and 
twelve wide. If, notwithstanding the advices from 
Major Lee, any thing by land is to be attempted 
against the Hook, these will be peculiarly useful on 
such a flat, sandy spot ; and, indeed, it would be 
impracticable to construct batteries in any reasona 
ble time without them. We have the honor to be, 

ALEXANDER HAMILTON, 
DUPORTAIL. 
FROM GOVERNOR GREENE. 



Warwick, Rhode Island, 5 November, 1779. 

SIR, 

I most sincerely congratulate your Excellency upon 
the enemy s having evacuated Rhode Island ; but am 
sorry to be under the necessity of troubling you with 
a resolution of the Council of War of this State, which 
I take the liberty to inclose, by which you will please 
to observe the distressed situation the inhabitants of 
those towns must labor under for want of their records. 
I doubt not you will take every necessary measure 
that may tend to convince General Clinton of his 
error in continuing to hold them, as they certainly 
cannot be of any use to the enemy, exclusive of the 
pleasure they enjoy in distressing mankind, who are 
not to be controlled by them. I am, with every 
sentiment of respect, your Excellency s 

Most obedient and most humble servant. 

WILLIAM GREENE. 



FROM GOVERNOR TRUMBULL. 

Hartford, 5 November, 1779. 

SIR, 

The time, when the arrival of the fleet under the 
command of the Count cl Estaing may be expected, 
being so far advanced that the utmost readiness to 
cooperate with him is become necessary, should he 
appear on this coast, and the immediate danger to 
which our own seaports will be exposed from the 
collected force of the enemy, should he be prevented 
from coming this way, have prevailed to induce the 
General Assembly of this State to order the militia, 
29* 
requested by your Excellency, to be assembled at the 
places of rendezvous proposed, as soon as possible. 

Should the advanced season, or any other unfore 
seen cause, prevent the Count from coming this way, 
and the intended enterprise against the enemy at New 
York be laid aside, the frontiers and sea-coasts of this 
State will be eminently exposed to the ravages and 
depredations of the enemy. We would flatter ourselves it will be in your Excellency s power to send 
a part of the troops, under your command, into this 
State, to take post so as to cover and protect the 
most exposed part of our sea-coasts and frontiers ; and 
desire you to inform us whether we may expect that 
our hopes and wishes, in this respect, may be realized. 

The keeping up large guards of the militia on the 
coasts, besides the enormous expense attending, injures 
the public service by withdrawing the men from the 
field, and lessening our ability to supply the army 
with men or provisions. But, I persuade myself, 1 
need not use arguments to prevail upon your Excel 
lency to indulge our request, if consistent with the 
public service and a jdue regard to the general interests of the States. I am, with great esteem and 
regard, my dear General, 

Your most obedient, humble servant, 

JONATHAN TRUMBULL. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SULLIVAN. 

Suffern s, 6 November, 1779. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I am now moving to Pompton, agreeably to yourExcellency s orders of yesterday. I find that the 
whole of the Rhode Island army is encamped on Staten Island, in addition to the troops before stationed 
there ; that they are making preparations for an ex 
cursion somewhere, and it is generally conjectured 
that they intend a descent upon the Jersey shore. 
This conjecture seems to be strengthened by the 
light-horse being sent on to the Island, and the preparations they are making in the boat way. If the 
forage is their object, will our troops at Pompton be 
within sufficient distance to give a timely opposition? 
May not the magazines at Pluckamin be an object? 
I see the disadvantage which may arise from this di 
vision of the army being sent at too great a distance 
from the others, and beg pardon for the above hints, 
which are only intended to express my wishes to be 
in such a situation as may enable me effectually to 
answer your Excellency s wishes. The place which 
will best answer this purpose, your Excellency can 
best determine. I have the honor to be, with the 
most perfect respect, dear General, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

JOHN SULLIVAN. 

P. S. I have not a horseman, or any thing in place 
of one, for expresses, or any other purpose. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SULLIVAN. 

Suffern s Tavern, 6 November, 1779. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I am sorry to inform your Excellency, that I am 
under the painful necessity of leaving a service to 
which I am, by principle and interest, attached ; and, 
among the variety of mortifications I must suffer in 
quitting it, that of being deprived the pleasure of 
serving under your Excellency, stands among the 
foremost. My health is too much impaired to be re 
covered but by a total release from business ; and, 
though the physicians give me encouragement that 
this will restore me, I am myself convinced of the 
contrary, and fear that I must content myself with 
enjoying the reflection of having used my utmost to 
serve my country, as the only thing I shall receive 
in exchange for a constitution sacrificed in endea 
vouring to promote its interest. 

Should there be a probability of Count d Estaing s 
arrival, I would willingly wait, to give the little as 
sistance in my power to extirpate the enemies of 
this country ; but, should this not be likely to happen, and the season be too far advanced, I must 
beg your Excellency s leave to retire as soon as 
possible, that I may take every measure in my 
power to restore my health in some degree, or at 
least to live in such a manner as will not tend to 
put it beyond a possibility of being restored, which 
a longer continuance in the service undoubtedly will. 
I have the honor to r be, most respectfully, my dearGeneral, your Excellency s 

Most obedient and very humble servant, 

JOHN SULLIVAN. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LINCOLN. 

Charleston, 7 November, 1779. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I had the honor of your very obliging favor of the 
28th of September, the last evening. I wish it was 
in my power to give you such an account of matters 
in this department, as would afford you some satisfaction in the perusal ; but, unfortunately for me, and 
perhaps it may soon be more so for the public, I 
cannot do it. We remain unsupported by troops, unsupplied with many essential articles, and uncovered 
with works ; and, what adds to the unhappiness, is 
the little prospect that our affairs will speedily be in 
a better channel. For, with regard to troops, General 
Scott is not arrived, nor do I know when he may be 
expected, for I have not had a line from him since 
he was ordered this way ; but, from the best informa 
tion I can obtain, if he comes at last, he has not 
more than four hundred men now fit for duty. 

That is all we are encouraged to expect from Vir 
ginia, which, with those here from that State, will 
amount to between six and seven hundred ; from 
North Carolina, we have about one hundred and fifty 
Continental troops. More may not be expected from 
them, excepting militia. What number of those may 
be sent is uncertain ; and, indeed, unless they serve 
for a longer time than the last (namely, three months 
from the time they entered this state, a time too 
short, either to learn the duty, or to be inured to 
the fatigues of the camp), little may be expected 
from them. With regard to this State, they have not, 
in their five regiments, seven hundred men fit for 
duty ; and we have no reason to expect that their 
number will be much augmented, considering the 
aversion the people have for the service here ; or that 
any permanent force will be brought by them into 
the field. For, after solemn debate in the House of 
Assembly, they resolved, that the militia should not 
be drafted to fill up the Continental battalions, and 
that the militia, when in the field, should not be under the Continental articles of war ; and refused, on 
the recommendation of Congress, to raise any black 
corps. The Georgia battalion does not amount to onehundred men in the whole ; they are not in a capa 
city to keep that number up, for they have no legis 
lative power in the State. The militia, therefore, are 
not properly organized, nor can be ; they come out at 
their own option, and return at their discretion. 

Thus, Sir, you see the state of our force, and ourexpectations. We are very deficient in many neces 
sary articles, such as ammunition, tent-cloth, blankets, 
clothes, c. This arises, in a great measure, from a 
large proportion of the vessels being taken, which 
were sent out hence for the public, and from others 
coming to a bad market. 

This town, which is the magazine of the State, and 
which, for that and many reasons, claims the atten 
tion of the enemy, and to possess themselves of which 
is among their first objects, is in a very defenceless 
situation. The works about it, begun, are not finished ; many more are necessary to be constructed, but 
from the want of negroes (the only laborers in this 
country), the matter is neglected. They have been 
sent for into the country, but, from some defect in 
the law, they are not brought in. 

Fort Moultrie, on Sullivan s Island, six miles from 
the town, supposed to be the key of the harbour, is 
in a very decayed state, and without a ditch, pick 
ets, or abatis to it. The repairs of that, also, are delayed from the same cause. Two floating batteries 
have been recommended to cover the bar, and they 
would undoubtedly answer the most valuable purpose, 
as no heavy ship can come over it, unless they take 
out their guns, or they are so much careened as 
they cannot work them. These, also, though indispensably necessary to the safety of the harbour, are 
unprovided. 
By this short state of affairs, you will see what 
little expectations there are., that we shall be able to 
make any considerable defence, in case any thing 
serious is attempted here by the enemy. Besides, if 
they should attack the town, I think they will at 
tempt to amuse us in the back parts of the country, 
and keep those people at home ; indeed, there has 
been a late attempt to seize our magazines at Ninety Six and Camden. A very considerable number 
of men got in arms, but their designs were fortu 
nately discovered, and many of them are taken. Yet 
the combination is alarming, and requires particularattention, considering what great proportion of the 
back inhabitants of these States are unfriendly and 
indifferent to the cause. 

I have frequently, and, I think, faithfully, represented these matters to Congress, and to this State ; 
and have endeavoured to convince them, by every argument in my power, that this State also was surely 
an object which claimed the attention of Britain, 
and policy, as it would affect us, and interest, would 
stimulate her to attempt the subjugation of it. We 
have about one thousand Continental troops in this 
State, and at Augusta, in Georgia. The Virginia dra 
goons and infantry are at Augusta. They were sent 
there on our retreat from before Savannah, in order 
to give confidence to the inhabitants and the militia 
of the country, and to be some check on the unfriendly, and the Indians. The second, third, and 
fifth South Carolina battalions, and part of the artil 
lery, are at Sheldon, opposite Port Royal Ferry, and 
between thirty and forty miles from the Savannah, 
as a cover to the country, while the people take in 
their crops, and remove their stock, which should be 
done immediately. The first and sixth battalions are 
at Fort Moultrie, and the North Carolina troops in 
this town. 

As soon as it shall become necessary, I mean to 
collect the Continental troops to a point, and to 
leave the well-affected militia to cover the back part 
of the country. They will render more service there 
than in garrison. The militia in the vicinity of 
Charleston will be called in to its aid. I have re 
quested the State to provide some secure place, pro 
perly supplied with provisions, as an asylum for the 
aged, the infirm, the women, and children ; that, in 
case of a siege, we may have no useless mouths in 
town, or any circumstance which would induce a 
more early surrender, or add to the absolutely necessary distresses of a siege. 

I think this town might be defended against a 
very formidable attack, if all was done for its secu 
rity which ought to be done. For it is situated on a 
peninsula our lines in the rear of it are about half 
a mile in length, and will soon have in front of 
them, at the distance of a musket shot, a fosse, in 
which the water wilL be retained six or seven feet 
by dams, one towards Cooper, and the other towards 
Ashley River ; this completed, and the necessary 
works about the town finished, and the floating bat 
teries provided, we should not be easily insulted, 
with a proper garrison and magazines, I am, my 
dear General, with the warmest sentiments of regard 
and esteem, unalterably yours, 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 
FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GATES. 

Providence, 8 November, 1779. 

SIR, 

Thursday night I had the honor to receive yourExcellency s letter of the 1st instant, and immedi 
ately gave orders for moving the Continental troops 
over the bay to Greenwich; but, the weather proving 
so very stormy the whole day, that could not be ef 
fected before Saturday evening. I came myself that 
night to Providence, and gave orders for Jackson s 
regiment, stationed here, to march this morning for 
Plainfield ; if the weather continues tolerable, I have 
no doubt but the whole will reach Hartford Saturday. 
I have advised with those who are the best acquainted with the different routes at this season of the 
year ; they all prefer that by Hartford, upon account 
of the facility of passing the ferries, and the good 
ness of the roads that way. 

I shall bring with me only four pieces of light 
brass field artillery, and propose leaving what is 
called the park, here, with a small guard to take 
care of it. If your Excellency wishes more to be 
brought forward, it may be easily done after the re 
ceipt of your farther orders. I am, Sir, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

HORATIO GATES. 



FROM COLONEL BRODHEAD. 

Pittsburg, 10 November, 1779. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I am honored with your favor of the 18th ultimo. 
The honorable notice you have been pleased to take 
VOL. n. 30 
of my little expedition, fills my mind with the warmest gratitude, and I hope to merit your future esteem. 

It is some time since I inclosed to the honorable 
Board of War a return of the troops under my command, and of the articles of clothing necessary for the 
respective corps, to render them tolerably comfortable 
during the ensuing winter. The troops have received 
a small supply of money, and I expect they will 
be contented, until more can be procured from the 
treasury. 

An expedition against Detroit, in the winter season, 
will doubtless put us in possession of the enemy s 
shipping, and, of course, give us the command of 
Lake Erie. Winter expeditions are generally attended 
with great loss of horses and cattle, except where 
large magazines of forage are laid in, and can be 
transported. But the British garrison and shipping 
will be a full compensation for every loss of that 
kind, and, indeed, every difficulty we can meet in the 
obtaining it, as it will likewise secure the future 
tranquillity of this frontier. 

I will endeavour to, have every thing in perfect rea 
diness, and procure the best intelligence that circum 
stances will admit. I believe a considerable number 
of Indians will join me ; but I have little expectation 
of supplies, except from the French settlement in the 
vicinity of that post ; and, as the British yearly cause 
the inhabitants to thresh out the grain, and sell to 
them for the purpose of filling their magazines, little 
dependence can be placed on receiving supplies from 
them ; and the Indians, on the Biver St. Lawrence, 
subsist chiefly on animal food. I have frequently 
applied to the Board of War for supplies and trinkets 
for the Indians, but fear it is not in their power to 
procure them. I will, however, renew my application. 
It is with great pleasure I hear of the destination 
of his Excellency Count d Estaing, and I have a happy 
presage that he will have the most ample success. 

I herewith remit a return of the cannon and mili 
tary stores belonging to these garrisons, and an esti 
mate of the cannon and military stores necessary for 
the intended expedition, to the best of my judgment. 
My best intelligence, at present, is, that the enemy 
have erected a very strong work, near to the old fort, 
and on the only commanding eminence, behind the 
soldiers gardens ; that the garrison consists of threehundred regulars (some say more), and about the 
same number of militia ; some of the latter description, 
it is said, will join our troops on their arrival in that 
neighbourhood. The Wyandots, Tawas, Chippewas, and 
Pottawattomies, live in the vicinity of Detroit, and 
many of them are, without doubt, under British in 
fluence. 

If the expedition cannot be prosecuted before the 
month of February, it will then be too late, on ac 
count of the high floods to which the intermediate 
country is subjected. Should it prove impracticable 
to carry on the expedition against Detroit, the troops 
under my command, with some volunteers, in my 
opinion, might be advantageously employed on an ex 
pedition against the Shawanese, on the Miami River, 
and from thence against the enemy s post at Natchez, 
with very little or no additional expense, and return 
early in the spring to march against Detroit. For I 
apprehend no danger to this frontier during the win 
ter season, and the troops will be healthier, if con 
tinued in action, than in these garrisons. 

A couple of French gentlemen, of good address, 
would be very serviceable in this district, and espe 
cially on an expedition. I shall be happy to hearfrom you, and receive further instructions. I have 
the honor to be, with the highest sentiments of re 
spect and esteem, your Excellency s 

Most obedient and most humble servant, 

DANIEL BRODHEAD. 

P. S. I am this moment informed that two thou 
sand Indians, who were driven from their towns, are 
in great distress, and live on the pittance afforded 
them by the enemy at Niagara. This intelligence 
is from Sandusky, and may be relied on. They in 
form the other Indians that they are afraid to hunt, 
on account of the Americans. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

West Point, 14 November, 1779. 

SIR, 

Your Excellency undoubtedly has frequently had 
under consideration a proper position for winter-quarters. It is not always in the power of a General to 
take a position most favorable to his wishes, on ac 
count of provision and forage, or to place himself in 
the most advantageous point of view for covering the 
country and securing his capital posts. A certainty 
with respect to provision and forage is an object of 
the first consideration in taking a position. All in 
ferior evils, of whatever nature, may, in some sort, be 
remedied by foresight and precaution; but there is 
no contending with hunger. Therefore, what would 
be considered only as secondary objects in some cases, 
become principals here. 

In the choice of a position, we must pay some re 
gard to the enemy s collected force, and to our divided condition, in which the army must of necessity 
be cantoned. The enemy now appear to be putting 
their troops into winter-quarters ; but it cannot be 
supposed they will remain inactive all winter, if we, 
by the manner of cantoning the army, open to them 
an opportunity of insulting us to advantage. The 
mischievous consequences of having our quarters beat 
up, in the dead of winter, cannot readily be foreseen. 
That it would be their duty and interest to lay hold 
of such an opportunity, nobody can deny; and that 
the character of the General, and many national cir 
cumstances, lead to the supposition, must be agreed 
to. It is necessary, therefore, to take a position which 
.will secure us from a surprise, and have as much 
force together as possible, to free us from insult. The 
place where, and the force necessary, to these ends, 
are the two capital points to decide upon. 

The command of the North River is an object of 
such importance, that the force and supplies neces 
sary for this purpose must be had at all events. The 
force requisite for these garrisons, I suppose, has been 
very judiciously calculated by General Duportail; and 
I imagine there cannot be any great variation from 
his report. 

Your Excellency will find, after detaching a proper 
force for this place, a covering party for the State 
of Connecticut, and the other necessary guards for 
King s Ferry, stores, and posts of communication, 
your force will be greatly inferior to that of the enemy ; and it will be growing more and more so as 
the service of the soldiers expires. It will be necessa 
ry, therefore, to endeavour to remedy, by the strength 
of ground, the deficiency of force. 

I have no doubt but that every State bordering 
upon the enemy, will apply for a proper force, to 
30* 
protect them against their ravages. To comply with 
these demands, will hazard the safety of the whole 
army. Divide your force,, and you will fall a prey 
in every quarter; and, I am persuaded, were you to 
adopt the plan which would be most flattering to the 
wishes of the people, it would be so far from affording them that protection and security which they 
promise themselves, that it would become one of the 
principal causes of the enemy s making inroads, and 
committing depredations upon them. 

There can be but two modes of cantonment, to 
prevent the enemy from disturbing us in quarters. 
One is, to keep such a force together as to bid defiance to all their menaces ; the other is, to disperse 
the troops in such a manner as to afford no object. 
The first is infinitely the most favorable to disciplineand economy. To disperse the troops among the 
inhabitants, will be attended with a certain loss of 
discipline to the soldiers and a general corruption of 
manners among the people. They will mutually debauch each other. Besides these disadvantages, the 
expense and waste of stores will be nearly double, 
and a great addition to the list of Staff Officers (al 
ready too numerous from the state of our money) 
will be found necessary. For these, and many other 
reasons too obvious to need explanation, dispersing 
the troops should be avoided at all events. 

Whatever covering is given to any part of the 
country, except where the principal force is stationed, 
should be so calculated as to be able to check the 
enemy s small ravaging parties, and yet not be an 
object worthy any considerable movement of theirs. 

From the representation of both the CommissaryGeneral and the Foragemaster-General, I find yourExcellency will be obliged to quarter the troops in 
New Jersey. The great consumption of forage, that 
has taken place in this State for five months past, 
will render it very difficult to provide for this garrison, and the different posts of communication. 

In cantoning the troops and drawing supplies for 
their subsistence, it may not be amiss to have an eye 
to the affair of next campaign. The expense and difficulty of transportation from the Western States, yourExcellency is perfectly acquainted with. You are 
also sensible that the long tract of barren country, 
through which the supplies must come, will only ad 
mit of a certain quantity of transportation; therefore 
I conceive, that good policy points out the necessity 
of keeping as many stores in reserve in this State 
as possible. This is necessary, not only to be prepared for any emergency that may happen from the 
enemy s turning their force against the Eastern States, 
but to have a magazine in readiness for a secret 
purpose, which your Excellency hinted to me a few 
days since. 

The further we move our main force to the westward, and still be within supporting distance of this 
garrison, the better, both for the preservation of the 
provision and forage of this State, as well as to les 
sen the general expense of transportation. And the 
greater stock of provision and forage we can leave 
in this State, and upon the communications, the less 
difficulty we shall find in giving support to this 
place, should the enemy approach it. I should re 
commend, therefore, to quarter the army as far wesir 
ward as Morristown or Baskingridge. The country is 
strong, secure from a surprise, happily situated to re 
ceive supplies of provisions and forage, and not very 
inconvenient for giving protection and cover to the 
inhabitants. It is true, it is considerably removed 
from this place. But were we to take a position at 
Suffern s or Pompton, the consumption of forage would 
be so great that it would destroy the possibility of 
keeping up a communication with the Western States, 
however pressing the necessity, before the grass sea 
son. Suppose the enemy should move up, early in 
the spring, and lay siege to West Point, and the 
supplies of this State prove unequal to our support, 
should we not be obliged to abandon it to its fate ? 

There is another objection to the Suffern s or Pompton position, which is, the advantage it gives the 
enemy of dividing our attention, by taking post at 
King s Ferry. It will be impossible for us to deter 
mine which is their object, the camp or West Point; 
and it will be almost as dangerous to expose ourcamp as these garrisons, especially early in the 
spring, when we have all our baggage about us, and 
no possibility of moving it off. If we take a position 
near Morris, we can always tell, by the motions of the 
enemy, what is their object; and, having our camp 
in a secure situation, should they turn their force to 
wards this place, we can march to its relief in such 
force as to give certain support, and at the same 
time leave our camp in perfect security. 

The fortifications here are so strong, and the garrison will be so numerous, that I think we have but 
little to fear, either from a surprise or storm ; and 
therefore we have only to guard against an investi 
ture or siege. 

As the enemy have the advantage of a w r ater transportation, and the spring is the most difficult part of 
the year for a land conveyance, it is most probable, 
if they have any designs upon this post, they will 
commence their operations before the grass season. 
Will it not be worth while, therefore, to form a small 
magazine of provision and forage, at or near Mr. Erskine s Iron Works, for the purpose of subsisting the 
army on their march to this place ? And another 
considerable magazine of provision and forage at 
Chester or Warwick for the support of this army in 
whatever position it may take for the relief of this 
garrison? These magazines should be formed from 
the westward, in the winter season, when there is 
the least call for transportation, and the roads the 
most favorable for the purpose. 

I imagine there will be great interest made for 
the eastern troops to be posted on the east side of 
the North River, to favor their recruiting. These 
reasons have something plausible in them, but I have 
my doubts with respect to their truth and reality. 
Men, when they are near home, are much more influ 
enced by domestic attachments than they are when 
they are at a great distance. The friends and rela 
tions of the soldiers very seldom use their influence 
to engage them in the service. On the contrary, 
they commonly make use of every argument to dissuade them from it. I am of opinion, therefore, the 
further the troops are removed from home, the more 
favorable it will be to the recruiting service in camp. 

There is but one reason for cantoning the eastern 
troops on the east side of the North River; and that 
is, they are more convenient to receive their State 
stores. But this is so trifling a consideration, that it 
ought to have no weight, when it is opposed to so 
many more important considerations. 

My present opinion favors the following disposition 
of the troops for winter-quarters. The garrison here 
should consist of Patterson s, Learned s, Clinton s, and 
the North Carolina brigades, which, I believe, will form 
a force sufficient for the purpose. If the horse is 
posted in Connecticut, as seems to be thought on, I 
think the troops coming from Rhode Island, in con 
junction with the horse, will form a sufficient covering party for the exposed parts of Connecticut and 
Westchester. I would only wish Clinton s brigade to 
be here, because it may interest the inhabitants to 
furnish supplies in the winter, and to encourage the 
militia to turn out with spirit, should the enemy make 
a sudden move towards the post. The connection be 
tween the army and country will have an influence 
in both these respects. 

The Delaware regiment can furnish guards for 
King s Ferry, and the stores at Ilingwood, should 
your Excellency think proper to establish a magazinethere. I mention this regiment for this service, be 
cause it seems to be unconnected with any brigades ; 
or, at least, the Maryland brigades are complete with 
out it. 

The rest of the troops I would quarter, as before 
mentioned, somewhere not far distant from Morris or 
Baskingridge, according as wood and water may favor 
a position. 

Should the enemy make any considerable detach 
ments from New York, a larger covering party may 
be necessary for the State of Connecticut, as I should 
have more apprehensions of their committing depredations, if they detach, than if they do not; for then 
they will have nothing left but to play the small 
game. 

The earlier the position is fixed upon, the better 
for quartering the army. I wish your Excellency, 
therefore, as soon as you have decided in your mind 
the places and force requisite for each side of the 
North River, and the garrison for these fortifications, 
would please to acquaint me therewith, as it will 
be a more perfect guide to niy conduct, in making 
the preparations for cantoning the army. I am, with 
great respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

NATHANAEL GREENE. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GATES. 

Hartford, 15 November, 1779. 

SIR, 

In obedience to the orders contained in your Ex 
cellency s letters of the 1st and 2d instant, I marched the whole of the Continental troops from the 
State of Rhode Island, and arrived yesterday morning, with the first division, consisting of a detach 
ment of Colonel Crane s artillery, with two six-pound 
ers, Colonel Livington s, Colonel Jackson s, and Colonel 
Webb s regiments, at Hartford. The second division, 
consisting of the rest of Colonel Crane s, with the 
like artillery, Colonel Greene s, Colonel Angell s, and 
Colonel Sherburne s regiments, will be here this evening. As I find no orders here, and have not received 
any letter from your Excellency since that dated the 
2d instant, I shall encamp the troops, and wait yourfurther commands. I am, Sir, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

HORATIO GATES. 



FROM GOVERNOR JEFFERSON. 

Williamsburg, 28 November, 1779. 

SIR, 

Your Excellency s letter, on the discriminations 
which have been heretofore made between the troops 
raised within this State, and considered as part of 
our quota, and those not so considered, was delivered 
me four clays ago. I immediately laid it before the 
Assembly, who thereupon came to the resolution I 
now do myself the honor of inclosing to you. The re 
solution of Congress, of March 15, 1779, which you 
were so kind as to inclose, was never known in this 
State till a few weeks ago, when we received printed copies of the journals of Congress. It would be 
a great satisfaction to us to receive an exact return 
of all the men we have in Continental service, who 
come within the descriptions of the resolution, to 
gether with our State troops in Continental service. 
Colonel Cabell was so kind as to send me a return, 
of October, 1779, of the Continental regiments, commanded by Lord Stirling, of the 1st and 2d Virginia 
State regiments, and of Colonel Gist s regiment. Be 
sides these, there are the following ; Colonel Harrison s regiment of artillery, Colonel Baylor s horse, 
Colonel Eland s horse, General Scott s new levies (part 
of which are gone to South Carolina, and part are 
here), Colonel Gibson s, regiment stationed on the Ohio, 
Heath s and O Hara s independent companies at the 
same stations, Colonel Taylor s regiment of guards 
to the Convention troops. Of these we have a re 
turn; there may possibly be others riot occurring to 
me. A return of all these would enable us to see 
what proportion of the Continental army is contri 
buted by us. 

We have, at present, very pressing calls to send 
additional numbers of men to the southward. No in 
clination is wanting, in either the legislative or ex 
ecutive powers, to aid them, or strengthen you ; but 
we find it very difficult to procure men. I herewith 
transmit to your Excellency some recruiting commissions, to be put into such hands as you may think 
proper, for reenlisting such of our soldiery as are 
not engaged already for the war. The act of Assem 
bly, authorizing these instructions, requires that the 
men enlisted should be reviewed and received by an 
officer, to be appointed for that purpose ; a caution 
less necessary in the case of men now actually in 
service, and therefore doubtless able-bodied, than in 
the raising new recruits. The direction, however, goes 
to all cases, and therefore we must trouble your Ex 
cellency with the appointment of one or more officers 
of review. Mr. Moss, our agent, receives orders, which 
accompany this, to pay the bounty money and re 
cruiting money, and to deliver the clothing. We have, 
however, certain reason to fear he has not any great 
sum of money on hand ; and it is absolutely out of 
our power, at this time, to supply him, or to say, 
with certainty, when we shall be able to do it. He 
is instructed to note his acceptances under the drafts, 
and to assure payment as soon as we shall have it 
in our power to furnish him, as the only substitute 
for money. Your Excellency s directions to the officer of review, will probably procure us the satisfac 
tion of being informed, from time to time, how many 
men shall be reenlisted. 

By Colonel Matthews, I informed your Excellency 
of the situation of Governor Hamilton and his companions. Lamothe and Dejean have given their pa 
roles, and are at Hanover Court-IIouse. Hamilton, 
Hay, and four others, are still obstinate. They, there 
fore, are still in close confinement, though their irons 
have never been on since your second letter on the 
subject, I wrote full information of this matter to 
General Phillips also, from whom I had received let 
ters on the subject. I cannot, in reason, believe that 

VOL. II. 31 
the enemy, on receiving this information, either from 
yourself or General Phillips, will venture to impose 
any new distresses on our officers in captivity with 
them. Yet their conduct, hitherto, has been most suc 
cessfully prognosticated, by reversing the conclusions 
of right reason. 

It is, therefore, my duty, as well as it was my 
promise to the Virginia captives, to take measures 
for discovering any change which may be made in 
their situation. For this purpose I must apply for 
your Excellency s interposition. I doubt not but you 
have an established mode of knowing, at all times, 
through your Commissary of Prisoners, the precise 
state of those in the power of the enemy. I must, 
therefore, pray you to put into motion any such 
means as you may have of obtaining knowledge of 
the situation of the Virginia officers in captivity. If 
you shall think proper, as I could wish, to take upon 
yourself to retaliate any new sufferings which may be 
imposed on them, it will be more likely to have due 
weight, and to restore the unhappy, on both sides, to 
that benevolent treatment, for which all should wish. 
I have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem 
and respect, your Excellency s 

Most obedient and most humble servant, 

THOMAS JEFFERSON. 



FROM THOMAS NELSON. 

York, 28 November, 1779. 



MY DEAR GENERAL, 

Your kind favor of the 26th of last month, by 

some means reached me only a few days ago. I am 

greatly obliged by your concern for my health, which 
is perfectly restored. The confinement absolutely necessary for a member of Congress, who pays the at 
tention he ought to the great concerns of this Con 
tinent, is totally inconsistent with my constitution. 
It was with reluctance that I left Congress at the 
time I did; but my disorder, brought on and increased by a sedentary life, compelled me to do so. I am 
never so well as when I take upon me the soldier. 
It may be asked, why I do not engage seriously in 
that line. Believe me, when I tell you, that I have 
often lamented my not taking the field with you 
at the commencement of this war, and there is a 
punctilio at this time that prevents it. To enter 
in a subordinate rank would not suit my own feelings ; and to take rank of the worthy officer who had 
seen the brunt of the war, would wound his feelings, 
and show a want of generosity in myself. 

You have heard, before this day, of our misfortunebefore Savannah. The disappointment was increased 
by our great certainty of success. Some of our allies, 
who suffered in that affair, are now in this town in a 
very sickly condition indeed. The , one of the 

seven ships that were to winter in this Bay, is arrived with about three hundred land forces. The 
others, it is imagined, have borne away for the West 
Indies. Count d Estaing is certainly gone to Europe. 

Our Assembly has been sitting some time, and, 
about a fortnight ago, appointed a Committee of 
Ways and Means, to consider of measures for complying with the requisitions of Congress, as well as 
to support our own credit. I think I may venture 
to say, there will be not the least doubt of both 
being effected by taxes and loans. Congress may 
rely on her quota of money from this State, which, 
I hope, will quickly restore her credit. Never was 
America in more danger than at this time. The 
Continental treasury exhausted; internal commotions 
in some of the States; differences in Congress re 
specting the back territory claimed by Virginia., which, 
I fear, will be attended with serious consequences. 
It was determined, yesterday, to put all the officers 
and soldiers, who are citizens of this Commonwealth, 
upon the same footing with those in the Virginia line. 
A motion has been made to give the same quan 
tity of land to the officers and soldiers belonging to 
those States that have no back territory, as is pro 
vided for our own troops; but, to my great sorrow, 
it failed. I think it would have been but just, arid 
I am sure it would have been politic. The injury 
done to America, if those troops should quit the service, will be as great as if the Virginia line should 
quit it ; for, although I may not think those States 
have the least claim upon our back lands, yet I 
think the officers and soldiers should all be upon an 
equal footing, having, indeed, equal services; and to 
compel the States, so circumstanced, to purchase these 
lands for their troops, is subjecting them to a burden 
which they ought not to bear. I distinguish between 
the citizens of those States and the troops. The for 
mer cannot, upon any principle of justice, insist upon 
that country being thrown into the common stock, 
towards defraying the expenses of the war ; but the 
latter may complain of great injustice done them, 
when they see such a difference made between them 
and their fellow-soldiers, who have all engaged in 
the general defence of the States. Accept my sincere 
wishes for a continuance of your health, an object 
in which no one thinks himself more interested than 
Your friend and obedient servant, 

THOMAS NELSON, JR. 
FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SULLIVAN. 

Pompton, 1 December, 1779. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

Perhaps there was never more justice in any ad 
vice than that given by the philosopher to his prince, 
namely, "Always beware of the man that flatters you, 
and appears to coincide with your sentiments on all 



occasions." 



I am confident that I have never appeared to yourExcellency in this character; nay, I have studied to 
avoid even the appearance of being a flatterer. I 
knew, at the same time, that your Excellency, as 
well as all others in high office, had those animals 
constantly courting your favors ; and, I confess that 
I have sometimes felt an uneasiness, lest my neglect 
of expressing those sentiments of esteem and affec 
tion which I really felt should be construed into a 
want of cordial esteem for that Commander, to whom 
America stands so much indebted. Conscious, how 
ever, of my own sincerity, I contented myself with 
yielding a cheerful obedience to all orders your Ex 
cellency was pleased to honor me with; not doubting 
that some future period might discover in whose 
bosom the most lively sentiments of friendship andesteem were lodged. But, as my present state of 
health almost forbids me to hope for the honor of 
serving again under your command, your Excellency 
will excuse me in declaring that I have ever felt 
those exalted sentiments of esteem and affection for 
you, that even your sincerest friend can boast. My 
public and constant declaration has been, and I now 
repeat, that, in my opinion, you are the saviour of 
this country ; and that to your fortitude, bravery, and 
31* " 



36G LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

steady perseverance, do we owe the independence and 
freedom we enjoy. 

This I say, to remove any doubts that may have 
arisen respecting my friendship and affection ; and I 
should now have avoided it, did not my own feelings 
too strongly indicate that I can never have the plea 
sure of again serving under your Excellency s command. 

You will please to pardon this long and (I daro 
say) to you tedious introduction to something more 
interesting. Permit me, then, to inform your Excel 
lency, that the faction raised against you in 1777, 
into which General Conway was unfortunately and 
imprudently drawn, is not yet destroyed. The mem 
bers are waiting to collect strength, and seize some 
favorable moment to appear in force. I speak not 
from conjecture, but from certain knowledge. Their 
plan is to take every method of proving the danger 
arising from a Commander who enjoys the full and 
unlimited confidence of his army, and alarm the people with the prospect of imaginary evils; nay, they 
will endeavour to convert your virtues into arrows, 
with which they will seek to torment you. 

This plan was adopted the last winter ; and, if you 
will take the trouble of reading Mr. Tudor s oration, 
delivered at Boston in March last, you will find every 
line calculated to answer this purpose. The words 
are Tudor s, but the thoughts are borrowed. I heard 
them thrown out long before they were by him laid 
before the public. 

Here I cannot help digressing to congratulate yourExcellency on your compelling them to attack yourvirtue, and not putting it in their power to point out 
a single vice. 

The next step is to persuade Congress that the 
military power of America should be placed in threeor four different hands; each having a separate quarter of the Continent assigned him ; each commander 
to answer to Congress only for his conduct. This, 
they say, will prevent an aspiring commander from 
enslaving his country, and put it in the power of 
Congress, with the assistance of the other command 
ers, to punish the attempt. This is a refinement in 
politics, and an improvement on public virtue, which 
Greece or Rome could never boast. 

The present time is unfavorable to their design. 
They well know, that the voice of citizens and sol 
diers would be almost unanimously against them. 
But they wait a more favorable opportunity, whicli 
they will certainly improve. I am well convinced 
that they cannot succeed; yet I thought it my duty, 
in the moment of my departure, to give your Excel 
lency this notice, that you may not only be on yourguard, but avoid intrusting those in matters where 
your interest and honor are nearly concerned. Ap 
pearances may deceive even an angel. Could you 
have believed, four years since, that those adulators, 
those persons so tenderly and so friendly used, as 
were Gates, Mifflin, Reed, and Tudor, would become 
your secret and bitter, though unprovoked enemies? 
If we view them now, we cannot help lamenting the 
want of sincerity in mankind. I persuade myself 
that your Excellency s steady and prudent conduct 
will baffle every attempt, and I feel happy in having 
discharged my duty to the best of commanders ; and 
only beg leave to assure your Excellency, that, in 
whatever station fortune may place me in future, no 
man will be more ready to bestow the rewards due 
to your Excellency s disinterested zeal, bravery, fortitude, and perseverance, than, dear General, your Ex 
cellency s 

Most obedient and devoted servant, 

JOHN SULLIVAN. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LORD STIRLING. 

Baskingridge, 9 December, 1779. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have your Excellency s favor of this date, on the 
subject of the movement of the Virginia troops. I 
should have been very happy to have continued the 
command of them, as they are an excellent body of 
men, and, among the officers, many valuable men for 
whom I have the greatest esteem ; but, in all arrangements of the army, I have always been content 
with the commands that have been allotted to me, and 
I do not doubt I shall have reason to be so in the 
future arrangements. However pleasing the command 
of the Southern army might have been to me, the 
very great esteem I fyave for General Lincoln would 
prevent my entertaining a wish to take it out of his 
hands. Besides his abilities, the knowledge he has 
acquired of that country points him out as the fittest 
officer for that command, and I am happy he is con 
tinued in it. Whatever commands your Excellency 
may commit to my care, you may be assured will be 
executed with cheerfulness and faithfulness; and that, 
with much sincere affection, esteem, and regard, I 
have the honor to be your Excellency s 

Most obedient, humble servant, 

STIRLING. 
FROM GOVERNOR JEFFERSON. 

Williamsburg, 16 December, 1779. 

SIR, 

I take the liberty of putting under cover to yourExcellency, some letters to Generals Phillips and 
Riedesel, uninformed whether they are gone into 
New York or not, and knowing that you can best 
forward them in either case. 

I also trouble you with a letter from the Master 
of the Flag, in this State, to the British Commissary 
of Prisoners in New York, trusting it will thus be 
more certainly conveyed than if sent to Mr. Adams. 
It is my wish the British Commissary should return 
his answer through your Excellency, or your Com 
missary of Prisoners, and that they should not pro 
pose, under this pretext, to send another flag, as the 
mission of the present flag is not unattended by cir 
cumstances of suspicion, and a certain information of 
the situation of ourselves, and our allies here, might 
influence the measures of the enemy. Perhaps yourCommissary of Prisoners can effect the former modeof answer. 

I inclose to you part of an act of Assembly, as 
certaining the quantities of land which shall be al 
lowed to the officers and soldiers, at the close of the 
war, and providing means of keeping that country 
vacant which has been allotted for them. 

I am advised to ask the attention of your Excel 
lency to the case of Colonel Bland, late Commander 
at the barracks in Albemarle.* When that gentleman 
was applied to, to take that command, he attended 

* Colonel Bland had commanded at Charlottesville, after the arrival 
of the Convention troops at that place. See " The Bland Papers,"edited by Charles Campbell, pp. 1-29. 
the Executive here, and informed them, that he must 
either decline it, or be supported in such a way as 
would keep up that respect which was essential to 
his command, without, at the same time, [sacrificing] 
his private fortune. 

The Executive were sensible, that he would be ex 
posed to very great and unavoidable expense. They 
observed that his command would be in a department 
separate from any other, and that he actually relieved 
a Major-General from the same service. They did 
not think themselves authorized to say what should 
be done in this case, but undertook to represent the 
matter to Congress, and, in the mean time, gave it 
as their opinion that a decent table ought to be 
found for him. On this he undertook the command, 
and, in the course of it, incurred expenses which 
seem to have been unavoidable, unless he would 
have lived in such a way as is hardly reconcila 
ble to the spirit of an officer, or the reputation of 
those in whose service he is. Governor Henry wrote 
on the subject to Congress. Colonel Bland did the 
same ; but we learn .that they have concluded the 
allowance to be unprecedented and inadmissible in 
the case of an officer of his rank. The Commissaries, 
on this, have called on Colonel Bland for reimburse 
ment, A sale of his estate was about to take place. 
when we undertook to recommend to them to sus 
pend their demand till we could ask the favor of 
you to advocate this matter with Congress, so far as 
you may think it right ; otherwise the ruin of a very 
worthy officer must inevitably follow. I have the ho 
nor to be, with the greatest respect and esteem, yourExcellency s 

Most obedient and most humble servant, 

THOMAS JEFFERSON. 
FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Morristown, January, 1780. 

SIR, 

The situation of my department has been, for a 
long time, peculiarly embarrassed. My greatest soli 
citude and efforts have scarcely satisfied the common 
exigencies of the service ; and I have the mortifica 
tion to find that, in spite of all my endeavours, the 
difficulties are every day increasing. 

I have repeatedly mentioned to your Excellency, 
for some months past, that the supplies of money 
furnished the department were very unequal to the 
current expenses. I have all along flattered myself 
that affairs would take a new and more favorable 
turn. As Congress were deliberating upon the sub 
ject of finance, I was led to believe that the schemes 
and plans they were adopting would afford more 
ample relief; and have encouraged the agents, under 
such an expectation, to proceed in the execution of 
the business. They have been enabled to extend 
their credit thus far, so as to keep the wheels in 
motion, hoping not to fail until government could 
find ways and means for furnishing us with cash 
more adequate to the demands. 

But whatever grounds I supposed there were for 
authorizing such expectations, I now find they were 
vain and nugatory. The cloud thickens, and the 
prospects are daily growing darker. There is now 
no hope of cash. The agents are loaded with heavy 
debts, and perplexed with half-finished contracts, and 
the people clamorous for their pay, refusing to pro 
ceed in the public business unless their present demands are discharged. The constant run of expenses, 
incident to the department, presses hard for further 
credit., or immediate supplies of money. To extend 
one, is impossible ; to obtain the other, we have not 
the least prospect. I see nothing, therefore, but a 
general check, if not an absolute stop, to the pro 
gress of every branch of business in the whole department, I have little reason to hope that, with the 
most favorable disposition in the agents, it will be 
in our power to provide for the occasional demands 
of the army in their present cantonments; much less, 
to have in readiness the necessary apparatus, and 
supplies of different kinds, for putting the army in 
motion at the opening of the campaign. My apprehensions of a failure in these respects are so strong, 
and my anxiety for the consequences so great, that I 
feel it my duty once more to represent to your Ex 
cellency our circumstances and prospects. From such 
a view of our situation, you may be led not to ex 
pect more from us than we are able to perform, and 
may have time to take your measures consequent 
upon such information. 

I know not whether government can command such 
sums of money as are necessary for the current ex 
penses of the nation ; but it is a folly to expect that 
this expensive department can be long supported on 
credit. A further attempt would only bring ruin and 
distress upon ourselves, without affording any sub 
stantial advantage, either to the public or the army ; 
and, therefore, I think it highly necessary, as all mili 
tary movements are under your immediate direction, 
and as the affairs of this department are intimately 
connected with all the active operations, that you 
should have a right understanding with Administra 
tion, with respect to the support they can give. 
in executing the measures you may think proper to 
take. 
There is no deficiency in the resources of the 
country. On the contrary, I have authentic reasons 
to conclude the country is more plentifully stored 
with every material necessary for the provision and 
support of an army, than it has been for three years 
past. The defect lies in a want of proper means to 
draw them into public use. I cannot see how a re 
medy will be applied to this evil in the present ma 
nagement of finance. The wretched state in which 
that is involved, creates HCAV obstructions, and an ac 
cumulation of expenses in every branch of the department. 

Hitherto our principal difficulty has arose from a 
want of proper supplies of money, and from the inefficacy of that which we obtained ; but now there 
appears a scene opening which will introduce new 
embarrassments. The Congress have recommended to 
the different States to take upon themselves the furnishing certain species of supplies for our depart 
ment. The recommendation falls far short of the 
general detail of the business, the difficulty of ad 
justing which, between the different agents as well 
as the different authorities from which they derive 
their appointments, I am very apprehensive will intro 
duce some jarring interests, many improper disputes, 
as well as dangerous delays. Few persons, who have 
not a competent knowledge of this employment, can 
form any tolerable idea of the arrangements neces 
sary to give despatch and success in discharging the 
duties of the office, or see the necessity for certain 
relations and dependencies. The great exertions 
which are frequently necessary to be made, require 
the whole machine to be moved by one common in 
terest, and directed to one general end. How far the 
present measures, recommended to the different States, 

VOL. IT. 32 
are calculated to promote these desirable purposes, I 
cannot pretend to say; but there appears to me such 
a maze, from the mixed modes adopted by some 
States, and about to be adopted by others, that I 
cannot see the channels, through which the business 
may be conducted, free from disorder and confusion. 

It would be a folly for me to attempt to change 
the general disposition of mankind, or to flatter my 
self with the hopes of a different conduct from those 
who may be employed in the various branches of the 
department, than what is known to influence and 
govern men. If experiments are necessary, I have 
not the least objections to their being made ; but I 
cannot agree to be responsible for the consequences. 
If government is distressed, and these expedients are 
requisite for her relief, my aid shall not be wanting, 
during my stay in the department, to give them a 
fair and full operation ; but I cannot say that I think 
they will either answer the expectations of the pub 
lic, or prove competent to the demands of the army. 

It cannot be more disagreeable to your Excellency 
to receive, than it is to me to make, so unfavorable 
a representation. I have left no steps unattempted, 
that appeared calculated to put affairs on a more 
prosperous footing; and I have hoped that every 
succeeding account would be more promising than the 
last. I should betray my trust, were I to amuse yourExcellency with hopes and encouragements; and I 
beg that this description of my department may not 
only be considered as justly drawn, but dictated by 
motives of duty, and aiming at the advantage of the 
public. I am, with great respect, 
Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

NATHANAEL GREENE. 
FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LINCOLN. 

Charleston, 8 January, 1780. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

I was, a few days since, honored with your Excel 
lency s favor of the 26th of October last, by Lieuten 
ant-Colonel Ternant. I am too fully convinced of the 
utility of the new regulations, not to afford him every 
countenance and assistance in my power; and it will 
be my greatest attention to have the troops in this 
department formed on the plan adopted for the order 
and discipline of the army of the United States. 

I hear, but have no official notice of it, that the 
Virginia line are ordered from the main army, to reenforce this department. If this should prove true, 
it will be fortunate indeed for this country, and, I 
think, exceedingly so for the United States and the 
cause in general ; for it is such an attention to the 
safety of this people, that, if ever an idea has been 
formed and nourished among them that they were 
neglected by Congress, it must now be removed; be 
sides the security it will afford to this State and 
Georgia. 

By the last accounts I have received from Savan 
nah, the enemy seem to be alarmed by the move 
ments of the Spaniards ; and, towards the end of the 
last month, sent off the sixty-eighth regiment to St. 
Augustine, and, some say, another small corps. What 
has been the fate of Mobile and Pensacola, is uncertain; by some accounts, we have reason to believe 
that they are in the hands of the Spaniards. This I 
have from a number of deserters ; and it is since con 
firmed by Mr. Cowen, one of our officers who was 
lately exchanged and left Savannah. I think there 
cannot be a doubt but that such a report prevails 
there but what gave rise to it, I know not. Though 
I have not so full evidence in favor of the report, as 
gives me satisfaction respecting the truth of it, yet 
I have thought it necessary and my duty to give 
your Excellency this hint. 

While I congratulate your Excellency on the suc 
cess of the arms of the United States, in the depart 
ment more immediately under your direction, I have 
to lament that so little has been done here, that we 
have nothing for our consolation, but that we have 
not permitted the enemy to run away with us. I 
have tlie honor to be, with the highest esteem, 
Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 



FROM ELBRIDGE GERRY, IN CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 12 January, 1780. 

SIR, 

The requisitions to the several States for reenforcements to the army, proposed in your letter of the 
18th November last, are not yet adopted by Con 
gress, and a fresh application from your Excellency 
appears to me necessary for promoting that important 
business. A report has been long since made on the 
subject, and been several times under the considera 
tion of Congress ; but an opinion has been lately 
suggested, and I fear with too much effect, "that the 
number of men enlisted for the war is already suffi 
cient, and that reinforcements are not necessary for 
the army in this quarter." Should this sentiment 
prevail, or the requisitions be much longer delayed, 
we shall probably lay the foundation of an inactive 
campaign, if not of greater misfortunes ; and renew 
the uneasiness of the Court of France, who last yearremonstrated in very friendly, but expressive terms, 
against the delays of our military preparations for 
that campaign. As the measures of our good ally 
for the establishment of our independence, as well as 
those of the common enemy against it, are prose 
cuted with the greatest vigor, it appears to me that 
we are urged by every principle of policy, generosity, 
and honor, to be equally vigorous and decisive, and 
I have been thus induced to trouble your Excellency 
on the subject. 

I hope that the measures taken and such as are 
under the consideration of Congress, for obtaining 
supplies of provisions, will effectually relieve the 
wants of the army, which, I confess, distress me ex 
ceedingly. I am, Sir, with every sentiment of respect 
and esteem, 

Your most obedient and humble servant, 

ELBRIDGE GERRY. 



FROM JOHN ARMSTRONG. 

Carlisle, 12 January, 1780. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

The present distressing aspect of our public affairs 
compels me to add to your Excellency s present trou 
bles the reading of the following lines. About this 
time I hoped to have heard of your being in Phila 
delphia, and fully intended writing at some greater 
length than the haste of the bearer will now admit. 

I need not take up the train, much less the 
causes, of our present most critical and dangerous 
situation. The flames of political destruction are en32* 
kindled all around us, and have made their formida 
ble progress but too obvious even to common reflec 
tion; nor have I ever separated the great public con 
cern from, that peculiar degree of anxiety, which 
must possess your mind, on the languishing state of 
our finance. On the subtile subject of finance, iny 
pretensions are truly small; but on the necessity of 
some different measures from any yet adopted, what 
man can shut his eyes ? To say nothing of the vari 
ous aerial schemes which have been thrown out, onething is clear, that even such as have been tried, 
from their show of more reason and solidity, either 
from their being inadequate in their nature, or too 
late in their application, have palpably failed of the 
effect. For some time past we have resembled a pa 
tient far gone in disease, given up by his physicians, 
and left to the mere efforts of nature. Now, whether 
we shall proceed in this same natural, or rather 
slothful and timid way, leaving our internal commerce to regulate itself, and take chance for the 
event, or attempt the plain highway of law and pub 
lic authority, in the regulation of prices generally, 
appears to bo the question, and that without an al 
ternative that can promise success. 

The latter, however degraded by merchants, or ex 
ploded by some politicians of more refined senti 
ments, if I have any opinion at all, is the better, 
if not the only fundamental means of our political 
recovery. I know there are powerful objections to 
this doctrine of regulation of prices by law, or rather 
they are powerfully made; for, at this time I must in 
truth declare, I think their whole operation imperti 
nent, inconclusive, and lost in the superior force of 
those arguments, which inevitably result from the 
present circumstances of this country ; whereby the 
great law of necessity is now clearly introduced for 
the trial of a legal regulation of prices, and must, at 
least, fully justify the experiment. I know the grand 
difficulties, as well as the niceties attending such 
regulations, must lie in the execution and penalties 
of this law. Hard they may be, but ought not to 
be supposed insurmountable. True, the virtue of the 
populace is very low, but not altogether extinct, the 
latent remains whereof must yet instrumentally save 
us. If so, how are we to animate these remains, when 
the natural springs thereof are so much relaxed ? 
No other probable, or perhaps possible w r ay, but by 
the salutary stimulus of public authority, and the en 
couragement they may derive from a near prospect 
of peace, or at least of retrenching the extra ex 
penses of the civil staff of the army, which would 
naturally lead to some further observation; I mean 
such as arises on the remarks, sentiments, and tem 
per of many people far out of your sight and hearing. 

But now Colonel Davis waits with impatience, and 
obliges me to conclude. Your Excellency will easily 
conceive my design, in these hasty lines, arises from 
a wish that your helping hand may be put to this 
business, although out of your strict sphere of action, 
as it is to be apprehended that different sentiments 
on politics may obstruct the measure. I am, with 
great truth and respect, your Excellency s 

Most obedient and affectionate humble servant, 

JOHN ARMSTRONG. 

P. S. I could sincerely wish the policy of Virgi 
nia, respecting their Land-Office and extent of terri 
tory, were otherwise timed, and more disinterested. 
FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LORD STIRLING. 

Elizabeth town, 16 January, 1780. 

SIR, 

I have the honor to inform your Excellency that 
early yesterday morning the corps under my command crossed the sound at Do Hart s Point, and pro 
ceeded towards the watering place. The enemy having received previous intelligence of our movements, 
a surprise was out of the question ; and as their works 
Avere well situated, and appeared otherwise strong, an 
assault was deemed unadvisable, as it would probably 
have cost us more than we could have gained by 
success. We found, too, contrary to our expectation, 
that the communication between the Island and New 
York was open. 

Immediately on our arrival in front of the enemy s 
works, they sent off a boat to the city and in the 
evening several vessels came down from thence to 
the Island. As, from this circumstance, there was no 
hope of reducing them, for want of provision or 
fuel, and a reenforcement might have rendered ourcontinuance dangerous, we determined to march off 
this morning. The retreat was effected in good or 
der, and with very little loss. A party of the en 
emy s horse charged our rear-guard, under Major Ed 
wards, but was immediately repulsed. The Major had 
three men killed, and killed one of the light horse 
men, and took his horse. Some of the men were 
frost-bitten, and, though we took all the pains in ourpower to have all those unable to march transported 
in sleighs, yet I imagine a very few may have been 
left behind. We took a few prisoners, and had a 
few deserters from the enemy. 
Immediately after crossing, a party was detached 
under Lieutenant-Colonel Willett, to Decker s Point. 
The corps there had been alarmed, and barely madeits escape. The house (as a garrison place), and 
eight or nine small vessels near it, were burnt. A 
considerable quantity of blankets and other stores 
were found. 

While the troops were upon the Island, a number 
of persons from this side took advantage of the 
occasion to pass upon the Island, and plunder the 
people there in the most shameful and merciless 
manner. Many of them were stopped on their re 
turn, and their booty taken from them; in addition 
to which, I have sent an order for publication, re 
quiring those who had eluded the search, to restore 
the articles in their possession, and exhorting the 
good people at large to assist in detecting them. All 
the soldiery, on re-crossing the ice, were searched, 
and the little plunder they had, taken from them ; 
and their names noted, that they may be brought to 
punishment. The articles recovered are and will be 
deposited with the Reverend Mr. Caldwell (who is 
exerting himself in the affair), to be returned to the 
owners. I am happy to inform your Excellency that 
a very inconsiderable part indeed of the troops dishonored themselves by participating in these enormities. 

The officers and men, in general, showed a good 
disposition; and I only regret there was no opportu 
nity of turning it to advantage. I have the honor 
to be, your Excellency s 

Most obedient and humble servant, 

STIRLING. 
FROM THE CHEVALIER 1)E LA LUZERNE, MINISTER FROM 
FRANCE. 

(Translation.) 

Philadelphia, 23 January, 1780. 

SIR, 

Advices recently received from Europe, make men 
tion of the efforts, which the English have made in 
Germany to procure recruits and new levies, and of 
the difficulty they have experienced, even on the part 
of those Courts with whom they have before treated. 
The greatest part of the German Princes, who have 
sold soldiers to the Court of London, now blush at 
these sales, which have excited their subjects against 
them, and which, besides, have drained their States. 
They are reluctant to give troops to a power that is 
making war against France, with whom they have 
always preserved amicable tics ; and I am. assured, 
that it is even doubtful whether the English will be 
able to procure a few recruits to complete the corps 
they have in America. 

I am informed that these circumstances have determined the British Government to make every effort 
to obtain men in America, whom they cannot procure 
in Europe \ and that Mr. Clinton has received orders 
to spare no pains to effect the exchange or deliver 
ance of the troops of the Convention of Saratoga, and 
of other prisoners who are in the hands of the 
Americans. It is added, that the want of the Court 
of London for soldiers is so pressing, that General 
Clinton has been authorized to surmount all the difficulties which may arise in the negotiation of this 
exchange; and that he is even permitted, in case of 
absolute necessity, to treat with Congress, or their 
Ministers, on terms of perfect equality, and as with 
an independent power. He has also equally full 
liberty to agree upon the number of private soldiers 
who may be given in exchange for an officer of any 
rank whatsoever ; and they order him simply to re 
member, in treating of this matter, that an English 
soldier, transported to America, is of an infinite price 
to England, and they exhort him to employ all his 
efforts to bring about an exchange, whatever may be 
the conditions. 

I hasten to communicate these interesting ideas to 
Congress ; and I have learned that they were confirmed by the event, and that Major-General Phillips had 
in effect drawn on a negotiation, the progress of 
which had been entirely confided to your Excellency. 
They prayed me, at the same time, to send you a 
communication of these objects, which the Congress 
think ought greatly to influence the measures which 
it will be in your power to take, when you know 
that the English Commissioners have orders to pass 
over all difficulties, and to grant all the demands 
which may be made, rather than to lose the occasion 
of reenforcing the army they have upon this Continent, 

I join to this some extracts, the contents of which 
have appeared to me of a nature to interest yourExcellency. You will see, besides, Sir, by the des 
patch of the British Minister, with what affectation 
he seeks to make the Thirteen States to be consi 
dered as subjected to the English domination, and you 
will judge of what importance it is to you to treat 
with the Court of London upon the footing of per 
fect equality, and how useful an act of this nature 
may be to the negotiations of Congress in Europe, 
when they can add to all the facts, of which the 
Court of Madrid makes mention in its memoir, a cartel regulated on the footing of perfect parity, and 
which would prejudge, beforehand, the question of 
your independence. I congratulate myself that this 
negotiation is in your hands and I am well per 
suaded that nothing will pass derogatory to the part 
which my Court has taken, in acknowledging the 
independence and perfect sovereignty of the United 
States. 

I shall intrust to your Excellency, that the King is 
disposed to send over succours to this Continent, of 
arms and ammunition ; but, as the events of the sea 
are uncertain, I believe that it will be proper to make 
no change in the measures which may have been taken 
otherwise to procure them. This news not having 
reached me till yesterday, I have not yet been able 
to make a communication of it to Congress. 

As you may be retained in your quarters by important considerations, I propose to go to pay you my 
respects in the course of the next month, and con 
fer with your Excellency on objects of great import 
ance, and relative to the measures necessary to push 
the next campaign with vigor, and to put the Ame 
rican army in a condition truly proper to hold the 
enemy in check upon the Continent, whilst his Ma 
jesty and the King of Spain shall display, in the 
other parts of the world, all their forces, to secure 
advantageous terms of peace to the allies. 

I am, with respect, Sir, 

LUZEIIXE. 

P. S. This letter will be delivered to your Excel 
lency by M. de Gal van, who has been raised to the 
rank of Major by your goodness. He desires to 
merit it anew, and prays me to solicit you to put his 
zeal in activity. I shall be very grateful for what 
you may be pleased to do for him. He was particu 
larly recommended to me by the Minister of France. 
He appeared to me to merit a great deal from his 
zeal, and from his personal attachment to your Ex 
cellency. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LINCOLN. 

Charleston, 23 January, 1780. 

MY PEAR GENERAL, 

I had, a few days since, the honor of your favor 
of the 12th ultimo, by Colonel Laurens, announcing 
that the Virginia line were ordered to this depart 
ment, than which nothing could be more acceptable, 
saving that of their not being needed. Their speedy 
arrival is an event most ardently wished for. 

By our late accounts from Philadelphia, and from 
a large ship being seen off this bar on the 10th, 
with troops on board, said to be from New York to 
Savannah, we are led to believe that the enemy will 
be early reenforced in Georgia. From that idea, and 
from a belief that this town will be the object which 
will claim their first attention, I have requested the 
Governor of this State to order into Augusta a num 
ber of his militia, to relieve the Continental troops 
there; all of which I mean to draw, as soon as possible, into such post as will facilitate their being 
thrown suddenly to a point. 

I find myself greatly embarrassed to know what 
ground to occupy; for, if we draw them into this 
town or its vicinity, and the enemy should attempt 
the same route as the last year, we shall lose the 
advantages of opposing them at the several strongpasses between this town and the Savannah. If we 

VOL. ii. 33 
should throw the troops near that river, from an idea 
that the enemy will cross it, and instead of that they 
should take shipping, and land between us and this 
town, they will shut us out of it; the consequence 
of which would, I think, be its loss. Besides, if we 
keep the troops near this town, and the enemy should 
land northward of the bar, they will, in that case, 
probably reach Haddrel s Point before us, and there 
by Fort Moultrie will be in danger. If we divideour few troops, there will be danger that w r e shall 
be beaten in detachment. 

It is, my dear Sir, among my first misfortunes, that 
I am not near enough to your Excellency to have 
the advantage of your advice and direction. But this 
I cannot enjoy. I feel my own insufficiency and 
want of experience. I can promise you nothing but 
a disposition to serve my country. If this town 
should be attacked, as now threatened, I know my 
duty will call me to defend it as long as opposition 
can be of any avail. I hope my inclination will co 
incide with my duty. 

If the enemy mean seriously to attack this town, 
I think, previous thereto, they will have their emis 
saries in the back part of this country to stimulate 
the Indians, and the unfriendly, to acts of hostility. 
We have, therefore, to guard against their baneful in 
fluence as much as possible. For this purpose, it is 
necessary that we at all times keep a body of men 
in arms near the inland frontiers. I have requested 
the Governor of North Carolina, immediately on the 
attack of this town, to embody a number of militia, 
and march them towards the frontiers of his State, 
where there are many disaffected people ; as they 
would not only quell any disturbance there, but, in 
case they should not be needed for that purpose, 
they might march this way, and serve as a ree nforcement to us. 

Two of ours, and the French frigates, are going out 
to see what discoveries they can make. They would 
have gone sooner, but the French ships had not 
water over the bar, and ours were out of repair. 

I have requested the Governor of Virginia to or 
der shoes, stockings, and other clothing to be sup 
plied the troops on their march, and that he would 
forward clothing here for their future supply. I wish, 
if you approve of the application, that you would 
support it. 

I am very sorry that Colonel Laurens, after waiting a number of days, could not get a passage by 
water as he expected; for thereby, my letter to you, 
instead of being the first, was long detained, and the 
consequence was that you received the information of 
our raising the siege before Savannah from Congress, 
when you ought to have had it from me. Though I 
was in hopes that I had given too great evidence of 
my attachment to you, to believe that it was from a 
designed neglect, yet I could not so fully rely on the 
candor of the world, and was afraid that it would be 
construed to my disadvantage, and that some might 
attempt to persuade your Excellency that I have not 
really that attachment and esteem which I have al 
ways expressed. I hope no such attempt has been 
made, for nothing could be more injurious. 

24:(/i. Since I began this letter, what was before 
conjecture, is now nearly reduced to a certainty ; 
namely, that the enemy mean a descent on this 
State, which probably will happen soon. Yesterday, 
a vessel was decoyed into this harbour, by a tender 
to our Continental frigates, bound from New York to 
Savannah, in company with a fleet of about ninety 
sail, bound to that port, convoyed by the followingships, namely; three seventy-fours, three sixty-fours, 
one fifty-four, one forty, and one frigate ; the Europe, 
Russel, Roebuck, Robust, Renown, Defiance, Romulus, 
and Perseus. She was separated from the fleet off 
Cape Hat-terns, in a storm, about twenty days since. 
She has on board a few bales of clothing, some furniture, &c., but the whole, as it is said, of inconsider 
able amount. Passengers in her, one Lieutenant and 
one Ensign in the British service, besides other pas 
sengers; and five privates in Robinson s corps. 

This news has induced me to write to Governor 
Jefferson and Governor Caswell, requesting them to 
give every possible assistance to facilitate the march 
of the troops ordered from the main army to reenforce this. I have the honor to be, my dear General, with the greatest regard and esteem, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL ST. CLAIR. 

Crane s Mills, 28 January, 1780. 

SIR, 

I arrived at Colonel Hazen s quarters the night be 
fore last; and yesterday, with him, visited the several posts, which I found to bo Rahway, Crane s Mills, 
Connecticut Farms, Elizabethtown, and Newark. Elizabethtown and Newark are occupied by small detach 
ments only, and guards are posted at De Hart s and 
Ilalstcd Points. A small guard is also kept at the 
New Blazing Star from the post at Rahway. 

In this situation the troops are as compact as, I 
believe, the nature of the cantonment will allow, con 
sistently with the objects in view; yet they are farfrom being so much so as could be wished. The 
distance these different places lie from one another, 
and the want of horse to communicate speedily any 
movements of the enemy, render it very easy to surprise one or other of the posts, particularly Railway, 
which is only two miles from the Sound, and lies 
five miles from hence and five miles from the Blazing Star. The small detached guard at that place 
may be very easily taken off; and then their flank, 
and even their rear, is entirely open. 

To cover effectually such an extent of country as 
from Newark to Arnboy, in the present state of the 
ice, would require a very considerable body of troops; 
and the dispersing them in small bodies exposes them 
to many accidents, and greatly favors desertion, which, 
with much regret, I find has prevailed on these 
commands. 

In Elizabethtown I found a four days guard, con 
sisting of one hundred men with a Field-Officer. 
This I reduced to a Captain and fifty, to be relieved 
daily, which I thought would answer every purpose 
that could be expected from the hundred, as they 
may, when on for one day only, be kept constantly 
alert, and half of them at a time patrolling during 
the night. Indeed, I believe good patrols would 
answer every purpose better than small guards; but, 
where the distance betwixt posts is considerable, they 
should be composed of horse. The guards at De 
Hart s and Halsted Points are certainly much ex 
posed, and if the enemy suffer them to remain, it 
must arise from extreme caution, or their having 
something of more importance in contemplation, for I 
cannot suppose they want information of our position. 
33* 
I have not yet been able to ascertain the enemy s 
number on Staten Island, or at Paulus Hook, but 
expect to-day to have pretty good accounts of the 
last, as also of the state of the ice on both the North 
and East Rivers 5 but from all that I can learn, and 
from the intelligence Colonel Hazen has received, 
their numbers on the Island amount to two thousand 
and upwards. The reinforcement, thrown in from 
New York, consisted of three regiments, supposed 
about seven or eight hundred men ; part of them are 
cantoned, and part encamped about the middle of the 
Island. Intelligence is, however, very difficult to be 
obtained, and is not, in my opinion, in a good train; 
the person who seems to be most depended upon 
bearing a very bad character, and known to act as 
an agent for the enemy. Indeed, it will be almost 
impossible to get it into another train, unless the in 
tercourse betwixt the inhabitants and the Island can 
be prevented ; nor can a stop be put to the traffic 
carried on with the city, unless some other way of 
rewarding those we employ be fallen upon, than 
countenancing it in their favor. 

Nothing has yet presented itself to induce any 
attempt upon the enemy which should at least 
have probability in its favor. Their advanced picket 
at Mills might be taken off, but it is a tri 

fling object, and the retreat of the party might be 
prevented. If any thing is to be done on the Island, 
it must, I believe, be by open force, which they seem 
to expect, as, from the information of a deserter, 
they are improving their works, and adding abatis, 
and keep their troops as close to them as possible. 
They are also constructing a new work with timber, 
on a hill that commands the redoubt at the watering 
place. There is, at present, an open passage to New 
York, but it is frequently interrupted by the driving ice. 

Doctor Burnet expected a trusty, intelligent person 
from New York last night, and I shall see him to 
day. By him I expect the information your Excel 
lency wishes with respect to the East River, and the 
situation of the enemy s vessels. If it favors Colonel 
Willett s enterprise, I shall desire him to wait upon 
your Excellency immediately. I find, by an order of 
General Tryon s of the 13th, that a number of ba 
teaux are to be laid up at De Nuys s Ferry, at the 
Narrows. 

I suppose Colonel Hazen has informed your Excel 
lency of the attempt the enemy intended upon the 
detachment at Rahway, on Wednesday last, which 
was prevented by Colonel Gray s having obtained 
some notice of it. I cannot help repeating that 
horse are much wanted to give any degree of se 
curity to the cantonments ; but, as one object is to 
cover and secure the inhabitants, they ought, some 
of them at least, to be furnished by the State, and 
if these were trusty, good men, acquainted with the 
country, they would make the best patrols possible. 
I believe, too, they would more effectually check the 
spirit of traffic than it will ever be done by the 
soldiery, who hold it, in some measure, a disrepu 
table employment. 

I wish I could give your Excellency any hint that 
might help to prevent or check the shameful desertion that prevails, and for which the troops of Penn 
sylvania, especially, have so little reason. It would, 
perhaps, answer a good end, whilst the ice continues 
firm, instead of detachments from the army, to send 
whole corps; the first to be taken from those lines 
where that vice has not crept in. By the time oneor two commands are completed, the communication 
will probably be more difficult. 

I have inquired, of every person I thought could 
give me proper information, into the causes of ourmisfortune at Newark and Elizabethtown, and it appears to have been owing to negligence in not having the patrols out in proper time, and to their having fatigued themselves too much the night before ; 
and it is certain, that the Captain had not a single 
vidette, nor even a sentry on the stable where his 
horses were. I am not quite satisfied whether yourExcellency intended a formal inquiry, or that I should 
inform myself in the manner I have done. Nothing 
further occurs at present. If any intelligence of mo 
ment arrives, it shall be immediately communicated, 
and I will detain Colonel Hazen until I hear from 
your Excellency. I have the honor to be, Sir, 
Your most obedient servant, 

ARTHUR ST. CLAIR. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL WAYNE. 

Wayncsborough, 4 February, 1780. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

I was so unfortunate as not to be acquainted with 
the intended attempt upon Staten Island ; otherwise 1 
certainly would not wish to be absent. But the mis 
fortune I most regret is, that nature had not formed 
her bridge previous to the dissolution of the light 
corps ; for, be assured, w r e remained some days, wishing and anxiously waiting for that event, after the 
state of our magazines, together with your orders, 
rendered a separation inevitable. 

I am confident that your Excellency will do me 
the justice to believe that, if any opening had offered 
to strike the enemy with a prospect of success, and 
where the object would have justified the attempt, 
not one moment would have been lost in asking yourpermission and final direction. 

In addition to my former request respecting the 
command in the light corps, I beg to be employed 
on every occasion where your Excellency may think 
me worthy of trust, either as a volunteer, or in any 
other character that you may deem most conducive 
to the benefit of the service; and to believe me, with 
the truest esteem, your very affectionate, and 
Most obedient, humble servant, 

ANTHONY WAYNE. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Morristown, 7 February, 1780. 

SIR, 

The inclosed copy of a representation from Colonel 
Barry, an Assistant Deputy-Quartermaster-General in 
this State, will show your Excellency that a new 
difficulty has arisen to delay transportation. It is 
very unfortunate that we should lose the advantage 
of this favorable term of conveyance, as the time is 
just at hand when it will be almost impossible to 
bring forward the supplies. 

The inhabitants are unwilling to give their aid, at 
the prices regulated by law, unless the regulation 
extends through all the States. I do not consider 
myself authorized to instruct my agents to break 
over the laws of the State; and now find a stagna 
tion in bringing on the provisions. 

People will withhold their services in this State, 
as long as they receive a less compensation than 
their neighbours. They seem to claim it as a right, 
that they be allowed their usual prices until the 
other States adopt measures for enforcing a regula 
tion. I do not hear them object to have a limitation 
of prices take place ; but they insist upon its not 
being binding on them till it is so on others. YourExcellency can foresee the consequences of the present difficulty, and will direct and authorize me in 
what manner to proceed. I am your Excellency s 
Most obedient, humble servant, 

NATIIANAEL GREENE. 



FROM GOVERNOR JEFFERSON. 

Williamsburg, 10 February, 1780. 

SIR, 

It is possible you may have heard that, in the 
course of last summer, an expedition was meditated 
by our Colonel Clark against Detroit; that he had 
proceeded so far as^ to rendezvous a considerable 
body of Indians, I believe four or five thousand, at 
St. Vincent s ; but, being disappointed in the number 
of whites he expected, and not choosing to rely prin 
cipally on the Indians, he was obliged to decline it. 
We have a tolerable prospect of reenforcing him this 
spring, to the number which he thinks sufficient for 
the enterprise. We have informed him of this, and 
left him to decide between this object and that of 
giving vigorous chastisement to those tribes of Indi 
ans whose eternal hostilities have proved them inca 
pable of living on friendly terms with us. It is ouropinion his inclination will lead him to determine on 
the former. 
The reason of my laying before your Excellency 
this matter, is, that it has been intimated to me that 
Colonel Brodhead is meditating a similar expedition. 
I wished, therefore, to make you acquainted with 
what we had in contemplation. The enterprising and 
energetic genius of Clark is not altogether unknown 
to you. You also know (what I am a stranger to) 
the abilities of Brodhead, and the particular force 
with which you will be able to arm him for such an 
.expedition. We wish the most hopeful means should 
be used for removing so uneasy a thorn from ourside. As yourself alone are acquainted with all the 
circumstances necessary for well-informed decision, I 
am to ask the favor of your Excellency, if you 
should think Brodhead s undertaking is most likely 
to produce success, that you will be so kind as to 
intimate to us to divert Clark to the other object, 
which is also important to this State. It will, of 
course, have weight with you in forming your deter 
mination, that our prospect of strengthening Clark s 
hands sufficiently is not absolutely certain. It may 
be necessary, perhaps, to inform you, that these two 
officers cannot act together, which excludes the hopes 
of insuring success by a joint expedition. I have 
the honor to be, with the most sincere esteem, yourExcellency s 

Most obedient and most humble servant, 

THOMAS JEFFERSON. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL HEATH. 

Highlands, 10 February, 1780. 

DEAR GENERAL, 
In the following I shall give your Excellency a 
state of facts relative to the late capture of Lieuten 
ant-Colonel Thompson and part of his detachment, on 
the lines of this post, on the 3d instant. 

Lieutenant-Colonel Thompson was at that time at 
Young s, near the White Plains ; his detachment con 
sisted of five companies. Captain Watson, of the 
third regiment, with his company, was at Young s 
house with the Lieutenant-Colonel. Captain Roberts, 
of the fifteenth regiment, and Captain Stoddard, of the 
first regiment, were on his right ; their greatest distance about two miles. On his left were CaptainLieutenant Farley, of the ninth regiment, and Captain 
Cooper, of the fourteenth regiment ; their extreme 
distance rather greater than the companies on the 
right. Pickets were advanced from each. 

On the morning of the 3d instant, about nineo clock, the Lieutenant-Colonel was informed that a 
body of the enemy s horse were advancing, and, at 
that time, about two and a half miles distant. Ap 
prehending the enemy to be horse only, he determined to remain where he was, and sent to the several 
companies to join him. Soon after this, the enemy 
attacked his picket (a sergeant and eight men), who 
fired on the horse, which checked them. On which 
the picket attempted to join the body, but were over 
taken by the horse, one or two of them wounded, 
and the whole taken prisoners. Not long after, the 
enemy s horse appeared in sight of the house. The 
Lieutenant-Colonel had been joined by Captain Roberts s company, who formed on the right. The enemy s horse halted at a distance, and discharged their 
rifles. Soon after, the infantry appeared, advancing to 
the front and right flank of our troops, who were now 
joined by Captain-Lieutenant Farley s company on 
the left; Captain Stoddard and Captain Cooper coming up, one on the right, the other on the left. Our troops preserved their order, and did not fire until 
some time after the enemy began. When they re 
ceived orders to fire, the enemy immediately scattered, 
availing themselves of trees and the ground, of which, 
it must be acknowledged, they very judiciously took 
the advantage, springing from one tree and place to 
another, and constantly gaining ground ; their fire being directed both against the front and flank of our troops, and a number being killed and wounded, 
they broke, some retreating up the road, others into 
the house, from the doors and windows of which 
they fired on the enemy. 

At this time, Captain Stoddard and Captain Cooper 
came up ; the former gave the enemy two or three fires, but, the distance being great, probably did little 
or no execution. The horse, at this instant, were 
very active, and overtook several of our men who 
were making their escape. It is said our troops discovered great bravery, and fought well for about fif 
teen minutes, when the Lieutenant-Colonel was compelled to surrender. We had fourteen men killed on 
the spot, including Captain Roberts ; and seventeen 
wounded, three of w r hom are since dead. Lieutenant Colonel Thompson, of Marshall s, Captain Watson, of 
Greaton s, Captain Farley, of Wesson s, Lieutenant Burley, of Tupper s, Lieutenant Maynard, of Greaton s, 
Ensign Fowler, of Nixon s, and Ensign Bradley, of 
Sheppard s, with ninety non-commissioned officers and 
soldiers, w r ere taken prisoners ; nine of whom, w T ho 
were wounded, were left by the enemy at a house 
some miles down the road. 

The enemy set fire to Young s house, and soon re 
tired, leaving two dead, and carrying off their wounded; among whom was a Captain of grenadiers, w r ound
VOL. n. 34ed in the hip, and a Lieutenant of the infantry, in 
the thigh. Our troops immediately after went on to 
the ground, and buried the dead. The enemy s force 
is said to have consisted of about sixty horse, 

and forty of the refugees, and between four hundred 
and five hundred infantry, detached from different 
corps, including a part or the whole of the grenadier 
and light infantry companies of the guards. Colonel 
Enimerick was out as a volunteer, on foot, with his 
rifle, and was very active. Colonel Morton, of the 
guards, commanded the whole, and Colonel Delany 
was with the refugee horse. 

Ilih. By two deserters, who left Fort Washington 
a few days since, I am informed that the enemy had 
at that place about one hundred and fifty sleighs, 
when they came away. The sleighs were employed 
in hauling wood. I am just now informed, by Colonel 
Badlam, who is on the advanced post, that a body of 
three hundred of the enemy s horse (probably part of 
these militia), and the seventh British regiment, came 
the last Monday from -Long Island to Westchester on 
the ice, where they now are. Whether their takingpost at Westchester is with offensive or defensive 
views, is uncertain; probably both. I have written 
Brigadier-General Poor to hold his brigade in the 
most perfect readiness for action, have patrols on the 
ice of Hudson s River, against Peekskill, and from the 
guard at , down towards Eort Montgomery. 

Every precaution is in exercise; and I trust the enemy will be disappointed, should they attempt to surprise us. I have the honor to be, with the greatest 
respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

WILLIAM HEATH. 
FROM COXONEL BRODHEAD. 

Fort Pitt, 11 February, 1780. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I wrote you on the 10th and 22d of November, 
and on the 13th of December last, and not having 
been honored with a line in answer to either of those 
letters, I begin to fear you have not duly received 
them, wherefore I take the liberty to inclose dupli 
cates. I likewise inclose the proceedings of a General 
Court-Martial on the trial of Lieutenant Arthur Gor 
don, Adjutant of the ninth Virginia regiment, and a 
return of the provisions in store. 

I have not seen Colonel George Morgan since I 
came to this department; neither have I seen the 
Deputy Quartermaster-General since last March. I 
have not a tent for my men, and, by the inclosed 
return, you will see that the provisions are scanty ; 
but I hope to be better supplied in the spring. 

I have frequently given the most pointed orders 
respecting the public craft, notwithstanding which, 
the greatest part is, or will be, carried away with 
the ice. What I could retain at this place I did, 
and secured it by hauling it upon land. If the officers commanding at the different posts had taken the 
same care, little or none would have been driven off. 
Such a deep snow and such ice have not been known 
at this place in the memory of the oldest natives. 
Deer and turkeys die by hundreds for want of food. 
The snow on the Alleghany and Laurel Hills is fourfeet deep. 

By one of our prisoners, who lately made his 
escape from the Wyandots, and who has frequently 
been at Detroit, I am informed that the new fort 
erected there has two bomb-proofs of wood ; that the 
walls are very high, fifteen feet thick, and made of 
fascines and clay ; that the barracks are sunk some 
distance into the ground, and that their roofs cannot 
be seen from without; that it stands on a fine commanding piece of ground, with a gentle descent each 
way ; likewise that it is surrounded by a ditch twen 
ty feet wide. The garrison consists of four hundred 
and fifty regulars, and the enemy have eighteen hundred men at Niagara, besides a great number of In 
dians. If this intelligence is true, unless some di 
version is occasioned by troops marching up the Susquehanna River, it is not improbable that the enemy 
may pay us a visit down the Alleghany Paver next 
spring, and I have neither men nor cannon sufficient 
for this fort, unless a reenforcement can be spared 
from the main army. I shall, however, make the 
best disposition that circumstances will admit, and, if 
possible, gain further intelligence from the Dela wares, 
who continue their declarations of friendship for us. 

I beg your Excellency will indulge me with twenty 
boat-builders, and some armourers, early in the spring. 
If I receive no orders to the contrary, and can be 
supplied with craft, I am determined to drive the Shawanese over the Lakes, which I can do before provi 
sions can be furnished for a capital expedition. 

I shall now transmit an estimate of cannon and 
military stores to the Board of War, in hopes that, 
by the time they arrive at this place, I shall be 
enabled to do something worthy the confidence you 
have placed in me. With the most exalted regard 
and esteem, I have the honor to be, your Excellency s 
Most obedient and most humble servant, 

DANIEL BIIODIIEAD. 
FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LINCOLN. 

Charleston, 12 February, 1780. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

I have received information that, on the 3d instant, 
the enemy landed about eight thousand troops, commanded by Sir Henry Clinton. If this is true, we 
may soon expect them before this town; for they 
probably know that we soon expect reinforcements. 

Two o clock, P. M. I have just received informa 
tion that a large fleet is off. Matters are fast ripening, and will, I think, soon become very serious. 

Eight o clock. I am told that fifty sail of vessels 
got into North Edisto this day. 

February 13^, three o clock in the morning. By a 
person just from Edisto, I learn that the number of 
vessels in at the harbour there is a little short of fifty. 

I am collecting the troops, and posting them in 
and near this town, saving the light-horse, and two 
hundred light troops. Those are in the southern 
part of the State, left with a view to hang on the 
enemy s left flank, should they attempt to march 
across land, and prevent the small parties strolling 
into the country, plundering, and distressing the in 
habitants. I am, my dear General, with the highestesteem, 

Your most obedient servant, 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 



FROM COLONEL JOHN LAURENS. 

Charleston, 14 February, 1780. 

DEAR GENERAL, 
I should have done myself the honor of writing to 
you earlier, "but postponed my intention in hopes of 
obtaining satisfactory intelligence of the force and 
designs of the enemy in this quarter. Although my 
expectations are far from being answered, I must en 
treat your Excellency s acceptance of what I have 
been able to collect on those subjects, lest the ex 
pected siege prolong my silence beyond the proper 
bounds. 

The day before yesterday, we had certain intelligence of the arrival of forty-five sail at North Edisto. 
A debarkation immediately commenced on Shnmons s 
Island; and an advanced corps, it is said, of five 
hundred, proceeded the following day to John s Is 
land. The Vigilant and two galleys are at Port 
Royal. Private accounts say that General Prevost is 
left to command at Savannah; that his troops consist 
of the Hessians and Loyalists that were there before, 
reenforced by a corps of blacks and a detachment of 
savages. It is generally reported that Sir Henry 
Clinton commands the present expedition. It appears 
to me to be the British policy to transfer the thea 
tre of the war to this vulnerable part of the Con 
tinent ; and, should their Commander-in-chief be here. 
I hope you w r ill do him the honor to meet him. 
The command of your winter-quarters might very 
well be left to a Major-General, and the appearance 
of your Excellency, in person, would produce such 
effects as would decide the American contest. The 
Carolinians, as usual, have been superior to foresight 
and precaution. The delay of the enemy produced 
no other effect than to increase their supineness, and 
finally to introduce a disbelief of the enemy s inten 
tions. But they begin to be roused. 

My father desires his most respectful compliments 
to your Excellency and Mrs. Washington. He has 
been detained here by M. Durumain s having taken 
French leave. This gentleman, who commanded the 
French frigate in this harbour, engaged to accommo 
date my father with a passage to France, but previously undertook a cruise in company with our Ame 
rican frigates. As soon, however, as he had passed 
the bar, he made the best of his way for Europe. 
A brace of two-deckers and a frigate are constantly 
standing off-and-on our harbour; but my father is 
determined, at all hazards, to prosecute his voyage, 
and fulfil his engagements to the public. 

I preferred a hasty letter to a total silence ; yourExcellency will be so indulgent as to excuse me for 
it, and assure Mrs. Washington of my respects. I 
have the honor to be, with the greatest veneration 
and attachment, 

Your Excellency s faithful Aid, 
JOHN LAURENS. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LINCOLN. 

Charleston, 4 March, 1780. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

Sir Harry seems to be collecting his force on 
James s Island, and is there throwing up some works ; 
one among the ruins of Fort Johnson, another a lit 
tle to the westward of it. It is said that he is also 
throwing up a bomb-battery opposite the town. Drawing his principal force to this Island, hauling his gal 
leys and other armed vessels of small draught of 
water near the mouth of Wappoo, collecting a num 
ber of boats there, indicate that an attempt on the 
southerly part of the town, by boats, will be made. 
It is pretty evident that he means to introduce his 
ships into the harbour, which I find he may effect 
with more safety than I once supposed he could ; for 
our frigates, which it was thought could lie before 
the bar, so as to command the entrance of it, appearto draw too much water for the purpose, and cannot 
anchor with safety nearer to it than three miles, and 
there they are liable to be annoyed from the shore; 
and the channel is so narroAV that they cannot an 
chor in line of battle. It is the opinion of all the 
Captains of the ships, that they can render more 
essential services by lying abreast, and acting in con 
junction with Fort Moultrie, than by taking any 
other post. 

General Hogan s arrival, last night, gives great happiness and spirit to the garrison; for we were be 
fore, and are now, much too weak ; we have but very 
little support from the country militia of this State ; 
there are but about two hundred of them in town, 
and it will be with difficulty that they will be 
brought into it, notwithstanding the exertions of the 
executive. The spirit with which they are conducting themselves, your Excellency will learn by the 
inclosed proclamation. 

The southern part of the State is exposed to the 
immediate incursions of the enemy, and to the depredations of the Tories. This, at present, keeps a 
number of men in that part in arms, to protect their 
families and property, which they say cannot be re 
moved. In the middle part of the country most of 
the inhabitants are disaffected, and a fcAV days since 
were in arms, and killed a number of people. This 
forbids any troops being drawn from that part of the 
country; force might be sent into it. The frontiers 
of the State are obliged to arm to restrain the sa 
vages, and for the defence of themselves, and the upper part of Georgia. The Eastern Shore is left for 
the defence of Georgetown and the sea-coast. 

Governor Caswell has, in the most pointed terms, 
ordered on the whole of the late drafts of threethousand. About one third of them are arrived, and 
he has directed two thousand more to embody nearthe bounds of the northerly part of this State, to act 
in either State, as circumstances may require. I was 
in hopes General Scott would have been here before 
now, but I cannot learn that he has yet left Peters 
burg. 

Our works are constantly going on, and matters 
every day grow better. The people are recovering 
their spirits, and have now high expectations. I 
have the honor to be, my dear General, with the 
highest respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Morristown, 6 March, 1780. 

SIR, 

Inclosed I send your Excellency a copy of my 
last letter to Congress, to which they have given no 
answer, and which necessarily involves very import 
ant consequences. 

The affairs of the Quarter-master s department are 
so intimately connected with the operations of the 
army, and the security, support, and movements of 
the latter so dependent on the former, that I think 
it my duty to give your Excellency the earliest in 
formation of every change and embarrassment in it, 
which may affect the service. This measure is necessary, not only for the public welfare, but for my own 
justification. 

Although I esteem it a peculiar misfortune to be 
reduced to the necessity of taking steps tending to 
my own justification, yet when I have not that sup 
port which was promised me by the Committee of 
Congress, when I engaged in the duties of the office, 
and which was and still is necessary to the order 
and management of the business, I have nothing left 
but to point out the causes of the failure. And I 
trust, when my conduct comes to be fully understood, 
and the business of the department stripped of vulgarprejudices and private enmity, it will be found to 
have been both prudently and honestly conducted. I 
shall not enter into a justification of all the detail of 
the business. I know it is too extensive for the wis 
dom of an angel to guard against every imposition. 
I am not chargeable for such evils, where the mis 
fortune originates in the plan of the war and the 
state of the finances. Though I cannot pretend to 
be responsible for the fidelity, discretion and prudence 
of every agent employed in the lesser branches of 
business, yet I presume the much greater part of 
every order are men of integrity, and some of them 
are the first characters for business upon the Continent. One thing I will venture to affirm with con 
fidence, which is, that every exertion has been madeby all the agents to promote the service in general, 
and to fulfil your Excellency s orders in particular, 
as far as the means in their hands or their personal 
credit or influence could be extended for the purpose. 

The crisis is now fast approaching, when there will 
be a general stagnation of business, as some of the 
deputies have already left the department, and others 
preparing to follow their example. Some have advertised to stop all purchases on the public account, for 
want of money to fulfil the contracts ; others will be 
reduced by necessity to do the like. Transportation 
cannot be kept up for want of money to pay those 
employed in that service ; and even those teams, 
which serve with the brigades, begin to refuse further service, unless they are paid for the past. 

Thus we seem to be threatened with distress and 
ruin on every side. I shall continue to give every 
aid to the business in my power, but it must sink 
under its own weight, unless it is better supported 
than it has been for months past. I am, with great 
respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

NATHANAEL GREENE. 



FROM PHILIP SCHUYLER. 

Philadelphia, 6 March, 1780. 

SIR, 

In the letter, which I had the honor to address 
your Excellency on the 15th ultimo, from Saratoga, 
I proposed personally to have explained myself to 
Congress on the subject of the appointment of the 
21st of January last. But reflecting that, notwithstanding the entire confidence I entertain in the honor 
and candor of every individual member of Congress, 
it is nevertheless possible, that, through want of per 
spicuity in expressing myself, or misapprehension in 
others, what I may verbally deliver on the subject 
may be unintentionally construed, or repeated, in a 
manner widely different from my intentions, this 
consideration induces me to convey my determination 
in writing. 
Every reflection. Sir, I have made, since the re 
ceipt of your Excellency s letter of the 24th January 
last, on the appointment mentioned in it, has con 
firmed the conclusion I very early drew, that I could 
not, consistently with my honor and reputation, ac 
cept of any employment under Congress, in a station 
either less honorable or less important than that which 
I once had the honor to hold; and, when the circum 
stances which led to my quitting the army shall re 
cur to Congress, I trust they will acquiesce in the 
propriety of this determination on my part. 

I do not mean, Sir, to convey the most distant 
idea, that I solicit a restoration to the rank and 
place I held in the army ; for, although it is true 
that I quitted it with reluctance, and that I have 
often since lamented that I was drove to the neces 
sity of doing it, yet the delicacy I entertain with re 
spect to the feelings of others, who might possibly 
conceive themselves injured by a perfect restoration 
of my rank, added to other considerations, have in 
duced me to lay aside every wish for a roapp oint 
ment. But, Sir, as I am incapable of withholding 
any services my country may deem me capable of 
rendering ; as a reform in the civil departments of the 
army is of the highest necessity, and as Congress 
have thought proper to apply to me for my aid on 
the occasion, permit me to tender them an offer of 
my services, as a member of their House, on a Com 
mittee to consult with the Commander-in-chief, and 
the Heads of the several civil departments of the 
army, and to adopt such measures as will have a 
probable tendency to complete the great object of the 
resolutions of the 21st January. As a member of 
such a Committee, I should esteem it my duty to 
visit every part of the Continent, for the purpose of 
introducing good order and a proper economy, and 
should deem myself fully rewarded for every possible 
exertion, in the success of the business, and in the 
approbation of Congress. I am, &c. 

PHILIP SCHUYLER. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL ARNOLD. 

Philadelphia, 6 March, 1780. 

DEAR SIR, 

I am requested, by the Board of Admiralty, to in 
form your Excellency that they have in contempla 
tion an expedition with several of their frigates, which 
will require three or four hundred land forces to act 
in conjunction, and who may act as marines when on 
board, which will obviate the great difficulty of pro 
curing men for the ships. They wish to be informed 
if the men can be spared from the army. They will 
be wanted to embark (probably at New London) by 
the middle of April, for an expedition of about two 
months. If seamen can be drafted, they will be much 
preferable to other troops. 

From the injury I have received in my leg, and 
the great stiffness in my ankle, my surgeons are of 
opinion it will not be prudent for me to take a command in the army for some time to come. As I 
wish to render my country every service in my 
power, I have offered the Board to take the command 
of the expedition, provided it is agreeable to yourExcellency, and the men can be spared from the army; in which case, I shall soon have the honor of 
laying the plan before your Excellency, and believe 
you will think it an object of importance. 

I have just received a letter from Major ClarkVOL. ii. 35 
son, dated Charleston, January 30th, who writes me, 
that " the fleet which sailed from New York in De 
cember, are certainly arrived and arriving at Savan 
nah ; their force uncertain, but very large." Two 
of our frigates have captured a brigantine, with clothing, and two sloops, with dragoons of Lord Cathcart s 
legion, who have saved only two horses of forty-five. 
The fleet were dispersed in a few days after they 
sailed, and greatly injured by several storms. 

I suppose your Excellency will receive particularinformation from Congress. I have the honor to be, 
with great respect and esteem, your Excellency s 
Affectionate and obedient humble servant, 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 



March 20t/i. Dear Sir, The foregoing is a copy 
of a letter I did myself the honor of writing yourExcellency, which went by express the day it was 
wrote, from Colonel Mitchei s office. As a fortnight 
has elapsed, and I have not been favored with an 
answer, I conclude the letter has miscarried ; I there 
fore take the liberty of sending a copy. If the 
service will not admit of a draft of men from the 
army, the expedition must, of course, be declined, as 
there is not the least probability of manning the 
ships without; in which case, I must request of yourExcellency a leave of absence for the ensuing sum 
mer, or until my wounds are so well as to admit 
my riding and walking with some degree of ease, 
and, of course, being able to take the command of a 
division in the army. 

Your Excellency will believe I should not ask this 
indulgence, could I, with justice to myself or country, take a command in the condition I am at present. My surgeons flatter me that a voyage to sea, 
and bathing frequently in salt water, will be of great 
service in strengthening my leg, and relaxing the 
muscles, which are greatly contracted, and thereby 
rendering it more useful. 

Mrs. Arnold yesterday presented me with a son. 
She joins me in best respects to Mrs. Washington. I 
have the honor to be, very sincerely and affectionate 
ly, your Excellency s 

Most obedient and very humble servant, 

BENEDICT ARNOLD.* 



FROM PHILIP SCHUYLER. 

Philadelphia, 7 March, 1780. 

DEAR SIR, 

I arrived on Sunday, but did not take my seat in 
Congress until this morning, as I deemed it prudent 
previously to address them on the subject of their 
appointment of the 21st January, which I did by 
letter ; a copy whereof I have the honor to inclose 
for your Excellency s perusal. I believe there is a 
determination not to accept of any services I may be 
able to render them, in the line in which I have of 
fered them. Many here affect not to see the pro 
priety of the distinction I have drawn ; but I shall 
be satisfied if the candid and ingenuous, who are not 
always a majority, in or out of doors, shall discover 
that it is not one without a difference. 



* In a letter to Silas Deane, dated March 22d, General Arnold 
wrote; "I have proposed to the Board of Admiralty an expedition, 
which will require three or four hundred land forces, to act in conjunc 
tion with the ships. The matter rests with General Washington. If 
men can be spared, and my plan takes place, you will hear from me 
soon. If it should not, I propose going to Boston, with the intention to 
take the command of a private ship." 
The measure I proposed to General Greene, the 
moment before I parted with him, I learnt, on my 
arrival, had already been decided upon as unneces 
sary, and I was confidentially advised that it would 
be in vain to urge it. I must, therefore, forbear, 
however strongly impressed with its importance. 

I do not advise you of the intelligence from Caro 
lina, as General Lincoln will probably be more full 
on the subject than I can be. The Minister has a 
letter from an agent, in which he informs the former, 
that part of the British were destined pour Ics An 
tilles. 

I believe it will be necessary for General Greeneto address Congress very pointedly on the subject of 
the wagoners, as I find a disposition in many to 
have them drawn from the army. The reasons why 
they should not, if even the army would after all be 
sufficiently in force, will be obvious to him, and I 
wish him to adduce them fully, to corroborate what 
I shall deliver on the subject before his letter arrives. 

Our finances are completely deranged. A Committee 
of the Whole have had them under consideration, for 
some time before my arrival. They have been on 
the business to-day, without making any progress. It 
seems a paradox, that the whole should be more in 
competent than a part; but I am so perfectly per 
suaded of it, that I shall strive to get it referred to 
a few. I have thrown together my ideas on the sub 
ject. How they will be accepted I must leave to 
time; though I believe some good would result, if 
they were adopted. 

Be so good as to entreat your lady to accept of 
my best respects ; and to believe that I am most sin 
cerely, with those sentiments of affection and esteem, 
which afford an ingenuous mind the most sensible of 
all satisfactions, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

PHILIP SCHUYLER. 



FROM LIEUTENANT-COLONEL JOHN LAURENS. 

Charleston, 14 March, 1780. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

The enemy s present disposition of his force, and 
all his late operations, indicate a design to attack 
Charleston by a siege in form. To complete the in 
vestiture, he must introduce his ships of war into the 
harbour. That it is his intention, appears from his 
fixing buoys on the bar, barricading his ships waists, 
and anchoring them in a station where they may 
embrace the first favorable spring tides to enter. 
His transports and store-ships have removed from 
Edisto up Stono River, where they lie contiguous to 
Wappoo Cut, which is the water communication from 
thence to Ashley River. At a point of the main 
land, formed by the issuing of the former into the 
latter, he raised, in the course of a night, the llth 
instant, a battery of six embrasures. This situation, 
naturally advantageous, he will probably render very 
strong, and establish in it his deposit of military 
stores and provisions. He then may either force a 
passage over Ashley River, or turn it by a circuitous 
march, fortify a camp on the Neck, and open his 
trenches. The best communication between his maga 
zines and camp will be across Ashley River, from a 
bluff, marked Bull, in your large map. 

Your Excellency will have learnt that the Commo 
dore and all his officers renounce the idea of defend35*ing the passage of the bar ; they declare it impracti 
cable for the frigates to lie in a proper position for 
that purpose. The Government has neglected to pro 
vide floating batteries, which might have been sta 
tioned there j so that it has been agreed, as the next 
best plan, to form a line of battle, in such a manner 
as to make a cross-fire with Fort Moultrie ; a shoal, 
called the Middle Grounds, being on the right of the 
ships, and the fort advanced of the left. As it would 
be the enemy s policy, with a leading wind and tide, 
to pass the fire of the fort, and run aboard of ourships, the Commodore is contriving an obstruction, 
which he thinks will check their progress, and allow 
time for the full effect of our fire. 

The impracticability of defending the bar, in the 
first instance, appears to me a great diminution of 
our means of defence. We must not only have a 
greater number of shipping below, and consequently 
withdraw them from flanking the enemy s approaches 
on the Neck, but are subject to the chances of a 
combat, which, in the other case, were out of the 
question. The Commodore has destroyed one set of 
the enemy s buoys 5 and I hope he will cut away 
such as may have been since put down, and order 
the galleys to give all possible annoyance to the 
enemy s ships in the act of entering. 

The attention of the Engineers has been distracted 
by different demonstrations on the part of the enemy, and they have not perfected the line across 
Charleston Neck. Henceforward I hope they will 
confine themselves solely to completing it, and then 
proceed to the construction of some interior inclosed 
works, to prolong the defence. 

As the enemy is determined to proceed by regularapproaches, all his operations are submitted to calculation, and he can determine, with mathematical precision, that with such and such means, in a given 
time, he will accomplish his end. Our safety, then, 
must depend upon the seasonable arrival of such reenforcements as will oblige him to raise the siege. 
The Virginia line is much more remote than we 
could have thought it would have been, at this mo 
ment. Your Excellency, in person, might rescue us 
all. Virginia and North Carolina would follow you. 
The glory of foiling the enemy in his last great ef 
fort, and terminating the war, ought to be reserved 
for you. Whatever fortune attends us, I shall, to my 
latest moments, feel that veneration and attachment, 
which I always had for your Excellency; and I beg 
leave to continue to subscribe myself, 

Your faithful Aid, 

JOHN LAURENS. 

P. S. I entreat your Excellency s pardon for transmitting the annexed letter, in its present imperfect 
state. It was a sketch, which I intended to have 
put in better form, if time had permitted. 



FROM COLONEL ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 

Amboy, 17 March, 1780. 

DEAR SIR, 

I duly received your letter of the 14th, and shall 
not fail, in conjunction with General St. Clair, to 
attend to the military object of it.* I am much oblig
* General St. Clair, Colonel Carrington, and Colonel Hamilton had 
proceeded to Amboy on the 9th instant, to meet British Commission 
ers, for the purpose of settling a general cartel for the exchange of 
prisoners. Washington s Writings, Vol. VI. p. 483.ed to your Excellency for the communication of yoursouthern advices. The enemy are still in the dark 
about their fleet and army gone that way, as we 
gather from the Commissioners. They pretend to 
have little European news, though a vessel arrived 
two or three days since from England, after ten 
weeks passage. We send you some late New York 
papers. The Commission has been several days at an 
end. The enemy, as was supposed, had no idea of 
treating on national ground. We are now in private 
conversation, and so far not without hopes that the 
liberation of our prisoners will be effected on admissi 
ble terms. Two or three days more will probably put 
an end to the interview. General St. Clair and Colo 
nel Carrington beg their respects may be presented 
to your Excellency. I have the honor to be, very 
respectfully and affectionately, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 



FROM COLONEL BRODHEAD. 

Fort Pitt, 18 March, 1780. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

The savages have already begun their hostilities. 
Last Sunday, they killed five men at a sugar camp 
upon Raccoon Creek, in Youghiogany county, and 
took prisoners three girls and three lads. It is generally conjectured that the Delawares perpetrated this 
murder ; but it is possible it may have been done by 
other Indians. If the Delaware nation should declare 
against us, this frontier will be greatly distressed ; 
as many other nations, who have hitherto been neu 
tral, will join them, and my force is by no means 
sufficient to protect the settlements. I have inclosed 
to the Adjutant-General a return of the troops for 
the month of February, since which near to fifty men 
have been discharged from the ninth Virginia regi 
ment, and many more will expect their discharges 
very soon. 

I have lately been favored with a letter from Co 
lonel Clark, declaring his readiness to cooperate with 
me in any measure I shall undertake, either for the 
reduction of one of the enemy s posts, or against the 
Indian towns. He is now at the Illinois, and will be 
considerably reenforced in the course of this spring. 
He proposes throwing up some works at the mouth 
of the Ohio River. If your Excellency can possibly 
spare a small reenforcement of well-appointed regulartroops for this district, I will pledge my honor to be 
as active as circumstances and situation will admit. 

I am exceedingly anxious to receive a line from 
you; and have the honor to be, with the most per 
fect regard and esteem, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

DANIEL BRODHEAD. 



FROM BENJAMIN FRANKLIN. 

Passy, 19 March, 1780. 

SIR, 

I beg leave to introduce to your Excellency s ac 
quaintance and civilities, Monsieur le Chevalier De 
Chastellux, Major-General in the French troops, now 
about to embark for America, whom I have long 
known, and esteemed highly in his several characters 
of a soldier, a gentleman, and a man of letters. His 
excellent book, on Public Happiness, shows him the 
friend to mankind, and, as such, entitles him, whereever he goes, to their respect and good offices. He 
is particularly a friend to our cause, and I am sure 
your Excellency will have great pleasure in his con 
versation. I have the honor to be, with great re 
spect, your Excellency s 

Most obedient and most humble servant, 

BENJAMIN FRANKLIN. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LINCOLN. 

Charleston, 24 March, 1780. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

Since my last, the enemy have, very unexpectedly, 
brought over the ships mentioned in the inclosed 
paper. It has been thought there was not water 
enough for a sixty-four gun ship. Before they came 
into the harbour, it was determined to form a lineof battle across the channel, with our ships, to act in 
conjunction with Fort Moultrie ; but afterwards, as the 
enemy were so vastly superior to our force, it was 
thought best to remove our ships up to the town in 
Cooper River, and land their heavy cannon and men. 
We are endeavouring to obstruct the channel from the 

o 

town to Shute s Folly. If we should succeed, great 
good will result from the measure, as thereby we 
shall prevent the enemy from running up that river, 
and cutting off our communication with the country 
on the east. 

The enemy are extending their works on Ashley 
River, from the mouth of Wappoo, with a design to 
cover their stores, which they can land near the first 
work, at the mouth of the creek, and remove them a 
mile or two across land to the head of another creek, 
which empties into the Ashley, where they have a 
work also, which is opposite a good landing on this 
side. I think they will throw their troops across 
above, take post at this landing, and then transport 
their stores, which will save them a very long land 
carriage. 

I lament, most sincerely, that, from the want of a 
sufficient power, we cannot oppose their passing this 
river, which might easily be effected, and oblige the 
enemy to take a circuit of forty miles. General 
Woodford is not yet arrived. By his letter of the 
6th instant, he informs me that his troops would 
leave Petersburg the day after. His numbers, by 
some means or other, are greatly reduced. By his 
return, he has only seven hundred and thirty-seven 
fit for action. 

General Scott informs me that he is coming on 
without the remainder of his troops. Want of clothing 
is the cause. A few of them have been persuaded to 
take care of General Woodford s baggage. Many of 
the North Carolina militia, whose times have expired, 
leave us to-day. They cannot be persuaded to re 
main longer, though the enemy are in our neighbourhood. 

General Mclntosh received, a few days since, a re 
solve of Congress, founded on a letter from the Go 
vernor of Georgia, and one from the Speaker of the 
Assembly of that State, purporting that he had lost 
the confidence of the people; in which resolve he is 
suspended from acting in the Southern department. 
I have not only to lament the loss of so good an officer, but that Congress have so suddenly come into 
a resolution, which must wound the feelings of an 
old servant of the United States, and who, by the 
war, is reduced from a state of great affluence to 
that but a little removed from beggary. He has the 
command of the country militia of this State, now in 
garrison. I have the honor to be, my dear General, 
with the highest esteem, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL BARON STEUBEN. 

Philadelphia, 28 March, 1780. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

The propositions I made to Congress, respecting 
the formation of the army, of which I had the honor 
of transmitting your Excellency a copy, remain yet 
on their table, without any decision thereon. They 
have, however, set aside the report of the Board of 
War on a motion for reducing the battalions, as you 
will perceive by the resolve annexed, so that all re 
duction or incorporation is now out of the question ; 
and for next campaign the regiments in the line will 
be augmented more or less by the respective States. 
What is to be done with the additional regiments 
and the cavalry, Congress cannot or will not decide; 
though I am rather led to believe their delay in this 
matter proceeds from the grand cause of all our mis 
fortunes, the bad state of our finances, which will 
not allow the recruiting of men, or purchasing of 
horses. 

I observed to you, my dear General, in my last, 
that every wheel of the machine seemed stopped. 
Of the truth of this observation I become more and 
more convinced, and must confess, that to me oursituation appears very critical. The late resolves re 
specting the money, though attended with all the 
success that can be wished, cannot make any imme 
diate alteration for the better. Some months must 
elapse before their good effects will be felt; and, during this time, we are disabled from doing any thing, 
whilst, at this very moment, the greatest exertions 
are necessary. 

My anxiety for our Southern affairs, I cannot help 
saying, is considerably increased by the last accounts, 
which seem to announce a determination of General 
Lincoln to defend Charleston with all his force; this, 
to me, appears to be playing a hardy game. , 

Another danger which threatens us, and which is 
much to be dreaded, is the declared division be 
tween Virginia and Pennsylvania; the latter State 
having actually passed a law for the raising fifteen 
hundred men to defend their pretended rights. All 
these things offer but a dull prospect, rendered still 
more dull by the cabals and factions which reign 
among us. The civil departments of the army, at a 
time when their whole attention should be taken up 
in providing for the approaching campaign, are in 
such a state of dissatisfaction and confusion, that I 
am very apprehensive they will make things still 
worse than they are. 

You will perhaps think, my dear General, that I 
am in anxiety for things which are out of my sphere ; 
but when you consider that all my happiness depends 
on our success, you will not blame me for,, the interest I take , in the cause. The same motives make 
me apprehensive that the necessary arrangements will 
never be firmly established without your personal 
assistance ; and I submit to you, my dear General, 
whether your presence is not absolutely necessary at 
Congress, in the present critical situation of our affairs. Your right to the confidence, both of Congress 
VOL. ii. 36 
and the people, is too well founded not to command 
the greatest attention to every thing you propose. 
The time is precious, and the prospect before us 
threatening. Your presence will animate our counsels, as it does our armies. My attachment to the 
cause, and the respectful confidence I have in yourperson, induces me to express, in the strongest terms, 
the desire I have to see you here. I have the honor 
to be, your Excellency s 

Most obedient and very humble servant, 

STEUBEN. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Philadelphia, 31 March, 1780. 

SIR, 

Your Excellency s public and private letters, of the 
26th, were handed me day before yesterday, and I 
wish it had been in my power to have given them 
an earlier answer; but the difficulty of satisfying 
myself, in all the matters contained in your letter, 
has prevented it. 

Many people are apprehensive for the fall of Charles 
ton ; and I think it in jeopardy, as w r ell as the troops 
under Lincoln s command. I am more anxious for the 
fate of the troops than the city. Should they both 
fall together, in this critical stage of our finance, it is 
difficult to determine what will be the consequences. 
Most people seem to agree, that a further detach 
ment of troops from this army cannot add any safety 
to the city, as its fall must be decided long before 
the troops can get up. Governor Reed, Generals 
Schuyler, Scott, and Wayne, are all of this opinion, 
as well as Mr. Sherman, and the Massachusetts Delegates; and this is clearly my opinion. But Colonel 
Gray son, and, I believe, the Board of War in general, 
are of opinion that a detachment ought to be sent 
on immediately, as they are apprehensive the city will 
fall, and the enemy push on to the northward. 
Should this happen, a proper force can be detached 
seasonably hereafter, as it cannot make but a few 
days difference whether they march now, or when 
the fall of the city shall be decided. If the enemy 
are defeated, the detachment ought not to go; and 
if they are not, it is already too late to give timely 
succour to the place. 

The business of finance is yet a matter of mere 
speculation. Nothing can be determined upon it from 
the present appearances. Most people are silent 
upon the subject; and this I interpret into a favora 
ble symptom. I find the measure passed in Congress 
but by a majority of one, and the members are more 
split and divided about the matter now, than any 
other order of men; indeed, some of them reprobate 
the measure. I perfectly agree with your Excellency 
in sentiment, that it is the duty of every well-wisher 
to the cause to give all the support in his power to 
the plan, now it is taken. For the measure will en 
tail just as much disgrace upon us if it does not pro 
ceed, as if if does ; and, if the plan fails, I am at a 
loss to conceive how we are to support the war. 
Public and private credit is almost at an end. 

Nothing is done in the Quarter-master s depart 
ment. The new system I mentioned in my last, is 
yet undecided on. The more I view it, the less I 
like it, and the stronger my conviction is, that it is 
calculated not less to embarrass your Excellency than 
to disgrace and injure me. Mifflin and Pickering are 
gone to Reading; and Mifflin has got the Massachusetts Delegates into his house, in town, upon 
very moderate terms, and, it is said, with a view of 
strengthening himself in that quarter. Depend upon 
it, he has a scheme, in concert with others. 

Public business is in a wretched train. All things 
at a stand ; and I don t believe the great depart 
ments of the army will be organized for a month to 
come, unless the new system is adopted, which will 
starve and disband the army in half the time. 

Generals Schuyler and Scott think it a most pal 
try thing. What I had in contemplation as a sys 
tem, I am persuaded is the only plan which will 
yield proper support to the army, and cooperate with 
your Excellency s military manoeuvres. An army is 
viewed in Congress as a city, which may be supported and provided for, without regarding the emergen 
cies of service. That body seem to be insensible of 
the great difference there is, in their public estima 
tion, betwixt now and four years ago, not only among 
individuals, but with the States in general; and, in 
stead of strengthening their influence by a just and 
generous conduct to individuals, they add insult to 
injury. A political body, that acts upon such barba 
rous maxims of policy, cannot fail to bring ruin and 
distress upon the people, as no honest man, that has 
a regard for his reputation, would feel himself in the 
power of such people. Conscious of my own integri 
ty, as well as faithful attention to the business committed to my trust, I cannot help feeling an honest 
indignation at the little arts made use of to lessen 
my merit and create suspicions to my prejudice. As 
I was placed in the office I now hold by your Ex 
cellency s particular request, and as you are the only 
person who can do me ample justice, I flatter myself 
I may safely rest my reputation with you, to place 
me in that point of light which justice and equity 
demand. 

It is the wish of many here, that your Excellency 
should come to town; and, I am persuaded, you 
would have it in your power to settle and arrange 
many matters, which, for want of being done, every 
thing is in a train the most ruinous and distressing 
imaginable. All our public horses in this State are 
starving. Hundreds have been drove into this city 
from the country, because the people refuse to keep 
them any longer. From the distressed situation the 
Forage department is in, I am afraid the most of ourhorses, if not all, will be altogether unfit for opening the campaign. After this day, we shall not have 
an ounce of forage in this city. This, I must con 
fess, would not grieve me much, were we well pro 
vided elsewhere ; but, alas ! we are in just the same 
wretched situation in every quarter. People may 
sometimes be convinced by feeling, when they cannot 
by reasoning. 

I am very apprehensive we shall lose a great part 
of the articles we have manufacturing, as the people 
will not deliver them without payment. What grieves 
me most, is the loss of several hundred fine new 
wagons, which were in great forwardness, and on 
which we depended for the opening campaign. 

There is no arrival, or foreign news. We learn 
here, by the way of New York, that Clinton was to 
attack Charleston on the 15th of this month. 

I thank your Excellency for the information re 
specting Mrs. Greene, and desire my compliments to 
Mrs. Washington. With great respect, I am, 
Your Excellency s obedient servant, 

NATHANAEL GREENE.

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Philadelphia, 2 April, 1780. 



I am sorry it has not been in my power to give 
your Excellency an earlier answer to your letter of 
the 26th ultimo. The subject is a matter of such 
moment, that, although it required despatch, yet the 
delay must be less injurious than a want of fall 
information to decide with certainty. 

It is not less mortifying to me, than unhappy for 
the public interest and national security, that circum 
stances oblige me to confess myself unable, for want 
of sufficient support, either to make the proper provi 
sion in my department, necessary for marching the 
troops to the southward, or for putting the army in 
motion in these Northern States. There would be no 
difficulty, either in the one case or the other, could 
the treasury furnish the proper supplies of cash. But 
in its present exhausted state, with the enormous demands upon the department, the agents have neither 
credit nor influence equal to the business. 

Orders were seasonably issued for an ample provi 
sion for the opening campaign. Many are in part 
executed, and might be easily completed, were the 
agents enabled to fulfil their contracts. But the 
manufacturers, for want of payment, will neither go 
on with the business, nor deliver what they have completed. And though the loss of these articles will 
be a capital injury to the public, as well in point of 
saving in expense as that of accommodating the 
army, yet there is not the remotest prospect of ob 
taining cash, seasonably, to prevent the misfortune. 

I have given general and particular orders to the 
agents, to collect from the manufacturers as many of 
the articles contracted for as possible, and to hold 
them in readiness for further orders. But the people 
have suffered so much by the depreciation of the 
money, that they will not part with their property 
without immediate payment. In this predicament are 
the stores manufacturing for public use ; what part 
we shall be able to obtain, is difficult to determine. 

The public horses, which are quartered about in 
different parts of the country, are suffering for want 
of forage ; and I am afraid many will perish, before 
the States, under the new requisition, will provideamply for their support. But, could the whole be 
made fit for service at the opening of the campaign, 
which will by no means be the case, the number 
would be very insufficient to answer the demands of 
the army. I am, with great respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

NATHANAEL GREENE. 



FROM PHILIP SCHUYLER. 

Philadelphia, 5 April, 1780. 

MY DEAR SIR, 

On the 3d instant I was favored with your Excel 
lency s letter of the 30th ultimo. I have, for ten 
days successively, deferred writing, in hopes that I 
should have been able, at last, to have advised you 
that public business was closely attended to in this 
quarter, and that we had adopted measures to disen 
cumber us from that variety of embarrassment we 
experience ; but, alas ! we have made little or no ad 
vances. 

Mifflin, Pickering, Jones, and General Sherman, 
have furnished the first part of a voluminous system 
for the Quarter-master s department. The second part 
is to direct the Commissary-General of Issues in the 
discharge of his duty; and the third will point at 
the regulations for the Hospital. I do not mention 
the Purchasing department, because that is to be abo 
lished ; the States are to do all. As General Sher 
man roundly asserts, that system will strike off fourthousand officers from the civil departments. As it is, 
replete with absurdity, it will pass into a law, unless 
it should be thought proper to confer with the Com 
mander-in-chief on the subject. There has been some 
wicked work, respecting a certain appointment, which 
General Greene will advise you of verbally. 

The gentleman I have last mentioned addressed 
Congress, in a letter of the 3d instant, wishing for 
their sense on his general conduct in the Quarter 
master s department. A resolution was proposed, that 
Congress had full confidence in his integrity and 
ability, and requesting his future exertions. This 
brought on much debate ; amendments were moved, 
and the House got into heats, and an adjournment 
was deemed necessary to give the members time to 
cool. A member, more zealous for the General s re 
putation than prudent, observed, that he was an officer in whom the Commander-in-chief had the highest 
confidence; that he was the first of all the subordi 
nate Generals in point of military knowledge and 
ability ; that, in case of an accident happening to 
General Washington, he would be the properest per 
son to command the army; and that General Washing 
ton thought so too. Another observed, that he had a 
very high opinion of General Greene s military abili 
ties ; that he believed the General had too ; but that 
he believed no person on earth was authorized to say 
as much as the words, above scored, implied. I mention this, that your Excellency may guard against 
any misapprehensions which this may occasion with 
your officers. General Greene will inform you who 
delivered the imprudent speech. 

Yesterday your letter of the 2d was read. There 
appeared a disposition in many to leave the whole 
business, which was the subject of it, to your discre 
tion. Great part of the morning was spent on the 
subject before the resolution took place, which will 
be transmitted by the President. 

Some days since, I moved for a Committee to prepare a letter to the States, to call on them for exer 
tions more competent to the great object we have in 
view. After some altercation, a Committee was appointed. Ellsworth, Muhlenberg, and Schuyler composed it. They prepared the letter, and reported but 
some gentlemen were averse at the decisive plainness 
with which we intended Congress should address the 
States ; whilst others contended that we should speak 
still more pointedly. After a whole day s debate, the 
letter was recommitted. 

I have entreated General Greene to remain a day 
or two longer in town, that I may be able to advise 
with him on the measures necessary to be pursued 
to prevent the ill consequences of his being driven 
to the necessity of a resignation, which, I conceive, 
would at any time be an event to be much lamented, but, in the present conjuncture, ruinous. 

Pray entreat Mrs. Washington to accept of my re 
spects, and the gentlemen of the family those wishes 
which my esteem for them induces. I am, dear Sir, 
with perfect esteem, and the sincerest affection, 
Your Excellency s obedient servant, 

PHILIP SCHUYLER.

Boston, G April, 1780. 

Sm ? 

A new Constitution of Government being generally 
apprehended necessary for this State, a majority of 
the towns, on recommendation of the Assembly, some 
months ago appointed Delegates for the purpose of 
forming one ; and they have lately, in Convention, 
agreed upon one, which is to be laid before the 
people at large for their consideration. They ordered 
a number of copies to be printed, two or three of 
which being at my disposal, I have the honor of in 
closing one of them to your Excellency. If it should 
afford you any amusement, I shall be much gratified. 

By a letter, in January, from our peace Ambassa 
dor, Mr. Adams, so far as he then had the means of 
judging, he did not expect to have any thing to do 
in the business of his department, at least for this 
year ; so that another campaign seems unavoidable. 
I wish it may be productive of such happy events 
as to insure a lasting- peace, established on American 
principles. I have the honor to be, with the most 
perfect esteem, Sir, your Excellency s 

Most obedient, humble servant,

FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL WOODFORD. 

Charleston. 8 April, 1780. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

After a forced march of five hundred and five 
miles, which we performed in thirty days, I had 
the pleasure of throwing my troops into town in 
good health and spirits, by the only passage now 
left open. We arrived on the 7th, at two o clock, to 
the great joy of the garrison. Our embarkation was 
made on the east side of Cooper River, distant from 
town nine miles. 

So far as my indisposition would enable me to 
make myself acquainted with the situation of mat 
ters, they stand nearly thus. 

Their ships, to the number of nine, passed Fort 
Moultrie yesterday afternoon, at five o clock. The 
fire from both sides was warm, but, the wind being 
fair and blowing very fresh, they passed with much 
more ease than I expected, and I fear with less 
damage. All that we can discover is, one of the 
frigates lost her foremast ; a ship ran aground in 
her passage up, but got off with the evening s flood, 
and, in attempting to come up in the night, was set 
on fire and blew up, whether from the fire of the 
fort, or by what other means, or of what force she 
was, we are not informed, having heard nothing from 
Fort Moultrie since the ships have taken their sta 
tion before the town, at two and a half miles distance. If they can get past the obstructions in the 
mouth of Cooper River, they will enfilade our works, 
and the consequences will be fatal, besides entirely 
cutting off all communication with the country. Ourbatteries are strong, and the artillery numerous ; but 
it appears to me they will not be so well manned as 
I could wish. Some part of the lines are rather low, 
and I think the men off duty will be much exposed 
when their batteries open. 

Their army crossed the Ashley the 29th of March, 
and the first of this month they broke ground in ourfront. Their nearest work is upon our right, at six 
hundred yards distance from ours, and they fall off 
from eight and nine, to eleven hundred yards on ourleft. They have done a good deal of work ; their 
battery upon the Cooper is in the greatest forward 
ness. It does not appear they can open for several 
days, unless they do it partially, which, I suppose, 
will not be the case. They have been employed, for 
several days and nights, in opening lines of communication between their batteries, which appear in 
great forwardness. Exclusive of these, they have a 
battery upon our left flank at Wappoo Cut, and 
some galleys, brought in by the passage of Stono 
River. These are mounted with thirty-two and twen 
ty-four pounders; but the distance is at least onemile and a quarter from our left, too far to do any 
considerable execution. 

The garrison appears in high spirits, and our arrival seemed to give them fresh confidence. My want 
of experience, in the defence or attack of a place, 
will not enable me to give your Excellency my 
opinion upon the w r hole of our situation, with any 
degree of precision. 

On our arrival he-re, the officers of the Virginia 
line, that came out last year, have applied to General Lincoln for a new arrangement of the regiments. 
I cannot, at present, inform your Excellency what will 
be done in it; but I shall oppose any alteration at 
this critical juncture, upon the principle of its doing 
mischief. And, as it w r as done by authority of the 
Board of War for this expedition, and I have been 
at much pains and infinite fatigue to get them pro 
perly organized for service, an alteration at this time 
will occasion much confusion, and make the troops 
of the line much less serviceable in the siege than 
they would be to remain as they are till it is ended, 
at least, or till your Excellency s pleasure, or that of 
the Board of War, is known. 
General Scott is here ; Colonel Buford s battalion 
on its march, but where I cannot inform you ; nor 
can I say any thing, with certainty, about the State 
troops on their march, under command of LieutenantColonel Porterfield. I shall think it my duty to take 
every opportunity of writing your Excellency from 
this place; and have to request, that you will be 
pleased to give my respectful compliments to all the 
General Officers, and the gentlemen of your family, 
and to be assured that I am, with the greatest re 
spect and affection, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

WILLIAM WOODFORD. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LINCOLN. 

Charleston, 9 April, 1780. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

The enemy crossed the Ashley, in force, near the 
ferry, on the 29th ultimo, and the next day moved 
down, and encamped about three thousand .yards from 
our lines. Before this, they had transported their 
heavy baggage, ordnance, and stores, from out of 
Wappoo, across land, about two miles, to Old Town 
Creek, on the west side of the river, opposite their 
encampment. In the morning of the 1st instant, we 
discovered that they had opened ground in several 
places in our front, about eleven hundred yards there 
from. The next night they threw up a work on ourleft, distance nine hundred yards. The next which 
appeared was on Cooper River, six hundred yards 
from our right ; these, and some which they have 
since raised, seem to be closed. They have been some 
nights perfecting their works, and opening lines of 

VOL. ii. 37 
communication. What they have done seems rather 
calculated to cover their approaches, than to annoy 
us from them. 

Seven ships of war passed Fort Moultrie yesterday 
afternoon, and anchored near where Fort Johnson 
stood, with no other apparent injury than the loss 
of one topmast. We have been busily employed in 
throwing obstructions in their passage of the Cooper. 
I wish they may prove effectual, for it is of the highest importance for us to keep that open ; thereby 
we preserve a communication with the country, from 
which we can draw our succours and supplies. In 
order the more effectually to do this, we mean to 
throw up a work on Lempriere s, one at Cainhoy up 
Wando, where we shall have our deposit of stores, 
besides some on the several landings, on the east 
side of Cooper River. These things have been some 
time in contemplation, but the necessary works to 
be made in town have prevented their being exe 
cuted. Indeed, before the Virginia troops, under General Woodford, arrived, which was on the 7th, we could 
not man them; but from the addition of that force, 
and the North Carolina militia, who are coming in, 
we hope to spare some few men for this purpose, 
and that we shall be able to draw down some of the 
militia of this State into these works, who will not 
come to town. One of the enemy s ships, said to be 
a transport, fell to leeward last night (within Fort 
Moultrie), which ship they burned this morning. 

I expect soon the remainder of General Scott s 
troops, and some militia from North Carolina. I have 
the honor to be, my dear General, with the highestesteem and affection, 

Your most obedient servant, 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 



THE AMEEICAN EEVOLUTION. 435 

FROM COLONEL JOHN LAURENS. 

Charleston, 9 April, 1780. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

When I last had the honor of writing to your Ex 
cellency, the enemy had not extended their opera 
tions beyond their place of arms on Wappoo Neck. 
On the 29th ultimo they crossed Ashley River, in 
force, one mile above the ferry. The next day they 
advanced to Gibbes s, a convenient landing, about two 
miles from town, having previously -collected a num 
ber of boats at the opposite shore, for the purpose of 
crossing their heavy artillery and stores. My batta 
lion of light infantry, posted there to prevent a surprise or too sudden approach of the enemy, was 
ordered not to engage seriously, but skirmish with 
advanced parties, retiring slowly and orderly towards 
town, as there was no object in maintaining any ad 
vanced post, and the advantages of a serious affair 
were all on the side of the enemy. 

On the night of the 1st instant, the enemy broke 
ground, and have been working slowly ever since. I 
scarcely know how to denominate what they have 
executed hitherto. It consists of several redoubts, 
with a covered communication from right to left, 
which is still unfinished. Their nearest work is an 
inclosed battery on their left, at about the distance 
of six hundred yards, which induces me to believe, 
that they intend the line in question for a first paral 
lel, although some parts of it are rather too remote. 
Our shells and shot have disquieted them, and inter 
rupted their operations; but General Lincoln, sensible 
of the value of these articles in a siege, economizes 
them as much as possible. Fatigue parties are con 
stantly employed in improving our works. The whole 
front of our lines, within the abatis, is armed with 
wolf-traps. All this affords an excellent defence 
against storm, but must finally yield to a persever 
ance in regular approaches, which appears to be Clin 
ton s present plan, unless we can work under his fire 
as fast as he can, and afford time for the arrival of 
your Excellency. 

Our obstructions in Cooper River are completed ; 
which gives a prospect of our maintaining a communication with the country, and hitherto prevents 
the accomplishment of the investiture. Since the 
arrival of General Woodford, General Lincoln will 
have it in his power to execute his plan of establishing the necessary posts for this purpose, on the east 
ern shore of the river. Colonel Malmedy is to take 
command of the troops destined for that service. 

The enemy s squadron of seven armed ships, threeof which are two-deckers, and two transports, availed 
itself of a brisk southern breeze to pass Fort Moultrie yesterday afternoon. The Admiral s ship led the 
van, and escaped without apparent injury; the fri 
gate which followed her. had her foretopmast carried 
away ; a large transport, in the rear of the whole, 
ran aground, and, after receiving some shot from Sul 
livan s Island, was fired and abandoned by her crew. 
The remainder are now anchored near the ruins of 
Fort Johnson, out of the reach of our cannon. 

My notice of the present opportunity was so sud 
den, that I have not been able to make atonement 
for my last hurried letter. Helving upon your Ex 
cellency s goodness, I have preferred writing, at any 
rate, to total silence, and losing an occasion of re 
peating the assurances of attachment and veneration, 
with which I have the honor to be, 

Your Excellency s faithful Aid, 

JOHN LAURENS. 
P. S. I beg to be respectfully presented to Mrs. 
Washington. The reason above mentioned makes me 
trouble your Excellency to present my love to the 
family, as I shall not be able to write to any of 
them. 



FROM COLONEL BRODHEAD. 

Fort Pitt, 24 April, 1780. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I am honored with your favor of the 4th of Janu 
ary, and the 14th of March. That of the 4th of 
January I did not receive until the 18th instant. 
Returns of the troops under my command have been 
duly forwarded to the orderly office, agreeably to 
general orders, except one or two months in the win 
ter, when the mountain was impassable. As no reenforcement can be had from your Excellency, the 
intended expedition against Detroit must be laid 
aside until a favorable turn of affairs takes place, unless you would recommend a junction of Colonel 
Clark s troops with mine. 

I have called upon the different counties, on this 
side the mountain, for eight hundred and twenty-five 
rank and file, to be drafted from the militia, and in 
tend to visit the Shawanese, provided the men are 
furnished. But the unhappy dispute of jurisdiction 
will, I fear, prevent my getting them ; and, as many 
renegadoes from the different Indian nations are col 
lected at the Shawanese towns, I do not incline to 
make an attempt with an inconsiderable number of 
men, because a defeat would be attended with fatal 
consequences to the settlement. 

I am honored with a line from the Honorable 
Board of War, informing me that an officer of Colonel 
37* 



438 LETTERS TO AVASIIINGTON. 

Proctor s regiment; with some stores and cannon, was 
in readiness to be sent up as soon as the roads 
would permit^ and the means of transportation can be 
procured. 

Mr. Arthur Gordon has deserted from his arrest,, 
and will probably avoid a new trial. 

With a view of saving land-carriage expenses, when 
water-carriage was practicable, I suffered only a few 
of the boats to be used ; and greater care could 
scarcely have been taken, than what I took, to prevent their being lost or spoiled; but it was out of 
my power to watch every person. 1 have, however, 
the pleasure to assure you, that not more than seven 
are past Fort Henry, which, as I have given orders 
to some of Colonel Clark s officers, will, I trust, be 
saved and sent back to this post. 

I Avas much inclined, last fall, to do myself the 
honor of waiting upon your Excellency, with a view 
of proposing some things which, at that time, I ex 
pected would have promoted the service in this district in the course of this campaign; but I do not 
recollect that I expressed my desire to visit my 
family. I am much obliged to your Excellency for 
the indulgence; but, as Colonel Gibson is absent on a 
visit to his family, at Carlisle, and the Indians are 
remarkably hostile, I must remain, until I see whe 
ther it will be in my power to prosecute an expedi 
tion against the hostile Indians, or not, and until I 
have the honor of hearing from you again. 

O t/ &lt;T5 

The Lieutenants of Monongalia county, and Ohio, 
write, that they arc happy to hear of the intended 
expedition against some of the hostile Indians, and 
that they will exert themselves to furnish the men 
required; but they conceive that it will be difficult to 
effect it, on account of the disputed territory. 
I take the liberty to inclose the copy of a letter, 
lately received from the Delaware Council at Coochocking, number One ; likewise a copy of the Reve 
rend Mr. Ileckewelder s letter, number Two ; and an 
extract from the Reverend Mr. Heckewelder s letter, 
number Three and I will likewise inclose the return 
of the troops, as nearly as possible, to your wish ; 
but as Colonel Gibson s regiment, my own, and the 
independent corps, were chiefly raised within the disputed territory, it will be impossible to determine in 
which State they were raised, until the line is run. 

Fearing a scarcity of salt provisions for the out 
posts, and the better to enable me to subsist a num 
ber of the militia upon the proposed expedition, I 
have been obliged to reduce the ration of meat onequarter, but I have allowed some Indian meal in lieu 
thereof. Since the 1st of March, the Indians have 
killed and taken forty-three men, women, and child 
ren, in the counties of Youghiogany, Monongalia, and 
Ohio, including those killed and taken upon the river ; 
and they have destroyed a number of horses and 
cattle in Tiger Valley. 

The Honorable Board of War mention the expense 
of expresses in such a manner, as must prevent my 
employing any ; but I will do myself the honor to 
communicate to you every material occurrence, by such 
private conveyance as may from time to time offer. 
I have the honor to be, with the most sincere respect 
and esteem, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

DANIEL BRODHEAD. 
FROM GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Pougbkcepsie, 24 April, 1780. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have to acknowledge the receipt of your Excel 
lency s favors of the 26th ultimo and 12th instant. 
Two days before the former came to hand, I received 
the act of Congress respecting the troops proposed to 
be raised for the defence of our frontiers. Some con 
siderable time will necessarily elapse before they can 
be embodied ; and, as the enemy have already appeared at different times and places on the northern and 
western frontiers, I am very apprehensive that, in 
the interim, the more remote settlements will be 
abandoned. Every measure will be used to expedite 
this business, and your Excellency will have the earliest information of the disposition which, in conse 
quence of your letter, I shall cause to be made of 
these levies. 

The act of Congress, of the 26th of last month, re 
specting the quotas of supplies for the army, to be 
furnished by the different States, was not received 
until some days after the rising of the Legislature. 
This, together with some other important matters 
from Congress, has induced me to call them together 
at an earlier day than that to which they stand ad 
journed; and I have accordingly issued my proclama 
tion for convening them at Kingston on the 9th of 
next month, when this business will be submitted 
to their consideration. In the mean time, I think it 
my duty to inform your Excellency, that, in conse 
quence of the several laws which have been enacted 
for obtaining supplies of provision and forage for the 
army, this State is so exhausted, that I am persuaded there is not more grain and meal left in possession of the farmers, than a bare competency for the 
support of its inhabitants until the new crop comes 
in ; and with respect to forage, few of the farmers 
have a sufficiency to bring their stock through until 
grass. Should, therefore, the present supplies, besides 
what are already in the hands of the public officers, 
be wanted before harvest, they are not to be had in 
this State. I should have written to your Excellency 
earlier on this subject, but I did not receive yourletter until a few days ago. I have the honor to be, 
with the highest sentiments of respect and esteem, 
Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

GEORGE CLINTON. 



FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

At the entrance of Boston Harbour, 27 April, 1780. 

Here I am, my dear General, and, in the midst of 
the joy I feel in finding myself again one of yourloving soldiers, I take but the time to tell you that 
I came from France on board a frigate, w r hich the 
King gave me for my passage. I have affairs of the 
utmost importance, which I should at first communicate to you alone. In case my letter finds you any 
where this side of Philadelphia, I beg you will wait 
for me, and do assure you a great public good may 
be derived from it. To-morrow we go up to the 
town, and the day after I shall set off in my usual 
way to join my beloved and respected friend and 
General. 

Adieu, my dear General ; you will easily know the 
hand of your young soldier. My compliments to the

SIR, 

I have received, with all the gratitude possible, 
the news which your Excellency has been pleased to 
give me of Don Juan.* I begin to flatter myself 
that the cares he has received from you, and from 
all those who surround him, will reestablish him. 

I cannot sufficiently express to you, Sir, my senti 
ments in this respect, and for the kindnesses, without 
number, which you have heaped upon me during the 
time passed with you. I shall render an account to 
my Court of all that I saw at the army; of the good 
order and discipline of the troops ; of the zeal and 
talents of the officers; of the good disposition reigning among them ; as well as of the respect and public 
confidence in the Commander-in-chief. These circum 
stances united form an augury the most favorable 
for the enterprises which your army may be in con 
dition to undertake, when it shall be completed, in 
consequence of the measures that have been just 
taken. I am certain, beforehand, that his Majesty 
will take a true satisfaction in learning details so in 
teresting to a power so dear to him. 

I dare supplicate your Excellency to receive anew 
the assurances of the sentiments of veneration and 
respect, with which you have inspired me, and with 
which I have the honor to be, 

Your most humble and most obedient servant, 

LUZERXE.

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL HEATH. 

Roxbury, 30 April, 1780. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I was, some time since, honored with yours of the 
28th ultimo, respecting clothing for the recruits, and, 
this morning, with that of the 17th instant. 

Several officers have already come from West Point 
on the recruiting service, and others are on the road. 
I wish they may be successful, but am at a loss, from 
the tenor of your Excellency s letter, to determinewhat bounty the recruits, raised by this State (Mas 
sachusetts), are to receive. It seems the Continental 
bounty, after the act of March, 1779, w T as to be two 
hundred dollars. The General Assembly of this State, 
on the 30th of September last, passed the following 
resolution, namely ; " Resolved, that a bounty of 
three hundred dollars, in addition to the bounty and 
subsistence-money allowed by Congress, be paid to 
each non-commissioned officer and soldier, who has or 
shall enlist as one of this State s quota of the Continental army, during the continuance of the present 
war between the United States of America and Great 
Britain." This bounty appears to be intended over 
and above the Continental bounty, and extended to 
all the soldiers belonging to their quota of the army 
enlisted at any preceding period. I purpose, to-mor 
row, to lay the matter before the Assembly, who, it 
is probable, may have received some particular in 
struction on the subject, or, at least, that they may 
conduct as they think proper. 
On Tuesday last two privateers, belonging to Sa 
lem (the Franklin and Jack), sent into that port a 
large letter-of-niarcjue ship, having on board one thou 
sand barrels of pork and beef, seven hundred and 
fifty barrels of flour, eight hundred firkins of butter, 
and dry goods to the amount of fifteen thousand 
pounds. 

A Dr. Apedale, lately come from New York to 
Boston, and, some time before, from Canada to New 
York, reports, that before he left Canada, it was said 
that about one thousand regulars and Tories, with as 
many Indians as could be collected and would join 
them, were to make an excursion on our frontiers on 
the Mohawk River, as soon as the season was suit 
able, in two divisions, under the command of John 
son and Butler; and that Lieutenant-Colonel Stacy 
was held a prisoner in Canada with a view to be 
exchanged for Johnson or Butler, should either of 
them happen to be taken. How much credit is to 
be given to this report, your Excellency may be able 
best to determine. 

I have the happiness to forward this by MajorGeneral the Marquis de Lafayette, who arrived at 
Boston on the 28th instant, where he was received 
with every demonstration of joy. I have the honor 
to be, with the greatest respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

WILLIAM HEATH. 



FROM JAMES DUANE. 



In Congress, Philadelphia, 4 May, 1780. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 
We are here in anxious suspense for the fate of 
Charleston. It is not to be wondered at, when 
we consider the greatness of the stake, and the uncertainty and importance of the event. The Gover 
nor, Council, and magistrates have shut themselves 
up in the town, determined to share the glory of 
preserving it, or to perish in the attempt. We understand that this resolution was submitted to with 
reluctance by the principal officers of the army, and, 
in my opinion, it is rather a display of heroism than 
of deliberate policy. The influence of government 
would have been well employed, as far as we can 
judge at so remote a distance, in preparing against 
a disaster, and drawing the internal strength of the 
country to some point for its defence. On the present plan, the loss of the whole State seems to be 
hazarded with the capital. 

We learn from a Mr. Cannon, who left the neigh 
bourhood of Charleston on the 12th, and parted with 
General Lincoln on the 9th, that the garrison and in 
habitants were greatly elated on the arrival of the 
Virginia line, and in full expectation of success ; and 
it is his opinion, that if the Maryland line were nearthe scene of action, Sir Henry Clinton would be glad 
to raise the siege. We have endeavoured to learn 
from him the sentiments of General Lincoln on the 
fate of the town ; but it appears that he is as re 
served in his conversation as his letters, though his 

/ o 

activity and vigor inspire the highest respect ana 
confidence. These circumstances do not appear in 
any correspondence; and I conclude, though they are 
not very material, you will not think them too trivial 
to be communicated. 

We are exerting every means in our power to ex 
pedite the march of the reenforcement destined for 
Charleston. It is committed to the joint efforts of 
VOL. ii. 38 
the Board of War and the Treasury, and I hopeevery obstacle is surmounted. I have but one wish 
left, that Virginia may, on so decisive and interesting 
an occasion, be able to detach a body of militia, 
which, in conjunction with the Continental reenforcements, will be sufficient to support the communication 
between the town and country, and harass the be 
siegers in their rear. The reluctance against the 
southern service, though easy to be accounted for, is 
much to be deplored ; and I reconcile myself to the 
embarrassments which our weakness in that quarter 
superadds to all our other difficulties. 

In spite of the disagreeable aspect of our money 
affairs, I look forward to a happy termination of ourarduous conflict. We have not experienced half the 
distresses which, considering the power of our enemies, every contemplative mind must have expected. 
I am, in this view, much engaged in another attempt 
to get the Confederation accomplished, which, in my 
opinion, would fully compensate for the temporary 
loss of any city on the Continent. It gives me great 
pleasure to assure your Excellency that the Delegates 
from Virginia are warmly disposed to give it all the 
aid in their power ; and they have the fullest expect 
ation that our joint exertions will succeed, and the 
future safety and tranquillity of the States be fixed 
on a permanent basis. Without a federal alliance, 
peace itself, independence, and security from external 
assaults, would scarcely deserve the name of a blessing. The flame of disaffection to the British Administration has, at length, reached the bosom of ourenemies. Hemonstrances and complaints, always ter 
rible to an arbitrary government, cannot fail of pro 
ducing embarrassment in public councils, or of en 
feebling the national exertions. We have a right to 
hope that they will be attended with serious conse 
quences, and put an end to their operations against 
these States. If Britain, unsupported by friends or 
allies, and rent asunder by domestic jars and discon 
tents, can continue an unjust and unpopular waragainst the joint efforts of America, France, and 
Spain, she will exhibit an example of obstinacy and 
of vigor unparalleled in history. 

To hold a place in your Excellency s confidence 
and friendship, is an honor which I most highly prize, 
and which I shall always regard as one of the most 
happy circumstances of my life ; for no man can be 
more entirely attached to you, by every tie of affec 
tion, esteem, and gratitude, than, my dear General, 
Your most obedient and most faithful servant, 

JAMES DUANE. 

P. S. Be pleased to present my most respectful 
compliments to Mrs. Washington and the gentlemen 
of the family. "We have this moment letters, informing us that the Connecticut and Massachusetts Legis 
latures have cheerfully adopted the new plan of 
finance. The Connecticut traders have done them 
selves great honor, as well as the principal farmers. 
The former, in an address to the Assembly, declare 
their readiness to receive the new money at its value 
specified for by congress, in payment for their commodities. New York, I am persuaded, will concur; 
and their example will probably bring all the States 
into the measures. 
FROM MAJOR-GENERAL THE BARON DE KALB. 

Philadelphia, 12 May, 1780. 

SIR, 

The providing the troops, under my command, with 
every necessary for their march, has been attended 
with many difficulties and delays, which it was not 
in my power to remove as soon as I could have 
wished- and, therefore, I was not able to give a 
satisfactory account to your Excellency before now. 

The Board of War have fixed upon Richmond as 
the place of rendezvous for the whole. The two bri 
gades embarked at the Head of Elk; the artillery, 
ammunition, and baggage, proceeded by land. I shall 
set out to-morrow morning. I should have done it 
many days ago, had I not been detained by the 
Board of War and of the Treasury. I should have 
been happy to see the Marquis de Lafayette, but 
would not lose a moment in going on. 

From Richmond, I will write to your Excellency 
the situation of the troops, the number of recruits 
joined on the march, and the measures I shall take 
to march with most expedition. I have the honor to 
be, with great respect, 

Your Excellency s obedient servant, 

THE BARON DE KALB.

FROM COLONEL BRODHEAD. 

Fort Pitt, 13 May, 1780. 

DEAR GENERAL, 
I have put off the assembling of the militia until 
the 4th of next month, to endeavour to procure a 
sufficient quantity of provision for them. But I fearit will not be in my power, as General Gates, who 
presides at the Board of Inspection, has ordered the 
Commissaries to stop purchasing ; and the Mingoes, in 
sundry parties, have been discovered on their march 
toward the inhabitants. Several persons have lately 
been killed and wounded in Westmoreland county, 
which will probably prevent my receiving any aid 
from the militia of that county. They have hired 
sixty men, who are now stationed upon their frontier. 
A Delaware Indian informed me this day, that two 
parties of warriors had just crossed the Ohio River, 
near Logstown and Chartier s Creek, which will, pro 
bably, by alarming and driving the inhabitants, prevent my getting the men from the other counties as 
I expected. The remaining Continentals are the cullings of our troops, and I cannot promise any thing 
clever from them. 

I have wrote to the artillery officer to hurry up 
the artillery and stores ; but I hear he is badly furnished with carriages and forage, which must prevent 
his marching with expedition. 

I think it is probable that the enemy are medi 
tating an attack upon some of our posts, which, for 
want of sufficient garrisons and supplies, cannot make 
much resistance. I am preparing to receive them 
here, but the detachments to Fort Mclntosh, Holliday s Cave, Fort Henry, and Fort Armstrong, leave 
but a small garrison to defend this post. The Dela 
ware Indians continue their professions of friendship, 
and some of their warriors are now out with my 
scouts. But, as I have little or nothing to give them 
but good words and fair promises, I apprehend they 
will soon decline the service. I have the honor to 
38* 
be, with the highest sentiments of respect and es 
teem. 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

DANIEL BRODHEAD.

FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL DUPORTAIL. 

Charleston, 17 May, 1780. 

SIR, 

You will have probably heard of the surrender of 
Charleston, by the time you will receive this letter. 
I arrived there the 25th of April, at seven o clock 
in the morning, after having past, during the night, 
in the middle of the enemy, through the woods, with 
the assistance of good guides. I found the town in a 
desperate state, almost entirely invested by the British army and fleet, which had passed the bar, and 
Fort Moultrie. They had surmounted difficulties which 
were generally looked upon as insurmountable, with 
out experiencing scarce any resistance. The enemy 
had brought their trenches, upon the Neck, within 
about one hundred and twenty or one hundred and 
thirty yards from the fortifications; in a word, the 
fall of the town was unavoidable, unless an army 
came to her assistance, which then did not appearlikely. 

After having examined the situation of things, I 
thought an evacuation highly advisable, and proposed 
it ; but the Council found an impracticability in the 
measure, although, for my part, it only appeared to 
me difficult and hazardous, and such as we ought to 
risk, in our present situation. That plan being re 
jected, the only object was to protract the term of 
our capitulation. I have done, on my part, every 
thing that was in my power to fulfil that object, in 
the same manner as Colonel Laumoy had, before my 
arrival; but time brought us to close sight of the 
term of our resistance. 

The enemy succeeded in draining part of our ditch, 
which was in front of our intrenchments, and raised 
new batteries in the third parallel. The day they 
opened them, they sent a flag, with a letter, to sum 
mon General Lincoln to surrender. Upon this a 
Council of General and Field-Officers was called; and, 
after having asked whether terms ought to be pro 
posed to the enemy, it was carried in the affirmative, 
by a great majority. I myself was of that number. 
The first proposals were from the enemy. We might 
expect advantageous conditions; I had even some 
hopes that we might have saved the garrison. Be 
sides, a positive refusal to treat with an enemy who, 
within a few days, would have been in a condition 
of giving us the law, appeared imprudent and unseasonable. It was then determined, in Council, that 
propositions should be made; but afterwards, by an 
extraordinary oversight, they left to the General Offi 
cers the care of determining whatever might be pro 
posed. 

This is the moment where I left off taking any 
part in what has been done, being of a contrary 
opinion to that of the General Officers. They agreed 
to propose that the Continental troops should be pri 
soners of war. I opposed that measure with all my 
might, I represented that, if even our situation re 
quired it, it was not our business to propose it, and 
that we showed an ignorance of what is practised in 
those cases, which would make us appear in a ridiculous light. I represented that, if I had been of 
opinion with the greatest number to propose terms 
to the enemy, I meant that they should be honor 
able terms, both advantageous to the army and the 
Continent; as, for instance, to surrender the town 
alone, with the artillery, stores, and ships, but to 
save the troops. That, if the army must be prisoners 
of war, it was more eligible to hold out, in order to 
justify such unfavorable conditions, by a longer re 
sistance and a more distressing situation. 

My representations had not the desired effect. The 
propositions were made such as you will see them. 
Fortunately, such as they were, the enemy would not 
grant them, and proposed others less advantageous, 
which General Lincoln did not, however, think proper 
to accept. The truce was broke, and the operations 
of the siege vigorously continued. But the second 
day after, the militia refused to do duty. General 
Lincoln thought from this that the capitulation was 
absolutely necessary, and called the Council, who 
countenanced the measure. For my own part, I 
thought that we ought to try before, to bring the 
militia to their duty by all possible means, by acts 
of authority, and, if necessary, by exemplary punish 
ments. This was likely deemed impracticable, and 
the capitulation took place, to my great regret; not 
that I thought we could have held out longer than 
three or four days, but that time would have put 
the enemy in such a situation as to render a further 
resistance on our part blamable to everybody. Then 
our defence would have done us much more honor. 
It is true that, in that case, the conditions would 
not have likely been the same ; but I was for sacrificing that advantage to a little more glory. 

Fortunately, in all this the honor of the American 
arms is secure, and the enemy have not yet great 
subject to triumph. To remain forty-two days with 
open trenches before a town of an immense extent, 
fortified by sandy intrenchments, raised in two months, 
without covered way, without outworks, open in several places on the water, and exposed everywhere to 
an open attack, and defended by a garrison which 
was not sufficient by half; to remain, I say, forty-two 
days before such a place, and display all the apparel 
of a regular siege, is nothing very glorious. The 
British General has, perhaps, followed the rules of 
prudence in this conduct ; but, at least, the troops 
under his command will never have subject of boasting of their audaciousness and enterprising spirit. 
The American troops, on the contrary, have given 
certain proofs of their firmness in supporting a tremendous fire, and remaining all the while exposed 
to the danger of a surprise and open attacks, of 
which the success was almost certain, if the enemy 
had taken proper measures. I have the honor to be, 
with the greatest respect, your Excellency s 

Most humble and obedient servant, 

DUPORTAIL. 

P. S. This is the copy of the letter that I write 
to the Congress. I am very sorry they don t let me 
have time enough to add a great many things I 
should be glad to say.

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Morristown, 23 May, 1780. 

SIR, 

I have had a long conversation with General 
Schuyler this morning, and have seen the powers 
and appointments upon the present business intrusted to the direction of the Committee, as well as their 
powers to act under.* From all which I am fully 
of opinion, that the plan is altogether incompetent to 
the purpose and end proposed. Time w r ill not permit 
me to enter into the detail of objections, nor perhaps 
would their force appear in the same point of light 
to another, who has had less experience in the difficulties attending the business, than I have. 

It is my opinion, that your Excellency ought to 
ask the decided opinion of the Committee, in writing, 
whether they think their powers are competent to 
the business expected of them. If they say not, as 
I am sure they must, then I would require of them 
the powers and the plan they conceive necessary to 
support the enterprise ; the whole of which I would 
state to Congress, supported with my own sentiments, 
as well with respect to the defects of the present 
plan, as the plan necessary for the business. Nothing, 
but some such decisive measure as this, will put the 
business on a proper footing. The measure will, at 
least, place your conduct in the fairest point of light. 
It will free the Committee from their present embarrassments, and place the labouring-oar where it ought 
to be. If you undertake the business upon the present footing, and exercise powers beyond the present 
scheme, it will be asked, why you did not ask for 
an enlargement of the Committee s pOAvers, if you 
deemed them inadequate. And if you engage and 
fail for want of support, it will be asked, why you 
embarked in such a business, without being fully per 
suaded that the means were adequate to the end. In 



* General Sclmylcr, Mr. Matlicws, and Mr. Peabody, Delegates in 
Congress, had been appointed a Committee to proceed to head-quarters for the purpose of consulting with the Commander-in-chief on 
the affairs of the army. 
whatever point of view I consider the subject, I see 
the greatest propriety in your Excellency stating to 
the Committee this qusere, whether it is their opinion they can give you such support as will warrant 
your engaging in a cooperation with the French 
forces for the redemption of New York. 

I have just seen Colonel Hamilton, who says yourExcellency desires my opinion upon the position the 
fleet off the Hook ought to take, upon the supposi 
tion it is a French fleet, and come with a view of 
cooperating with us. It is my opinion, if your Ex 
cellency intends to support the expedition against 
New York at all events, without regard to the pow 
ers or plan laid down by Congress (if that should 
fail or appear inadequate to the end), then the fleet 
and forces ought to be immediately brought into the 
Hook, and the troops landed upon Staten Island, 
where our army ought to reenforce them at the 
same instant of time. But, if your Excellency is determined to depend upon civil government for sup 
port altogether, without any exertions of your own, 
and you think the present plan and powers of the 
Committee defective, it is my advice, to let the fleet 
and forces go into Rhode Island ; unless you should 
think it advisable to put one thousand or fifteen 
hundred men on board, and push on the fleet, without 
loss of time, to the soutlrvvard. 

To bring the fleet into the Hook, without having taken some decisive resolution upon the lineof conduct you mean to pursue, may tend to embarrass you and injure our ally. We ought carefully to 
avoid bringing our friends into distress and disgrace, 
if we cannot avail ourselves of the benefit intended us. 

I shall be at head-quarters in a few minutes, and 
will give your Excellency my further sentiments on 
the matter. I am, with great respect. 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

NATHANAEL GREENE.

FROM JAMES BOWDOIN. 

Boston, 29 May, 1780. 

DEAR SIR, 

Yesterday, at five o clock, P. M., I received yourExcellency s letter of the 15th, with the inclosed to 
Major-General Heath. As it was of importance he 
should have it as soon as may be, I immediately 
went with it to Roxbury, and delivered it to him. I 
told him I would assist him in inquiring for inform 
ation relative to the particulars mentioned in yourletter, and, if I should obtain any worth notice, I 
will communicate it to your Excellency .* 

It appears probable the enemy have got informa 
tion of what is intended; for they know, by a packet 
arrived at New York from England, that a squadron 
of men-of-war, with troops, had sailed from Brest for 
this part of America; and last Thursday a vessel, 
which arrived here on Saturday, saw a number of 
ships standing to the eastward, which the people judged were going to Halifax ; probably the same which, 
on that day, we received intelligence had some days 
before sailed from New York with two thousand troops 
on board. These repeated drafts, one would think, 
must so much weaken New York, as to make it impressible by a force not very large ; so that in such 
a divided state of their troops, both places may fall 
into our hands, if we spiritedly cooperate with ourallies ; which, so far as this State may be concerned, 
I doubt not will be the case, when their arrival is 
known, or rather, when your Excellency shall make 
the requisition. 

I am much obliged for the intelligence concerning 
the state of things at Charleston. Our direct intelligence is to the 27th of April, and that on the 22d, 
at night, an attack of the enemy was repelled, with 
a loss on their part of eight hundred, as appears by 
our last newspapers. What was their real loss, I 
think is uncertain. Fervently wishing their total defeat there, and a successful campaign on our part, I 
have the honor to be, with the most respectful re 
gards, Sir, your Excellency s 

Most obedient, humble servant, 

JAMES BOWDOIN.

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL PUTNAM. 

Pomfret, 29 May, 1780. 

DEAR SIR, 

I cannot forbear informing your Excellency, by the 
return of Major Humphreys to camp, of the state of 
my health, from the first of my illness to the present time. 

After I was prevented from coming on to the 
army, by a stroke of the paralytic kind, which deprived me, in a great measure, of the use of my 
right leg and arm, I retired to my plantation, and 
have been gradually growing better ever since. I 
have now so far gained the use of my limbs, especially of my leg, as to be able to walk with very 
little impediment, and to ride on horseback tolerably 
well. In other respects I am in perfect health, and 
enjoy the comforts and pleasures of life with as good 
a relish as most of my neighbours. 

Although I should not be able to resume a command in the army, I propose to myself the happiness 
of making a visit, and seeing my friends there some 
time in the course of the campaign. And, however 
incapable I may be of serving my country, to my 
latest hour my wishes and prayers will always be 
most ardent and sincere for its happiness and freedom. As a principal instrument in the hand of Pro 
vidence for effecting this, may Heaven long preserve 
your Excellency s most important and valuable life. 

Not being able to hold the pen in my own hand, 
I am obliged to make use of another to express with 
how much regard and esteem, I am, your Excellency s 
Most obedient and very humble servant, 

ISRAEL PUTNAM. 

P. S. I am making a great effort to use my hand 
to make the initials of my name, for the first time.

FROM COLONEL BRODHEAD. 

Fort Pitt, 30 May, 1780. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

Since my last, ten persons have been killed and 
wounded, taken by the Indians in Westmoreland county. Parties of regulars and militia have endeavoured 
to overtake them, but without success. 

The accounts I have received, relative to the British garrison at Detroit, differ widely, some making it 
to consist of only two hundred men, some three hundred, and others, upwards of four hundred. This has 
determined me to send Captain Brady, with five white 
men and two Delaware Indians, to Sandusky, to en 
deavour to take a British prisoner, which I hope he 
will effect. I have likewise offered other Delaware 
warriors fifty hard dollars worth of goods, for oneBritish soldier, and they have promised to bring himimmediately. Should an intelligent one be brought 
in, I intend to offer him some indulgence upon his 
giving me the most perfect intelligence in his power. 

I had lately called out eight hundred and twenty five rank and file, and a proportionate number of officers, from the militia, to aid me upon an enterprise 
against the Shawanese towns ; but, upon finding the 
true state of what provisions could be drawn from 
the Commissaries, and that they were prohibited from 
making any further purchases, I was compelled to 
postpone the attempt until a sufficient quantity of 
provisions can be procured. The militia appear to be 
very anxious to aid me, and I sincerely wish it was 
in my power to indulge them. I expect a small sup 
ply from below the mountains, which, if it proves to 
be of good quality, will enable me to subsist the dependent posts until the 1st of September. 

The soldiers frequently desert^ and are often apprehended ; and I expect sundry charges will soon be 
exhibited against some of the civil Staff Officers in 
this district. I shall, therefore, be much obliged for 
a few more blank orders, to enable me to assemble 
General Courts-Martial for their respective trials. 

I cannot learn that the ordnance and stores, ordered from Philadelphia, have yet left Carlisle, nor do I 
know of what kind they are, nor what their number 
or quality. I have the honor to be, with the most 
sincere respect and esteem, 

Your Excellency s most obedient Servant, 

DANIEL BRODIIEAD. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL HEATH. 

Roxbury, 31 May, 1780. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

Since I had the honor of writing you on the 
28th instant, I have been endeavouring to obtain in 
telligence of the situation of the enemy at Halifax, 
&c. I learn that their naval force, not long since, 
consisted of one ship of seventy-four guns, one of 
twenty, one sloop of war, and two or three privateers. 
General McLean, a vigilant officer, commands the 
land forces, which are said to consist of six regi 
ments, each about five hundred strong, four of which 
are at Halifax, the other two at different posts in 
the province. The militia of the town is said to be 
about eleven hundred. 

From a gentleman, of the strictest probity and 
warmest attachment to our cause, and who has madeupwards of forty voyages from Boston to Halifax, I 
learn that, when he was last there, which was before 
the commencement of hostilities, the enemy had a 
strong work on George s Island, at the entrance of 
the harbour; another about half a mile from the cen 
tre of the town, and about the same distance from 
George s Island ; a battery on the east side, about 
two miles below, or without George s Island ; a bat 
tery also at the town ; the ship-yard and Arsenal 
about a mile above the town, where there is another 
battery. The basin begins just above the ship-yard, 
and extends up about six miles northerly, from east 
to west. Between three and four miles above the 
Navy Yard was a block-house, at a place called the 
Narrows. The citadel is on a high hill, back of the 
town, at the distance of a quarter of a mile, and 
commands both the town and harbour. The basin is 
very spacious, capable, perhaps, to contain the whole 
navy of England. 

I have just called at the Honorable Mr. Bowdoin s. 
He has preserved a chart of the harbour of Halifax; has 
made several inquiries of the gentleman I mentioned 
in my last, who, I believe, without the least suspicion, 
answered every one of them. Mr. Bowdoin is now 
making some minutes explanatory of the chart and 
the information he has received from the gentleman. 
The chart and minutes he will forward by to-morrow s 
or the next post, to your Excellency. I am looking 
out for the best pilots, and believe shall find a num 
ber of very good ones. 

By the last accounts from Penobscot, there were 
appearances of an evacuation, or the removal of a 
part of the ordnance and troops to some other place. 
The garrison at Penobscot, at present, is by no means 
strong, at most not more than four hundred. Captain 
La Touche, of his most Christian Majesty s frigate the 
Hermione, in his late cruise, ran into Penobscot Bay, 
where he lay for some time, made several signals, 
and took a plan of the works, which he has forwarded to the Minister at Philadelphia. It is said the 
appearance of this frigate in the Bay has caused a 
great consternation and alarm. 

I have just established a correspondence with Ge 
neral Wadsworth, who commands the troops in the 
eastern parts of this State, and with Colonel Allen, 
at Machias, and have requested every piece of intelligence they may be able to obtain, either from Hali 
fax or Penobscot. 

The last night,, I received most alarming accounts 
from West Point, of the scantiness of provisions and 
rum at that post, A quantity of the latter is on the 
road to Springfield. Since I have been here, I have 
been endeavouring to promote the recruiting service 
all in my power; but the Court unfortunately stop 
ping the towns bounties, in the settlements with the 
soldiers, has almost totally prevented enlistments. 
The new Assembly convened this day. I apprehend 
they will go any lengths that are recommended, to 
complete their quota, even by drafts, if they cannot 
be otherwise obtained. I wish to know your Excel 
lency s pleasure, whether I shall urge it, arid how 
far. 

The issuing Commissary here informs me that there 
are upwards of nine hundred quintals of dry codfish 
in the stores, a considerable part of which will be 
in danger of spoiling in the course of the summer, if 
it is not issued. What pity it is that the army, in 
their present straits, cannot be relieved by it. 

A report prevails, to-day, that the Trumbull frigate 
and a French ship have re-taken the Iris, formerly 
the Hancock frigate, off Sandy Hook. I hope it will 
be confirmed. I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

WILLIAM HEATH. 
FROM JOSEPH REED. 

Philadelphia, June 5, 1780. 

DEAR SIR, 

Your kind and truly obliging favor, of the 28th 
ultimo, came safely to hand, and, the oftener I pe 
ruse it, the more fully sensible I am of the justice 
and importance of its contents. I do not know by 
what means the expected assistance from France has 
been procured; but it will certainly give a complex 
ion to the alliance in future, according to the recep 
tion it meets with here. I should be very apprehen 
sive, from the different state of improvement of the 
two countries, and perverseness of human nature, 
which often leads us to expect more than can be ob 
tained, and be chagrined at the disappointment, that, 
with all possible attention and care, difficulties will 
arise, and that it will greatly add to the burden laid 
upon you. But, if they should want necessaries, when 
the country abounds in them, we shall justly forfeit 
any pretensions to respect and friendship, and be 
come contemptible, not only to them, but to the 
world, and even to ourselves. Our difficulties lie 
with the rich, and not with the poor. While the warwas conducted with emissions, the aid of the former 
was not wanted; that of the latter was to be had, 
and may be had now, upon the same terms, that is, 
giving them a support for their labors; but to fight 
and starve, or work and starve, are equally impracti 
cable. 

In my opinion we have, in some degree, miscalculated the abilities of the country, and entirely the 
disposition of the people to bear taxes in the neces 
sary extent. The country, not immediately the seat 
of either army, is richer than when the war began; 
but the long disuse of taxes, and their natural unpalatableness, have embarrassed the business exceedingly; and Tories, grumbling Whigs, and party, have 
all thrown in their aid to increase the discontent. 
These circumstances, which it w r as impossible to fore 
see in their full extent, made a foreign loan a mat 
ter of great importance, and even of indispensable 
necessity; and, if any thing has been omitted to ob 
tain it, which we may yet retrieve, I should hope no 
time will be lost. 

The failure of the Eastern States to supply beef 
will be attended with some disagreeable effects here ; 
for all the money we had, or expected soon, has 
been furnished to procure this article, and, of course, 
our means of procuring flour proportionably diminished. The State made an effort, on this account, 
which no other has equalled, as they mortgaged anestate, belonging to the public, in the neighbourhood 
of this city, for the special purpose of supplying the 
army, leaving the taxes for the general use of the 
United States. But this money, though secure in 
every other event than that of our failing in the 
contest, and drawing an interest, has met with em 
barrassments and opposition, partly from interested 
and partly from other motives, which have very much 
delayed the supplies. We have, at length, got in 
motion, and, I hope, shall be able to get a supply of 
flour for the summer ; but the shock paper money 
has received, subjects all our resources to the ca 
price of interested or perverse individuals, more than 
is consistent with our safety or honor. 

The address of the Committee, accompanied with a 
letter from yourself, came at a seasonable moment, 
just as the House of Assembly was about to rise. 
They immediately passed a law for raising two men 
out of every company of militia, which I had en 
deavoured, but in vain, to effect last spring. This 
will produce about one thousand men from the whole 
State, about six hundred of which will go to fill 
up the ranks of the Continental army. The re 
mainder we must endeavour to throw upon the fron 
tiers, or some of our oldest and most established 
counties are in danger of becoming a frontier. In 
short, there is no pacifying them without a body of 
troops, though experience has long decided how in 
adequate a defensive war is for support against the 
Indians. 

The representation of the distress for want of meat, 
produced an immediate exertion, of which I hope the 
benefit must be felt by this time. It is true, many 
of the cattle are not fit for slaughter, but they are 
the best we have. It was thought best to continue 
this business, at least for some weeks, in order to 
have a stock in possession, and of consequence they 
will be continued for some time; proceeding to camp 
upon this principle, that, if you have none better, 
these must serve, and if you have, the season of the 
year will admit their being kept till they are better. 

We had proceeded thus far, and there seemed to 
be a very good disposition in all to advance the necessary measures, with as much expedition as delibe 
rative bodies usually do, or are capable of. The 
vesting extraordinary powers in the Executive was 
not so well relished, and it was too delicate a sub 
ject to be much pressed by me, especially as there 
appeared some reluctance on this point; and, it is 
probable, the House would have adjourned without 
touching upon it, had it not been so forcibly urged 
in your private letter. I was extremely embarrassed ; 
I did not see any chance of its being done, but by 
letting them know that it was deemed by you a 
matter not of mere importance, but of indispensable 
necessity. This was done in a manner the most 
guarded and confidential, and had the desired effect, 
as they have vested the Executive with the power 
to declare martial law, so far as they shall deem necessary? ftftd which gives us a power of doing what 
may be necessary, without attending to the ordinary 
forms of law. I have the pleasure to observe, the 
measure is generally satisfactory; and as we shall en 
deavour to exercise it with prudence and moderation, 
I hope it may be productive of the good effects ex 
pected from it. 

The loss of Charleston, with its garrison, and stores, 
which I think a very probable event, notwithstanding 
the sanguine hopes of some, and doubts of others, 
will, it must be presumed, rouse us from the insensi 
bility with which we have hitherto carried on the 
war since 1777. And yet the scene is so distant, 
and the danger apparently remote, that I am not 
certain of this effect. The arrival of a few vessels 
from Statia, or capture of as many, seems to be an 
event more interesting, than an advantage gained or 
lost by the enemy, however considerable. And ourcountry friends find their patriotism abate, as their 
interests are affected by duties or taxes. I am in 
clined to think some stroke of adverse fortune neces 
sary, and that lasting good may flow from it ; for, 
pretend what we may, the country is so much re 
moved from the distress of the war, and really has 
the three requisites of war, men, provisions, and iron, 
if not in abundance, in sufficiency for all our wants, 
our only difficulty is to draw them forth. And for 
this, two things are essentially necessary; namely, 
union among the States, generally and particularly. 
The parties in Congress have weakened the influ 
ence and lessened the weight of that body, and the 
internal divisions have had the like effect on the Go 
vernments ; so that every measure, however necessary 
for the general good, has been timid, feeble, and lan 
guid, each fearing to give his adversary some advan 
tage ; while the disaffected and mercenary have raised 
their heads, with an astonishing degree of insolence, 
to the great discouragement of the Whigs, especially 
in the middling and lower classes of life, who, having 
been distressed by their attachment to our cause, and 
their minds neither feeling, nor perhaps capable of 
feeling, what is called liberality of spirit towards an 
enemy, have been mortified to find themselves no 
way distinguished, but by their sufferings. It is clearthat the Royal cause, both in this State and Mary, 
land, derives great advantage from the division of 
the Whigs ; for, in the rage and discontent of party, 
auxiliaries are so acceptable, that we are not apt 
to scrutinize their motives and principles too narrow 
ly. Upon these considerations, I have ever thought 
it a most necessary duty to sacrifice, as far as I am 
capable, any smaller resentments, and, far from declining the paths of peace, to seek them. I have 
made more advances than one. The exposing my 
life to save that of my principal enemies, when they 
would otherwise have fallen a collective sacrifice to 
their own imprudence and to popular resentment, 
though an act of duty in my station, might have 
been evaded on many plausible pretexts. But it 
seems to be the allotment of Providence, that, in this 
respect, I am to be unhappy. 

Conceiving it a proper time to write, and make a 
great and general effort for our national safety and 
honor, a few days before I was favored with yoursentiments on this subject, waiving all sorts of punc 
tilio, I made a direct overture. I can only say, it 
was not accepted ; but it was of so explicit and unequivocal a nature, as to leave no farther ground, unless time and a change of circumstances should pro 
duce it. I am, however, happy to find, that I have 
met your opinion in this respect, and beg you to 
believe, not only that I was sincere on that occasion, 
but that, as the public good and your ease appearconnected in some degree with it, I shall embrace 
any favorable opportunity to renew it. 

I feel, exceedingly feel, for the peculiarity of yoursituation, my dear Sir, and also fear that your health 
may suffer in the conflict. But when I consider what 
just conceptions you have of the importance of the 
prize for which we contend, the progress already, and 
the abounding affection and confidence of the country, I cannot but believe you may draw great conso 
lation and support, that the present difficulties will 
lay a foundation for some system of solid supply, 
and a just consideration of the army, which has been 
too generally viewed through a very mistaken me 
dium. For myself, I shall only add, that the same 
motives which led me to leave domestic enjoyments 
and lucrative ease, in 1775, and partake your early 
exertions, now strengthened by more knowledge and 
warmer attachment, will induce me to strain every 
nerve, and run every risk, to promote the public service, as the most acceptable testimony I can give 
you of the truth of these professions. And if there 
is any particular case or occasion, which, from want 
of knowledge or information, I may be likely to 
overlook, I shall esteem it a particular favor to be 
honored with a few lines, to which I shall pay the 
most special and animated attention. 
I think it very happy, that Major Lee s corps is 
in the vicinity of this place; as, in case of emergen 
cy, they may be wanted to execute measures which, 
though necessary, are unpalatable, and often ill exe 
cuted, where the feelings of acquaintance and per 
sonal friendship operate against the public measures. 
They are in exceeding good quarters, on the best 
terms with the inhabitants, and, I presume, must be 
far too late to render any assistance to our friends 
in the south. 

Mrs. Heed, who is pretty well recovered, returns 
her respectful regards and thanks to Mrs. Washing 
ton and yourself for your polite attention, in which I 
beg leave to include mine; and am, with the most 
unfeigned respect and esteem, dear Sir, 

Your obliged and most obedient humble servant, 

JOSEPH REED.

FROM COLONEL ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 

8 June, 1780. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have seen the enemy. Those in view I calculate 
at about three thousand.* There may be, and pro 
bably are, enough others out of sight. They have 
sent all their horse to the other side, except about 
fifty or sixty. Their baggage, it is agreed on all 
hands, has also been sent across, and their wounded. 
It is not ascertained that any of their infantry have 
passed to the other side. There are four or five 
hundred on the opposite point, but it is uncertain 
whether they are those who went from this side, or 
those who wore on Statcn Island. I rather suppose 
the former. 

Different conjectures may be made. The present 
movement may be calculated to draw us down, and 
betray us into an action. They may have desisted 
from their intention of passing till night, for fear of 
our falling upon their rear. I believe this is the 
case, for, as they have but few boats, it would certainly be a delicate manoeuvre to cross in our face. 

We are taking measures to watch their motions 
to-night as closely as possible. An incessant, but 
very light skirmishing; very few boats, not more 
than enough to carry three or four hundred men 
at a time. It is likely more will come down this 
evening I have the honor to be 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

ALEXANDER HAMILTON.

FROM GOVERNOR JEFFERSON. 

Richmond, 11 June, 1780. 

SIR, 

Major Galvan, as recommended by your Excellency, 
was despatched to his station without delay, and has 
been furnished with every thing he desired, as far as 
we were able. The line of expresses formed between 
us, is such as will communicate intelligence from oneto the other in twenty-three hours. I have forwarded 
to him information of our disasters in the south, as 
they have come to me. 

Our intelligence from the southward is most la 
mentably defective. Though Charleston has been in 
the hands of the enemy a month, we hear nothing 
of their movements which can be relied on. Rumors 
are, that they are penetrating northward. To remedy 
this defect, I shall immediately establish a line of 
expresses from hence to the neighbourhood of their 
army, and send thither a sensible, judicious person, 
to give us information of their movements. This in 
telligence will, I hope, be conveyed to us at the rate 
of one hundred and twenty miles in the twenty-fourhours. They set out to their stations to-morrow. I 
wish it were possible, that a like speedy line of 
communication could be formed from hence to yourExcellency s head-quarters. Perfect and speedy in 
formation of what is passing in the south, might put 
it in your power, perhaps, to frame your measures 
by theirs. 

There is really nothing to oppose the progress of 
the enemy northward but the cautious principles of 
the military art. North Carolina is without arms. 
We do not abound. Those we have are freely imparted to them; but such is the state of their re 
sources, that they have not been able to move a 
single musket from this State to theirs. All the 
wagons we can collect have been furnished to the 
Baron de Kalb, and are assembled for the march of 
twenty-five hundred men, under General Stevens, of 
Culpepper, who will move on the 19th instant. I have 
written to Congress, to hasten supplies of arms and 
military stores for the Southern States, and, particu 
larly, to aid us with cartridge-paper and boxes, the 
want of which articles, small as they are, renders ourstores useless. The want of money cramps every 
effort. This will be supplied by the most unpalat 
able of all substitutes, force. Your Excellency will 
readily conceive that, after the loss of one army, oureyes are turned towards the other, and that we comfort ourselves, if any aids can be furnished by you, 
without defeating the operations more beneficial to 
the general Union, they will be furnished. At the 
same time, I am happy to find that the wishes of 
the people go no further, as far as I have an opportunity of learning their sentiments. Could arms be 
furnished, I think this State and North Carolina 
would embody from ten to fifteen thousand militia 
immediately, and more if necessary. 

I hope, ere long, to be able to give you a more 
certain statement of the enemy s as well as our situ 
ation, which I shall not fail to do. I inclose you a 
letter from Major Gal van, being the second I have 
forwarded to you. With sentiments of the most per 
fect esteem and respect, I have the honor to be, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

THOMAS JEFFERSON.

FROM GOVERNOR- CLINTON. 

Kingston, 13 June, 1780. 

DEAR SIR, 

Your Excellency s letter of the 10th instant, ad 
dressed to Lieutenant-Governor Cortlandt, w r as delivered to me yesterday evening, and I immediately for 
warded, by express, your letter to Brigadier-General 
James Clinton, and urged him to the utmost expedi 
tion in his march to West Point. I inclose yourExcellency a copy of a letter from my brother, of 
the 10th instant, giving the particular disposition of 
the regiments of his brigade, by which it appears, 
that Colonel Gansevoort s was employed in escorting 
a supply of provisions to Fort Schuyler. As this appeared to me to be a business of too much import 
ance to admit of delay, or be intrusted to the care 
of a weak party, I have therefore taken the liberty 
of advising him to continue this regiment on that 
service until it shall be accomplished, which, I hope, 
will meet your Excellency s approbation. 

I am apprehensive that the other three regiments 
(they having, previous to the receipt of your Excel 
lency s order, marched to the respective stations men 
tioned in my brother s letter) will not be able to 
reach West Point on as early a day as might have 
been expected. The militia, in the vicinity of the 
posts in the Highlands, were, before I left Poughkeepsie, put under orders to hold themselves in con 
stant readiness to take the field on the shortest no 
tice ; and, on the signals of alarm being given, those 
on the west side of the river are to repair to West 
Point, and those on the east side are to rendezvous 
at Fishkill, and there wait for further orders. Of this 
I apprised General Howe at the time. I now write 
to him on the subject; and, if it should be thought 
necessary by your Excellency, I will immediately 
order such part of them to West Point as your Ex 
cellency or General Howe may direct, until the arrival of General Clinton s brigade. 

Your Excellency s several letters of the 23d and 
28th ultimo, and 2d instant, were received and opened by Lieutenant-Go vernor Cortlandt, in my absence, 
and such of them as were proper to be commu 
nicated to the Legislature, with the letters from the 
Committee of Congress, of the 25th ultimo, were laid 
before them; and I am happy in being able to as 
sure your Excellency, that they give me reason to 
hope that they will yield a compliance with the re40* 
quisitions made of this State, on this important occa 
sion, except in the article of forage, of which this 
State is entirely exhausted. 

The moment I closed my last letter to General 
Sclmyler, which has been communicated to your Ex 
cellency, I embarked for Albany, with an intention 
to intercept the enemy, under Sir John Johnson, in 
their retreat from Tryon county, or to succour Fort 
Schuyler, if invested, which I then apprehended might 
have been the case. On my arrival at Albany, I soon 
had reason to believe that the report of a force having marched against that post was merely calculated 
to favor Sir John Johnson s incursion ; and, as the 
militia had collected, he had retired about six miles 
from Johnstown, and was preparing to return to Ca 
nada by a route more northward than that by which 
he entered the country. I therefore directed Colonel 
Van Schaick, who was at Fort Hunter, to march for 
ward and hang close upon and harass his rear, to 
afford time for me to gain his front with the militia, 
to the north of Albany, which I expected to be able 
to effect, by striking into Jessup s Patent from Fort 
Edward. But, before my letter reached Colonel Van 
Schaick, the militia in that quarter, being out of 
provisions, and finding Sir John retiring, were returning home, which was also the case with those who 
assembled, and I expected to find at Fort Edward. 

Under these circumstances, I found it necessary to 
alter my plan, to that of passing Lake George, and 
meeting the enemy on the borders of Lake Champlain, which (as the enemy appeared to be much 
fatigued by their long march, and it was to be presumed would move slow as soon as they were ad 
vanced such a distance as to conceive themselves out 
of danger) I conceived might still be practicable. I 
accordingly reassembled the militia, and, with the 
levies stationed at Fort Edward, and a detachment of 
Warner s regiment, crossed Lake George. But, though 
I had a force, superior to that of the enemy, advanced as far as Bulwagger s Bay, below Crown Point, 
the place at which the enemy embarked, within eight 
days after my leaving this place, I was so unfortu 
nate as to find (judging by the information of ourscouts, and by the appearance of the bushes and 
bark the enemy had prepared to hut themselves, but 
did not put up, and by other marks as well as the 
sailing of their vessels) we were about six hours too 
late. 

I would fain hope, however, that the attempt, though 
unsuccessful, may be attended with the good effect 
of deterring the enemy from a similar enterprise, as 
it will, at least, discover to them the danger which 
may attend it. I think it my duty to inform yourExcellency that, on my request, I was joined by a 
party of two hundred and forty of the militia of the 
Grants, under Colonel Warner and Major Allen, whose 
behaviour on this occasion, in every respect, was very 
agreeable to me. I beg your Excellency will pardon me in troubling you with this long detail, as I 
wish it only to be received as an apology for not 
succeeding in an attempt which I gave you reason to 
believe was practicable, and which undoubtedly might 
have been effected had I found matters in the train 
I had reason to expect. I have the honor to be, 
with the greatest respect and esteem, dear Sir, 
Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

GEORGE CLINTON.

FROM JOSEPH JONES ; IN CONGRESS. 

19 June, 1780. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have your favor of the 31st ultimo, in answer 
to my several letters ; and was then impressed with, 
and still feel great anxiety on account of, our public 
affairs. The present distress is to he ascribed, in 
great part, to the resolution not to issue any more 
bills of credit before a sufficiency of money is pro 
vided, and supplies procured, for the army. Had 
proper precaution been taken in these matters, and 
the new scheme of finance been ready for the public 
consideration, the determination not to increase the 
quantity of money, and the alteration introduced by 
the new system, would not have been so sensibly 
felt, or occasioned the distress, in the several depart 
ments, they have produced. From these, I think, we 
are nearly emerging, as the new money is coming 
into use in the several States, and will probably 
greatly relieve us. 

But, by these and several other proceedings, Con 
gress has been gradually surrendering, or throwing 
upon the several States, the exercise of powers they 
should have retained, and, to their utmost, have ex 
ercised themselves, until, at length, they have scarce 
a, powder left but such as concerns foreign transac 
tions ; for, as to the army, the Congress is at present 
little more than the medium through which the wants 
of the army are conveyed to the States. This body 
never had, or, at least, in few instances ever exer 
cised, powers adequate to the purposes of war ; and, 
such as they had, have been, from embarrassment 
and difficulties, frittered away to the States ; and it 
will be found, I fear, very difficult to recover them. 
A resolution passed, the other day, desiring the States 
to inform us what they had done upon certain requi 
sitions for some time past, that we might know what 
we had to rely on. This may probably serve as a 
basis for assuming powers, should the answers afford 
an opening. 

Other resolutions are now before us. By one of 
them, the States are desired to give express power 
for calling forth men, provisions, and money, for carrying on the war, for the common defence. Others 
go to the assumption of them immediately. The first, 
I have no doubt, will pass this body, but will, I ex 
pect, sleep with the States. The others, I believe, 
will die where they are ; for, so cautious are some 
of offending the States in this respect, a/ / gentleman, 
the other day, plainly told us, upon a proposition to 
order some armed vessels to search the/ vessels going 
out, to prevent the exportation of flour, though, if an 
embargo was laid in the Delaware, asj in this State, 
he consented to the measure, otherwise he never 
would agree to such exercise of power. 

The merchant bankers in this city are making 
generous exertions to procure and send forward to 
the army a supply of flour, and will afford us great 
help in that article. The Massachusetts Delegates 
read us letters, whereby it appears their State have 
raised four thousand men for the army, and are em 
bodying four thousand more, to be ready, if wanting. Gates, Weedon, and Morgan, are ordered to the 
Southern department. Five thousand militia are re 
quired from Virginia to join that army, and threethousand to be held in readiness from North Caro 
lina, four thousand, and two thousand to be held in 
readiness. Twenty-five hundred of the Virginia mili 
tia were to inarch yesterday. By our accounts, it 
would seem those States are somewhat roused from 
their slumber, but have rejected the scheme of finance 
of the 18th March last, which, I fear, will have a 
bad effect on the credit of the money of the other 
States that have agreed to the measure. 

Governor Jefferson has transmitted us a state of 
the Virginia troops, taken from the last returns, by 
which it appears we have, in the different corps, fourthousand and eleven men in service to the 30th Sep 
tember, and for the war, or longer period than the 
30th September next, including those captured in 
Charleston. This surprises me. But the fact appears 
to be so ; and where they are, or what is become of 
them, is strange. I cannot inform you whether ourLegislature have ordered a draft to fill up the defi 
ciencies, as we have no mail this week from the 
southward, it stopping at Annapolis, for want of a 
rider to bring it to this place, the late rider having quitted the business. AVith great esteem, I am, 
dear Sir, 

Your obedient, humble servant, 

JOSEPH JONES.

FROM JOSEPH REED. 

Philadelphia, 20 June, 1780. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have received your favor of the 16th instant, 
directing the march of the city light-horse, for which 
the necessary orders will be given, and they will 
proceed with all possible despatch. Upon the new 
plan of our militia, there are light-horse attached to 
the troops of every county. The short time since 
the plan has been adopted has not permitted a 
thorough execution; but, if your Excellency should 
be of opinion they would be specially useful, I shall 
endeavour to have them completed as soon as may 
be. The troop of the county of Philadelphia is al 
ready well mounted, armed, and in uniform. I do 
assure your Excellency every stimulus has been used 
to forward the recruits. According to information, 
they are chiefly selected, and only wait a proper 
equipment; but, as I found this was tedious in the 
country, I directed them to be sent hither, and they 
are now coming in. I am of opinion, if your Excel 
lency could spare a few officers, say five or six, pru 
dent and discreet, who could bear with the oddities 
and humors of the persons with whom they will 
have to do, it might forward the men; and, as it 
is proposed to set about a voluntary additional en 
listment, as soon as this is over, we are sanguineenough to believe some men might be had. For 
this purpose some clever sergeants would be of great 
service. 

The spirit, which your Excellency seems to wish, 
I think, is recovered beyond expectation. The loss 
of Charleston, like many other seeming misfortunes, 
may perhaps (heavy as it now appears) prove a real 
blessing to America, A measure has been set on 
foot here to establish a bank, which, from the unani 
mity with which it is espoused, seems likely to pro 
duce considerable advantages, and supplies to the 
army. It was at first constructed upon so narrow a 
scale as to meet with difficulties; but, being since 
enlarged, I hope will prove a more fruitful source of 
supply than the occasional expedients from time to 
time adopted. Whatever measure promotes the pub 
lic good, shall have my aid and concurrence, from 
whatever quarter it proceeds. 
The ladies of the place have also caught the happy 
contagion, and, in a few days, Mrs. Reed will have 
the honor of writing to you on that subject. It is 
expected she will have a sum equal to one hundred 
thousand pounds, to be laid out according to yourExcellency s direction (in the absence of Mrs. Washington) in such a way as may be thought most 
honorable and gratifying to the brave old soldiers 
who have borne so great a share of the burden of 
this war. I thought it best to mention it in this 
way to your Excellency, for your consideration, as it 
may tend to forward the benevolent scheme of the 
donors with despatch. I must observe, that the ladies 
have excepted such articles of necessity as clothing, 
&c., which the States are bound to provide. 

We have just heard that Mrs. Washington is upon 
the road to this city, so that we shall have the benefit of her advice and assistance here, and, if neces 
sary, refer afterwards to your Excellency. I am, with 
the greatest respect and regard, dear Sir, 

Your most obedient and very humble servant, 

JOSEPH REED, President,

FRANK EPPES TO GENERAL LEE.

Kemp s, 31 March, 1776. 
SIR, 

I congratulate you on your appointment and arrival, and shall 
immediately proceed to execute the commands I had the honor 
to receive this night. At present I can only say, that Lord 
Dunmore s intrenchment is near a quarter of a mile in length, 
running nearly in a straight course from cove to cove, including Tucker s Mills and bake-house, with about two acres of 
land, in which they keep their hospital and exercise the blacks, 
whose number is between two and three hundred. These, to 
gether with about forty regulars of the fourteenth regiment, the 
marines of the Liverpool, Otter, and sometimes the Roebuck, 
and the Tory volunteers of Norfolk, who may perhaps amount 
to near a hundred, compose Lord Dunmore s whole force, unless you include the sailors on board a fleet of seventy or eighty 
sail of small vessels, with a few large ones, whose numbers it 
is impossible to ascertain. 

The fleet are furnished with water from the distillery on oneside of the river, and Tucker s Mills on the other side; the 
former within two hundred yards of the Dunmore, and in con 
venient reach from the Otter; and the latter, included within 
the intrenchment, and under the command of the Liverpool and 
Otter, which have stationed themselves in the best manner for 
the protection of it. The ground near it is rather higher than 
the retrenchment, but has no shelter for near a half mile be 
fore you get to it, being an open old field. The depth of the 
ditch, through which the water runs, is above eight feet, the 
width uncertain. 

I cannot, as yet, learn the number of cannon his Lordship has 
mounted, nor how many men constantly reside within their lines. 
They are supplied with many conveniences from Portsmouth, 
and the Western Branch; and, if we had not continued at this 
post, the whole county of Princess Anne would have lain at 
their mercy, and the communication between Carolina arid the 
fleet have been opened, to the very great advantage of the lat 
ter. The scouting parties from this place have hitherto effect 
ually prevented on this side of the river, and if the 
same steps had been taken on the other side and on the West 
ern Branch, they would have been reduced to greater distress 
than they are at present. 

By an intrenchment, in the mouths of the cannon at the distillery, we might, perhaps, greatly annoy the enemy for a while, 
but there is no mode of preventing it on the other side of 
the river, without the possession of Tucker s Mills. In short, 
I do not think we can prevent them from watering with the 
force we have here. Besides the Liverpool, King Fisher, Otter, 
and Roebuck ships of war,, there are the Dunmore, the William, the Anna, ships of force, and a great number of armed 
tenders. If a raft could be privately constructed, we might do 
immense mischief to the crowd of vessels lying at Norfolk. 

I shall be able to give you a fuller account upon my re 
turn, which shall be with great expedition. There are many 
valuable effects belonging to the Tory prisoners in this county. 
I should be glad to receive some orders about them. In con 
sequence of a late act of Parliament, upon which the inclosed 
proclamation is founded, Lord Dunmore has seized upon all the 
vessels at Norfolk, whose owners are not on board, and con 
fiscated them to the King s use. There has been a very heavy 
firing yesterday and last night. I dare say above live hundred 
cannon in the Bay, or at sea. From the change of place, there 
seems to have been a smart pursuit. I sent out a party on 
horseback last night, who are not yet returned. 

I am, Sir, very respectfully, your most obedient servant, 

FRANK EFPES.

FROM GENERAL LEE TO GENERAL ROBERT HOWE, EDENTON, NORTH CAROLINA. 

Williamsburg, 5 April, 1776.
 
SIR, 

I had the pleasure of receiving yours the day before yes 
terday, and think myself very much flattered by the good opinion you have conceived of me. I wish you may never have 
reason to think you have formed it without foundation. I should 
have been extremely sorry had you put off your necessary 
jaunt to Carolina merely through attentions to me. Your presence there, at this time, must be of the greatest importance, 
and I fancy it will become every day more important. 

My own situation is extremely disagreeable from an uncertainty of the enemy s designs. I know not where to turn me, 
where to fix myself. I may be in the north, when, as Richard 
says, I should serve my sovereign in the west. I would wil 
lingly take a certain step, but, from the excessive prudence and 
economy of this Committee of Safety, am totally unprovided with 
the necessary materials. The distribution of their troops is like 
wise a masterpiece. I wonder they did not carry it still further, and post one or two men, by way of general security, in 
every individual gentleman s house. 

I beg, Sir, should Mr. Clinton land, and attempt to take 
post, that you will immediately inform me, by express, of his 
situation, circumstances, and force, as likewise of the state of 
your troops, regulars, militia, &c., of their numbers and quality, 
of their wants and deficiencies. Any assistance that we can afford yon, you may depend upon. I must apprise you that we 
have little or no cannon, and not a single tool for field works. 
How are you off in the article of intrenching tools? You can 
expect no arms. You will naturally ask what I mean by as 
sistance, with these exceptions. I mean, if the enemy make 
your Province their object, I will immediately march myself, 
with whatever troops can be spared. In the mean time, believe 
me, Sir, to be, with the greatest respect, 

Your most obedient and humble servant,

THE COMMITTEE OF SAFETY TO GENERAL LEE. 

Williamsburg, 10 April, 1776. 

The Committee of Safety, taking into consideration the state 
of this Colony, and supposing General Lee may wish to be 
fully advised of local circumstances, and with the steps which 
have been taken by the General Convention of this Colony, or 
the Committee of Safety under their appointment, respecting the 
army, have thought proper to represent, that the forces raised 
by the General Convention of Virginia, for the defence of this 
Colony, as well the two old regiments there raised as the seven 
battalions to be raised, were, by an ordinance of the Convention, put under the direction of the Committee ; and this Board 
was directed to provide for them arms, ammunition, tents, bed 
ding, clothing, provisions, and all necessaries, in such manner 
as the circumstances of this country would admit. The clothing is to be paid for by the soldiery ; all the rest to be furnished at the expense of the public. 

By a clause in this ordinance, founded on a hope that the 
whole nine battalions would be taken into Continental pay, it 
is ordained, " That the whole should be under the command 
of one Major-General, and two Brigadier-Generals, to be appointed by Congress, and the field and other officers to be appointed and commissioned by Convention," with a proviso, " That 
all appointments and commissions of Convention should become 
void, when Congress should commission the same officer, or 
appoint another in his stead." The Convention, also, considering the place of attack by the enemy uncertain, and knowing 
the whole coast from Norfolk to Alexandria on the Potomac 
equally exposed, were pleased to direct the stations of the troops 
as follows ; two regiments on the south side of James River, 
two between York and Rappahannoc Rivers, and two in the 
Northern Neck, with a proviso, " That on any emergency the 
Committee of Safety should have power to call them from those 
stations, but, so soon as the exigency ceased, they should be 
ordered back to their respective stations." 

In pursuance of this command of Convention, this Committee 
directed the rendezvous of the eight battalions (the ninth being raised for the sole defence of the Eastern Shore) at con 
venient places within the districts described, leaving it to the 
commanding officers of each battalion to station them at any 
place therein they should judge best for the service. And, in 
pursuance of the direction of Convention, this Committee madecontracts for victualling these battalions by the ration, at an 
agreed price, to be furnished at the particular stations, and varying in price according to the conveniency of each station. These 
contractors have accordingly laid in provisions, in proportion 
only to the number of troops allotted at such stations, and now 
serve all the troops. The Congress having as yet made no pro 
vision for such purposes. 

The Committee have also purchased clothing and necessaries 
to a very considerable amount, and stored them under the di 
rections of proper persons, as Commissaries of Stores at this 
place and at Fredericksburg, at the head of the Rappahannoc 
River, a place through which all stores from the northward 
must come, central with respect to our back country, whence a 
considerable quantity of linen is expected, and most convenient 
for supplying the two regiments in the Northern Neck, and oneon the south side of the Rappahannoc River. Out of these stores 
the whole eight battalions have been indiscriminately furnished 
with clothing and necessaries ; and even since it has been known 
that six of them have been taken upon the Continental esta 
blishment, the latter have also been paid out of our treasury? 
from necessity, to avoid any uneasiness through the want of a 
Continental fund here. 

This Committee, being advised that General Lee has been 
pleased to order the four northern battalions to this place, think 
it expedient to lay this short state of matters before him, (wishing to refer him to the ordinance of the Convention for his 
fuller information), with a view of learning from the General 
how far he expects this Board should be assisting in the departments heretofore assigned to this Committee by the Con 
vention, observing that all the contracts for victualling the troops 
must become void, so soon as the troops are finally removed 
from the particular stations. 

And we beg leave farther to observe, that the inhabitants 
of this Colony in general are badly armed, and that those in 
particular in and about the several stations, having spared their 
best arms to the soldiery intended for their immediate protec 
tion, will be more exposed than ever, and may be exceedingly 
alarmed, when the troops are called at a great distance from 
them, while the measures of the enemy, or their intended place 
of attack, are altogether unknown. This Committee beg General 
Lee to be assured, that they place entire confidence in his 
great military abilities, and sincerely congratulate the inhabit 
ants of this Colony on his acceptance of the chief command 
here, and will, as far as in their power, confine themselves to 
such a line of conduct as shall not interfere with his better 
judgment ; and therefore will most cheerfully cooperate with 
General Lee in every thing, in which he may think they can 
be of service; and to this end they wish to have a conference 
with General Lee upon the subject-matter of this representa 
tion, and upon all other occasions, when he shall judge it necessary. 

Signed for and by order of the Committee of Safety,

PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMMITTEE OF SAFETY. 

Williamsburg, 10 April, 17 70. 

The Committee, taking under their most serious consideration 
a letter from Major-General Lee, urging the necessity of removing the inhabitants of Norfolk and Princess Anne counties from 
the neighbourhood of our enemy, together with several letters 
from the Secretary of State, lately intercepted, and other papers ; 
and having been repeatedly informed, upon oath, by every per 
son that has escaped from Lord Dunmore s ships and the fleet at 
Norfolk, that there is a constant intercourse kept up between the 
inhabitants on the Norfolk side, who furnish the enemy with pro 
visions, and give intelligence of all our measures, which conduct 
has likewise been experienced frequently and complained of by 
the foregoing, and many other pregnant proofs, with a full con 
viction of the inimical disposition of many of the inhabitants in 
the neighbourhood of our enemy; and, convinced that all others 
who may be well disposed, and really attached to the common 
cause, must be exposed to the depredations of the enemy ; 

Do unanimously Resolve and Order, That all the inhabitants 
of Norfolk and Princess Anne counties at present residing be 
tween the enemy and our posts at Great Bridge and Kemp s 
Landing, and in a direct line from Kemp s Landing to the ocean, 
be immediately removed to some interior parts of this Colony ; 
and that those who are unable to remove themselves, be assisted 
by the public. And, for the better effecting such removal, it is 
further ordered that all live stock of the said inhabitants be immediately taken possession of by our army, and removed to a 
place of safety for the use of the owners ; and such part thereof 
as the owners may be willing to part with, be purchased by the 
Commissaries for the use of the forces, except where it may 
happen to be the property of such as have already retired to, or 
may hereafter join, Lord Dunmore. 

This Committee, considering the intelligence contained in the 
aforementioned letters from the Secretary of State, and reflecting on the uniform policy of the British Court, and the measures 
lately adopted in North Carolina, are fully convinced that ourenemies are solely encouraged to make their wicked attempts 
upon such Colonies wherein they can expect the best assistance 
from the persons disaffected to the American cause ; and are of 
opinion that the most likely means of securing this Colony from 
such attempts, will be to remove all suspicious persons beyond 
the influence of the enemy. This Board do therefore order, that 
all persons within the counties of Norfolk and Princess Anne, 
who have heretofore repaired to Lord Dunmore s standard and 
taken the oath prescribed by him, who thereby may have a reli 
ance on them to aid his measures, do immediately remove them 
selves to some interior parts of this Colony, at least thirty miles 
from the enemy ; and, the better to enforce such removal, it is 
further ordered, that all the male slaves of such suspected per 
sons, above the age of thirteen, and also the like slaves of the 
persons within the limits aforedescribed, be immediately taken 
into the custody and safe-keeping of some officer at our posts in 
Norfolk and Princess Anne, to be conveyed to some place off 
navigation, and to be returned to the owners, after they shall 
have settled at some secure place, upon the further order of this 
Committee. 

Resolved, That a sum of money, not exceeding one thousand 
pounds, be advanced to Willis Reddick, James Murdaugh, and 
Andrew Meade ; and they are hereby empowered and requested 
to make proper provision for these necessary purposes, and, in 
general, to superintend this important business, and be assisting 
in the execution thereof, in the most humane manner the nature 
of the case will admit of. And it is earnestly recommended to 
all persons who can provide habitations for such persons so re 
moving, to give notice thereof in the Virginia Gazette as speed 
ily as possible.

GENERAL LEE TO GENERAL ARMSTRONG. 

Williamsburg, 10 April, 1776. 

It has ever been the opinion of General Lee, that instructions 
to an officer how to act, in a distant command, is impertinence 
and mere pedantry. He desires, therefore, Brigadier-General 
Armstrong to use his own judgment and discretion in his command, lie only requires that, immediately upon his arrival in 
South Carolina, he (General Armstrong) should make out returns 
of the strength, condition, and quality of the different corps, and 
in general of the force of the whole Province ; that he should 
likewise inform himself, not only of the strength of Georgia, but 
of the politics and disposition of the people, and transmit the 
substance of his information on these subjects to General Lee, 
directed to Brigadier-General Howe in North Carolina, who will 
forward them to head-quarters, wherever they happen to be. 

He hopes and recommends it to General Armstrong, that he 
will be jealous of ceding an inch of ground, as in slave countries 
so much depends on opinion, and the opinion -which the slaves 
will entertain of our superiority or inferiority will naturally keep 
pace with our maintaining or giving ground. For these reasons, 
Charleston must be defended with the utmost obstinacy. If the 
enemy appear on the coast of South Carolina, and show an 
intention of lodging themselves in that Province, the Brigadier is 
to send an express immediately to the Major- General, and he is 
to assure the inhabitants, as an encouragement to act with vigor, 
that a strong force shall be immediately marched to their assist 
ance. 



GENERAL LEE TO THE COMMITTEE OF SECRECY OF THE PRO 
VINCE OF NORTH CAROLINA. 

Williamsburg, 13 April, 1776. 
GENTLEMEN, 

I had yesterday the honor of yours of the 9th. The real 
ardor and public spirit of your Province, not only reflect great 
honor on its own character, but there is reason to think that 
your example will inspire others with that vigor and decision 
which are alone wanting to insure victory. Your resolution to 
raise a body of liglit-liorse is, in my opinion, most judicious. It 
is a species of troops without which an army is a defective and 
lame machine. I have proposed and urged it in this Province. 
They talk of adopting the measure, but nothing is as yet done. 
I could wish, Gentlemen, that your horses may be of the strongest sort, so that, on pressing occasions, a dragoon may be able 
to carry a foot soldier behind him. 

I am sorry you are so deficient in powder. I have wrote to 
Congress on the occasion, and hope soon to be able to supply 
you. As to arms, I believe it will be impossible to procure 
them, unless you have on the frontiers a sufficient number of 
rifles. For my own part, I like them even better for the batta 
lions than muskets, particularly if you can conciliate your men 
to the use of spears. I never had in my life any opinion of 
bayonets. My opinion may appear singular, but it is certain 
they never have been used, though we hear so frequently of marching with bayonets. For these reasons, I would propose that you 
should collect all the rifles possible. After having regulated the 
necessary business of this Province, I shall pay my respects, in 
person, to your Committee, and thank them, viva voce, for the 
good opinion they are pleased to express of me ; and am, Gentle 
men, your most obedient, humble servant, 

CHARLES LEE. 

P. S. It is of the utmost importance that you provide a suffi 
cient number of proper boats for the transportation of troops over 
your respective rivers. 



THOMAS BURKE, CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE OF SECRECY OF 
NORTH CAROLINA, TO GENERAL LEE. 

Halifax, 22 April, 1776. 
SIR, 

We think it our duty to inform you that the body of British 
troops, under the command of Cornwallis, supposed to consist of 
three thousand men, are to land at Little River, about thirty miles 
to the south of Cape Fear ; from thence to penetrate by the Lake 
Wiggaman into the interior parts of this Province, expecting a 
junction with the disaffected inhabitants, Highlanders and Regu 
lators, whose residence and influence are principally in that vi 
cinity. The Regulators and Highlanders, notwithstanding ourlate success against them, are by no means subdued. Upon the 
least encouragement of receiving support from Governor Martin 
and his expected friends, we doubt not they will again be in 
motion. 

An intestine enemy in our bosom, a large body of British 
troops expected upon our sea-coast, only two regular regiments 
yet embodied for the service of this Colony, our militia diffused 
through a large, extensive Province, and the great difficulty of 
drawing them to act together at a point, with a great scarcity of 
fire-arms, are circumstances which induce us to wish for yourpresence here immediately, and suggest the necessity of youraffording us assistance from the Province of Virginia with all 
possible expedition, as the troops from Britain are every hourexpected, and in all probability are now off this coast. Our mili 
tia are scarce recovered from the fatigue of their last campaign. 
You may, however, be assured that every thing may be expected 
from them, within their abilities, that the warmest attachment to 
the American cause and true spirit can inspire. Your presence 
would give them great confidence, and have a happy influence 
upon the whole military arrangements of this Colony. We have 
the honor to be, with great respect, Sir, 

Your most obedient, humble servant, 

THOMAS BURKE, Chairman. 



GENERAL LEE TO GENERAL MOORE. 

Suffolk, 23 April, 1776. 

SIR, 

I am at present occupied in clearing the country of the Tories. 
My perplexity with respect to the enemy s real design is, you 
may easily conceive, very considerable, since the overthrow of 
their plans by Colonel Caswell s victory. I cannot persuade my 
self that your Province will be their aim, but rather this or 
South Carolina. I am apt to think that their appearance at 
Cape Fear is rather a feint. However, I may be mistaken. In 
deed, I can alone act from surmise. 

If any further circumstances give you reason to believe that 
they really intend to make an impression in your Province, I 
beg you will inform me of it. You will likewise send me a 
minuie detail of your strength and your weakness, in what you 
are abundant, in what you are deficient. I will myself immedi 
ately join you, and bring with me what force you require, and I 
can procure. I am, Sir, 

Your most obedient, humble servant, 

CHARLES LEE. 



EDMUND PENDLETON, PRESIDENT OF THE COMMITTEE OF SAFETY, 
TO GENERAL LEE. 

Williamsburg, 5 May, 1776. 
SIR, 

I had the honor of laying your obliging favor of the 4th 
before the Committee of Safety, who are perfectly satisfied of 
your intention not to encroach on the civil authority, but to 
confine your operations to the proper line of military duty, of 
which you are so good a judge. On our parts, we beg leave 
to assure you, Sir, we shall be always ready to give you every 
necessary assistance in our power for accomplishing the great 
purpose we all have in view. When we reflect on the several 
reasons by you assigned for your proceedings at Portsmouth, 
we must approve of the whole of your conduct to those people ; 
it being one of the inevitable consequences of this kind of war, 
that legal modes of inquiry must yield to necessity, and what 
the public safety seems to require should be immediately done, 
even though some injury may arise to innocent individuals, to 
whom the community may render compensation when tranquillity 
is restored. 

On this last consideration, we request you will give directions 
to retain the molasses, salt, and other articles for the use of 
the public, and that, in the inventory thereof to be returned, 
each individual s property may be distinguished, as far as possible ; that, if in any future period they can satisfy the legis 
lature of their innocence (which, however improbable, is yet 
possible), the quantum of their loss may be ascertained. We 
are pleased that you confined the conflagration at present to 
the houses of a few of the most notorious offenders, since, al 
though the reasons you urge appear forcible for the destruction 
of the whole, it may give more general satisfaction to have the 
subject first discussed by the representatives of the people, to 
whom, in their approaching session, we will communicate yourfavor, and transmit to you their resolution thereupon. 
VOL. IT. 42 
"We are much obliged by the intelligence sent us respecting 
that arch-traitor, old Goodrich, who is so notorious an offender 
that we suppose there will be no difficulty in his conviction. 
We shall always have pleasure in keeping up a free and friendly 
correspondence with you ; and are, with great respect, Sir, yourmost obedient servants, 

EDMUND PENDLETON, 

For the Committee. 



GENERAL LEE TO DANIEL OF ST. THOMAS JENIFER, PRESIDENT 
OF THE COUNCIL OF SAFETY OF MARYLAND. 

Williamsburg, G May, 1776. 
DEAR SIR, 

I find that I am extremely censured, not only by your Board, 
but by a multitude of others, for my letter to Mr. Purviance, 
with respect to the seizure of Mr. Eden s person and papers. 
But I really think, when the circumstances are explained, that 
the censure will appear unjust, and that I was neither violent, 
assuming, nor precipitate. 

When the Secretary of State s letter to your Governor was 
put into my hands, I naturally concluded that, could we possess ourselves of all Mr. Eden s papers, the whole machinations 
of the Ministry might be discovered, that this discovery might 
enable us to prevent their effects, and perhaps defeat the whole 
plan. The possession of these papers could not be hoped for 
without previously securing his person, and, to accomplish this, 
the utmost secrecy and expedition were necessary. Now, Sir, 
as I imagined you had no troops at Annapolis to execute the 
purpose (but in this I find I was mistaken), and as I knew 
there were troops in readiness at Baltimore, and as there was 
no Continental General or other officer in Maryland, Mr. Purviance, Chairman of the Committee, on the spot where I had 
conceived troops alone to be stationed, occurred to me as the 
only person to whom I could with propriety and effect make 
application. Had I known, Sir, that a regiment or any troops 
were stationed at Annapolis, I should undoubtedly have addressed 
myself to you, as President of the Council of Safety. 

It is said, Sir, that Maryland was out of the district of my 
command ; that, consequently, to intrude myself into the busi 
ness and concerns of that Province was assuming and arrogant. 
I really conceive, Sir, that when the safety or very being of 
the whole community appears at stake, the part I have acted 
in this affair cannot with justice be esteemed arrogance. I did 
not presume authoritatively to order, but, as one servant of the 
public, earnestly to entreat and conjure another servant, who 
alone appeared to me to have the means in his hands, to take 
a certain step of the last importance to the public cause. I 
must repeat, Sir, that my reason for addressing myself to Mr. 
Purviance at Baltimore, proceeded entirely from my ignorance 
of there being any troops at Annapolis, and not (as I have 
been told has been thrown out) from any diffidence in yourvirtue and decision. I suppose the Committee of Safety here 
viewed it in the same light, for I read my letter to them, and 
it was approved of. 

In times like these, Sir, I conceive, that when we have re 
ceived sufficient evidences of any treasonable practices being 
carried on, and that when it appears to us that the imme 
diate seizure of a particular traitor s person may lead to discoveries on which the salvation of the State may depend, and 
when the utmost secrecy and expedition are necessary to the 
seizure of his person, it is the duty of a good citizen not to 
delay a single instant, if a single instant s delay may prevent 
the execution. This was the manner I thought it my duty to 
proceed in, in the case of Mr. "Wbrmeley. On the discovery of 
his correspondence with the enemy, I gave orders for the se 
curity of his person and papers, and then referred the affair to 
the proper tribunal, the Committee of Safety; the measure was 
so far from giving umbrage, or creating jealousy, that it met 
with their unanimous approbation. If this method is proscribed, 
at a juncture like the present, the great check on dangerous 
correspondence and conspiracies will be taken off. If councils 
are to be held previously to the seizure of any traitor s per 
son or papers, notwithstanding the strongest evidences against 
him, I am much mistaken if every traitor does not slip through 
your hands. 

I must now, Sir, conclude with assuring you, and the re 
spectable body over which you preside, that, if they suppose 
me capable of aiming or wishing to extend the military author 
ity, or trespass on the civil, they do me the most cruel in 
justice. Although I was bred in the army, I thank God the 
spirit and principles of the citizen were ever predominant; and 
I solemnly declare that, if I thought it possible I should ever 
be so far intoxicated by military command, as to harbour a wish 
injurious to the civil supremacy in all thing.-, I would now, 
whilst I retain my senses, beg leave to divest myself of my 
present office, and serve as a volunteer in the glorious cause 
in which I have embarked my person, fortune, and reputation. 
What I did in this affair, I did in the character of a common, zealous member of the community, not of an officer; what 
appeared irregular or offensive in the mode, I hope I have, 
explained to your satisfaction ; and I entreat, that it may be 
entirely attributed to a mistake, for which I am heartily con 
cerned, as it has prejudiced me in the opinions of men whoseesteem I am most ambitious of obtaining. 

I am, &c., 

CHARLES LEE. 



GENERAL LEE TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Williamsburg, 7 May, 1776. 

SIR, 

I find the part I have acted in the business of Mr. Eden 
has given great umbrage to the Council of Maryland. I take 
the liberty of inclosing to you a copy of my letter to that 
Board on the occasion, as I hope it will appear to the Con 
gress a fall explanation and justification of my conduct. I shall 
not trouble them any more on the subject. 

Five transports with troops are arrived at Cape Fear. I shall 
therefore set out on Thursday for Wilmington, by the way of 
Halifax. When we consider, Sir, the vast extent of the vulner 
able parts of this country, the numerous navigable intersecting 
waters, the multitude of slaves, that we have not more than 
five thousand regulars fit for duty in the Province, that of these 
five thousand not more than three are properly armed, that to 
arm them (defectively as they are) the Province has been drove 
to the necessity of disarming the minute-men ; I say, Sir, when 
these circumstances are considered, I shall appear, I hope, reason 
able in entreating the Congress to spare us, if possible, some 
battalions, and of those battalions which are best armed. If 
indeed our minute-men were properly furnished with muskets and 
ammunition, if our rivers were already secured in the manner 
I propose, I should think myself capable of baffling all their 
attempts with our present force ; but, situated as we are, my 
anxiety for the common safety obliges me to solicit a reinforce 
ment. 

A letter from one of your members informs me, that five 
thousand blankets and five thousand pair of shoes are on the 
road for the use of this army. They are much wanted. The 
number is. I believe, sufficient. We are, as I observed before, 
wretchedly in want of medicines, as well as of a director to 
our hospital. Dr. McClurg is a very able man, and univer 
sally esteemed qualified for the office. The pay of the regi 
mental Surgeons, established by Congress, is so low that it is, 
in this part of the world (where the common country practice 
of surgery is singularly lucrative) impossible to find capable 
men who will accept. But I am in hopes that the Convention will make such additions, out of the provincial purse, as 
to enable us to fill the commissions with proper and competent 
persons. 

Now I am on the subject of pay, Sir, I must beg leave to 
urge the necessity of considerably increasing that of the Engi 
neers. It is impossible that men qualified for this important 
office should be prevailed upon to serve on such miserable 
terms. You have no American Engineers. They must, of course, 
be foreigners, and foreigners expect, in their language de quoi 
manger ; that is, something which will enable them to eat and 
drink. Twenty dollars a month will not enable them to eat, 
drink, and wear linen, or indeed any kind of clothes. Besides, 
it must be considered that these gentlemen are obliged, by the 
nature of their duty, to make more journeys than other officers, 
that horses must be purchased and fed. that the expenses of 
travelling are, in these southern provinces, very high. For these 
reasons, and many others, the pay of Engineers ought to be, as 
it is in all other services, greater than that of other officers. 
Upon the whole, Sir, I really do not think that they ought or 
can do with less than forty dollars per month, and rations at 
least for their horses. On more moderate terms I am per 
suaded you cannot procure men equal to the task, as the corps 
is distinct, and not numerous. This necessary addition of pay 
will be an expense beneath the consideration of the Congress. 

Colonel Richard Henry Lee informs me, that it was not the 
intention of the Congress that Captain Innes s company should 
be reduced to make way for Arundel s, but that they should both 
be established. I think, Sir, it would be a useless expense. 
Captain Innes, who must, I am sure, be an excellent officer42 
in any other department, professed himself ignorant iu this 
branch ; his officers were equally ignorant. Arundel has got 
possession of the company, and, by his activity and knowledge, 
will, I am persuaded, make them fit for service. Indeed, toestablish an artillery company, Captain, subalterns, and non 
commissioned officers being entirely composed of novices, can an 
swer no end or purpose. It is my opinion, therefore, that, in 
stead of these two companies proposed, the addition of thirty 
or forty men to Captain Arundel s, and two subaltern officers, 
Avill not only be better, but that it promises more advantage 
to the service. 

Now I am on the subject of Captain Arundel, I beg leave 
to remind the Congress of what I mentioned with respect to 
his expenses on the road. There is one circumstance, of which 
I could wish to be ascertained. Is the expense of the defence 
of these rivers, that is, the construction of row-galleys, floatingbatteries, tenders, &c., to be brought to the account of the Con 
tinent or of the Province ? I wish to be ascertained on this 
head, because, if it is at the expense of the latter, I shall 
regularly propose to the Convention or Committee of Safety 
every scheme, which may be attended with expense, before it 
is entered upon. If the Quartermaster-General, or his depu 
ties, when they despatch any teams from Philadelphia with 
powder or other necessaries, were to purchase the horses through 
out for the Continental use, instead of hiring them, the saving 
would be considerable, for, in this country, the hire is intole 
rably dear, so great indeed, that I have ventured to order a 
number of teams to be purchased. 

I have just received a vague return of the forces of North 
Carolina, of their powder and cannon. It does not appear that 
they have, of effective regulars, properly armed, more than two 
thousand; of powder, more than two tons and a half; and, as 
to cannon, they are almost totally destitute. As the enemy s 
advanced guard, if I may so express myself, is actually arrived, 
I must, I cannot avoid detaching the strongest battalion we have 
to their assistance ; but I own I tremble, at the same time, at 
the thoughts of stripping this Province of any part of its in 
adequate force. I am puzzled to know how to direct my mo 
tions, from the uncertainty of the enemy s plan, but not dispirited, as I am confident that the Congress will afford me 
every relief in their power, and am not in the least diffident 
of the courage and zeal of the men and officers. I am, &c. 

CHARLES LEE. 
P. S. I have, as yet, heard nothing of Mr. Stabler, the En 
gineer. I ought, in fact, to have at least half a dozen, for we 
have a variety of posts to throw up, and there is not a man 
or officer in the army that knows the difference betwixt a 
chevaux-de-frise and a cabbage garden. I wish the Congress 
would indulge me with Mr. Smith, whom I know to be an 
able and active man. Massenbourg is a treasure. A little hurt 
in my hand obliges me to write by the pen of my secretary. 



GENERAL LEE TO EDMUND PENDLETON, PRESIDENT OP THE 
CONVENTION OF VIRGINIA. 

Williamsburg, 9 May, 1776. 
SIR, 

As I am obliged, by the arrival of the enemy, to repair to 
North Carolina, and am not less prompted by my zeal and affec 
tion for this Province, than obliged by my duty, to take every 
precaution for its safety before my departure ; on this principle, 
I beg leave to lay before the Convention the following measures, 
which I conceive to be necessary. 

1st. To devise some means for establishing a corps of caval 
ry ; without which, an army is so extremely defective in every 
part of the world, and in none more than in this, for reasons 
which it might be tedious to enumerate. 

2dly. Without delay to order some able pilots of every river 
to examine accurately the narrowest part of the channel of each 
river; what is the nature of the shoals which form these chan 
nels ; whether they are solid, firm sand, gravel, or rock ; what is 
the distance of the nearest part of the channel from either shore ; 
what is the nature of the shore, whether it is high or low ; for I 
am sanguine enough to hope, when these circumstances are ascertained, the navigation of most of the rivers may be shut up to 
the enemy, by means of batteries, either floating or fixed. 

Sdly. As these purposes cannot be effected without a large 
body of carpenters, smiths, and artificers of every sort, to esta 
blish some companies of them, subject to the military laws; for, 
without a coercive power, it is difficult, in this part of the world, 
to prevail on them to work. 

4thly. As I understand there are prodigious flocks of sheep 
and cattle on the islands near the Eastern Shore, and as my 
authority does not extend to whatever concerns property, that, 
you will order immediately all this stock to be transported to 
the continent; and, if this is impracticable, to kill them, as 
otherwise they must indisputably fall into the hands of the enemy. 

5thly. As the eastern counties are, from their great abundance of all the necessaries of life, so tempting objects to the 
incursions of the enemy, and as I understand there will be no 
difficulty in procuring good men, I would humbly propose to the 
Convention to augment Colonel Fleming s regiment to the same 
strength of numbers with the other battalions. 

I must now, Sir, beg leave to mention to the gentlemen of 
the Convention a very important matter of consideration ; no less 
than the preservation of the lives of your soldiers. The Continental allowance to Surgeons and Surgeons Mates of the regi 
ments is so miserably small, and at the same time the common 
country practice of surgeons is so very lucrative in this Province, 
that it is not possible to find men, qualified for the station, who 
will accept; and, as I cannot venture to propose to the Continental Congress the increase of the pay of the Surgeons of the 
whole army, merely because this increase is necessary in my 
division, I must submit it to the judgment of the Convention, 
whether such an addition as to bring up the pay of these gen 
tlemen to the original Provincial ordinance, will not be money 
well and necessarily expended. 

I am, Sir, with the greatest respect, yours, 

CHARLES LEE. 



GENERAL LEE TO EDMUND PENDLETON, PRESIDENT OF THE 
CONVENTION OF VIRGINIA. 

Wilmington, 1 June, 1776. 
Sill, 

The whole enemy s fleet have sailed from Cape Fear, the first 
division on Wednesday, the last yesterday ; but it is far from 
being ascertained whether they have steered their course to the 
northward or to the southward. The people here are all of 
opinion that Charleston is their object. For my own part, I do 
not see on what they ground this persuasion. However, as South 
Carolina is weaker in numbers than Virginia, I have ordered 
Muhlenberg s regiment, at a venture, to Charleston immediately ; 
as also a detachment of seven hundred men from this place. I 
have been also under the necessity of stripping this Province of 
sixteen hundred pounds of gunpowder, which I must replace from 
Virginia. 

As this Colony is now apparently no longer in danger, I shall 
send an express to stop your militia, as they may be wanted 
more in their own Province, and will now be an unnecessary 
expense. I shall myself set out for Charleston to-morrow, but at 
the same time confess, I know not whether I shall go to or from 
the enemy ; but if that Capital is really their object, their whole 
force will be collected in one point, their operations will be 
more regular, and, consequently, my presence, as Commander-inchief of the district, more requisite ; whereas, if Virginia is their 
object, it is possible and probable their operations may be merely 
predatory and piratical. If such are their intentions, I am 
confident that your own officers will have little or no occasion 
for the advice or assistance (such as they are) of, Sir, &c., 

CHARLES LEE. 

P. S. As I have not much time, and indeed there being no 
absolute necessity of troubling the Congress with any circum 
stances farther than expressed in this letter, I must entreat, Sir, 
that you will send a copy of it to the Congress. 



GENERAL LEE TO COLONEL THOMPSON, AT SULLIVAN S ISLAND. 

Charleston, 21 June, 1776. 
. SIR, 

It is a certain truth, that the enemy entertain a most fortunate 
apprehension of American riflemen. It is equally certain, that 
nothing can contribute to diminish this apprehension so infallibly, 
as a frequent ineffectual fire. It is with some concern, therefore, 
that I am informed that your men have been suffered to fire at 
a most preposterous distance. Upon this principle, I must entreat 
and insist that you consider it as a standing order, that not a 
man under your command is to fire at a greater distance than 
an hundred and fifty yards, at the utmost ; in short, that they 
never fire without almost a moral certainty of hitting their object. 
Distant firing has a double bad effect; it encourages the enemy, 



502 OPERATIONS IN VIRGINIA [1776. 

and adds to the pernicious persuasion of the American soldiers, 
namely, that they are no match for their antagonists at close 
fighting. To speak plainly, it is almost a sure method of making 
them cowards. 

Once more, I must request that a stop be put to this childish, 
vicious, and scandalous practice. I extend the rule to those who 
have the care of the field-pieces. Four hundred yards is the 
greatest distance they should be allowed to fire at. Transgression 
of this rule will be considered as the effect of flurry and want 
of courage. Those who are accused of transgressing will be pro 
ceeded against, as acting from these principles. I have, Sir, the 
greatest opinion of your good sense and spirit, and flatter myself 
that you will not only issue orders of restriction on this head, 
but that you will be attentive that they are vigorously put in 
execution ; and am, Sir, &c., 

CHARLES LEE. 

P. S. I am likewise informed that your men pass, without 
order or orders, to Long Island. Is this wise? Is it soldier 
like? Is it to show the enemy where our weakness is? 



GENERAL LEE TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Charleston, 2 July, 1776. 
SIR, 

I should have done myself the honor sooner of informing the 
Congress of the attack made by the enemy s squadron on Sulli 
van s Island, and their repulse, but conjectured that, by waiting 
a day or two, I might probably be furnished with the means of 
sending a more minute, full, and satisfactory account. My con 
jecture was right ; for, yesterday, five seamen made their escape, 
one of whom is a more intelligent fellow than commonly found 
amongst men of his level. Inclosed is a copy of their narrative. 
Some parts of it are, perhaps, too whimsical and trivial to merit 
the attention of Congress ; but I think it my duty to present it 
as it is, without adding or curtailing a circumstance. I think, 
Sir, I may venture to congratulate the Congress on the event. 
Not only the advantages must be considerable, but the affair re 
flects no small credit on the American arms. 



APPENDIX. AND SOUTH CAROLINA. 503 

On Friday, about eleven o clock, the Commodore, with his 
whole squadron, consisting of two line of battle ships and six fri 
gates (the rates of which are marked in the inclosed narrative) 
anchored at less than half musket-shot from the fort, and commenced one of the most furious and incessant fires I ever saw 
or heard. It was manifestly their plan to land at the same time 
their whole regulars at the east end of the Island, and of course 
invest the fort by land and sea. As the garrison was composed 
entirely of raw troops, both men and officers, as I knew their 
ammunition was short, and as the bridge by which we could 
reenforce or call off the troops from the Island was unfinished, 
you may easily conceive my anxiety. It was so great, that I 
was in suspense whether I should evacuate it or no. Fortu 
nately, whilst I was in this state of suspense, some ammunition arrived from the town ; and my Aid-de-camp, Mr. Boyd, returning 
from the Island with a flattering report of the garrison s spirits, 
I determined to support it at all hazards. 

On this principle, I thought it my duty to cross over to the 
Island, to encourage the garrison by my presence ; but I might 
have saved myself that trouble, for I found, on my arrival, they 
had no occasion for any sort of encouragement. I found them 
determined and cool, to the last degree. Their behaviour would, 
in fact, have done honor to the oldest troops. I beg leave, there 
fore, to recommend, in the strongest terms, to the Congress, the 
commanding officer, Colonel Moultrie, and his whole garrison, as 
brave soldiers and excellent citizens; nor must I omit, at the 
same time, mentioning Colonel Thompson, who, with the South 
Carolina rangers and a detachment of the North Carolina regu 
lars, repulsed the enemy in two several attempts to make a lodg 
ment at the other extremity of the Island. 

Our loss, considering the heat and duration of the fire, was in 
considerable. We had only ten men killed on the spot, and 
twenty-two wounded, seven of whom lost their limbs ; but, with 
their limbs, they did not lose their spirits, for they enthusiasti 
cally encouraged their comrades never to abandon the standard 
of liberty and their country. This, I do assure you, Sir, is not 
in the style of gasconading romance, usual after every successful 
action, but literally fact. I with pleasure mention the circum 
stance, as it augurs well to. the cause of freedom. At eleven the 
fire ceased, having continued just twelve hours, without the least 
intermission. 

What the enemy s intentions are now, it is impossible to 
divine. I am inclined to think they will (if they can repass the 
bar) bend their course to the Chesapeake or Hampton Bay. Per 
haps shame and rage may prompt their land forces to some 
attempt before their departure. On my part, I shall spare no 
pains to discover their intentions and to baffle their schemes. 

As Georgia is a district of the command with which you have 
honored me, I thought it prudent to request some of their mem 
bers to a conference with the President of this Province and 
myself. They accepted the invitation, and gave us great satisfac 
tion from their intelligence and good sense. Inclosed is the sub 
stance of their deliberation. 

The Province is certainly of the last importance to the common cause ; and the mode of protecting it, pointed out by these 
gentlemen, is, in my opinion, in all its parts, wise and necessary. 
They had conceived a notion that I had powers to augment theirestablishment. I assured them I had no such powers, but both 
Mr. Rutledge and myself gave it as our opinion that any ex 
penses, manifestly beyond their faculties, which they might incurin the common cause, would be repaid by the Congress ; and, in 
this persuasion, we ventured to encourage them to augment their 
cavalry, without loss of time, and make the proposed present of 
cattle to the Indians. Indeed, Sir, without a strong corps of 
cavalry, I do not see how it is possible to protect these Southern 
Colonies ; and with one thousand good cavalry, I think I could 
insure their protection. From the want of this species of troops, 
Charleston and its dependencies had certainly been lost, if the 
enemy had acted with the vigor and expedition we had reason to 
expect; but a most unaccountable languor and inertness on their 
part have saved us. 

If the scheme I proposed in Virginia had been approved and 
adopted, it would have been not only a security, but considerable 
economy. The forage was to have been the only expense. Now 
I am upon the subject, I cannot help mentioning, that I have 
been informed that the project has been considered by some gen 
tlemen as a sort of presumption in me in arrogating such a 
power; but I fancy the affair was not properly understood. I 
saw the immediate necessity of such a corps. I knew they could 
be raised immediately by these means, and at the same time I 
was given to understand, by several gentlemen of the Virginia 
Convention, that, should the Continental Congress disapprove of 
the expense (trifling as it was), there was little doubt of their 
Convention defraying it. But, in fact, the measure seemed necessary for the salvation of the Provinces, and not a day \vas to be 
lost, which I hope will fully justify my conduct; and I must 
beg leave to repeat my assertion, that, without cavalry, these 
Provinces cannot easily be defended. I wish some means could 
be devised of reducing East Florida to an American Province ; 
had I force sufficient, I should, with your permission, certainly 
attempt it. The advantages would be great and manifold. The 
augmentation of the Georgian cavalry I sincerely hope may be 
approved of by the Congress. Inclosed is the establishment and 
pay proposed for them. 

I think the terms not high. I shall now, Sir, conclude with 
.expressing the high satisfaction I have received from the zeal, 
activity, and public spirit of the gentlemen and inhabitants of this 
city and Province, from the President and Council down to the 
lowest order of the people ; and with assuring you, that I have 
not, in my military capacity, met with the least obstruction or 
difficulty; but that we have all worked, in concert and harmony, 
for the common good. I most earnestly request you will pay 
my respects to the Congress, and be persuaded, Sir, that I am, 
most entirely and devotedly, 

Your most obedient servant, 

CHARLES LEE. 

P. S. The Georgia troopers have, according to the establish 
ment of their Congress, fifty shillings sterling a man, and rations 
for themselves, but find arms, horses, and forage. The Captain s 
pay is ten pounds sterling per month ; the Lieutenants , six 
pounds ; the Quarter-master s, four pounds. 

Lord Dunmore has, I believe, at present with him only oneship of war. If any part of the Continental fleet should happen 
to visit Hampton Bay, at this juncture, it would defeat the whole 
scheme of the enemy s operations, at least for this campaign. 
But it is impossible to say how long his Lordship -may remain 
in this weak condition. 



GENERAL LEE TO MAJOR-GENERAL CLINTON. 

(Sent by a flag of truce.) 

Charleston, 3 July, 1776. 
SIR, 

A certain Walker was, by a most whimsical concurrence of 
YOL. n. 43 
wind and tide, hurried into the midst of our sentinels at the end 
of Sullivan s Island. He says he is master of a brig transport, 
and has the principal property in the vessel. As the man would 
probably be ruined by this odd accident, Mr. Rutledge, President, 
of the Province, and myself, would propose to you an exchange 
of this Walker for Ethan Allen ; or, if he is not at present in 
your fleet or army, for any two of the Connecticut privates who 
were taken prisoners with Allen. I confess honestly to you, Sir, 
that I am extremely desirous of redeeming Allen and his whole 
party. You, I am sure, are liberal enough to compassionate the 
sufferings of those who think, at least, they are engaged in a 
righteous cause. In this persuasion, I propose to you an ex 
change, man for man, of these people with the soldiers of the 
fourteenth, who were taken prisoners at the Great Bridge, in Yirgina. If, therefore, any of his party are at present in your cus 
tody, you will oblige me much in releasing them. I pledge my 
word and honor that an equal number of the fourteenth shall be 
sent from the place of their confinement to Lord Dunmore s 
camp, or wherever you think proper. 

I take the liberty to request you will accept of a small quan 
tity of fruit and vegetables, which, perhaps, in your situation, are 
not easily procured. This, I hope, you will consider as a testi 
mony of the regard I have for your personal qualities. The 
President joins with me in a high opinion of Mr. Clinton. 

I have, I am told, an intimate friend and comrade in yourcorps, Captain Primrose Kennedy, of the forty-fourth. I entreat 
you will assure him of my love and friendship, and send him a 
small portion of the fruit. Mr. Byrd, one of my Aids-de-camp, is 
the flag, who, I am confident, will be treated with all the respect 
due to his character. I am Sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

CHARLES LEE. 



GENERAL LEE TO ARCHIBALD BULLOCK, PRESIDENT OF GEORGIA. 

Charleston, 18 July, 1776. 
SIR, 

I feel most sensibly for the distressed situation of your Pro 
vince, and am determined to exert my utmost for its relief. I 
wish I had it in my power to spare you a larger force than, I 
am afraid, our present numbers will admit of; but, the instant 
we are assured the enemy will depart, I will order a battalion, 
or a number equal to a battalion, for Savannah. These, added 
to your own, will, I hope, be sufficient to protect the inhabitants 
from insult, and prevent your cattle from falling into the hands 
of these people, whose only crime is having been too long pa 
tient with administration. Two expeditions are now on foot; 
one, from this Province, against the lower Cherokees; another, 
against the Overhill Cherokees, from Virginia. I flatter myself 
that these two active operations will be a greater security to 
Georgia than could the largest defensive body. If the enemy 
stir southward, I shall myself march for your Province, with all 
the force I can muster; but I must regulate my motions by 
theirs. I most sincerely wish to your Province security and 
prosperity, and to yourself health and happiness ; and am, Sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

CHARLES LEE. 



GENERAL LEE TO JOHN RTJTLEDGE, GOVERNOR OF SOUTH CARO 
LINA. 

Charleston, 19 July, 1776. 
DEAR SIR, 

When I requested you to collect a number of boats for the 
transportation of troops to the Island, it was my intention to 
transport the greatest force I could possibly muster, to take the 
command in person, and endeavour to bring the enemy to a bat 
tle. Had we been victorious, there would have been an end of 
all their southern operations ; had we been defeated, it is true 
the loss would have been great, but not irreparable. Upon the 
whole, balancing the important consequences of victory, and the 
disadvantages of a defeat, I should have been justifiable in risking a general action ; but the number of boats collected would 
never have answered this purpose. They would contain, at the 
utmost, only twelve hundred men ; a body too small to be detached on such an errand. In fact, islands present such manifold 
advantages to the enemy over us, that we must never venture 
on them without an assurance or great probability of a complete 
victory ; because, if defeated, we have no possibility of retreat. 

As the post on Long Island, and all schemes of attack, are 
now ended, I may mention these things to explain the motives 
of my putting you to the trouble of collecting the boats ; the 
whole may be now undoubtedly returned. Captain tells 

me that, in this fleet of craft, there is one wooden boat, belonging to Major Caper?, which might, with little alteration, be con 
verted into an excellent galley. As we all agree a fleet of 
galleys may be of the greatest use, and that it should be esta 
blished without loss of time, I should think that every boat which, 
with little trouble, can be thrown into that form, ought to be 
purchased. I am, &c., 

CHARLES LEE. 

P. S. I wish you would turn your thoughts to the defence of 
Georgia, and what regiment can best be spared from your Pro 
vince for that purpose. 



GENERAL LEE TO EDMUND TENDLETON, PRESIDENT OF THE CON 
VENTION OF VIRGINIA. 

Charleston, 20 July, 1776. 

SIR, 

I think it my duty to apprise you that the enemy s fleet and 
army are now, in all human probability, on their departure from 
this coast ; their troops are all reembarked ; the Commodore s ship 
and the Solebay have repassed the bar ; the Experiment and five 
other ships alone remain on this side, but are preparing to pass 
the next tide. It is impossible to say where they will bend their 
course, but I am myself inclined to think Virginia will be the 
scene of their operations. The deserters, indeed, assert, that it is 
their intention to proceed to New York ; but it appears to me, 
from Lord George Germain s intercepted letter, that General 
Clinton is restricted to these southern Colonies. Perhaps they 
may try Georgia, the weakness of which Colony, and the expect 
ation of a powerful cooperation on the part of their Indian 
allies, may allure them; but, on the other hand, the distressed 
situation of their fleet and army, from the want of good water, 
fresh provisions, and vegetables, will make the temptation of the 
table which Lord Dunmore, I understand, has spread for them 
on Gwyn s Island, irresistible. Upon the whole, I must repeat 
that I am persuaded Virginia will be their object. I hope and 
make no doubt, Sir, that you will be prepared for their recep 
tion. 
I think it necessary, for the common service, to inform you 
that a corps of at least fifteen hundred men will be assembled 
on the Cherokee line in less than three weeks from the present 
date. This number is supposed to be adequate to the end pro 
posed; that is, the destruction of the crops of the Lower Nation, 
and of course striking a necessary terror into the minds of the 
other nations. I mention this, as I apprehend the expedition pro 
jected against the Overliill Cherokees, from your Province, may 
have some dependence on the measures of the Carolinas against 
the Lower Nation. But although, being ignorant of the geogra 
phy and circumstances of the country, I speak in the dark with 
regard to the relation which one expedition may have with the 
other, the informing you of the number of the Carolina corps, 
and the time they may be expected to enter the enemy s country, can be of no less service. As soon as I can be ascertained 
of the enemy s designs, I shall set out for the point of action, in 
hopes to render all the service in my power to the place at 
tacked, as well as the common cause. 

I am, Sir, with the greatest respect, 

CHARLES LEE. 



SIR HENRY CLINTON TO GENERAL LEE. 

Off Charleston Bar, 22 July, 1776. 
SIR, 

On my return to the fleet, I found a letter from you by a 
flag of truce, with some refreshments you were pleased to send 
me ; in return for which, I must beg your acceptance of a cask 
of porter and some English cheese. 

I have made inquiries concerning the person mentioned in 
your letter, who, it seems, has occasioned this correspondence be 
tween us, but can learn nothing further about him than that he 
is not a master of a vessel, as he has represented himself to 
you ; and you will have been already informed, by Mr. Byrd. 
that Ethan Allen, and those that were with him, are gone to 
the northward. I am, Sir, 

Your most humble servant, 

HENRY CLINTON. 

1776. 1776. GENERAL LEE TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Savannah, 21 August, 1776. 
SIR, 

Your letter, with the thanks of the Congress, reached me at 
Petersburg. The approbation of the freely chosen Delegates of a 
free and uncorrupt people, is certainly the highest honor that a 
man of any sentiment can be ambitious of; and I shall consider 
it as a fresh stimulus to excite my zeal and ardor in the glori 
ous cause in which I am engaged. May the God of Righteous 
ness prosper your arms in every part of the Empire, in propor 
tion to the justice with which they were taken up! Once more 
let me express the high satisfaction and happiness I feel in this 
honorable testimony ; and once more let me assure the United 
States of America, that they cannot meet with a servant, what 
ever may be his abilities, animated with a greater degree of 
ardor and enthusiasm for their safety, prosperity, and glory. 

The present state of this Province, its strength and weakness, 
I shall transmit to the Board of War, according to the directions 
I have received. Be persuaded. Sir, that I am, with the greatest respect, &c., 

CHARLES LEE. 



No. II. 

OPERATIONS OF THE NORTHERN ARMY IN OPPOSING THE EXPEDITION UNDER GENERAL BURGOYNE. 

GENERAL ST. CLATR TO GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Ticonderoga, 25 June, 1777. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I informed you yesterday, that an encampment of the enemy 
had been discovered at Gilliland s Creek. Last night two of their 
vessels came up to Crown Point, and this morning there are 
seven lying at that place. The rest of their fleet is probably but 
a little lower down, as we hear their morning guns distinctly at 
different places. They have also debarked some troops, and en 
camped upon Chimney Point. Whether they have landed at 
Crown Point, or not, my scout-boat did not discover, not daring 
to venture far enough down the lake, on account of the shipping; 
but I have sent out a scout on this side, which, I doubt not, will 
bring a just account of their situation. 

I cannot help repeating to you the disagreeable situation we 
are in ; nor can I see the least prospect of our being able to defend the post, unless the militia come in. And should the enemy 
protract their operations, or invest us, and content themselves 
with a simple blockade, we are infallibly ruined. 

I have thoughts of calling for the Berkshire militia, which are 
nearest to us, and will probably be the most alert to come to ourassistance, because they are in some measure covered by this 
post; but on that I shall consult the other General Officers. This, 
however, is clear to me, that we shall be obliged to abandon this 
side, and then they will soon force the other from us; nor do I 
see that a retreat will in any shape be practicable. Every thing, 
however, shall be done that is possible to frustrate the enemy s 
designs. But what can be expected from troops ill armed, naked, 
and unaccoutred ? I shall write you again as soon as the scout 
returns ; and am, dear General, 

Your most obedient, humble servant, 

ARTHUR ST. CLAIR. 



BROCKHOLST LIVINGSTON TO GOVERNOR LIVINGSTON.* 

Ticonderoga, 3 July, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

I wrote you on the 30th ultimo, advising you of the approach 
of the enemy. On the 1st instant the second division of their 
army arrived, in forty bateaux, about twenty men in each, and 
landed on the eastern shore of the Lake, opposite the Three-Mile 
Point. Yesterday they received a third reinforcement, in sixty 
bateaux. They have done little yet of any consequence, but con 
tinue playing their old game with the savages. Yesterday, in the 
afternoon, a party of these, with some Canadians and a few regu 
lars, in the whole about two hundred and fifty, under the command of Captain Frazer, of the forty-seventh, attacked our picket 
guard of fifty men, and drove them in ; then advanced, and for a 
short time kept up a scattering fire on the French lines. Ourtroops behaved with great coolness and resolution, and, after a 
few shots, made them retire to the woods. The loss the enemy 
sustained in this little brush is uncertain. We had one Lieu 
tenant and five privates killed, and a Lieutenant and seven men 
wounded. These skirmishes are of infinite service to our troops, 
who are in general raw and undisciplined. They serve as prepa 
ratives to an action of the last importance, which we have rea 
son hourly to expect. 

Two Hessians have deserted to us, both very intelligent fel 
lows. They agree that Burgoyne commands the army, and, under 
him, General Riedcsel the German forces. Carleton has staid 
behind as Governor of Quebec and General of the troops in Ca 
nada. They have brought all the Hessians with them ; in the 
whole, seven regiments and one battalion, besides four companies 
of dragoons. Their regiments consist in general of six hundred 
men. Their dragoons are not mounted, but come in expectation 
of getting horse at this place. Their supply of provisions is very 
short, from which it appears they mean a coup de main, and not 
a siege. 

We are daily receiving additions to our strength. Colonel 
Warner is expected to-day .with six hundred Green Mountain 
Boys. We also hourly look for General Schuyler, with a large 
body of militia from below. The spirits of our men were much 
raised yesterday with an account of a signal victory gained by 
General Washington over the enemy. We fired thirteen guns as 
a feu de joie on the occasion, just as we perceived a reenforcement of the enemy coming up. 

To-morrow we shall give them a salute of the same kind, being the anniversary of the ever-memorable 4th of July, 177G, on 
which day we broke off all connection with slavery, and became 
the free and independent States of America. 

In a letter of the 2Gth ultimo, I told you of my being a 
patient in the General Hospital. I have now the pleasure to in 
form you my complaint is removed, and my health perfectly 
restored. In the absence of General Schuyler, I have the honor 
of acting as Aid-de-camp to General St. Clair. You know his 
abilities too well to be informed of them by me. He is cool and 
determined, ever vigilant, and unruffled by every appearance of 
danger. I flatter myself with the hopes of announcing to you, in 
a few days, the welcome news of the total defeat of the enemy. 
I am, dear Sir, with every sentiment of esteem and affection, 
Yours, sincerely, 

BIIOCKHOLST LIVINGSTON. 



GENERAL ST. CLAIR TO GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Dorset, 8 July, 1777, nine o clock. 

DEAR SIR, 

About an hour ago, I received your favor of yesterday. I 
wrote you from Ticonderoga the night before we left it, to 
inform you that I intended to march to Skenesborough by the 
way of Castleton, and from thence to Fort Edward ; but when I 
got to Castleton I found the enemy were in possession of Skenes 
borough, which obliged me to change my route. 

On the march to Castleton, we fell in with a party commanded 
by Captain Frazer, who had been collecting cattle in the country. 
These were immediately dispersed, and a few prisoners taken ; 
but, being reenforced by a strong detachment from Ticonderoga, 
they attacked, in the morning, the rear-guard of our army, who 
had imprudently stopped six miles short of the main body, and 
were, I believe, rather surprised ; notwithstanding which they madea very obstinate defence, and, I have good reason to think, killed 
and wounded a great number of the enemy. As they were at 
too great a distance for me to support them, I sent orders to 
Colonel Warner, who commanded the party, in case he found 
himself too hard pressed, to retreat to Rutland, and join me. He 
is not yet come in, though I have heard that he is coming in 
with about a hundred men; and a great part of the other regi 
ments, except Hall s, have already joined us. 

I am in great distress for provisions. If I can be supplied at 
Manchester, I shall proceed directly for Fort Edward, or Sara 
toga, as circumstances may direct; if not, I shall be obliged to 
go to Bennington. I account myself very happy in effecting this 
retreat, as the loss of the army, small as it is, would have been 
a blow that this part of the country would have felt severely, 
and that must inevitably liave happened in a very few days. 
Adieu, my dear General ; I hope to see you soon, or things in a 
better train. 

I am, Sir, your very humble servant, 

ARTHUR ST. CLAIR. 
1776. BROCKIIOLST LIVINGSTON TO GOVERNOR LIVINGSTON. 

Fort Edward, 17 July, 1777. 
DEAR SIR, 

My last was on the 12th. In that I acquainted you with the 
evacuation of Ticonderoga, and the consequences resulting there 
from. I have the pleasure now to inform you that General St. 
Clair has joined us with his army. General Nixon s brigade is 
also arrived. Our force now, in Continental troops, is two thou 
sand five hundred. The militia are about two thousand. With 
these is an army of six thousand regular disciplined troops to be 
opposed. The probability of success, under these circumstances, 
I leave you to judge of. A stand is to be made about threemiles below this, at a place called Moses Creek, there being some 
advantageous heights to fortify. For my own part, I trust more 
to the woods for security than any fortresses we can raise. The 
enemy scarcely ever attack us in our works. "When they do, they 
generally succeed. 

General Burgoyne, finding it almost impracticable to come by 
Wood Creek (the passage of which we had obstructed by felling 
trees into it), has returned to Ticonderoga, in order to come by 
the way of Fort George. For this purpose they are carrying their 
bateauxs from Lake Champlain into Lake George. We have 
been so fortunate as to get off all our stores from Fort George, 
which were very considerable ; and yesterday the garrison left it, 
after setting fire to the Fort, Hospital, Barracks, and other buildings. In removing our stores we left only two wagons, which 
were cut off by a scout of Indians. 

We have no news from the westward, since my last. General 
Johnson has called a meeting of Indians, with intent, no doubt, to 
persuade those who are our friends to remain neutral, and per 
mit him to pass through their country. General Burgoyne, on 
the back of his proclamation, has sent a summons to the people 
of the Grants to meet Governor Skene at Castleton, to be there 
acquainted with the terms on which they are to hold their pro 
perty ; and threatening with immediate death all who refuse their 
attendance. General Schuyler has sent them an address in an 
swer to this. Copies of both, and also of the proclamation, I will 
send you as soon as I can find time to make them out. They 
begin to dispense their protections in great numbers. Those who 
take them, and are discovered, we send immediately to jail. I 
shall be punctual in transmitting you every intelligence of conse 
quence, and shall be happy in hearing from you in return. 
I am your affectionate son, 

BROCKHOLST LIVINGSTON. 



BROCKHOLST LIVINGSTON TO GOVERNOR LIVINGSTON. 

Fort Edward, 21 July, 1777. 
DEAR SIR, 

Inclosed you will receive copies of Mr. Burgoyne s proclama 
tion, his summons to the people of the Grants, and General 
Schuyler s answer thereto. Few occurrences of moment have 
transpired since my last of the 17th. Yesterday we received a 
flag from Skenesborough, by which Mr. Burgoyne was so polite 
as to return General Poor s baggage, and send home a prisoner 
or two on parole. The flag brought a letter from Colonel Skeneto General Schuyler, desiring a personal conference with him on 
public affairs. The General, in answer, told him he could not 
open a correspondence in a public character with him while his 
superior officer commanded at Skenesborough ; that he should 
always be willing to receive flags from General Burgoyne, or the 
officer commanding any detachment of the army ; and that, if 
they were desirous of a conference, they should appoint an officerto hold it, and he would send one of equal rank on his side to 
meet him. 

An Indian scout of ours returned this morning, and brought 
with them five prisoners. The enemy, not knowing we had In 
dians in our service, were decoyed, thinking them their own. 
The prisoners were taken near Skenesborough. They inform 
that the enemy are cutting a road to Fort Anne to bring up 
their cannon, and mean an attack on this place. I fancy they 
will find the game gone, it being the General s intention to move 
to a place five miles below this. Our strength is considerably 
reduced since my last, a great part of the militia being dismissed 
to reap their harvests. They were a most disorderly set, and 
deserted by whole companies. 

Sir John has done little at the westward. Some of his sava 
ges scalped a Captain and killed a few men belonging to Gansevoort s regiment, at Fort Schuyler. I shall be happy in receiving 
a letter from you. 

I am, dear Sir, yours, sincerely, 

BROCKHOLST LIVINGSTON. 



516 OPERATIONS OF [1777 

GENERAL SCHUYLER TO GENERAL LINCOLN. 

Saratoga, 31 July, 1777. 
DEAR SIR, 

Colonel Warner is on the Grants, with a small body of Continental troops and some militia, and expects to be reinforced in a 
day or two by General Stark, with a body of militia from New 
Hampshire. 

You will please to repair to Manchester, the place where the 
troops above mentioned are collected and collecting, and take the 
command of the whole. As General Burgoyne is advancing 
towards us, and as a movement of a body of troops from the 
Grants towards Skenesborough will doubtless much embarrass 
him, and will certainly oblige him to have a considerable force 
at that place, you will move towards it, if the troops you should 
find there, or those that may join, are in such numbers as that 
you can do it without risking too much. 

You will please to advise me, from time to time, of your situ 
ation and force, that I may be enabled to direct your future 
operations, according to what information I may get of the enemy s intentions. It is impossible to be more explicit in the present state of affairs. Events may arise, to which these orders 
could not possibly apply; you will, therefore, consider them as 
merely discretionary, and exercise your own judgment as contin 
gencies may arise. 

I am, dear Sir, with great esteem and regard, 

PHILIP SCHUYLER. 



GENERAL LINCOLN TO THE COUNCIL OF MASSACHUSETTS. 

Bcnnington, 10 August, 1777. 
GENTLEMEN, 

From a representation of the officers, and from my own observation, I find the men sent here from the county of Worcester, 
under the command of Colonel Gushing, left their homes in such 
haste, that they are by no means prepared to remain in camp 
any considerable time, and many of them had no opportunity to 
make that provision for their families left behind, which they 
would have done had they considered they were to have been 
long detained. General Schuyler hath repeatedly, in the most 
pressing terms, urged that all the troops in the Grants, excepting 
one small regiment, should join him. Colonel Cushing s regiment, 
excepting some who have deserted, are this day to march for 
Stillwater, which most of them cheerfully undertake, notwithstanding their peculiar situation. I hope that, as early as men can be 
raised for a time limited, these will be discharged. This, as they 
come out upon an alarm, they do expect, and I am sure it will 
give quiet, and I think, on the whole, much promote the general 
interest. 

The enemy have left the Grants. They collected their whole 
force at Fort Edward, and are moving down, and seem deter 
mined to possess themselves of Albany. I hope they will meet 
with a check before they reach it; I presume they will, if the 
militia expected arrive in time. There never was an opportunity 
when we could act with so great a probability of success against 
them as the present, for they have penetrated, and are penetrating far into the country, and have left a very naked and unco 
vered rear ; therefore, never a greater call for the exertions of 
the people. 

I am very sorry that I am obliged to inform your Honors, that, 
notwithstanding the evident pressing necessity for men at Stillwater to support our brethren there, a number of Colonel Cushing s regiment left it, on finding the enemy had quitted the 
Grants, and have returned or are returning home, contrary to 
the orders and advice of their officers. 

They pretend to say, in their own justification, that they came 
out on an alarm, for a particular purpose, namely, to oppose the 
enemy on the Grants ; and that, as Burgoyne has withdrawn his 
troops from that quarter, they are no longer held. Would it not 
be best, whenever they are ordered out, to limit the time of their 
service, and prevent, if possible, their entertaining an idea that 
they are bound to act in any one of the United States rather 
than another? 

I am, &c., 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 



GENERAL BURGOYNE TO LIEUTENANT-COLONEL BAUM. 

Near Saratoga, 14 August, 1777. 
SIR, 

The accounts you have given me are very satisfactory, and I 
VOL. n. 44 
1776. doubt not every proceeding under your direction will be the 
same. I beg the favor of you to report whether the route you 
have marched will be practicable with a large corps of cannon, 
without repair, or with what sort of repair. The desirable cir 
cumstance for your corps is, at present, to possess Bennington ; 
but should you find the enemy too strongly posted, and maintaining such a countenance as would make a coup de main hazard 
ous, I wish you to take such a post as you can maintain till you 
hear further from me ; and upon your reports and other circum 
stances, I will either support you in force or withdraw you. 

You will please to send to my camp, as soon as you can, wa 
gons and draught-cattle, and likewise such other cattle as are not 
necessary for your subsistence. Let the wagons and carts bring 
off what flour and wheat they can, that you do not retain for the 
same purpose. I will write to you in full to-morrow in regard to 
purchasing horses out of the hands of the savages. In the mean 
time, let them be assured that whatever you select from them, fit 
to mount the dragoons, shall be paid for at proper price. 

I am, &c., 

JOHN BURGOYNE. 



GENERAL ARNOLD TO GENERAL GATES. 

German Flats, 21 August, 1777. 
DEAR GENERAL, 

Your favor of the 19th instant was delivered to me last evening, and I am happy to hear that you are well and have joined 
the army. I beg leave to congratulate you on our late success 
over the enemy by the troops commanded by General Stark. I 
make no doubt it will have a happy effect. 

I leave this place this morning with twelve hundred Continental troops, officers included, and a handful of militia, for Fort 
Schuyler, which is still besieged by a number equal to ours. 
Nothing shall be omitted that can be done to raise the siege. 
You will hear of my being victorious, or no more ; and, as soon 
as the safety of this part of the country will permit, I will fly to 
your assistance. 

General Herkimer died yesterday. I will make your compli 
ments and return your thanks to the other gentlemen when I 
have the pleasure of seeing them. 
I am credibly informed that General St. Leger has sent to 
General Burgoyne for a reinforcement. I believe it will not be 
in his power to spare them, except they have marched before the 
late action, which may be worth inquiring into. 

I am, &c., 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 



GENERAL ARNOLD TO GENERAL GATES. 

Mohawk River, ten miles above Fort Dayton, 

five o clock, P.M., 23 August, 1777. 
DEAR GENERAL, 

I wrote to you the 2 1st instant from German Flats, that, from 
the best intelligence I could procure of the enemy s strength, it 
was much superior to ours. At the same time I inclosed you a 
copy of the resolutions of a Council of War, and requested you 
to send me a reinforcement of one thousand light troops. As 
the enemy had made their approaches within two hundred yards 
of the Fort, I was determined, at all events, to hazard a battle 
rather than to suffer the garrison to fall a sacrifice. This morning I marched from the German Flats for this place. The ex 
cessively bad roads, and necessary precautions in marching through 
a thicli wood, retarded us so much, that we have but this moment 
reached this place, where I have met with an express, with the 
inclosed letter from Colonel Gansevoort, acquainting me that the 
enemy had yesterday retired from Fort Schuyler with great precipitation. I am at a loss to judge of their real intentions, whe 
ther they have returned home, or retired with a view of engaging 
us on the road. I am inclined to the former, from the accounts 
of the deserters, and from their leaving their tents and a consi 
derable baggage, which our people have secured. 

I shall immediately detach about nine hundred men, and make 
a forced march to the Fort, in hopes of coming up with their 
rear, and securing their cannon and heavy baggage. My artil 
lery, tents, &c., &c., I shall leave here. The bateaux, with the 
provisions, follow me. As soon as the security of the post will 
permit, I will return with as many men as can be spared. As I 
came down in bateaux, I shall be able to make despatch. I have 
sent an order for the light troops, if you have sent any, to return 
immediately, and the militia to go home. 

I am, &c., 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 
1776. GENERAL LINCOLN TO THE COUNCIL OF MASSACHUSETTS. 

Bennington, 25 August, 1777. 
GENTLEMEN, 

The evening before the last, I received a letter by express 
from General Gates, desiring me to meet at head-quarters, nearHalf Moon, yesterday morning, where General Clinton was also 
desired to attend, to confer upon a plan of our future operation. 
I met them, and returned here between two and three o clock 
this morning. 

The militia from the State of Massachusetts, and others, are to 
assemble in the Grants, where, probably, they will act for a time. 
It is General Gates s earnest desire that those of them who are 
to serve to the end of November may be forwarded here as soon 
as possible. To his request you will give me leave to subjoin my 
most serious solicitations, that every vigorous exertion to forward 
the troops with rapidity, in the power of the Council, may be 
adopted ; for, in a very few days, if they are not here, the operations of the main body of the northern army will l&gt;e delayed. 
I need not represent the many ill consequences, which may, and 
probably will take place, consequent thereon. 

The militia from the county of Worcester, called for by General Stark, are coming into camp. I am sorry they did hot, on 
the road, hear that I requested them to return and urge on the 
three months men ; for thos$ who come out on the alarms cannot 
remain long in camp, and while they are out, the counties they 
respectively belong to will find it difficult to raise their threemonths men. That consideration hath induced to suffer them to 
return. 

I hear that to-morrow I may expect five companies of the 
three months men. As soon as they arrive, I shall discharge the 
whole of Colonel Cushing s ; for the discontent among them is so 
general that they will be of very little service here if they re 
main. One company of them left the camp the day before yes 
terday ; some left us yesterday ; some, to day ; others, I hear, 
intend to leave us on the morrow. My situation at present is 
truly disagreeable ; for what can make a man feel more so than 
to be accountable for the conduct of troops who do not hold them 
selves under obligation to obey ? I expect matters will soon be 
in a better state. 

I am, &c., 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 
GENERAL ARNOLD TO GENERAL GATES. 

German Flats, 28 August, 1777. 
DEAR GENERAL, 

The 24th instant, in the evening, I reached Fort Schuyler, but 
too late, after so fatiguing a march, to pursue the enemy that 
evening. Early the next morning, a detachment of five hundred 
men followed them. Soon after, a heavy rain came on, which 
obliged them to return, excepting a small party, who went to 
the Oneida Lake, where they arrived just in time to see the 
last boats of the enemy going off. The 26th proved a rainy day, 
so that it was impossible for the troops to move until the evening, when I sent off Colonel Livingston s and Colonel Jackson s 
regiments. Yesterday, Bailey s and Wesson s left Fort Schuyler, 
and arrived here last evening. The greatest despatch is made in 
getting their boats over the Falls. 

You may depend on my joining you as soon as possible with 
my detachment, about twelve hundred men. Few Indians will 
be with me. The Oneidas and Tuscaroras, of all the Six Na 
tions, are our only friends. The Commissioners have frequently 
told them that they wished them to observe a strict neutrality, 
and that they would never ask them to take up arms. I found 
their head men determined to follow the advice of the Commis 
sioners ; and therefore I did not urge the young men to join me, 
though I am told by Mr. Deane that most of them may be in 
duced to do it. I have despatched a messenger to them, acquainting them that you wish to see them immediately ; and that, as 
you are a warrior, they might naturally judge of the subject on 
which you would speak to them. 

I have left Gansevoort s and Van Schaick s regiments, consisting of seven hundred men, at Fort Schuyler. One company of the 
latter garrisons Fort Dayton ; and a second, Fort Johnson. They 
are supplied with two months provisions, and a good store of 
ammunition. 

I believe there is nothing to be feared from the enemy in this 
quarter at present. I have made your compliments and doneyour message to Colonels Gansevoort and Willett. 

I am, &c., 

BENEDICT ARNOLD.

GENERAL BURGOYNE TO GENERAL GATES. 

Head-Quarters of the King s Army, 
upon the Hudson River, 30 August, 1777. 
SIR, 

Major-General Riedesel has requested me to transmit the in 
closed to Lieutenant-Colonel Baum, whom the fortune of war put 
into the hands of your troops at Bennington. 

Having never failed in my attentions towards prisoners, I can 
not entertain a doubt of your taking this opportunity to show me 
a return of civility ; and that you will permit the baggage and 
servants of such officers, your prisoners, as desire it, to pass to 
them unmolested. 

It is with great concern I find myself obliged to add to this 
application, a complaint of the bad treatment the Provincial sol 
diers in the king s service received after the affair at Bennington. 
I have reports, upon oath, that some were refused quarter, after 
having asked it. I am willing to believe that this was against 
the order and inclination of your officers ; but it is my part to 
require an explanation, and to warn you of the horrors of a re 
taliation, if such a practice is not, in the strongest manner, discountenanced and reprehended. 

Duty and principle, Sir, make me a public enemy to the Ame 
ricans who have taken arms ; but I seek to be a generous one ; 
nor have I the shadow of resentment against any individual, who 
does not induce it by acts derogatory to those maxims upon 
which all men of honor think alike. 

Persuaded that a gentleman of the station to whom this letter 
is addressed, will not be comprised in the exception I have 
made, 

I am, personally, Sir, &c., 

JOHN BURGOYNE. 



GENERAL FRASER TO GENERAL GATES. 

1 September, 1777. 
SIR, 

I have it in charge, from his Excellency Lieutenant-General 
Burgoyne, to desire that you would have the goodness to give 
directions for transmitting to me a return of the British officers 
and private men who were made prisoners at the skirmish nearBennington, specifying the wounded, the nature of their wounds, 
and the manner in which they are attended. If any aid of surgeons or medicines should be wanted, the Lieutenant-General 
wishes to forward it without delay. The manner in which we 
have treated such of your officers and men as have fallen into 
our hands, gives me reason to expect that every degree of care 
will be extended to those brave men whom the fate of war has 
put in your power. 

I send an open letter to the senior British officer now in yourhands, and desire the favor of you to forward it. I have the 
honor to be, Sir, 

Your most obedient, humble servant, 

SIMON FRASER. 



GENERAL GATES TO GENERAL FRASER. 

Head-Quarters, 2 September, 1777. 
SIR, 

Last night I was favored with your letter of yesterday s date. 
The return you request is by this conveyance transmitted to his 
Excellency General Burgoyne. Surgeons, medicines, and attend 
ance, with every comfort imaginable, have been amply supplied 
to the sick and wounded officers and soldiers, prisoners at Ben 
nington, as it is the wish of every generous mind, that the cala 
mities of war should lie as light as possible upon unhappy indi 
viduals who are wounded or taken. You will be satisfied these 
are my sentiments when you examine Ensign and Quarter-master 
Sanders, who were brought by one of my scouts, last year, to 
Ticonderoga. In Brigadier-General St. Leger s retreat from Fort 
Stanwix, and during the siege thereof, some British officers and 
soldiers have fallen into our hands. As soon as I know their 
names, they shall be sent to you in writing. Your letter, ad 
dressed to the senior British officer, is sent to Bennington. I 
have the honor to be, Sir, 

Your most obedient, humble servant, 

HORATIO GATES. 

1776. GENERAL LINCOLN TO GENERAL GATES. 

Bennington, 4 September, 1777. 
DEAR GENERAL, 

The person I sent to General Burgoyne is returned. He had 
an opportunity to confer with him, with Fraser and others, and 
was suffered to return into the country, under the character of a 
Recruiting Officer. He informs me that the flying camp is about 
three miles below Fort Miller, on the east side of the river, and 
consists of seventeen hundred men ; that the American troops are 
about half a mile above them, and he supposes there are about 
fifteen hundred of them. About one mile above, is the German 
camp ; then the British head-quarters, number unknown. At Fort 
Edward there are about three hundred men, commanded by a 
Major; about one hundred and fifty at Fort George; about five 
hundred at Ticonderoga. By every appearance, the enemy s designs are to move down the river. This is confirmed by every 
person who comes out. 

My informant gives it as his opinion, from the best evidence 
he could collect, that there are about six thousand European 
troops on the south of Lake Champlain. I hear, by another per 
son who left Fort Edward the 30th ultimo, that the enemy had 
sent one English regiment, and fifteen or sixteen light field-pieces, 
to Fort Anne ; and that, on the 2d instant, General Burgoyneintended to remove his heavy cannon to Stillwater. I hope you 
will take possession before him, as I know, in that case, you will 
seriously dispute title with him; and doubt not but you will con 
vince him that his claim is insupportable. 

I have sent to the officers, civil and military, and to a number 
of private gentlemen in the county of Berkshire, desiring their 
aid to the Commissary, by furnishing him with teams to forward 
on the flour here as fast as possible. I have received a quantity 
of ammunition from General Heath; have now a good supply, 
and have good reason to believe that I shall have a sufficiency 
of flour. Beef we have in plenty. I have the honor to be, dearGeneral, 

With the warmest sentiments of regard and esteem, &c., 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 


GENERAL LINCOLN TO GENERAL GATES. 

Pawlet, 11 September, 1777.
 
DEAR GENERAL, 

I am honored with your favor of the 10th instant. General 
Stark, by his last letter, informed me his troops should join yourHonor ; since which, I have heard of his march ; therefore have 
inclosed your letter to him. I should not have been short of 
ammunition, had the militia from the Massachusetts attended to 
the orders of the Court, and had the ball sent from Springfield 
and Albany been of a size suitable for the muskets. 

On our movement this way, the few enemy, who were at 
Skenesborough, left it, after burning a number of boats. We 
have in camp about two thousand men, and now a prospect of a 
supply of flour. On the return of the scouts, now out, I expect 
a good account of the enemy s situation ; shall not fail, immedi 
ately, by scouts and heavier detachments, to attempt giving that 
diversion to General Burgoyne which we contemplated my move 
ment here would effect. 

I am, &c., 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 



GENERAL LINCOLN TO COLONEL BROWN. 

Pawlet, 12 September, 1777 
SIR, 

You will please to take the command of five hundred men, and 
proceed, in the best route, to cross the Narrows, as soon as may 
be, to the landing at the north end of Lake George ; and, if you 
find any of our men prisoners there, you will relieve them, and 
destroy all such boats and stores belonging to the enemy as may 
fall within your power ; and if, upon inquiry, you find that you 
can attempt Ticonderoga, without risking too much, you will do 
it. As in all your movements you must be regulated by the in 
formation you receive of the situation of the enemy, which may 
be such as to render it impossible to execute these orders, you 
are, therefore, to consider them as discretionary ; and, if you find 
matters different from what hath been represented, and you can 
not prosecute the above plan, you will adopt such an one, as, in 
your opinion, will most annoy, divide, and distract the enemy. 
1776. You will give me, from time to time, the earliest information 
possible of your movements, and of the discoveries you shall 
make. I wish you success. 

And am, dear Sir, &e., 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 



GENERAL LINCOLN TO GENERAL GATES. 

Pawlet, 14 September, 1777. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I just now received your favor of yesterday s date. By a 
scout, who has been near Fort Edward, and from one of the 
inhabitants in that neighbourhood, I have a confirmation of the 
enemy s movements mentioned in your letter. I think it is not 
probable that their design is on your post. However, I will keep 
the most watchful eye over them, and, if possible, prevent a surprise. 

On being informed by almost every person who came in, as 
well as by the letter you inclosed to me from General Palmer, 
of the weak state of Ticonderoga, and also advised that a consi 
derable number of our men were prisoners in the enemy s hands,, 
and kept at Lake George Landing, under a very small guard, at 
which place the enemy had a large magazine of stores ; and sup 
posing a movement that way would perfectly coincide with the 
original design of my being" sent here, namely, if possible to di 
vide and distract the enemy, I was induced yesterday, with the 
advice of the officers, to send Colonel Brown, with five hundred 
men, to the landing at Lake George, to relieve the prisoners and 
destroy the stores there ; the same number of men under Colonel 
Johnson to Mount Independence; the latter to give a diversion 
to the enemy, while the former should execute his commission, 
and, if an opportunity should offer, without risking too much, to 
push for Mount Independence, while Colonel Brown would at 
tempt Ticonderoga, and, farther, to amuse and divide the enemy 
by attacking their outposts, &c. A like number of men were 
sent under Colonel Woodbridge to Skenesborough, thence to Fort 
Anne, and on to Fort Edward. 

I hope these movements will meet your approbation. I should 
have mentioned the design before, and not have put the plan in 
execution without your advice, could I have been sure the in 
formation would not have fallen into the hands of the enemy. I 
supposed that you intended to hint to me your apprehension of 
danger in this way, and that I must be cautious as to what I 
wrote, when, in the close of your favor of the 10th, you say, " I 
desire you will not fail frequently to acquaint me with yourmovements, and, as far as is prudent, with your designs." 
I am, &c., 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 



GENERAL GATES TO GENERAL LINCOLN. 

Camp, Heights above Behmus, 19 September, 1777. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

It is the opinion of all the Generals that I have consulted 
with, that, in the present position and circumstances of General 
Burgoyne s army, considered with his apparent views, your army 
ought to be posted at Stillwater, and that not one moment should 
be lost in your marching them thither. Upon your arrival there, 
you will take possession of the height upon the east side, and fix 
five or six hundred men thereupon. The rest you will encamp 
at the old station. General Burgoyne has not left the smallest 
article at any of the posts in the rear. This, I informed you of 
in my last. You will march by the shortest route to Stillwater. 
Provisions, &c., shall be provided for you there. 

I am, &c., 

HORATIO GATES. 



GENERAL LINCOLN TO COLONEL BROWN. 

Pawlet, 21 September, 1777. 

DEAR COLONEL, 

All your movements since you left this place have [been] very 
agreeable to me. I am greatly obliged to you for your exertions, 
and am glad to hear, that with spirit the officers and men under 
you have distinguished themselves. You are all entitled to the 
thanks of the public; mine you have most cordially. 

I had no idea, when I wrote to General Bayley, to which 
letter you refer, of your retreating while there was a probability 
of success ; neither do I now wish it. Colonel "Woodbridge will 
afford you all the assistance in his power. I had yesterday 
1776. General Gates s repeated orders to join him at Stillwater. I must 
do it myself with all the troops I can collect here. He had 
a skirmish, the night before last, with the enemy. He took two 
hundred and fifty prisoners and three field-pieces. General Warner and you must act your own judgments with respect to at 
tacking the enemy s lines, continuing the siege, or retiring. I 
am this moment going to set off; expect to see General Gates 
to-morrow. I shall leave General Bayley at Castleton, who will 
afford you every in supplies. 

I am, &c., 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 

P. S. While at Skenesborough, I could get no advice from you, 
and supposed our expresses were cut off. Indeed, I was con 
firmed in this opinion, after being informed that one of our boats 
was fired on by the Tories, and one man killed. The boat went, 
as afterwards I was told, into East Bay. I therefore took post 
for one night at Castleton. 



GENERAL LINCOLN TO THE COUNCIL OF MASSACHUSETTS. 

23 September, 1777. 
GENTLEMEN, 

I marched from Manchester to Pawlet, with the troops who 
had joined me, on Monday/ the 8th. On the 14th, a party of 
five hundred men, commanded by Colonel Brown, was ordered to 
cross the Narrows in South Bay, and march for the Landing at 
the north end of Lake George, to destroy the enemy s boats 
and stores, and relieve a number of our men, prisoners there ; 
and if, upon inquiry, he found an attempt upon Ticonderoga 
might be made without risking too much, he was to do it. A 
like number was sent to Mount Independence, under Colonel 
Johnson, in order to divert, at least, the enemy there, and take 
off their attention from our real object, and to attack it, if a 
favorable opportunity should offer. At the same time, another 
party of about five hundred was sent, under Colonel Woodbridge, 
to Skenesborough, who were to cover Colonel Brown, and march 
on towards Fort Edward, and give the enemy a diversion in that 
quarter. 

The success Colonel Brown hath met with, you learn by the 
inclosed, which is a copy of his letter to me. He hath acted 
with great spirit, and informs me that his officers and men have 
behaved with bravery.* General Warner is with Colonel Johnson, 
at the Mount, and hath the general direction of the three parties, 
lie informs me, that no opportunity hath offered by which he 
might attack the lines at Mount Independence with a probability 
of success. I feel myself very happy in having him there, for I 
have the greatest confidence in his prudence, fortitude, and zeal. 
General Bayley, who was Colonel Bayley in the last war, of the 
State of New Hampshire, now on the Grants, an experienced, 
good officer, is left at Castleton, in the neighbourhood of the enemy, and will forward supplies, and join the troops, if necessary. 

I moved, on Wednesday, the 17th, to Skenesborough, and 
marched that way about seven hundred men, with an intention to 
move towards the North River; but the day after, before the 
troops reached me there, I had information from General Gates, 
that the enemy had abandoned all their posts in their rear ; and 
proposed I should fall on the enemy s left flank. I immediately 
remarched the seven hundred men on their way back, near to 
Pawlet. The next day, by two expresses, I received General 
Gates s orders to take post at Stillwater; for the enemy had not 
only abandoned the posts in their rear, but had broken down all 
the bridges immediately on passing them, which evidenced General Burgoyne s intention to move forward, at all events. 

I left Pawlet the day before yesterday (Sunday), arrived here 
last night, and expect the troops in this evening or in the morn

letter written by Colonel Brown to General Gates, dated " North 
End of Lake George, September 18, 1777," and published in the 
newspapers of the time, gives the particulars of his success against 
the enemy. 

" With great fatigue, after marching all last night, I arrived at this 
place at break of day, and after the best disposition of the men I could 
make, immediately began the attack, and, in a few minutes, carried 
the place. I then, without loss of time, detached a considerable part 
of my men to the mill, where a great number of the enemy were 
posted, who also were made prisoners; a small number of whom having taken possession of a block-house in that vicinity, were with more 
difiiculty brought to submission ; but at the sight of the cannon they 
surrendered. 

" During these seasons of successes, Mount Defiance also fell into 

our hands. I have taken possession of the old French lines at Ticon

and Mount Independence in the strongest and most peremptory terms.

about three thousand, including three small regiments of Continental troops, the rangers from the Grants and part of their mili 
tia, the militia from Berkshire, who came for twenty days only, 
with all the Massachusetts three months men. 

The prisoners taken at Ticonderoga may soon be expected at 
Boston, to which place General Gates hath ordered them. An 
attack on this post, from the enemy, is hourly expected.

GENERAL GATES TO GENERAL PUTNAM. 

Albany, 2 November, 1777. 
DEAR SIR, 

Governor Clinton will present you my letter to him of this 
date, which contains my unalterable sentiments of the measures 
which ought to be taken, should Sir Harry Clinton attempt to 
succour or reenforcc Sir William Howe. I will not again repeat 
them here, but only take the liberty earnestly to recommend the 
profoundest secrecy in whatever you determine to do ; for, depend 
upon it, that that consummate, artful woman, Mrs. Robinson, will 
do all in her power to be acquainted with your secrets. 

As to any attack upon New York, I utterly disapprove of it; 
for, while the enemy s ships of war can act in the North and 
East Rivers, the taking of that city would be doubtful, and, if 
I have had as yet no information of the event of Colonel Johnson s 
attack on the Mount. My loss of men, in these several actions, is 
not more than three or four killed, and five wounded. The enemy s 
loss is less. I find myself in possession of two hundred and ninetythree prisoners, namely; two Captains, nine subalterns, two Commis 
saries; non-commissioned officers and privates, one hundred and fortythree British, and one hundred and nineteen Canadians; eighteen arti 
ficers ; and retook more than one hundred of our men ; total, two 
hundred and ninety-three, exclusive of the prisoners retaken. The 
Avater- craft I have taken is one hundred and fifty bateaux, above 
the Falls ; in Lake Champlain, fifty, above the Falls, including several large gun-boats and an armed sloop ; arms equal to the number of 
prisoners ; some ammunition ; and many other things which I cannot 
as yet ascertain. I must not forget to mention a few cannon, which 
may be of great service to us." 
taken, could not be held ; and be assured, that all stores, of any 
value to us, are or will be afloat, before any large detachments 
leave that city, and I can see no good in taking an empty town, 
which we cannot hold. Of course it is not an object to divert 
the attention of the King s Generals from their more important 
designs. 

I am, &c., 

HORATIO GATES. 



THOMAS CHITTENDEN TO GENERAL GATES. 

In Council, Bennington, 22 November, 1777. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I have the pleasure to inform your Honor of the success of 
our Green Mountain rangers, in harassing the enemy s rear on 
their retreat from Ticonderoga, in which Captain Ebenezer Allen, 
with fifty rangers, has taken forty-nine prisoners, upwards of onehundred horses, twelve yokes of oxen, four cows, and three of 
the enemy s boats, &c. &c. 

Major "Wait, who was sent to take possession of Mount Independence, found nothing of consequence, excepting several boats 
which the enemy had sunk, in which there were some provisions. 
All barracks, houses, and bridges were burnt ; cannon, to the 
number of forty, broken and spiked up. He was so fortunate as 
to take one French sutler, with some rum, wine, brandy, &c. 

Agreeably to your Honor s request for Colonel Warner to come 
to Albany, express was sent, and he is to set off for Albany this 
morning. I have the honor to be, by order of Council, 
Your Honor s most obedient, humble servant, 

THOMAS CHITTENDEN, President. 

N. B. I beg your Honor s directions how to dispose of the 
prisoners. 



GENERAL BURGOYNE TO GENERAL GATES. 

Cambridge, 11 February, 1778. 
SIR, 

I received the resolves of the Congress, of the 8th of January, 
with an astonishment that no occurrence ever before occasioned. 
1776. It would be misplaced to enter now into any reasoning upon the 
subject. 

I apply to you, Sir, as an individual whom I believe to have 
honor, humanity, and generosity. My Aid-de-camp has directions 
to communicate to you my letters to the Congress. I leave to 
your feelings to support that which regards my private situation, 
only begging leave to recall to your recollection the offer you 
made, in regard to my personal embarkation. In the full persua 
sion of the integrity of that proposal, I thought not of entering 
into reasonings and justifications in my public or private letters 
from Albany, in any such degree as the delicacy of a soldier s 
character required, after a series of the most critical situations, 
difficult attempts, and diversified ill success. To die in this country, is nothing ; but to leave my honor unvindicated in my own, 
is more than philosophy or fortitude can be expected to bear. 

I confide in you, to consider this entirely as a private letter, 
and am, 

With sincere regard, Sir, &c., 

JOHN BURGOYNE. 



GENERAL GATES TO GENERAL BURGOYNE. 

York, 2 March, 1778. 
SIR, 

I am exceedingly mortificfd that you did not accept of my offer 
at Albany, to go to England in a vessel, that the State of Mas 
sachusetts Bay would, at my request, have provided. General 
Glover, with whom you are acquainted, was, in that case, to have 
attended you in his own ship ; and I am persuaded you would 
have avoided many disagreements, had it pleased you to have 
accepted that offer. Your case I feel, as I ever shall that of the 
unfortunate brave. If courage, perseverance, and a faithful attach 
ment to your Prince could have prevailed, I might have been 
your prisoner. The chance of Avar has determined otherwise. 

The Congress now send the passports you desire ; and I am 
happy to acquaint you, that the Major and Lady Harriet Ackland 
arc in New York, and may possibly be in England as soon as, 
or very soon after you. With respect, I am, Sir, 
Your most obedient, humble servant, 

HORATIO GATES. 
GENERAL LINCOLN TO COLONEL JOHN LAURENS. 

Boston, 5 February, 1781. 
MY DEAR SIR, 

In compliance with your wish, that I would give you the out 
lines of the several movements I made in the Northern depart 
ment, in the year 1777, after General Gates reassumed the command, to my being wounded on the 8th of October, I offer the 
following short state of the matter. 

General Gates s arrival in camp at the Sprouts, about twelve 
miles above Albany, was announced to me in Bennington, on the 
19th of September, by his letter of that date to General Stark, 
in which he requests our ideas of a plan for the future opera 
tions of the campaign. We were fully of opinion, that a body of 
militia should be collected in the Grants, and move in the rearof General Burgoyne, as this measure would oblige him to make 
heavy detachments to secure the several posts necessary to cover 
his rear, on the doing of which the salvation of his army might 
depend. He would also be obliged to escort his provision-wagons, 
which would serve to weaken his main body, as General Gates 
would have little to fear in front. Besides, this movement would 
cover a large and valuable country, filled with provisions, and re 
strain the unfriendly. 

Immediately on General Gates receiving this letter, he ordered 
me to attend him at head-quarters. At that interview I explained 
to him fully the reasons on which our opinion was grounded. 
lie acceded to the propriety of the measure, and ordered me 
back to Bennington, to receive the Massachusetts militia, who had 
been ordered on, and to make the necessary arrangements to act 
in conjunction with him on a general plan. On the 2d of Sep 
tember, the Commissary reported that there was a deficiency of 
flour, which was an alnrming circumstance, as our division was 
to consist of militia, who cannot long be held, without proper 
attention is paid to their supplies. I immediately wrote to the 
officers, civil and military, in the county of Berkshire, requesting 
their attention to this matter, and their aid to forward the flourstored in that part of the country. They, and the people at 
large, stimulated by the most laudable motives, soon gave us, 
though the transportation was extremely difficult, the most am 
ple supply. From an apprehension that it might be too long 
delayed, I wrote to that county for a body of their militia, and 
45* 



534 OPERATIONS OF [1781. 

requested that they would come mounted, each bringing his sack 
of flour. 

On the 7th, having received some supplies, and good assurance 
that a sufficiency would be sent on, M T e moved to Manchester, 
with the troops which were collected, and gave orders for others 
to follow as they arrived. On the 8th, I reached Pawlet with 
part of the troops. Here we halted for the arrival of the remain 
der, and the stores, and to know the situation of the enemy, and 
because it was a strong post, both of our flanks being covered by 
mountains, in most places impassable, forming, at this place, al 
most the point of an acute angle, not unlike my ideas of the 
strength of Thermopylae. Thus far we could pass with wagons. 

On the loth, our little army being collected, which consisted of 
two thousand five hundred men, and the stores being arrived, to 
execute our general plan, which was to annoy, divide, and distract the enemy, Colonel Brown was sent with five hundred men 
across the Narrows (part of Lake Champlain, or, as it is some 
times called, South Bay), to the north end of Lake George, with 
instructions to destroy all the boats and stores there belonging to 
the enemy, and, if possible, to relieve our prisoners at that post. 
Colonel Johnson was ordered, with a like number of men, to 
Mount Independence, with instructions to attempt that post, to 
favor the designs of Colonel Brown. Colonel Woodbridge was 
ordered with five hundred men to Skenesborough, with instruc 
tions to proceed to Fort Anne, and from thence to attempt the 
enemy s post at the Mills, if it could be done without risking too 
much. Hereby he became a cover to Colonel Brown, and se 
cured his retreat, if nothing more could be effected. In order to 
give despatch to these enterprises, and ease to the troops, the 
horse, which I wrote for from Berkshire to come on with sacks, 
having arrived, they were divided among the three commands, and 
took on the flour. The beeves were kept on foot. A number of 
militia light-horse were ordered on, with their saddle-bags filled 
with spare cartridges. Thus the men moved very light, and with 
great despatch. 

On the 17th, after leaving four hundred men to cover the 
stores at Pawlet, I moved with six hundred towards Skenesbo 
rough, in order to join Colonel "Woodbridge, the more effectually 
to cover Colonel Brown ; at which post I intended Colonels 
Brown and Johnson should join me, in order to move in force 
into the rear of General Burgoync. 

Colonel Johnson arrived in time before Mount Independence, 
and remained there a number of days; but, finding the enemy too 
well covered to attempt an assault with a probability of success, 
he returned when ordered. The enemy having evacuated their 
posts in their rear, it became unnecessary for Colonel Woodbridge 
to proceed farther than Skenesborough. Colonel Brown s success 
you have fully represented in the following extracts from his re 
port to me. 

On the 19th, I received a letter from General Gates, approving the measures I had taken, and expressing his wish that I 
would take a different post, as General Burgoyne had totally 
neglected his rear. I then ordered the troops, who were on their 
march to Skenesborough, to return to Pawlet. On the 20th, I 
received his orders to take post at Stilhvater. This laid me under the necessity of giving orders to our troops, before Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, to return and join me at Stillwater, as soon as they should have succeeded, or all hopes of 
success should be cut off; and, after leaving a proper guard at 
Pawlet, to march the troops, not on command, to Stilhvater. I 
left them, on the 21st, to be marched by their proper officers, 
and reached head-quarters at Behmus s Heights, in the evening 
of the 22d. 

After my arrival in camp, the General gave me the right wing 
of the army, which consisted of Nixon s, Glover s, and Patterson s 
brigades, and the Massachusetts militia, as they arrived from the 
expedition northward. Thus matters remained, without any thing 
very particular, until the 7th of October. In the afternoon, the 
enemy moved with their right towards our left. The light troops 
were sent out to skirmish with them, to retard and observe their 
motions; for the General was apprehensive that they meant a 
feint on the left while they should attempt a real attack on ourright. The light troops were reenforced by Poor s and Learned s 
brigade on the left. As the action became serious, they were 
reenforced by militia and detachments from the right. Towards 
evening, General Gates ordered me to move with the right, and 
attack the enemy s left; but it became so dark before we could 
reach their line, that nothing happened there but some skirmishing between the advanced parties. Their right suffered greatly, 
and were driven within their lines ; and some of their outworks 
were carried by our people, and the day ended gloriously on ourside. 

I received orders to move by daylight, in the morning of the 
8th, with the right, and attempt the enemy s lines. We advanced 
three brigades, each brigade forming a column, and marching 
from its own encampment. At the same time, there was a move 
ment on the left. On the approach of our advanced corps, the 
enemy, after exchanging n few shots, left their lines, to be possessed by us, and took post on a height in the rear of their lines. 
Soon after this I received a wound in my leg, which prevented 
my remaining longer in the field ; and my long ill health prevented my remarking further particulars on the campaign, which 
ended witli so much advantage to America, and so justly to the 
honor of General Gates. 

I am, my dear Sir, &c., 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 



GENERAL PUTNAM TO GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Head-Quarters, Peekskill, 29 September, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

By order from General Washington, all the troops from this 
post, except about eleven hundred Continental and four hundred 
of the militia, are withdrawn. I have received intelligence, on 
which I fully depend, that the enemy had received a reenforcement at New York, last Thursday, of about three thousand British and foreign troops ; that General Clinton has called in 
guides, who belong about Croton River; has ordered hard bread 
baked; that the troops are called from Paulus Hook to King s 
Bridge, and the whole troops are now under marching orders. 

Under these circumstances, and from a variety of other consi 
derations, I think it highly probable the designs of the enemy 
are against the posts in the Highlands, or some part of the counties of Wcstchester or Dutchess. Should their attack be upon 
the posts in the Highlands, you cannot have the least expectation 
the posts can be maintained, with our present force, against the 
strength the enemy may, or probably will send. When you con 
sider the infinite importance of the post to the general interest 
of the country, and of this State in particular, I cannot entertain 
a, doubt of your immediate attention to the defence of it. Unless 
a greater force than at present is here, or appears probable to 
be here, is supplied for the defence of the post, you must be 
sensible I cannot be answerable for the defence of it. I there 
fore beg you to pay an attention to this important post, and 
afford me a reinforcement of the militia, that will enable me to 
maintain it. If it is possible for you to pay a personal attention 
to this object, I shall be happy in your counsel and assistance, 
and am, dear Sir, 

Your very humble servant, 

ISRAEL PUTNAM. 

P. S. I received your favor of the 28th instant, and shall ob 
serve the contents. The ships are drawn up in the river, and I 
believe nothing prevents them from paying us an immediate visit, 
but the contrary wind. 



GENERAL PUTNAM TO GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Peekskill, eight o clock in the evening, 4th October. 

DEAR SIR, 

This morning we had information from our guard-boats, that 
there were two ships of war, three tenders, and a large number 
of fiat-bottomed boats, coming up the river. They proceeded up 
as far as Tarry Town, where they landed their men. This evening they were followed by one large man-of-war, five topsail ves 
sels, and a large number of small craft. I have sent off parties 
to examine their route, and harass their march, if prudent. 

General Parsons has gone down to reconnoitre. He has not 
yet returned; but by information from several different quarters, 
we have reason to believe they intend for this post. They are 
now making up, as we hear, for Croton Bridge. You will please 
to give such orders to the militia, in consequence thereof, as you 
shall think proper. I have sent the barge to you with this, and 
most sincerely wish you would come down as soon as convenient. 
I should have wrote you before, but I thought this movement 
only to drive off some cattle, &c. I am, dear Sir, with great 
regard, 

Your most humble servant, 

ISRAEL PUTNAM. 
GENERAL PUTNAM TO GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Paper Mills, 6 October, 1777. 
DEAR GENERAL, 

I am this moment returned from Fort Independence, and find 
the [intelligence concerning a] party of the enemy, which were 
said to have landed last night at that Fort, is without foundation. 
By the inhabitants, who live just by Fort Independence, I am 
informed that the enemy have landed betwixt King s Ferry and 
Dunderberg. If that is the case, they mean to attack Fort Mont 
gomery by land, which when I am sure of, I shall immediately 
reenforce you.* 

I am, &c., 

ISRAEL PUTNAM. 



GENERAL PUTNAM TO GENERAL GATES. 

Fishkill, eleven o clock, A. M., 9 October, 1777. 
DEAR GENERAL, 

In my letter of yesterday, I acquainted you of the enemy s 
having possession of Fort Montgomery. Yesterday they pro 
ceeded up the river with their ships, galleys, flat-bottomed boats, 
&c., and landed a body at Fort Constitution, took possession of 
that post, and played round "the die raux-dc-f rise a little. I ex 
pect every moment to have information that they are advancing 
up. 

Governor Clinton is on the west side of the river, with about 
four hundred Continental troops, which I sent him yesterday, and 
is exerting himself in collecting the militia. If they attempt to 
land on that side, he will oppose and annoy them as much as 
possible. If this side should be their object, I shall, with the re 
mainder of the Continental troops and the Connecticut militia 
(which, I am happy to inform you, came in yesterday and the 
day before in great numbers, but, I am sorry to say, they 
already begin to run away), oppose them every way in my 
power. Certain it is, that they mean, at all events, to join Ge

same da} r , October Gth. See the purliculars in Washington s Writings, 
Vol. V. p. 471. 
ncral Burgoyne without delay. They are on a desperate point; 
and I dare say that their orders are positive to join the Northern 
army, at all risks. General Clinton commands them in person. 
He has two general officers with him, and, I believe, between 
five and six thousand men. If they should proceed by water, I 
shall do every thing in my power to arrive at Albany before 
them. Weighing the chcvaux-de-frise, I do not think is a matter 
of any moment to them. They can take a fair wind, and, with 
their flat-bottomed boats, which all have sails, go to Albany, or 
Half- Moon, with great expedition, and, I believe, without any 
opposition. Would it not be a matter of great importance to 
send, if you can possibly spare them, a detachment from yourarmy towards Albany, or some advantageous ground, to prevent 
them from getting between you and me ? For, if they should 
come on your rear, the situation of your army would be disagreeable. 

The loss of Fort Montgomery has, instead of depressing the 
spirits of the country, animated them. So many forts and strong 
holds have been given up without fighting, that they began to 
despair, and thought that our troops would not face the enemy. 
But now they begin to be convinced of the contrary ; for the few 
brave men, who were in that fort, defended it five hours against 
at least five thousand of the enemy, determined on carrying the 
post. The garrison, in the whole, did not amount to more than 
six hundred. Notwithstanding the great superiority of the enemy, 
our troops never surrendered the fort, but fought, from one re 
doubt to another, after the enemy had got into the fort; and, 
when they could do no more, they fought their way through, and 
most of them made their escape. Colonel Dubois, who had a 
wound with a bayonet in his neck, has mustered nearly two hundred of his men, who were with him in the action, many of 
whom have slight wounds with bayonets and swords, but are in 
high spirits, and, I hope, will effect something clever. 

I am, &c., 

ISRAEL PUTNAM. 

P. S. If there are any of the militia in your quarter that yet 
remain at home, pray let them be mustered. 


GENERAL PUTNAM TO GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Fishkill, ten o clock, P.M., 9 October. 1777. 
DEAR GOVERNOR, 

Upon your letter, and some intelligence I received from below, 
I am fully of opinion the enemy intended a desperate effort to 
relieve General Burgoyne. I had the advice of the General 
Officers here, and we were of opinion, that to keep our force col 
lected would be the best means of preserving our safety. As it 
is uncertain which side of the river the enemy will take, and 
having it in their power to make their election (in which we 
shall be unable to follow them), to throw our main force on the 
west side of the river would leave our principal stores a prey, 
and expose the resources of this and the Northern army to be 
cut off. 

I have thought it advisable to order Colonel Brinkerhoff s regi 
ment immediately to march and join you ; and, should the enemy 
succeed in weighing the chevaux-de-frise, and proceed up the 
river, I should think it advisable for you to proceed to Albany 
with despatch ; and, should the number of cannon you have incumbcr your march, you will convey as many of them as you 
shall think proper to some place of safety, and proceed on with 
the rest. The militia of Connecticut, I hear, are coming in. I 
shall do every thing in my power to oppose the enemy, and to 
give succour to you, trusting .that, through the smiles of Heaven, 
we shall yet be free. With great esteem and respect, 

I am, your obedient, humble servant, 

ISRAEL PUTNAM. 



GOVERNOR CLINTON TO GENERAL GATES. 

New Windsor, 9 October. 1777.
 
DEAR GENERAL, 

Immediately after our late misfortune at Fort Montgomery, I 
wrote the Legislature of this State the particulars, requesting 
them, without delay, to forward them to you. My hurry, at that 
time, and since, prevented my answering your favor of the 4th 
instant until now ; since which, the enemy have taken possession 
of Fort Constitution, and are, at this time, riot far below the clievaux-dc-frise. 
My guards fell in with, and took two spies from General Clin 
ton, going to Burgoyne. One of them confessed, that his orders 
were to make all possible despatch, and inform General Burgoynethat he had got Fort Montgomery, the key of America, and that 
he was prepared to weigh the chevaux-de-frise ; and that he, Burgoyne, might now proceed, as all obstacles in the river were re 
moved, lie further says, that Clinton is determined to push up 
the river to relieve Burgoyne from his present difficulty. The 
inclosed confession of Taylor will give you some idea of their 
past manoeuvres and future intentions. 

If I have been rightly informed, your army is now so nume 
rous that you can with safety order a part of it to establish a 
post at, or this side, Albany. In that case, if they move up, 
General Putnam, who is collecting a large body of the Connecti 
cut militia on the opposite shore, will be able to join them. I 
shall endeavour to keep between them and your army, with two 
Continental regiments and some militia; and I hope, by this 
means, to keep them from Albany. Indeed, I am sure it can 
be done, provided you establish a post on this side for us to 
retire to. I cannot, at present, ascertain the number lost at Fort 
Montgomery. My brother, General Clinton, who received a wound 
in his thigh, with a number of other officers, and two hundred of 
Dubois s regiment, made their escape after the enemy were in 
possession of the fort, and have come in safe. 

"We have just received intelligence that General Washington 
attacked the enemy, last Saturday, on Chestnut Hill, near Phila 
delphia, defeated, and drove them through Germantown. Night 
coming on, he withdrew, and renewed the attack early on Sunday 
morning, and had gained the victory.* We have as yet received 
no authenticated accounts of the action. 

Colonel Lamb, and most of his officers who were with me at 
the fort, also escaped. 

I am, dear Sir, &c., 

GEORGE CLINTON. 


GENERAL PUTNAM TO GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Continental Ferry, 15 October, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

The shipping, moving up the river, must fully convince us that 
their intentions are for Albany. It is, therefore, a matter of the 
utmost importance for us immediately to fix upon what manner 
we shall dispose of our troops. If we were convinced that General Gates was able to oppose them, I think we ought not to lose 
one moment, but march immediately down to King s Bridge. 

I wrote General Gates on Sunday, and begged of him to ac 
quaint me with his situation. Would it not, therefore, be prudent 
to keep our troops at Fishkill until I receive his answer? Yourimmediate opinion will oblige, dear Sir, 

Your very humble servant, 

ISRAEL PUTNAM. 

SIR, Since the General wrote the within, he has received 
yours ; and I am directed by him to acquaint your Excellency, 
that he agrees with you in opinion, that moving up the river will 
be the most practicable method to be taken. The General intends 
moving up immediately ; and I am, in haste, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

T. YATES, Adjutant. 



GENERAL PUTNAM TO GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Three miles above Fishkill, 1G October, 1777. 

DEAR GOVERNOR, 

I received your agreeable favor, and congratulate you on the 
glorious intelligence it contains of the capture of General Burgoyne.* I have halted my troops, who were on their march 
northward, and desirous of doing every thing to subserve our important cause, and bring our struggles to a happy and speedy 
issue. I should be glad of your opinion respecting my future 
movements whether I shall proceed to Albany, or remain to 
watch the motions of the enemy on the river, and protect the 
shore, or move immediately down to attack King s Bridge, leaving all the York militia in Dutchess county to guard the river. 
General Parsons, with about two thousand troops, is at Peekskill. 
My troops will halt upon the road where they are, till I receive 
your advice in the premises, which I request may be as speedy 
as possible ; also, that you would acquaint me whether you will 
probably be able to afford any assistance, in case it should be 
thought advisable to move down to the Bridge. With esteem 
and respect, I am, dear Sir, 

Your obedient, humble servant, 

ISRAEL PUTNAM. 

P. S. If you should advise going to the Bridge, I desire Colo 
nel Lamb would come down. 



GOVERNOR CLINTON TO GENERAL PUTNAM. 

Marbletown, seven miles from Kingston, 

17 October, 1777. 

SIR, 

I received your favor of the 16th. I am sorry to inform you, 
that by a letter from General Gates, of the 15th, the enemy had 
not surrendered. You do me the honor to ask my opinion re 
specting your future movements. It is needless and impossible 
for me to advise; because, having once settled our plan and 
afterwards deviated from it, the concerting any future measures 
might be productive of ruin to one of us, if deprived of those 
succours and that support, which form a part of the general plan 
of operations. My opinion of your attack at King s Bridge is, 
that it will be utterly inefficacious. 

For the rest, as your operations must be governed by circum 
stances, I can only inform you of facts. Kingston was burnt yes 
terday afternoon, because I had not troops to defend it. Two 
prisoners tell me that Albany is the enemy s object. If I ad 
vance much farther northward, it will be in the power of the 
enemy to ruin my little corps by landing above and below me, 
as I shall then have the Catskill Mountains to the west, and 
Hudson s River to the east. I expect every instant to hear that 
Rhinebeck is in flames. I have the honor to be, 

Your most obedient and humble servant, 

GEORGE CLINTON. 
P. S. I trust you must have received General Gates s letter 
of the 13th, of which he sent me a copy, in which he approves 
of the plan of removing our armies up the river on each side. 



GENERAL PUTNAM TO GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Head-Quarters, Red Hook, 20 October, 1777. 

SIR, 

By the inclosed copies, the originals of which were taken yesday, on their passage to New York, your Excellency will be able 
to form some judgment of the enemy s intentions, and what is 
best to be done, as far as circumstances will admit. Would it 
not answer a very valuable purpose to get the guns out of the 
row-galley that is scuttled in Esopus Creek, as they may be 
turned to the annoyance of the enemy, and prevent their getting 
possession of them? If your Excellency has no capital objection 
to the measure, I could wish that it might be carried into execu 
tion as soon as possible. 

I have this morning written to General Gates for some heavy 
cannon on travelling carriages, with fixed ammunition, and Continental troops, which if I receive, I expect to be able to oblige 
them to retire below the chevaux-de-frise. Whenever the cannon 
arrive, you shall be advised" previous to any operation, in order 
that we may act in conjunction as much as circumstances will 
permit. I am, with great regard, your Excellency s 

Most obedient and very humble servant, 

ISRAEL PUTNAM. 



GENERAL PUTNAM TO GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Fishkill, 27 October, 1777.
 
DEAR GOVERNOR, 

As I am informed by your brother, General James Clinton, with 
whom I had the pleasure to dine to-day, that you were at Plea 
sant Valley, this waits on you to desire your advice and counsel at 
head-quarters, with all convenient despatch, upon some interesting 
matters, as the enemy have evacuated Peekskill, Fort Montgomery, and all adjacent posts, and gone down the river with their 
whole fleet. With esteem and respect, I am, affectionately, 
Your obedient, humble servant, 

ISRAEL PUTNAM. 



GOVERNOR CLINTON TO GENERAL PUTNAM. 

Pleasant Valley, 27 October, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

I am favored with yours of this date. I flattered myself I 
should have had the pleasure of seeing you ere now, as, when I 
left Kingston, it was my principal business ; and, though it was 
dark when I crossed the river, I reached Poughkeepsie that 
night, when in hopes to have overtaken you there, but was too 
late, as you had left that the preceding day. Ever since I have 
been here, I have been so unwell as not to dare venture out, 
considering the badness of the weather; but the moment the rain 
ceases, I will set out for your quarters. 

General Gates, in his letter of the 24th instant, gives me rea 
son to believe a large part of his army are on the move down 
each side of the river. Part of them had reached Hurley yes 
terday. He supposed the enemy yet to be up the river nearRed Hook, and intended to retake Fort Montgomery before they 
could get down to reenforce it. For this purpose he was for 
warding a considerable train of artillery, and asked an interview 
with me at Coeyman s, this side of Albany, yesterday. I could 
not attend then for the reasons above, but wrote him, informing 
him of the different situation of the enemy, which will, of course, 
alter his intended plan. At the same time I suggested it as my 
opinion, that the enemy would not now attempt any thing capi 
tal up the river this season, but detach their main force to 
strengthen Howe at Philadelphia, to which grand scene we undoubtedly ought to turn our chief attention, for on our successes 
there every thing worth regarding depends. 
Yours, sincerely, 

GEORGE CLINTON. 



GENERAL GATES TO GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Albany, 29 October, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

As I have not heard a syllable from you, or General Putnam, 
for a week past, I conclude you are in no want of any further 
assistance from me. Colonel Malcom promised to write as soon 
as he saw your Excellency. I have a sloop gone with a flag of 
truce to New York, on board of which is the widow Cortlandt 
Schuyler, her family, servants, &c., with Lieutenant Swords and 
his family. The sloop is commanded by Captain Van Buren. 
Colonel H. B. Livingston, who went in the bateau that carried 
Lord Viscount Petersham, Aid-de-camp to Lientenant-General 
Burgoyne, has my orders to see you upon his return from General Vaughan, to whom he carried a letter from me. Captain 
Van Buren will also make you his report as lie passes New 
Windsor. I am exceedingly impatient to hear from the south 
and the south-west. I am happy to tell you, that General Lin 
coln and General Arnold are both in a fair way of recovery. 
I am, 

Your Excellency s most affectionate, humble servant, 

HORATIO GATES. 



GOVERNOR CLINTON TO GENERAL GATES. 

Fishkill, ten o clock at night, 30 October, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

I arrived here about noon, when I met your favor of the 25th 
instant. My letter of the 20th, informing you of the enemy s 
fleet having fallen down below New Windsor, must have reached 
you before this. I have, therefore, only to add, that the enemy 
have demolished Fort Montgomery, and all the other posts in the 
Highlands, and moved down with their whole force towards New 
York ; and to ask how I am to dispose of the troops belonging 
to your department, which you have been so good as to place 
under my direction. As it is probable General Putnam may 
think it prudent to make an attempt against New York, I am 
the more anxious to have your directions in this respect, that I 
may govern myself accordingly. I am, with the highest esteem 
and respect, 

Your affectionate, humble servant, 

GEORGE CLINTON. 

P. S. Your troops had not reached New Windsor yet. The 
last I heard of them, they were at Kingston, since which, to this 
day, I believe the weather has prevented their moving. 



GENERAL GATES TO GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Albany, 2 November, 1777. 

SIR, 

Upon my return last night from Coeyman s, I had the pleasure 
to receive your Excellency s letter of the 30th of last month. If 
Sir Henry Clinton is directed to reenforce the army of Sir William Howe, which I believe to be the case, he will either land 
his troops at Amboy, and march by the lower road to Mount 
Holly, to support any designed attack upon Fort Mifflin, and the 
fortified pass of the Delaware River ; or he will land at Elizabethtown, and march by Brunswic and Princeton to Trenton, in or 
der to facilitate Sir William Howe s retreat across the Delaware, 
and through the Jerseys. In either attempt, I am clearly of opinion that all the troops I sent to your assistance, with all that 
can properly, from your neighbourhood, be added to them, should 
march without delay to Morristown, and for their further opera 
tions, be governed, in great measure, by the movements of the 
enemy. Of these, the Commanding Officer should procure the 
best intelligence. 

If Sir Henry Clinton marches towards Mount Holly, our army 
will, of course, move directly to Princeton, and hang upon his 
rear and right flank. If he marches towards Trenton, our army 
will march to Somerset Court-House, and be ready to move, as he 
moves, towards Trenton ; our General carefully acquainting General Washington with his own, and the enemy s motions, and re 
ceiving his directions for the cooperation of his army. 

The Governor of the Jerseys should, at the same time, be 
requested to order the militia of that State to second the motions 
of our army. If Colonel Morgan and his rifle regiment have 
marched, it would be right to send an express to stop them at 
Van Camp s, and order him to inarch from thence to Sussex 
Court-House and Morristown. 

The heavy brass artillery I sent down the river, should be sent 
up again by water, or so disposed as to be secured from any 
surprise. The light brass field-guns, which you mentioned in a 
former letter, should be sent with the troops to Morristown. I 
have the best reason to believe, that, with the troops I have 
here, I can secure every thing this way until June, and perhaps 
do more. 

If the public affairs of this State do not require your Excel 
lency s immediate attendance upon them, I wish you could be 
spared to command the army to be assembled at Morristown. 
But if your meeting the Legislature here cannot be dispensed 
with, I wish General Parsons might be ordered for that service, 
and now take the liberty to recommend it to General Putnam by 
this express. Nevertheless, I wish you would immediately cross 
the river to General Putnam, and show him this letter, and con 
fer with him upon this important movement of the troops. 

As I have sent General Putnam a very fine brigade from 
hence, with two excellent regiments of Connecticut militia, I 
think he will be able to spare one brigade of Continental troops 
from his side, with General Parsons. 

I utterly disapprove of any attempt upon New York, knowing 
that while the enemy s" ships of force occupy the East and North 
Rivers, and there is a tolerable garrison on the Isthmus, the 
taking the city would be very doubtful ; and, when taken, it 
would be found without any military stores of consequence ; for 
those, you may be assured, are afloat; and it is also so commanded from the water, that it cannot be held, until we are 
superior at sea. 

If you cannot wait upon General Putnam yourself, send him .a 
copy of this letter, and your sentiments thereupon, with my letter 
to him inclosed. I am, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

HORATIO GATES. 


COLONEL HAMILTON TO GENERAL PUTNAM. 

Head-Quarters, New Windsor, 9 November, 1777. 

Sir, 

I cannot forbear confessing, that I am astonished and alarmed 
beyond measure, to find that all his Excellency s views have been 
hitherto frustrated, and that no single step of those I mentioned 
to you has been taken to afford him the aid he absolutely stands 
in need of, and by delaying which, the cause of America is put 
to the utmost conceivable hazard. 

I so fully explained to you the General s situation, that I could 
not entertain a doubt you would make it the first object of yourattention to reenforce him with that speed the exigency of affairs 
demanded ; but, I am sorry to say, he will have too much reason 
to think other objects, in comparison with that insignificant, have 
been uppermost. I speak freely and emphatically, because I 
tremble at the consequences of the delay that has happened. 
General Clinton s reinforcement is probably by this time with 
Mr. Howe. This will give him a decisive superiority over ourarmy. What may be the issue of such a state of things, I leave 
to the feelings of every friend to his country, capable of foreseeing consequences. My expressions may perhaps have more 
warmth than is altogether proper; but they proceed from the 
overflowing of my heart, in a matter where I conceive this Continent essentially interested. I wrote to you from Albany, and desired you would send a thousand Continental troops of those first 
proposed to be left with you. This, I understand, has not been 
done. How the noncompliance can be answered to General 
Washington, you can best determine. 

I now, Sir, in the most explicit terms, by his Excellency s 
authority, give it as a positive order from him, that all the Con 
tinental troops under your command may be immediately marched 
to King s Ferry, there to cross the river, and hasten to reenforce 
the army under him. 

The Massachusetts militia are to be detained instead of them, 
until the troops coming from the northward arrive. When they 
do, they will replace, as far as I am instructed, the troops you 
shall send away in consequence of this requisition. The General s idea of keeping troops this way does not extend farther than 
covering the country from any little irruptions of small parties, 
and carrying on the works necessary for the security of the 
river. As to attacking New York, that he thinks ought to be 
out of the question at present. If men could be spared from the 
other really necessary objects, he would have no objections to at 
tempting a diversion by way of New York, but nothing farther. 

As the times of the Massachusetts and New Hampshire militia 
will soon expire, it will be proper to call in time for a reenforcement from Connecticut. Governor Clinton will do all in his 
power, to promote objects in which the State lie commands in i&gt; 
so immediately concerned. Generals Glover s and Patterson s bri 
gades are on their way down. The number of Continental troops 
necessary for this post will be furnished out of them. 

I cannot but have the fullest confidence you will use yourutmost exertions to execute the business of this letter ; and I am, 
with great respect, Sir, 

Your most obedient, 

ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 



GENERAL PUTNAM TO GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Head-Quarters, King s Street, 10 November, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

The night before last I arrived at this place, and shall this 
day proceed down towards the Plains. Yesterday, General Parsons and myself were down at Eastchester, and within threemiles of King s Bridge. From every appearance, the enemy seem 
much frightened. They have called in all their outguards, and 
collected their main force at the Bridge. 

Deserters come in very fast ; and, from every account I am 
able to procure, their strength at the Bridge is about two thou 
sand five hundred. Inclosed you have a late paper, which, in 
my opinion, paints their distress in many particulars. When op 
portunity will permit, I shall be glad to see you down here. My 
compliments to your brother; and I am, dear Sir, 
Your very humble servant, 

ISRAEL PUTNAM. 



ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO GENERAL WASHINGTON. 

Manor of Livingston, 14 January, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

I was honored with your Excellency s favor of the 27th of 
December, and am greatly obliged by your favorable mention 
of my brother. In my recommendation of him, I was influenced 
more by my hope of rendering him further useful to his country, than by any partial desire of serving him, without having 
the most distant wish of engaging your Excellency in any promise 
that might lead to a preference, to which he is not justly entitled, 
since neither his interest nor honor renders his continuance in 
the army necessary, his fortune putting him above the first, and 
the reputation he has already acquired, together with your Ex 
cellency s approbation, fully satisfying the last. 

That I. may not, however, seem to have been without warrant 
in my recommendation of him, I take the liberty to inclose to 
your Excellency an extract of a letter to him, written under Ge 
neral Arnold s directions, by a gentleman of his family, he being 
unable to hold the pen himself. After a warm recommendation 
of his conduct, both in the camp and the field, and giving himand his regiment a full share of the honor of the battle of the 
19th of September (in which General Arnold, not being present, 
writes only from the report of those who w r ere), he adds, " On 
the 7th of October, the conduct of your corps fell more imme 
diately under the inspection of General Arnold. He thinks it but 
justice to you and them to observe, that great part of our suc 
cess on that day was owing to the gallant part they acted in 
storming the enemy s works, and the alertness and good order 
they observed in the pursuit." I did not, in my letter to yourExcellency, allude to the dispute between Colonels Cortlandt and 
Livingston, having never interested myself further therein than to 
endeavour to prevail with my brother to yield up that preference 
to which I conceived Colonel Cortlandt s seniority entitled him, 
though it may, in some measure, be superseded by the resolutions 
of Congress. 

But I ask your Excellency s pardon for permitting any thing 
of a private nature to trespass long upon that time, which you 
generously devote to the public, and will proceed to one of more 
general concern, in which also, as an individual, I am deeply in 
terested I mean the defence of this State, and the erection of 
works on Hudson s River. I have seen your Excellency s letter 
on that subject to Governor Clinton. I wish the delicate situation in which he stands would have permitted him to have been 
more explicit in his answer, which he has also communicated to 
me. This I conceive the general permission, which your Excel 
lency has given me, to write my sentiments fully, and the atten 
tion with which you have honored my letters, together with the 
losses, which, through mismanagement, I have already sustained, 
in some measure entitle me to be. 

The military arrangement in this department is far from being 
satisfactory. The offices of Commissary, Quarter-master, &c., are 
generally unsupplied with money ; public credit is stretched be 
yond all reasonable bounds ; certificates, which are the only cash 
of these several offices, have lost their credit, from the uncertainty 
and difficulty that attend their payment ; and force alone affords 
a scanty supply to the army. This renders it impossible to lay 
up magazines, opens a wide door for frauds, and is attended witli 
the most mischievous effects upon husbandry, and the tempers of 
the people. I learn, by a letter from Mr. Lee, the demands of 
the Southern army. No great quantity of cattle are raised in 
this State, except in the county of Westchester, from whence the 
enemy draw considerable supplies, though nothing would be easier 
than to cover it from their depredations, and to supply our army 
at Peekskill from it. Flour may be procured, when the Commis 
saries are properly supplied with money, and their whole atten 
tion turned to the business of their department. It would be 
happy for us, if those engaged in the civil departments of the 
army were bound by an oath not to engage in trade. 

But I am wandering from my subject. Your Excellency is 
fully impressed with the importance of fortifying Hudson s River. 
The want of men and money must make this work go on heavily, 
or, indeed, by leaving it unfinished, waste what shall be expended. 
Your Excellency will see the necessity of pressing Congress for 
supplies of both, more especially the last. I would submit it to 
your Excellency, whether it would not be more advisable to se 
lect a body of the ablest men out of the general regiments at 
Peekskill, to carry on the works, allowing them additional pay 
as a compensation for their labor and the wear of their clothes, 
than to work in the ordinary way. Might not the troops stationed 
at Albany, also, be drawn down to that post, or part of them, at 
least ? 

Your Excellency is not ignorant of the extent of General Put 
nam s capacity and diligence ; and, how well soever these may 
qualify him for the management of this work, a most important 
command, the prejudices to which his imprudent lenity to the disaffected, and a too great intercourse with the enemy, have given 
rise, have greatly injured his influence. How far the loss of Fort 
Montgomery, and the subsequent ravages of the enemy, are to be 
imputed to him, I will not venture to say, as this will necessarily 
be determined by a Court of Inquiry, whose determinations I 
would not anticipate. Unfortunately for him, the current of popu 
lar opinions, in this and the neighbouring States, and, as far as I 
can learn, in the troops under his command, runs strongly against 
him. For my own part, I respect his bravery and former services, and sincerely lament that his patriotism will not suffer himto take that repose, to which his advanced age and past service justly entitle him. Your Excellency sees the necessity of 
spirit and activity, in this department of our officers, who in a 
fertile genius can find resources against the multiplied wants of 
this situation. Cannon should be procured^ and the forges set at 
work in making a chain. Twelve or fourteen twelve-pounders 
may be obtained at Salisbury furnace. Carriages should be prepared. In short, Sir, unless we make use of the present moment, 
the well-affected will be unwilling to remain in this State next 
summer. 

Having drawn this out to a most unreasonable length, I must 
fear trespassing upon you, and defer some other matters upon 
which I propose writing to your Excellency. In the mean while, 
I must only flatter myself that your Excellency will not only ex 
cuse, but consider the freedom with which this is written as a 
new proof of the confidence I have ever found myself inclined to 
repose in your Excellency, and which you have so frequently 
encouraged as to persuade me that I run no other hazard in 
speaking freely of men and measures, than that of sometimes trying your Excellency s patience. We have various accounts of 
their being in great dread of an unwelcome visit at New York 
during this winter. I suppose their apprehensions will be some 
what allayed by the arrival of the seventy-first and three Hes 
sian regiments, which have lately got in from Philadelphia. I 
have the honor to be, with the greatest respect and esteem, 
Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



GENERAL WASHINGTON TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

Head- Quarters, Valley Forge, 12 March, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

I should have answered your letter of the 14th of January 
before this time, had I not been daily in hopes that I should 
be able to give you a satisfactory account of a change of men 
and measures in the North River department. It has not been 
an easy matter to find a just pretence for removing an officerfrom his command, where his misconduct rather appears to result 
from want of capacity, than from any real intention of doing 
wrong; and it is, therefore, as you observe, to be lamented, that 
he cannot see his own defects, and make an honorable retreat 
from a station in which he only exposes his own weakness. 

Proper measures are taking to carry on the inquiry into the 
loss of Fort Montgomery, agreeably to the directions of Congress ; 
and it is more than probable, from what I have heard, that the 
issue of that inquiry will afford just grounds for a removal of 
General P. But whether it does or not, the prejudices of all 
ranks in that quarter against him are so great, that he must, at 
all events, be prevented from returning. I hope to introduce a 
gentleman in his place, if the general course of the service will 
admit of it, who will be perfectly agreeable to the State and to 
the public. In the mean time, I trust that General Parsons will 
do every thing in his power to carry on the works, which, from 
his last accounts, are in more forwardness than I had expected. 

I wish that all the men in the upper part of the river had 
been drawn down to the Highlands, instead of being kept to 
carry on an expedition, in which I never was consulted, but 
which I saw from the beginning could never succeed, from a 
variety of reasons, which it would be needless to give to you, or 
any man acquainted with the state of the country through which 
it was to have passed. Those who were the most sanguine, I 
fancy, now see the impracticability of it. 

Peekskill and the neighbouring posts were, by a resolve of 
Congress, included in the Northern department, and the care of 
carrying on the works put under the direction of the officer commanding in that district. General Gates being, soon after the 
resolve, called to the Board of War, he had no opportunity of 
doing any thing towards it. Whether there will be any alteration 
in the extent of the command this campaign, I cannot tell. But, 
if it falls again into that department more immediately under my 
particular command, you may depend that all the attention due 
to posts so important shall be paid to them. 
I am, &c., 

GEORGE WASHINGTON.  
delphia. In my opinion, the instant the enemy eva 
cuate it, the best disciplined troops in the army 
should be marched in, and the several inhabitants or 
dered, on pain of military execution, to confine them 
selves to their houses. Proper persons should then 
be sent to the several stores, to make out lists of 
the goods contained in them. From these lists you 
should mark the articles which may be necessary for 
the army, the hospital, and the like. The next step 
should be to levy a contribution, of at least one hundred thousand pounds sterling, in hard money, which 
ought to be apportioned upon the inhabitants, according to their wealth and disaffection. They may then 
be permitted to go about their usual occupations. 
But the Quarter-master should take proper stores, and 
therein lodge, under guard, the articles by you marked ; and receipts should be by him given, at the rate 
such goods sold immediately before the evacuation; 
and duplicates of such receipts forthwith transmitted 
to the Treasury Board. The propriety of these steps 
I will not dilate upon. But, should they be pursued, 
I think the most beneficial consequences would accrue 
to the public. I am, once more, yours, 

GOTJVEENEUE MORRIS. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LINCOLN. 

Worcester, 1 June, 1778. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

I was honored with your kind favor of the 7th 
ultimo, on the 19th, accompanying your valuable present, the epaulettes and sword-knot.* You will per
* Concerning these epaulettes and sword-knot, see Washington s Writings, Vol. V. p. 361. 
mit me to return my most cordial thanks for them, 
and to assure your Excellency that this testimony of 
your approbation of my conduct fills me with the 
highest sentiments of duty and affection, will always 
be remembered with the warmest gratitude, and ranked among the first honors which have been conferred 
upon me in life. I must have been insensible, in 
deed, not to have felt this honorary, and very parti 
cular mark of respect ; blind, not to have discerned 
the candor and friendship with which I have been 
treated, from my first being honored with a command 
under your Excellency; criminally inattentive, not to 
have noticed the concern you have expressed for my 
safety and perfect recovery ; and must ever be unhappy in reflection, should I not pay you that tri 
bute of love and esteem which justice and gratitudeindispensably demand. 

My leg hath acquired such degree of strength, that 
I can bear considerable weight on it. There have 
been lately several exfoliations the openings are now 
small; the limb is free from pain and inflammation, and 
puts on a better appearance than it hath ever before. 

By the advice of my surgeons, for the sake of a 
ride, I came to this town, the week before the last, 
with Mrs. Lincoln. She w r as immediately taken with 
the smallpox, in the natural way, and now lies very 
ill. I am, my dear General, with regard and esteem. 
Your obliged, humble servant, 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Yorktown, 8 June, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 
My colleague, Mr. Drayton, having shown me, about 
a fortnight ago, the draft of a report which he had 
prepared, stating charges against the General Officers 
who lately abandoned Ticonderoga, and flattering me 
with assurances that he would soon offer it to Con 
gress, I delayed replying to your Excellency s favor 
of the 29th ultimo, hoping for ground to intimate 
that that business was ready to be despatched to yourExcellency, for the further necessary order ; but, to 
my great mortification, it continues to be procrasti 
nated. Some of the gentlemen of the Committee are, 
or have been, desirous of new lights. In a word, Sir, 
I am quite in opinion with those gentlemen who say, 
"the not proceeding in this matter is cruel and op 
pressive," although I am as well convinced the delay has not been calculated or intended to distress 
the parties affected. It has arisen from a vapid, desultory habit, which, if I am not mistaken, I have 
seen squander millions, and endanger States. I speak 
with warmth, and, I believe, with equal truth. On 
my country s account, as well as from a feeling for 
the culprit officers, I am really ashamed of our con 
duct respecting the particular affair in question. How 
ever, as I can always take a decent freedom with my 
colleague, who is really a diligent man, I will not let 
him pass a day unreminded of the necessity for bringing forward his report. I sent off a messenger to 
day, with a letter to Lancaster, at his request, for 
collecting somewhat relative to the business, and I 
think he hinted, that when that ingredient should be 
obtained, the report would be complete. 

Frequent items have been given in public of the 
disagreements of our Commissioners. This day a pri 
vate perusal of papers, treating on that subject, gave 
me much pain. I fear an investigation, upon the arrival of Mr. Dearie, who is every hour expected, will 

VOL. II. 12 
spread the trouble wide. I have suppressed all that 
has been written to me, and have sealed my lips, ex 
cept to your Excellency and one other gentleman. I 
know all the gentlemen yonder, some of them very 
intimately; know their tempers and habits, and think 
I can mark out causes ; but I can only deplore their 
impolitic, and, I was going to say, school-boy jarrings, 
and dread the consequences of a heated and injudi 
cious discussion on this side. 

Wi. Late last night your Excellency s public let 
ter of the 7th w r as brought to me. I shall lay it 
before Congress at 10 o clock. Lord Abingdon s pro 
test does honor to Mr. Morris, of New York ; the 
merit of our resolves, of 22d April, is fairly to be 
ascribed to him.* 

I have lately much regretted that I had it not in 
my power to transmit to your Excellency some of the 
English papers which we had received, and which, 
indeed, came originally into my own hands ; but judged it my duty to present them to the House, w T here 
they were so and so suddenly dispersed, as to 

deprive me of the reading even of one of them; yet 
I dare not say I will take better care another time ; 
my own duty will be r to do as I have done. 

In order to save time, I have sent to the Secre 
tary s office a young man to copy the resolves of 
Congress, required by your Excellency, and which 
will be found here inclosed. 1 am, with the most 
sincere regard and esteem, Sir, your Excellency s 
Much obliged, and most obedient servant,

FROM GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

Yorktown, 9 June, 1778. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I have sent to your address three bundles, containing the several materials collected by the Committee 
for arranging the army. This business being now put 
under your care, I trust you will be enabled speedily 
to put your arm} " in the situation you wish, excepting always the deficiency of numbers, which is, upon 
the whole, well enough, since thereby it happens that 
less of the resources of the country are consumed ; 
and this is certainly a war of resources. The opinion 
of Congress, relative to Philadelphia, you have doubt 
less ere this received. Mine did not arise from any 
pleasure I take in the distresses of my fellow-crea 
tures ; still less from that horrid love of proscriptions, 
which, however dictated, certainly disgraces human 
nature. Simply, I wished that our enemies should be 
mulcted before they were received into our bosom, 
and that we might thereby possess ourselves of the 
sinews of war. 

Should there be still other desiderata as to the 
army, which, indeed, I well know there are, pray let 
me hear of them in a letter, to which I shall call 
the attention of the House, who have now entangled 
themselves in such an infinity of matter, that some 
management is really necessary to lead them to the 
most serious and important objects. The Committee 
had written to Governor Clinton for his assistance in 
arranging the regiments not with you. So much as 
I received in answer to that application you will find 
among the bundles. Whatever may come to hand, 
regarding Gansevoort s regiment, I shall do myself 
the honor to transmit immediately. I am called away. 



136 LETTEllS TO WASHINGTON. 

Should Mrs. Washington be still in camp, which, I 
confess., is rather unlikely, pray present my respects 
to her. I have the honor to be, dear General. 

Yours sincerely, 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



FROM GEORGE JOHNSTONE.* 

(Private.) 

Philadelphia, 10 June, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

I beg to recommend to your private civilities my 
friend Dr. Ferguson. He has been engaged, from his 
early life, in inculcating to mankind the virtuous 
principles you practise. 

* The Earl of Carlisle, Governor George Johnstone, and William 
Eden, in concert with Sir Henry Clinton, were the British Commis 
sioners for negotiating with Congress on the terms of Lord North s 
Conciliatory Bills. They arrived in Philadelphia on the Gth of June. 
Dr. Adam Ferguson was Secretary to the Commissioners. Governor 
Johnstone also wrote a letter of the same date as the above to the 
President of Congress, who replied as follows. 

" Yorktown, 14 June, 1778. 
" DEAR SIR, 

"Yesterday I was honored with your favor of the 10th, and thank 
you for the transmission of those from my dear and worthy friends, 
Mr. Oswald and Mr. Manning; had Dr. Ferguson been the bearer of 
these papers, I should have shown that gentleman every degree of re 
spect and attention, that times and circumstances admit of. 

" It is, Sir. for Great Britain to determine whether her Commis 
sioners shall return unheard by the Representatives of these United 
States, or revive a friendship with the citizens at large, and remain 
among us as long as they please. 

" You are undoubtedly acquainted with the only terms on which 
Congress can treat for accomplishing this good end ; terms, from which, 
although writing in a private character, I may venture to assert with 
great assurance, they never will recede, even admitting the continu 
ance of hostile attempts, and that, from the rage of war, the good 
people of these States shall be driven to commence a treaty westward 
of yonder mountains. And permit me to add, Sir, as my humble 
I also take the liberty of transmitting to your care 
some letters from disconsolate relations, who look up 
for relief from the measures in view, persuaded you 
will forward them safe. I beg to be esteemed, in 
every private consideration, your great admirer, 

And obedient servant, 

GEORGE JOHNSTONE. 



FROM FRANCIS DANA.* 

York, 11 June, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 
I had the honor, last evening, of your favor of the 

opinion, the true interest of Great Britain, in the present advance of 
the contest, will be found in confirming our independence. 

" Congress, in no hour, have been haughty ; but to suppose that 
their minds are less firm in the present than they were when desti 
tute of all foreign aid, even without expectation of an alliance ; when, 
upon a day of general public fasting and humiliation, in their house 
of worship and in the presence of God, they resolved to hold no 
conference or treaty with any Commissioners on the part of Great 
Britain unless they shall, as a preliminary thereto, either withdraw 
their fleets and armies, or, in positive and express terms, acknowledge 
the independence of these States, would be irrational. 

" At a proper time. Sir, I shall think myself highly honored by a 
personal attention, and by contributing to render every part of these 
States agreeable to you ; but, until the basis of mutual confidence 
shall be established, I believe, Sir, neither former private friendships, 
nor any other consideration, can influence Congress to consent that 
even Governor Johnstone, a gentleman who has been so deservedlyesteemed in America, shall see the country. I have but one voice, 
and that shall be against it. But, let me entreat you, my dear Sir, 
do not hence conclude that I am deficient in affection to my old 
friends, through whose kindness I have obtained the honor of the 
present correspondence ; or, that I am not, with very great personal 
respect and esteem, Sir, 

" Your most obedient and most humble servant, 

" HENRY LAURENS." 


9th instant, requesting me to repair to camp, to as 
sist in the business of arranging the army, as soon 
as possible. Although I am impressed with the necessity of that business being finished without delay, 
yet I cannot, in duty to the State I represent, quit 
Congress till the Confederation is ratified, which I 
hope will be done in a few days. In the mean time, 
the arrangement may go on, as General Heed will 
doubtless be at hand to assist you. He has paid a 
particular attention to the battalions of this State ; 
those of Maryland, on account of their distance from 
your camp, the Committee could make no inquiry 
about. These, also, may be arranged without any 
assistance from me ; and, indeed, I know nothing 
about either of them. Those to which I paid a particular attention were the battalions of New Hamp 
shire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Jersey, and Vir 
ginia ; the last of which may be settled by conferring 
with the General Officers of that line, whose recommendation w r e followed. 

I will get the necessary papers from Mr. Morris, 
and forward them to you, with the hope of taking 
some labor from off your hands. I should have been 
happy to have given my immediate attendance in 
camp. I trust by the time you, with the assistance 
of General Heed, may have gone through the batta 
lions of this State, Maryland, and Virginia, to have 
the pleasure of affording you in this business all the 
assistance in my power. I am, dear Sir, with much 
respect and esteem, 

Your most obedient and obliged, humble servant, 

FRANCIS DANA. 

P. S. Should Mrs. Washington be with you, you 
will be pleased to make my most respectful compli 
ments acceptable to her. 
FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL KNOX. 

Artillery Park, 15 June, 1778. 

SIR, 

I feel myself so embarrassed in the duties of the 
department,, of which I have the honor to be the 
head, by the Regulations of Congress of the 12th of 
February last, that I beg the favor of your Excel 
lency to represent the matter to that honorable body 
for further consideration. The awkward situation in 
which I am, without any of the powers appertaining 
to the rank of Commanding Officer of Artillery, the 
expectations from me, without the ability to comply, 
and the bad consequences that may arise to the service in general, induce me to make this representa 
tion ; and I hope the importance of the subject will 
be a sufficient excuse for the trouble it may give 
your Excellency or Congress. 

In all considerable armies in Europe, a General 
Officer has the command and direction of the artil 
lery, and the preparation of every thing pertaining 
to the ordnance department, and of all species of 
arms and accoutrements, offensive and defensive, be 
longing to a soldier. As his charge is very exten 
sive, he is allowed, for his assistance, commissaries, 
clerks, conductors, founders, and artificers, of all 
branches necessary to his profession; all of whom 
are immediately under his direction and receive his 
orders, and he receives orders and renders an account 
of his conduct to the State that employs him. 

In the British service, the Master-General of Ord 
nance, or the Commander-in-chief of the Artillery, has 
a Board of Ordnance, over which he presides, and 
regulates every thing relating to the artillery. This 
Board consists of the Surveyor-General of the Artillery, Clerk of the Ordnance, Storekeepers, and Clerk 
of the Deliveries. There cannot be an instance pointed out, in any service, where the Commissaries or 
Clerks are made independent and unamenable to the 
Commanding Officer of Artillery, as in the Regula 
tions of the Ordnance Department of February 12th. 

It is certainly proper that every head of a depart 
ment should have the direction of all parts of it; 
otherwise he cannot be considered as amenable for 
any deficiencies, which are out of his power to reme 
dy. In the late Regulations, the Commander of the 
Artillery has no power to give the dimensions or 
construction of any carriages or cannon, however erro 
neous they may be ; or directions for making postfires, tubes, fuzes, and a thousand other matters, in 
which his profession and the reputation of his corps 
are intimately concerned, and on which the success 
of actions may depend. 

I have made such minutes for alterations of the 
Regulations alluded to as appear to be indispensably 
necessary for the good of the service, and annexed 
them to the resolves. If the Honorable Congress 
think proper to adopt them, I shall be happy, as I 
shall then be in a post to serve my country with 
reputation. I am, with the greatest respect, yourExcellency s 

Most obedient, humble servant, 

HENRY KNOX. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Yorktown, 18 June, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 
It has not been in my power ; with any convenience, to make an earlier acknowledgment of yourExcellency s favor of the llth. 

There were letters in the Commissioners packet 
only for Congress, and particular members then present in the House. One, for Mr. E. Rutledge, unsealed, and several, also unsealed, were brought, as 
being taken from the express. The utmost caution 
is necessary, in the present conjuncture of our affairs ; 
and, therefore, had any suspicious directions turned 
up, such should have passed under the eye of Con 
gress. The idea of opening other people s letters is 
exceedingly abhorrent to me ; but I think Congress 
have a power over letters equal, at least, to that 
which necessity obliges them sometimes to exercise 
over persons; but Governor Johnstone is too well 
hackneyed in the ways of men to trust his deep 
schemes within our reach. 

His private letter to me, by the by, is, notwithstanding all his good sense, no proof of an infallible 
judgment; I am sure it is one of his having mis 
taken his man. I take the liberty of transmitting it, 
together with my intended answer, and the letters 
from Mr. Osw r ald and Mr. Manning, under this cover, 
for your Excellency s perusal. There are some traits 
in Mr. Oswald s, which strongly imply a determina 
tion, on the part of Great Britain, but reserved as 
the ultimatum, to submit to our independence. I am 
much inclined to believe the Commissioners now are, 
or soon will be, vested with powers for that purpose. 
Mr. Oswald is a gentleman of solid understanding 
and quick perception, of a very large, independent 
fortune, much exceeding a quarter of a million ster 
ling ; often consulted by administration. For the 
goodness of his heart, I refer you to this particularpart of his character; he is no placeman, but muchesteemed by the first men of each of the political 
parties. Great reliance may be placed upon what he 
writes, or even hints. 

Yesterday there was an extraordinary motion on 
our floor for calling upon members to lay before 
Congress such letters as they had received from the 
Commissioners, or other persons, meaning persons in 
Great Britain, on political subjects. I could not for 
bear offering some objections. It appeared to be a 
dangerous attempt to stretch the power of Congress. 
My letters had been read by many members, and 
were at the service of every gentleman who should 
request a perusal; but I would never consent to 
have my property taken from me by an order from 
my fellow-citizens, destitute of authority for the purpose. This circumstance, and some remarks that fol 
lowed, have induced me to put Governor Johnstone s 
letter, and my intended answer, into Mr. Drayton s 
hands, who is collecting materials for displaying the 
Governor s good designs, and no doubt he will, ac 
cording to his usual tone, add pretty severe strict 
ures. Among other papers, I transmit to your Excel 
lency copies of the Commissioners Address to Con 
gress, and of their commission. These are to be pub 
lished by order. If no mistake was made, the copy 
of the answer of Congress was sent to your Excel 
lency yesterday, in my public letter.* 



* These papers, with many others relating to the proceedings of the 
Commissioners, may be found in Almon s liemcnibrancer, Vol. VII. p. 8 
et seq. ; Vol. VI II. pp. 40-72. 

The following is an extract from a letter written by Josiah Bartlett, 
a Delegate in Congress from New Hampshire, to Mr. "YVhipple, of the 
same State, dated Yorktown, June 20th. 

" I have the pleasure to inform you that every member of Congress 
was firm and steady, never to make a peace, but on the principles 
of absolute independence. I am sorry that the answer was deferred some 
I pray God to support and direct your Excellency 
in this moment of extraordinary trial ; and I am, with 
the most sincere esteem and regard, dear Sir, yourmuch obliged and obedient humble servant, 

HENRY LAURENS. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL ARNOLD. 

Philadelphia, 10 o clock, P. M. ; 
22 June, 1778. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

Your Excellency s favor of the 21st, respecting the 
militia, I received at three o clock this evening, and 
immediately had as many inhabitants collected at the 
Coffee-House as I could notify. Fifty volunteers have 
engaged to go with General Cadwalader, who this 
minute informs me he expects to collect a consider 
able number more in the morning, in the city. I 
cannot flatter myself with procuring many in the 
vicinity. These are unarmed. Search is making for 
all the arms in the city. I have ventured to order 
Colonel Jackson to march at three o clock to-morrow 
morning, with the troops under his command. These, 
with the volunteers, and four hundred men now in 
the enemy s rear, will make a formidable body. Their 
places are supplied by Colonel Proctor s regiment, who 
will do garrison duty until a sufficient number of 



days, on account of the zeal of some members for sealing the letters 
up, and sending them back, without reading, in consequence of some 
harsh expressions against the King of France. However, it was over 
ruled, as you will see, and a more proper method, in my opinion, taken. 
What will be their next steps, time only will discover. In the packet 
to Congress were inclosed a great number of letters to the separate 
members. Some from Governor Johnstone to such of the members as 
he was acquainted with, and others from other persons in England, who 
had any acquaintance with them." 
convalescents can arrive from Valley Forge ; for which 
purpose I intend giving an order, which, I trust, will 
meet your Excellency s approbation. 

One hundred and odd deserters from the enemy 
have arrived in town this day. The whole number 
is little short of three hundred, and great numbers, I 
am informed, are scattered through the Jerseys. 

Your Excellency s favor of yesterday, by the In 
dians, was delivered to me this evening. Particularattention shall be paid to the contents. I am, with 
the greatest respect and esteem, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GATES. 

Peekskill, 25 June, 1778. 
SIR, 

To prevent the enemy s army, now marching across 
the Jerseys, from receiving any considerable reenforcement from the troops in and near New York, I 
propose moving the main body of this army to the 
White Plains, and shajl take a strong camp in that 
neighbourhood. I have all my cavalry, and a consider 
able body of infantry, now properly posted between 
the two rivers, to intercept the enemy s parties, and 
cut off their communication with the interior country, 
which has also given the alarm of an attack being 
meditated upon New York, as confirmed by good in 
telligence, which Colonel Graham assures me he has 
received. Probably the slow movements of the enemy, joined to the obstructions thrown in their way, 
may so retard their march through the Jerseys as 
to give your Excellency an opportunity to harass 
them exceedingly with your dragoons and light infantry, aided by the militia, which will most assuredly 
produce, amongst other good things, a considerable 
desertion, and, perhaps, finally such an opening as 
may enable your Excellency to make a glorious finishing of the war. I should apprehend the enemy s re 
sources for provisions on their march must be scanty ; 
and, if they are once obliged to take a fixed position, 
or force your army from a very strong one, their 
desperation may be their ruin. 

In order to eke out the magazine, I have increased 
the quantity of flour and rice, and reduced the meat. 
Of the two former we have large supplies. I think a 
quantity of cured shad might be sent us from the 
southward. I am, Sir, 

Your Excellency s most obedient humble servant, 

HORATIO GATES. 



FROM COLONEL HAMILTON. 

Robins s Tavern, 8 miles from Allentown ; 
12 o clock; 26 June, 1778. 

SIR, 

We have halted the troops at this place. The enemy, by our last reports, were four miles from this 
(that is, their rear), and had passed the road which 
turns off towards South Amboy, which determines 
their route towards Shrewsbury. Our reason for halting is the extreme distress of the troops for want 
of provisions. General Wayne s detachment is almost 
starving, and seem both unwilling and unable to march 
further, till they are supplied. If we do not receive 
an immediate supply, the whole purpose of our detachment must be frustrated. 

This morning we missed doing any thing from a 
deficiency of intelligence. On my arrival at Crau
VOL. II. 13 
berry yester-evening, I proceeded, by desire of the 
Marquis, immediately to Hightstown and Allentown, 
to take measures for cooperating with the different 
parts of the detachment, and to find what was doing 
to procure intelligence. I found every precaution was 
neglected no horse was near the enemy, or could be 
heard of till late in the morning; so that, before we 
could send out parties and get the necessary informa 
tion, they were in full march; and, as they have 
marched pretty expeditionary, we should not be able 
to come up with them during the march of the day, 
if we did not suffer the impediment we do on the 
score of provisions. We are entirely at a loss where 
the army is, which is no inconsiderable check to ourenterprise. If the army is wholly out of supporting 
distance, we risk the total loss of the detachment in 
making an attack. 

If the army will countenance us, we may do some 
thing clever. We feel our personal honor, as well as 
the honor of the army and the good of the service 
interested, and are heartily desirous to attempt what 
ever the disposition of our men will second, and pru 
dence authorize. It is evident the enemy wish to 
avoid, not to engage us. 

Desertions, I imagine, have been pretty consider 
able to-day. I have seen eight or ten deserters, and 
have heard of many more. We have had some little 
skirmishing by detached parties. One attacked their 
rear-guard with a degree of success, killed a few, and 
took seven prisoners. I am, with great respect and 
regard, Sir, 

Your obedient servant. 

ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 

P. S. The Marquis and General Dickinson send 
their compliments. My writing renders theirs unnecessary. 

An officer just comes in, who informs me that he 
left the enemy s rear five miles off, still in march, 
about half an hour ago. To ascertain still more fully 
their route, I have ordered a fresh party on their 
left, towards the head of their column. They have 
three brigades in rear of their baggage. 



FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Hightstown, at a quarter after 7, 26 June, 1778. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I hope you have received my letter from Cran 
berry, where I acquaint you that I am going to 
Hightstown, though we are short of provisions. When 
I got there, I was sorry to hear that Mr. Hamilton, 
who had been riding all the night, had not been able 
to find anybody who could give him certain intelligence ; but, by a party who came back, I hear the 
enemy are in motion, and their rear about one mile 
off the place they had occupied last night, which is 
seven or eight miles from here. I immediately put 
Generals Maxwell s and Wayne s brigades in motion, 
and I will fall lower down, with General Scott s, with 
Jackson s regiment, and some militia, I should be 
very happy if we could attack them before they halt, 
for I have no notion of taking one other moment but 
this of the march. If I cannot overtake them, we 
could lay at some distance, and attack to-morrow 
morning, provided they don t escape in the night, 
which I much fear, as our intelligences are not the 
best ones. I have sent some parties out, and I will 
get some more light by them. 

I fancy your Excellency will move down with the 
army, and if we are at a convenient distance from 
you, I have nothing to fear in striking a blow, if op 
portunity is offered. I believe that, in our present 
strength, provided they do not escape, we may do some 
thing. General Fornian says that, on account of the 
nature of the country, it is impossible for me to be 
turned by the right or left ; but that I shall not quite 
depend upon. 

An officer, just from the lines, confirms the account 
of the enemy moving. An intelligence from General 
Dickinson says, that they hear a very heavy fire in 
the front of the enemy s column. I apprehend it is 
Morgan, who had not received my letter; but it will 
have the good effect of stopping them, and, if we 
attack, he may begin again. 

Sir, I want to repeat to you, in writing, what I 
have told to you, which is, that, if you believe it, or 
if it is believed necessary or useful to the good of 
the service and the honor of General Lee, to send 
him down with a couple of thousand men, or any 
greater force, I will cheerfully obey and serve him, 
not only out of duty, but out of what I owe to that 
gentleman s character. 

I hope to receive soon your orders, as to what I 
am to do this day or to-morrow ; to know where you 
are, and what you intend ; and would be very happy 
to furnish you with the opportunity of completing 
some little advantage of ours. 

LAFAYETTE. 

P. S. The road I understand the enemy are moving by, is the straight road to Monmouth. 
FROM COLONEL HAMILTON. 

28 June, 1778. 



The result of what I have seen and heard con 
cerning the enemy is, that they have encamped with 
their van a little beyond Monmouth Court-House, and 
their rear at Manalapan s River, about seven miles 
from this place. Their march to-day has been very 
judiciously conducted, their baggage in front and 
their flying army in the rear, with a rear-guard of 
one thousand men, about four hundred paces from 
the main body. To attack them in this situation, 
without being supported by the whole army, would 
be folly in the extreme. If it should be thought 
advisable to give the necessary support, the army 
can move to some position near the enemy s left 
flank, which would put them in a very awkward 
situation, with so respectable a body in their rear ; 
and it would put it out of their power to turn either 
flank, should they be so disposed. Their left is 
strongly posted, and I am told their right also. By 
some accounts, one part of his army lies on the road 
leading from the Monmouth road to South Aniboy. 
It is not improbable that South Amboy may be the 
object. 

I had written thus far when your letter to the 
Marquis arrived. This puts the matter on a totally 
different footing. The detachment will march to 
morrow morning, at three o clock, to Englishtown. I 
am, with great esteem and respect, 

Your obedient servant, 

ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 
13* 
FROM BRIGADIER-GENERALS WAYNE AND SCOTT. 

Englishtown. 30 June, 1778. 

SIR, 

We esteem it a duty, which we owe to our country, ourselves, and the officers and soldiers under ourcommand, to state the following facts to your Excel 
lency. 

On the 28th instant, at five o clock in the morning, 
we received orders to march with the following detachments, namely, Scott s and Varnum s brigades, 
Colonels Butler and Jackson in front, amounting to 
seventeen hundred men Colonels Wesson, Livingston, 
and Stewart, with one thousand men, commanded by 
General Wayne ; a select detachment of fourteen hundred men, rank and file, under General Scott, with 
ten pieces of artillery properly distributed among the 
whole. 

About eight o clock, the van under Colonel Butler 
arrived on the left of Monmouth Court-House, on 
the rear of the left flank of the enemy, who were in 
full march, moving in r great haste and confusion. At 
this time our main body, under General Lee, were 
formed at the edge of a wood about half a mile distant from the Court-House. General Wayne, who 
was in front reconnoitring the enemy, perceiving that 
they had made a halt, and were preparing to push 
Colonel Butler with their horse and a few foot, gave 
direction for him to form and receive them, and at 
the same time sent Major Byles to General Lee, re 
questing that those troops might be advanced to 
support those in front, and for the whole to form on 
the edge of a deep morass, which extends from the 
east of the Court-House on the right a very considerable distance to the left. The troops did arrive in 
about an hour after the requisition, and were generally formed in this position. 

About the same time, General Scott s detachment 
had passed the morass on the left, and the enemy s 
horse and foot, that had charged Colonel Butler, were 
repulsed. The number of the enemy now in view 
might be near two thousand, though at first not more 
than five hundred, exclusive of their horse. The 
ground we now occupied was the best formed by 
nature for defence of any, perhaps, in this country. 
The enemy advanced with caution, keeping at a con 
siderable distance in front. General Scott, having 
viewed the position of the enemy, as well as the 
ground where about twenty-five hundred of our troops 
were formed, repassed the morass and took post on 
the left, in a fine open wood, covered by said morass 
in front. 

Whilst this was doing, General Wayne, perceiving 
that the troops on the right, from the wood to the 
Court-House, were retreating, sent Major Fishbourn 
to General Lee, requesting that the troops might re 
turn to support him. In the interim General Waynerepassed the morass, leaving Colonel Butler s regi 
ment to keep post on the right flank of the enemy. 
Generals Scott and Wayne then went together along 
the morass to the Court-House, when Major Fishbourn returned, and said that General Lee gave no 
other answer, than that he would see General Waynehimself, which he never did. The enemy, having now 
an opening on the right of General Scott, began to 
move on, when General Wayne and General Scott sent 
to General Lee to request him at least to form, to 
favor General Scott s retreat ; but this requisition met 
with the same fate as the last. The troops kept still 
retreating, when General Scott, perceiving that he 
would not be supported, filed off by the left. General Wayne ordered Colonel Butler to fall back also. 
Thus were these several select detachments unac 
countably drawn off without being suffered to come 
to action, although we had the most pleasing pro 
spect, from our numbers and position, of obtaining 
the most glorious and decisive victory. After this, 
we fortunately fell in with your Excellency. You 
ordered us to form, part of those troops, whose con 
duct and bravery kept the enemy in play, until you 
had restored order. 

We have taken the liberty of stating these facts, 
in order to convince the world that our retreat from 
the Court-IIouse was not occasioned by the want of 
numbers, position, or wishes of both officers and men 
to maintain that post. We also beg leave to men 
tion, that no plan of attack was ever communicated 
to us, or notice of a retreat, until it had taken place 
in our rear, as we supposed by General Lee s order. 
We are, &c., 

ANTHONY WAYNE, 
CHARLES SCOTT. 



FROM COLONEL MORGAN. 

Middletown, 9 o clock, 2 July, 1778. 

SIR, 

I came to this place early yesterday morning ; the 
enemy had left it the night before ; their main body 
is encamped about three miles from the town ; their 
rear within a mile ; we are in full view of each other. 
I am, and have been ever since I came out, at a 
great loss for light-horse, having none with me. Ge 
neral Scott sent me a sergeant and six, whose horses 
were tired, and were rather an incumbrance, as they 
could scarcely raise a gallop. Major Jameson was 
here yesterday. I applied to him. for a few ; he sent 
Captain Harrison, who staid with me about two hours, 
when Colonel Moylan sent for him. and his party. 
Colonel Moylan certainly has reasons for so doing; 
but, Sir, you know the cavalry are the eyes of the 
infantry, and without any, my situation must not be 
very pleasing, being in full view of the enemy s whole 
army. 

My advance engaged their rear yesterday. They 
reenforced, and sent a column on each flank. We re 
treated to a hill at this end of the town. They 
retreated to their own ground; a few were killed. 
I had one slightly wounded ; but had no horse till 
Cornet Dorsey luckily came up. I am, with esteem, 
Your most obedient and humble servant, 

DANIEL MORGAN. 



FROM WILLIAM HENRY DRAYTON.* 

Philadelphia, 5 July, 1778 

SIR, 

While I am sensible that I hazard your Excellency s 
censure of my discretion, yet I cannot resist the impulse I feel to pay you my little tribute of thanks 
for the important victory of Monmouth, and to ex 
press how much I feel myself tenderly and anxiously 
interested in every thing respecting your safety and 
glory. Your Excellency s invariable conduct naturally 
exposes you to such intrusions, and I rely upon it 
that your good nature will pardon this. 

Personally almost unknown to you as I am, yet, 

* A Delegate in Congress from South Carolina. 
Sir, this obstacle is too weak to prevent a gratifica 
tion on my part which gives me the highest pleasure. 
Somehow or other, nature has composed me of mate 
rials which are apt to force the bounds of common 
decorum, when my affections and gratitude are ex 
cited. 

That your Excellency s life may long be preserved 
in your glorious and disinterested defence of yourcountry, and in the enjoyment of the fruits of yourlabors and victories, is my most fervent prayer ; being, Sir, your Excellency s 

Most obliged and most humble servant, 

WILLIAM HENRY DRAYTON. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia. 7 July, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have had the honor of presenting, to as many 
members of Congress as have been convened in this 
city since the adjournment from York, your Excel 
lency s several favors, of the 28th and 30th of June, 
and 1st instant, and, at their special instance, have 
caused them to be printed, for the information of the 
public. 

I arrived here on Tuesday last, but hitherto have 
not collected a sufficient number of States to form a 
Congress; consequently I have received no commands. 
Your Excellency will therefore be pleased to accept 
this as the address of an individual, intended to assure 
you, Sir, of my hearty congratulations with my countrymen on the success of the American arms, under 
your Excellency s immediate command, in the late 
battle of Momnouth, and more particularly of my own 
happiness in the additional glory achieved by yourExcellency in retrieving the honor of these States in 
the moment of an alarming dilemma. 

It is not niy design to attempt encomiums upon 
your Excellency. I am as unequal to the task as 
the act is unnecessary. Love and respect for yourExcellency is impressed on the heart of every grate 
ful American, and your name will be revered by posterity. Our acknowledgments are especially due to 
Heaven for the preservation of your Excellency s per 
son, necessarily exposed, for the salvation of America, 
to the most imminent danger in the late action. That 
the same hand may at all times guide and shield 
your Excellency, is the fervent wish of, dear Sir, 

Your much obliged and faithful humble servant, 

HENRY LAURENS. 



FROM COUNT D ESTAING. 



At Sea, 8 July, 1778. 

SIR, 

I have the honor of imparting to your Excellency 
the arrival of the King s fleet, charged by his Ma 
jesty with the glorious task of giving his allies, the 
United States of America, the most striking proofs 
of his affection. Nothing will be wanting to my happiness, if I can succeed in it. It is augmented by 
the consideration of concerting my operations with a 
General such as your Excellency. The talents and 
great actions of General Washington have insured 
him, in the eyes of all Europe, the title, truly sublime, 
of Deliverer of America. Accept, Sir, the homage that 
every man, that every military man, owes you ; and 
be not displeased that I solicit, even in the first 
moment of intercourse, with military and maritime 
frankness, a friendship so flattering as yours. I will 
try to render myself worthy of it by iny respectful 
devotion for your country. It is prescribed to me 
by orders, and my heart inspires it. 

I have the honor of rendering an account to Con 
gress of the letter I write to your Excellency. M. 
de Chouin, Major of Infantry in the King s service, 
has orders to present you this. I pray you to grant 
the most extensive confidence to all this officer shall 
tell you on my part. He is a near relation to M. 
de Sartine. This Minister has been long since known 
for his attachment to the common cause. It is less 
the desire of pleasing a statesman, honored with the 
confidence of the King, which has determined me to 
send to you M. Chouin, than an opinion of his mili 
tary knowledge, the clearness of his ideas, and the 
precision with which he will communicate mine. I 
beseech you to grant him your kindness. I have the 
honor to be, with respect, Sir, your Excellency s 
Most humble and most obedient servant, 

ESTAING. 



FROM COUNT D ESTAING. 

In the Eoad without Sandy Hook, 13 July, 1778. 

SIR, 

The desire of communicating speedily with yourExcellency determines me to make a debarkation on 
the coast of Jersey, in a village which, according to 
the map, is to the northward of the river Shrewsbury. 
If our common enemy are in possession, and can be 
driven from it, I shall fulfil the object of my descent. 
An instant of liberty will suffice for a good patriot 
to show himself. Every citizen will be eager to con 
vey my homage to the Deliverer of his country. The 
first moments are so precious, above all upon sea, 
that it may be of the greatest importance for me 
to be informed, four-and-twenty hours sooner or later, 
of the projects of your Excellency. I have orders to 
second them. I dare assure you that I will do it to 
the utmost of my power. To act in concert with a 
great man is the first of blessings; it is one of those 
which flatter me the most in the commission with 
which I am honored. An apprehension that the let 
ter, of which I have now the honor to send a dupli 
cate, may not come to hand till late, makes me ha 
zard a step, the motive for which must be the excuse. 
I have the honor to be, 

ESTAING. 



FROM COUNT D ESTAING. 
In the Road without Sandy Hook, 17 July, 1778. 

SIR, 

The bar of the River Shrewsbury, the officer, sailors, 
and boats that I have lost in the waves, have not 
hindered Colonel Laurens from braving them twice, 
to come and deliver me himself the letter that you 
did me the honor to write me on the 14th of this 
month. The desire of communicating with you alonewould have induced me to hazard a descent myself 
the first, and with four grenadiers as my only sup 
port, in a place, the debarkation of which is as difficult as it was unknown ; and where there existed not 
a single spot proper for embarkation. The sacrifice 
of several of my men appeared to me less affecting, 
as it was the sole means of communication I could 
have. 

I have occupied myself less with discovering the 
number of English vessels of war in the Road of 

VOL. II. 14 
Sandy Hook, than the means of entering it. I sup 
pose there are fourteen vessels of war, a throng of fri 
gates, and a multitude of transports. This superiority 
of number, and the goodness of the English navy, 
will not hinder me from attacking Lord Howe in his 
retrenchment, and under his batteries, if the depth of 
the water do not forbid me. I only received threepilots yesterday ; they have need of re-collecting their 
ideas, and are at this time sounding the river. The 
hope of giving you something positive on this head 
engaged me to pray your estimable, well-informed, 
and most amiable Aid-de-camp, to pass a bad night 
on board the Languedoc. 

He will give you an account, Sir, of the regret I 
shall feel, if this powerful mark of friendship, which 
the King has given his allies, who are so dear to 
him, should not prove of so great utility as he might 
promise himself. 

I will not enter into any further detail in this let 
ter. Mr. Laurens will tell you more than I can 
write. But it will be very important that the arrival of so great a naval succour should produce at 
the same time a general effort by land. If, unfortu 
nately, that should be impossible, you are too good a 
patriot and too good a soldier not to feel the neces 
sity I shall be under of going to seek elsewhere an 
opportunity of injuring our common enemy. The 
places that you shall point out to me will appear to 
me preferable, whenever naval circumstances and the 
state of my supplies will permit. It is with the 
greatest pleasure that I learn, from M. Gerard, the 
King s Minister, that you are clothed with the most 
ample powers to treat with me on military opera 
tions. I cannot act, either far or near, under the aus 
pices of a greater master. You are a master; and 
you know that, the instant one thing becomes , we 

ought to attempt another. 

I have received a printed list of the eleven Eng 
lish vessels of the line, which are announced to us on 
very good part. This news, published by the order 
of Congress, acquires an authenticity which merits the 
highest attention. 

Accept my compliments upon your last victory. 
Even were not the success of America our own, by 
the intimate bands which bind us together, it would 
be impossible, as a soldier and as a man, not to participate in it. It is natural to love to see one laurel 
more adorning the brow of a great man. I have the 
honor to be, with respect, 

Your very humble, and very obedient servant, 

ESTAING. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 
(Private.) 

Philadelphia, 18 July, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

Yesterday I had the honor of writing to your Ex 
cellency a public letter by James Martin, and also 
of presenting to Congress your Excellency s favor of 
the 14th, which the House received with satisfaction. 

Permit me, Sir, to recommend to your Excellen 
cy s protection two packets from the Sieur Gerard to 
Count d Estaing, which will accompany this. I have 
assured Monsieur Gerard that it is altogether unnecessary to urge your Excellency to give these des 
patches the quickest safe passage to the Vice-Admiral. 

Prizes are finding the way into the Delaware. One, 
laden with rum, limes, &c., intended for the enemy s 
refreshment, embraced one of our wharves the evening before last, and I learn a rich ship is on her way 
up. 

I have this moment received a second letter from 
the British Commissioners. If I dared to venture an 
opinion, from a very cursory reading of the perform 
ance, it would be that this is more puerile than any 
thing I have seen from the other side since the commencement of our present dispute, with a little dash 
of insolence, as unnecessary as it will be unavailing. 
If the Marquis de Vienne will indulge me, till I 
return from Congress, your Excellency will find a 
copy of that letter within this. At present, as he is 
on the wing, I must send to obtain his permission ; 
and in order to be quite ready, in case he shall re 
fuse to wait, I conclude this with repeated assurances 
of being, with the highest esteem and respect, dearSir, your Excellency s 

Obliged and obedient, humble servant, 

HENRY LAURENS. 

P. S. Returned from Congress at 9 o clock. A 
resolve, relative to the Commissioners letter, that it 
ought not to be answered, &c., with the letter, will 
appear in print. 



FROM COLONEL HAMILTON. 

Black Point. 20 July, 1778. 



SIR, 

Inclosed I transmit your Excellency a letter from 
Count d Estaing. lie has had the river sounded, and 
finds he cannot enter. He will sail for Rhode Island 
to-morrow evening ; in the mean time, he is making 
demonstrations to deceive the enemy, and beget an 
opinion that he intends to operate in this quarter. 
He would sail immediately, but he waits the arrival, 
or to hear, of a frigate which carried M. Gerard to 
Delaware, and which he appointed to meet him at 
Sandy Hook, so that he fears his sudden and unex 
pected departure, before she arrives, might cause her 
to be lost. He will not, however, wait longer than 
till to-morrow evening. We have agreed that five 
cannon, fired briskly, shall be a signal of his arrival 
by day, and the same number, with five sky-rockets, 
a signal by night. 

In communicating this to General Sullivan, the Count 
wishes not a moment may be lost, and that he may 
be directed to have persons stationed on the coast, 
and intermediate expresses to facilitate the communication between them. Pilots will be a material arti 
cle. He begs every thing may be forwarded as much 
as possible, and as many troops collected as may be. 
He would be glad if a detachment could march from 
your army, or could be sent by water, for which purpose he would send covering ships and some vessels 
he has taken by way of transports ; but he cannot 
think of losing so much time as seems necessary. If 
the water scheme could shorten it, it would be a 
happy circumstance. He recommends it to your at 
tention, and that you would take measures, if the end 
can be better answered in this way, and meet himwith information of the part he may have to act to 
execute the plan. I perceive he can with difficulty 
debark four thousand troops, but he will try to do it. 
I am, Sir, 

Your most respectful and obedient servant, 

ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 
14* 
P. S. I hope your Excellency will excuse my not 
being myself the bearer of these particulars ; the end 
may be answered by letter. Mr. Neville is anxious 
to get on. I have just heard of despatches arrived 
from you ; I don t know but they may contain some 
thing new, which may make the Count wish a good 
conveyance to return an answer. My stay till to 
morrow morning may answer that end. I shall not 
delay coming forward. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Camp at the Plains, 21 July, 1778. 

SIR, 

Your Excellency has made me very unhappy. I 
can submit very patiently to deserved censure ; but 
it wounds my feelings exceedingly to meet with a 
rebuke for doing what I conceived to be a proper 
part of my duty, and in the order of things. 

When I left your Excellency at Haverstraw, you 
desired me to go forward and reconnoitre the country, and fix upon some proper position to draw the 
troops together at, I was a stranger to all this part 
of the country, and could form no judgment of a 
proper place, until I had thoroughly examined the 
ground. 

Croton River was the only place I could find 
suitable to the purpose, all circumstances being 
taken into consideration. I wrote your Excellency 
what I had done, and where I was, that if you had 
any thing in charge I might receive your orders. I 
wrote you the reasons for my not waiting upon you 
in person were, I had many letters to answer, and 
many matters to regulate in my department, which 
prevented me from returning.* Besides which, it 
was almost half a day s ride, the weather exceeding 
hot, and myself not a little fatigued. And here I 
must observe, that neither my constitution nor 
strength is equal to constant exercise. 

As I was a stranger to all the lower country, I 
thought it absolutely necessary for me to come for 
ward. A thorough knowledge of the country is not 
easily obtained ; such a one, at least, as is necessary 
to fix upon the most eligible position for forming a 
camp. The security of the army, the ease and con 
venience of the troops, as well as to perform the du 
ties of my office with a degree of reputation, all 
conspired to make me wish to fix upon the properest 
ground for the purpose. This it was impossible for 
me to do, unless I came on before the troops. And 
I must confess I saw no objection, as your Excel 
lency had wrote me nothing to the contrary, and 
what I wrote naturally led to such a measure. 

I expected you on every hour, and was impatient 
to get forward that I might be able to give some 
account of the country when you came up. Before 
I left Crompond, I desired Mr. Pettit to wait upon 
you at your arrival, and take your orders, and if 
there was any thing special to forward it by ex 
press. 

If I had neglected my duty in pursuit of pleasure, 
or if I had been wanting in respect to your Excel
* General Greene was appointed Quartermaster-General by Con 
gress on the 3d of March, and he had since performed the duties of that 
office in addition to his regular service in the army as Major-General. 
The Quarter-master s department had become much deranged during 
the preceding campaign, and General Greene was prevailed upon to 
accept the appointment as the most proper person, by his energy and 
ability, to bring it into order, and establish an effective system. 
lency, I would have put my hand upon my mouth, 
and been silent upon the occasion ; but, as I am not 
conscious of being chargeable with either the one or 
the other, I cannot help thinking I have been treated 
with a degree of severity that I am in no respect 
deserving. And I would just observe here, that it is 
impossible for me to do my duty if I am always at 
head-quarters. I have ever given my attendance 
there as much as possible, both from a sense of duty 
and from inclination ; but constant attendance is out 
of my power, unless I neglect all other matters ; the 
propriety of which, and the consequences that will 
follow, I submit to your Excellency s consideration. 

Your Excellency well knows how I came into this 
department. It was by your special request, and you 
must be sensible there is no other man upon earth 
would have brought me into the business but you. 
The distress the department Avas in, the disgrace that 
must accompany your operations without a change, 
and the difficulty of engaging a person capable of 
conducting the business, together with the hopes of 
meeting your approbation, and having your full aid 
and assistance, reconciled me to the undertaking. 

I flatter myself, when your Excellency takes a, view 
of the state things were in when I first engaged, 
and consider the short time we had to make the 
preparations for the opening campaign, and reflect 
with what ease and facility you began your march 
from Valley Forge, and continued it all through the 
country r notwithstanding we went great part of the 
way entirely out of the line of preparations, you 
will do me the justice to say I have not been negli 
gent or inattentive to my duty. 

I have, in every respect, since I had my appoint 
ment, strove to accommodate the business of the department to the plan of jour Excellency s operations. 
And I can say, with great truth, that ever since I 
had the honor to serve under you, I have been more 
attentive to the public interest, and more engaged in 
the support of your Excellency s character, than ever 
I was to my own ease, interest, or reputation. 

I have never solicited you for a furlough to go 
home to indulge in pleasure, or to improve my in 
terest, which, by the by, I have neglected, going on 
four years. I have never confined myself to my 
particular line of duty only. Neither have I ever 
spared myself, either by night or day, where it has 
been necessary to promote the public service under 
your direction. I have never been troublesome to 
your Excellency, to publish any thing to my advan 
tage, although I think myself as justly entitled as 
some others, who have been much more fortunate, 
particularly in the action of the Brandywine. 

I have never suffered my pleasures to interfere 
with my duty ; and 1 am persuaded I have given 
too many unequivocal proofs of my attachment to 
your person and interest, to leave a doubt upon yourmind to the contrary. I have always given you my 
opinion with great candor, and executed your orders 
with equal fidelity. I do not mean to arrogate to 
myself more merit than I deserve, or wish to excul 
pate myself from being chargeable with error, and in 
some instances negligence. However, I can speak, 
with a becoming pride, that I have always endea 
voured to deserve the public esteem, and your Excel 
lency s approbation. 

As I came into the Quarter-master s department 
with reluctance, so I shall leave it with pleasure. 
Your influence brought me in, and the want of yourapprobation will induce me to go out. 
I am very sensible of many deficiences, but this 
is not so justly chargeable to my intentions, as to 
the difficult circumstances attending the business. It 
is almost impossible to get good men for the con 
ducting all parts of so complex a business. It may, 
therefore, naturally be expected that many things 
will wear an unfavorable complexion ; but, let who 
will undertake the business, they will find it very 
difficult, not to say impossible, to regulate it in such 
a manner as not to leave a door open for censure, 
and furnish a handle for reproach. I am, with all 
due respect, your Excellency s 

Most obedient, humble servant, 

NATHANAEL GREENE. 



FROM COLONEL HAMILTON. 

Newark, 23 July, 1778. 

SIR, 

I wrote to your Excellency, the evening of the 
20th, by Major Neville. I remained in the neigh 
bourhood of Black Point till the afternoon following. 
The Count had received his expected despatches from 
Congress, and was to sail, as I mentioned before, the 
first fair wind. At Brunswick, yesterday, Mr. Caldwell joined me. He was immediately from the Point, 
and brought intelligence that the fleet got under 
way yesterday morning. The wind, unfortunately, 
has been much against them, which is so much the 
more to be regretted, as they are rather in want of 
water. I need not suggest to your Excellency that 
an essential part of the Ilhode Island plan is, to take 
every possible measure to watch the enemy s motions, and to establish the expresses from place to 
place, to give the Count instant information of any 
movement among their fleet. This will enable himto be in time to intercept them, should they attempt 
to evacuate New York while he is at Rhode Island, 
and will, in general, facilitate the intercourse and co 
operation between him and your Excellency. 

I have nothing new to communicate, besides what 
was sent by Major Neville, and what I now send. 
All the ideas interchanged between the Count and 
myself were such as w r ere familiar before I left 
head-quarters. He was to go to Rhode Island, and, 
in conjunction with General Sullivan, endeavour to 
possess himself of the enemy s ships and troops there, 
if; on his arrival, he had good reason to think it 
could be effected without further assistance. If not, 
he will be glad of a reenforcement from you in the 
most expeditious manner possible. What manner you 
think will be most expeditious, you will adopt; and, 
if his aid may be useful, he will afford it as soon as 
he is informed of it. 

This being the case, my immediate presence at 
head-quarters is the less necessary, as to this busi 
ness ; and I hope your Excellency will indulge me, 
if I do not make all the despatch back which a case 
of emergency would require, though I do not mean 
to delay more than a moderate attention to my frail 
constitution may make not improper. 

ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 
FROM GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Pouglikccpsic, 24 July, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have received your letter of the 23d instant, 
inclosing one to General Schuyler, which I immedi 
ately forwarded to him. I am sensible that, however 
distressing the situation of our western frontier may 
be, your Excellency has taken every method to afford it security that is in your power, consistent 
with the general good of the service. I would not 
wish, therefore, that any representation of mine should 
occasion a diminution of your present force ; and, as 
Colonel Graham s regiment is composed of men who 
are intimately acquainted with every part of the 
country between the enemy s lines and yours, and 
may be of peculiar service where they now are, I 
would beg leave to submit to your Excellency s further consideration, whether it would not be most ad 
visable to continue it with you at present; in which 
case, I will endeavour to call out a larger proportion 
of the militia for the defence of the frontiers. This, 
I think, the militia ought cheerfully to submit to, as, 
if they were not required for that service, it would 
be but reasonable that they should march to reenforce the army under your Excellency s immediate 
command. 

I have already ordered out one fourth part of the 
militia of Orange and Ulster to the western frontier 
of those counties, who will amount to near six hundred men, and have directed them to take their sta 
tions so as to secure the most important passes leading into the settlements. If they do this, and are 
vigilant, I trust that part of the country will experi 
ence a degree of safety. In addition to this, I have 
issued positive orders to Brigadier-General Ten Broeck, 
and the commanding officers of the several regiments 
in Tryon county, to detach one fourth of their militia 
(such regiments as may be necessary for the safety 
of the northern frontier excepted) for the protection 
of the western frontier in that quarter, and to act 
under and assist Colonel Butler in any offensive operations which may be thought necessary to be carried on by him against the enemy. 

Colonel Butler (whose march, on receiving the in 
telligence I lately transmitted to your Excellency, I 
wished to be hastened) was this morning at New 
Windsor, and will proceed directly to Albany, and 
from thence to Schoharie or Cherry Valley, as General Stark (whose department he will then be in) 
shall direct; and, if joined by Alden s regiment, and 
the detachment of militia which I have ordered out, 
they will form a pretty respectable force in that 
quarter. In the mean time, if I should receive any 
new intelligence that may render its augmentation 
necessary, it shall immediately be communicated to 
your Excellency. I propose, if nothing extraordinary 
happens to prevent it, to do myself the pleasure of 
waiting on your Excellency next week. I am, with 
the highest esteem and respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

GEORGE CLINTON. 



FROM COLONEL JOHN LAURENS. 

Point Judith, 40 miles from Providence, 
25 July, 1778. 

SIR, 

I had the honor of writing to your Excellency from 
Lebanon the 23d instant. The day following, at three
VOL. II. 15 
o clock in the afternoon, I arrived at Providence. As 
soon as I had delivered to General Sullivan yourExcellency s despatches and instructions, I set out for 
this place with Colonel Wall, and an ample number 
of pilots, whom General Sullivan had provided and 
put under his command. Colonel Wall is a man of 
character and property, perfectly acquainted with the 
coast, &c. Those under him are experienced pilots, 
and men of responsibility. We arrived here at nineo clock this morning, having been detained till that 
time in procuring a party of militia, and making arrangements both for securing such boats as we shall 
want for our own immediate use, and such as, with 
out this precaution, might be employed in communicating intelligence to the enemy. 

We have agreed with four whaleboat privateers, 
belonging to Connecticut, manned with enterprising, 
experienced mariners, and pressed four belonging to 
this State. We have given them to understand that 
the frigate, lying at Connecticut River, is to push 
out of the Sound, and that we are to meet her with 
hands to enable her to go round and join the French 
fleet, for which purpose their boats are necessary. 
The number that we have is amply sufficient for ourbusiness, and now we are in readiness. Two senti 
nels will be posted, in an advantageous place, whose 
business will be to attend to whatever signals may 
be given from the seaboard ; besides which, Colonel 
Wall, the master pilots, and myself, will alternately 
hold watch, arid keep our attention awake. Till last 
night, twelve o clock, unfavorable winds have prevailed. If the gale, which we have at present, does 
not prove inconstant, it will not be long before we 
are called upon. Our situation commands a view of 
the several entrances to Newport; and Block Island 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 1*71 

is directly opposite to us, so that nothing can pass 
to or from Newport unnoticed. 

General Sullivan estimates the enemy s land force 
here at seven thousand. The state of their shipping, 
he informs me, is as follows ; in the east channel 
(or that between Seconet Point and Rhode Island), 
tAVO galleys and one small frigate ; in the west chan 
nel (or that between Boston Neck and Connanicut 
Island), two small frigates ; in the middle, or main 
channel, two frigates ; at Newport, two or three fri 
gates. As General Sullivan will probably write to 
your Excellency, I forbear descending to farther particulars. He has been indefatigable, and nothing on 
his part will be wanting. I have the honor to be, 
with the greatest respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

JOHN LAURENS 



FROM COUNT D ESTAING. 



At Sea, 3 August, 1778. 

SIR, 

It is difficult to console one s self for the obstacles, 
as numerous as insurmountable, which stopped me at 
Sandy Hook. The importance of New York, the happiness of fighting the English fleet, and the extreme 
satisfaction of acting directly with you, made me desire, with the greatest ardor, the possibility of entering. I offered, to too little purpose, in an assembly 
of your experienced pilots, a recompense of fifty 
thousand crowns to him who should find us a suffi 
ciency of water. It is only by action that my regret 
can be diminished, and as yet we do nothing. Yourforesight and your orders have, nevertheless, antici 
pated my wants, and rendered my delays less long. 
The re enforcement you have so properly sent, will, as 
I am informed, arrive this evening, and it will, most 
assuredly, be on the part yon have so wisely and expeditionsly taken, that our success will depend. 

General Sullivan has done me the honor to come 
and see me, and to communicate his views. I will 
second them with all my power. He is full of that 
spirit of activity and combination, with which you 
inspire all those who have served under your orders. 
I believe him as fully persuaded as I am of the necessity of acting. The intrenchments that are visible 
above Connanicut increase daily. They are numerous. 
The time I have been at sea begins to make me lose 
a number of men with the scurvy. The extreme 
difficulty of procuring water at Shrewsbury, and the 
tardiness with which it is collected here from differ 
ent places, have long since obliged me to retrench 
our allowance. The officers and men support this 
terrible privation with courage and patience ; and we 
have acquired a virtue which has, hitherto, been re 
fused us, the virtue of perseverance. We doubtless 
owe it to the flattering hope of being useful to allies, 
whom our national taste had itself given us, before 
the orders of the King had prescribed it. 

The gentlemen, your Generals, will acquit them 
selves better than I of the duty of rendering you an 
account of the certain state of the preparations going 
on, and of the small burning of three English vessels, 
which guarded the eastern channel. I will confinemyself by repeating to you, what I cannot well describe, the zeal and the infinite pains of LieutenantColonel Laurens. He is on the wing the four-andtwenty hours round, to procure us refreshments and, 
when this is done, remains on board during a very 
long day with all the patience of an old sailor. We 
are indebted to him for a hospital established on 
shore, and for disembarrassing us of our prisoners; 
which, in our situation, form two important articles. 

I desire much that the present expedition may be 
speedily terminated, to give me leisure to employ 
myself with purging the Sound of the English ves 
sels which now infest the navigation. I have received Colonel Sears with all the consideration and all 
the confidence which those merit whom you are 
pleased to send me, and, when it shall be time for it, 
I will consult him with the greatest eagerness. Ac 
cept the homage of the attachment and respect, with 
which I have the honor to be, Sir, 

Your most obedient and most humble servant, 

ESTAING. 

P. S. Since writing my letter, I received that 
which you had the goodness to address me, on the 
26th of July, by Major-General Greene. I am going 
to look for him on shore, that he may not lose any 
of the present precious moments. The reputation of 
this General Officer made his arrival to be wished. 
His influence on his countrymen, and his knowledge 
of the country, will render him formidable to ourcommon enemy. You know how to divine whatever 
we stand in need of; and, from what I have seen, 
the discerning and employing men proper to the busi 
ness in hand, seems to be one of the qualities which 
compose the illustrious character you bear. This is, 
perhaps, the most important part of the great Ge 
neral.

FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Providence, 6 August, 1778. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I have received your Excellency s favor by General Greene, and have been much pleased with the 
arrival of a gentleman, who, not only on account of 
his merit and the justness of his views, but also by 
his knowledge of the country, and his popularity in 
this State, may be very serviceable to the expedition. 
I willingly part with the half of my detachment, 
though I had a great dependence upon them, as you 
find it convenient to the good of the service. Any 
thing, my dear General, you w r ill order, or even wish, 
shall always be infinitely agreeable to me, and I will 
always feel happy in doing any thing which may 
please you, or forward the public good. I am of the 
same opinion as your Excellency, that dividing ourContinental troops among the militia will have a bet 
ter effect than if we were to keep them together in 
one wing. 

You will receive, by General Sullivan, an account 
of his dispositions, preparations, &c. I therefore have 
nothing to add, but that I have been on board of 
the Admiral the day before yesterday. I saw among 
the fleet an ardor, and a desire of doing something, 
which would soon turn into impatience if we don t 
give them a speedy occasion of fighting. The officers cannot contain their soldiers and sailors, who are 
complaining that they have been these four months 
running after the British, without getting at them ; 
but I hope they will be soon satisfied. 

The Count d Estaing was very glad of my arrival, 
as he could open freely his mind to me. He ex 
pressed the greatest anxiety on account of his wants 
of every kind, provisions, water, &c. He hopes the 
taking of Rhode Island will enable him to get some 
of the two above-mentioned articles. The Admiral 
wants me to join the French troops to those I command, as soon as possible. I confess I feel very 
happy to think of my cooperating with them ; and, 
had I contrived in my mind an agreeable dream, I 
could not have wished a more pleasing event than 
my joining my countrymen with my brothers of Ame 
rica, under my command, and the same standards. 
When I left Europe, I was very far from hoping such 
an agreeable turn of our business in the American 
glorious revolution. 

Though I have no account, neither observations, to 
give to your Excellency, as I am here a man-of-warof the third rate, I will, after the expedition, scribble 
some lines to you, and join, to the account of General 
Sullivan, the assurance that I have all my limbs ; and 
that I am, with the most tender affection, and entire 
confidence, yours, with high respect, 

LAFAYETTE. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SULLIVAN. 
Head-Quarters, on Rhode Island, 13 August, 1778. 

DEAR GENERAL&gt; 

In my last I had the honor to inform you of my 
being in possession of the enemy s works on the 
north part of Rhode Island, and of the arrival of the 
British fleet the moment we had landed; as also of 
the sailing of Count d Estaing in quest of them. As 
this unfortunate circumstance deprived us of the assist 
ance we promised ourselves from the French troops, 
I waited on the ground till the 10th, at night, when, 
finding my numbers had increased sufficiently to warrant my advancing to the town, without waiting the 
return of the fleet, I issued orders for the army to 
inarch the llth, at six in the morning. But fortune, 
still determined to sport longer with us, brought on 
a storm so violent that it last night blew down and 
almost ruined all the tents I had. The arms, of 
course, were rendered useless, and almost the whole 
of our ammunition ruined. The much greater part 
of the army have no kind of coverings, nor would 
tents, if they had them, prove a sufficient security 
against the severity of the storm. My men are 
mostly lying under the fences, half covered with 
water, without ammunition, and with arms rendered 
useless. 

The communications between us and the main are 
cut off by the violence of the wind, which will scarce 
ly permit a whaleboat to pass. Should the enemy 
come out to attack us, our dependence must be upon 
the superiority of our numbers and the point of the 
bayonet. How our militia may behave on such an 
occasion, I am unable to determine. To retreat is 
impossible; therefore we must conquer or perish. 
Perhaps, under such circumstances, an attack upon 
us might be of great advantage. Several men have 
perished from the severity of the weather, and I ex 
pect more will, as I see no probability of the storm 
ceasing. All our hopes of assistance from the French 
fleet are at an end, as this storm must have driven 
them far off from tin s post, and, I am very apprehensive, quite off the coast. To combat all these mis 
fortunes, and to surmount all these difficulties, requires 
a degree of temper and persevering fortitude, which I 
can never boast of, and which few possess in so am 
ple a manner as your Excellency. I will, however, 
endeavour, by emulating the example, to rise superior 
to the malevolence of fortune and my present lament 
able situation, as quick as possible; and, if Heaven 
will cease to frown, endeavour to gratify your Ex 
cellency s desires. I am sorry your Excellency s let 
ter, respecting the enemy s burning their shipping, 
did not arrive till they had burnt and sunk the whole 
of their vessels of war, and sunk almost all the other 
vessels, to block up the channel. 

The letter of your Excellency, inclosing that to the 
Count d Estaing, did not arrive till after he had sailed. The intelligence from the Council of Massachu 
setts, informing that Admiral Byron, with thirteen 
large ships of the line, was spoken with off the West 
ern Islands, also arrived the day after he sailed. This 
account says that Byron was spoken with on the 29th 
of June. The fleet which arrived here, and the Count 
was in pursuit of, was Lord Howe s fleet, among which 
were only five sail of the line. The rest, smaller ves 
sels of war, and transports. They landed no men 
here. 

I was apprehensive that some such event as this 
might happen to deprive me of the Count s assist 
ance. This induced me to call for more men than I 
should otherwise have done. The numbers of the 
enemy are nearly thus : 

Two Hessian regiments, GOO each, . . 1,200 
Two Anspach, 500 each, . . . 1,000 
Brown and Fanning, . . . . 600 
22d, 38th, 43d, and 54th British, 400 each, 1,600 
Two Hessian regiments, 500 each, . . 1,000 
Whitman s regiment, . . . . 100 

5,500 
To these we may add one thousand seamen, 1,000 

6,500 
My numbers on the Island are about nine thou 
sand, rank and file. Deserters come out in great 
numbers. 

I have the honor to be ; my dear General, &c., 

JOHN SULLIVAN. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SULLIVAN. 

Camp, before Newport, 23 August, 1778. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

The Fates have decreed that you shall receive no 
thing but disagreeable intelligence from this quarter. 
Major-General Greene and the Marquis returned, the 
night before last, from the French Admiral. My let 
ter, their entreaties, and General Greene s written re 
monstrance, drawn up on board the Languedoc, have 
only produced the letter which I inclose. It seems 
that the Captains of the French fleet are so incensed 
at the Count d Estaing s being put over them, he being but a land officer, that they are determined to 
prevent his doing any thing that may redound to his 
credit or our advantage. The Count himself wished 
to come in, but his Captains were, to a man, for leaving us. I then drew up a letter, in behalf of all the 
officers of the army, and sent on board ; but he, though 
the wind was not fair for Boston, put oil to sea night 
before last. This letter was followed by the inclosed 
protest, both of which I have ordered after him, in ;i 
fast-sailing privateer. I arn, however, well persuaded 
that nothing will alter the determinations of the Captains, and that he will follow their counsel, though ho 
knows they wish his ruin. 

This sudden and unexampled procedure renders my 
situation exceeding delicate. The enemy have twice 
attempted to relieve the place by reinforcements ; the 
last fleet had four thousand troops on board. Should 
they make another attempt, they must succeed. They 
will then have near ten thousand troops on the Is 
land, and the command of the water on every sideof us, as we have been obliged to dismantle our forts 
at Bristol and Tiverton to forward our operations 
against the town. 

I inclose to your Excellency a copy of the ques 
tions proposed by me to the General Officers and 
Commandants of brigades this day. I also inclose to 
your Excellency a copy of the protest sent after the 
Count d Estaing. As my situation, at present, can 
promise nothing to advantage, except from a sudden 
attack, I wish the opinions of the officers may justify 
me in making this last effort. I have the honor to 
be, my dear General, 

Yours, most affectionately, 

JOHN SULLIVAN. 

P. S. I offered the Count, in my letter, to make 
the attack the moment he would land the troops, and 
put them in the boats I had prepared for them. 
General Greene and the Marquis assured him that 
we would not require the stay of his fleet and troops 
more than forty-eight hours. But nothing could in 
duce him to assist us with either, a single moment. 



FROM COLONEL LAURENS. 

Camp, before Newport, 23 August, 1778. 

SIR, 

I am just returned from a fruitless pursuit of the 
French squadron. General Sullivan will inform yourExcellency of the fatal determination of the Count s 
officers in a Council of War, as well as of the several 
remonstrances, and final solemn protest, made by the 
American Generals. The Admiral s ship being dismantled, fore and aft, at the moment he had overtaken 
the British fleet, and was promising himself an important victory, another ship of the line being in 
like manner dismantled, and a seventy-four gun ship 
being separated from the squadron, all the effects 
of a most dreadful storm which suddenly arose, were 
regarded as sufficient reasons, added to the expecta 
tion of Admiral Byron s arrival, for abandoning the 
American troops in the midst of a very important ex 
pedition, and reducing them to the necessity of making a desperate attack or a precipitate retreat. 

The honor of the French nation, the honor of the 
Admiral, the safety of his fleet, and a regard for the 
new alliance, required a different conduct ; but the 
Count s hands w r ere tied. The cabal of marine officers, who wish his destruction because he was intro 
duced from the land service into their corps, left 
him, it is said, no choice. I cannot, however, but be 
of opinion, that a solemn protest might, by affording 
a justification for his acting in direct contradiction to 
the unanimous voice of his officers, have induced himto remain here. lie might have been furnished, at 
this place, with all the means of refitting which he 
can expect at Boston. lie might have been as well 
secured against a superior force ; and, in case he had 
chosen to fight, he would have been in better condi 
tion in still water, with dismantled vessels, where 
every one knows that, with springs upon his cables, 
he might fight his artillery as w r ell as if he had 
masts and sails ; whereas, at sea, in case of a separa 
tion from his fleet, the Languedoc may fall a prey 
to a vessel of half her force. 
As I find that I am detaining the express, and I 
am sure General Sullivan will have written your Ex 
cellency more fully than my present hurry and con 
fusion of ideas, for want of sleep, will permit me to 
do, I must entreat your Excellency s excuse for closing my letter abruptly. I have the honor to be, with 
the greatest respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

JOHN LAURENS. 



FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Camp, before Newport, 25 August, 1778. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

I had expected, in answering your first letter, that 
something interesting would have happened that I 
might communicate to your Excellency. Every day 
was going to terminate our uncertainties; nay, every 
day was going to bring the hope of a success, which 
I did promise myself to acquaint you of. Such was 
the reason of my deferring what my duty and inclination did urge me to do much sooner. I am now 
indebted for two favors of yours, which I beg leave 
to offer here my thanks for. The first letter reached 
me in the time we expected to hear again from the 
French fleet; the second I have just received. My 
reason for not writing the same day the French fleet 
went to Boston was, that I did not choose to trouble 
your friendship with the sentiments of an afflicted, 
injured heart, and injured by that very people I came 
from so far to love and support. Don t be surprised, my dear General; the generosity of your honest 
mind would be offended at the shocking sight I have 
under my eyes. 

VOL. II. 16 
So far am I from a critical disposition, that I will 
not give you the journal of our operations, neither 
of several instances during our staying here, which, 
however, might occupy some room in this letter. I 
will not even say to you, how contracted was the 
French fleet, when they wanted to come in at their 
arrival, which, according to the report of the animadverters, would have had the greatest effect; how 
surprised was the Admiral, when, after a formal and 
agreed convention, one hour after the American General had given a new written assurance, our troops 
made the landing a day before it was expected ; how 
mortified the French officers were to find out that 
there was not a gun left in these very forts, to whose 
protection they w 7 ere recommended. All these things, 
and many others, I W 7 ould not take notice of, if they 
were not at this moment the supposed ground upon 
which it is said that the Count d Estaing is gone on 
to Boston. Believe me, my dear Sir, upon my honor, 
the Admiral, though a little astonished by some in 
stances of conduct on our part, did consider them in 
the same light as you and myself would have done ; 
and, if he is gone off, it is because he thought himself obliged by necessity. 

Let us consider, my dear General, the motions of 
that fleet, since it was proposed by the Count d Es 
taing himself, and granted by the King in behalf of 
the United States. I will not go so far up as to re 
member other instances of the affection the French 
nation have for the Americans. The news of that 
fleet have occasioned the evacuation of Philadelphia. 
Its arrival has opened all the harbours, secured all the 
coasts, obliged the British navy to be together. Six 
of those frigates (two of them I have seen sufficient 
for terrifying all the trading people of the two Carolinas) are taken or burnt. The Count d Estaing went 
to offer battle, and act as a check to the British navy, 
for a long time. At New York it was agreed he 
should go to Rhode Island, and there he went. They 
prevented him from going in at first; afterwards he 
was desired to come in, and so he did. The same 
day we landed, without his knowledge, an English 
fleet appears in sight. His being divided into threeparts by our directions (for, though he is a Lieu 
tenant-General, he never availed himself of that title), 
made him uneasy about his situation. But, finding 
the next morning that the wind was northerly, being 
also convinced that it was his duty to prevent any 
reinforcement at Newport, he goes out, under the 
hottest fire of the British land-batteries; he puts the 
British navy to flight, and pursues them, and they 
were all in his hands when that horrid storm arrived 
to ruin all our hopes. Both fleets are divided, scat 
tered. The Caesar, a seventy-four gun ship, is lost; 
the Marseillais, of the same size, loses her masts, and, 
after that accident, is obliged to send back [permit 
to escape ?] an enemy s ship of sixty-four ; the Languedoc, having lost her masts, unable to be governed 
and make any motions, separated from the others, is 
attacked by a ship of the line, against which she 
could only bring six guns. 

When the storm was over, they met again in a 
shattered condition, and the Csesar was not to be 
found. All the Captains represented to their General, 
that, after a so long navigation, in such a want of 
victuals, water, &c., which they had not yet been 
supplied with, after the intelligence given by General 
Sullivan, that there was a British fleet coming, they 
should go to Boston; tout the Count d Estaing had 
promised to come here again, and so he did, at all 
events. The news of his arrival and situation canie 
by the Senegal; a frigate taken from the enemy. Ge 
neral Greene and myself went on "board. The Count 
expressed to me, not so much to the envoy from Ge 
neral Sullivan, as to his friend, the unhappy circum 
stances he was in. Bound by express orders from the 
King to go to Boston in case of an accident or supe 
rior fleet, engaged by the common sentiment of all 
the officers, even of some American pilots, that he would 
ruin all his squadron in deferring his going to Boston, 
he called a new Council of War, and, finding every 
body of the same opinion, he did not think himself 
justifiable in staying here any longer, and took leave 
of me with true affliction, not being able to assist 
America for some days ; which has been rewarded with 
the most horrid ungratefulness. But no matter. I am 
only speaking of facts. The Count said to mo these 
last words : "After many months of sufferings, my men 
will rest some days ; I will man my ships, and, if I 
am assisted in getting masts, &c., three weeks after 
my arrival I shall go out again, and then we shall 
fight for the glory of the French name, and the inte 
rests of America," 

The day the Count went off, the General American 
Officers drew up a protestation, which, as / had been 
very strangely called there ^ I refused to sign ; but I 
wrote a letter to the Admiral. The protestation and 
the letter did not arrive in time. 

Now, my dear General, I am going to hurt yourgenerous feelings by an imperfect picture of what I 
am forced to see. Forgive me for it ; it is not to the 
Commander-in-chief, it is to my most dearest friend. 
General Washington, that I am speaking. I want to 
lament with him the ungenerous sentiments I have 
been forced to see in many American breasts. 
Could you believe that, forgetting any national 
obligation, forgetting what they were owing to that 
same fleet, what they were yet to expect from them, 
and, instead of resenting their accidents as those of 
allies and brothers, the people turned mad at their 
departure, and, wishing them all the evils in the 
world, did treat them as a generous one would be 
ashamed to treat the most inveterate enemies ? You 
cannot have any idea of the horrors which were to 
be heard on that occasion. Many leaders themselves, 
finding they were disappointed, abandoned their minds 
to illiberality and ungratefulness. Frenchmen of the 
highest character have been exposed to the most disagreeable circumstances; and yet, myself the friend 
of America, the friend of General Washington, I am 
more upon a warlike footing in the American lines 
than when I came near the British lines at Newport. 

Such is, my dear General, the true state of mat 
ters. I arn sure it will infinitely displease and hurt 
your feelings. I am also sure you will approve the 
part I have taken in it, which was, to stay much at 
home with all the French gentlemen who are here, 
and declare, at the same time, that any thing thrown 
before me against my nation, I would take as the 
most particular affront. 

Inclosed I send you the general orders of the 24th, 
upon which I thought I was obliged to pay a visit 
to General Sullivan, who has agreed to alter them in 
the following manner. Remember, my dear General, 
that I don t speak to the Commander-in-chief, but 
to my friend ; that I am far from complaining of any 
body. I have no complaints at all to make to you 
against any one ; but I lament, with you, that I have 
had an occasion of seeing so ungenerous sentiments 
in American hearts. 
16* 
I will tell you the true reason. The leaders of the 
expedition are, most of them, ashamed to return, after 
having spoken of their Rhode Island success in proud 
terms before their family, their friends, their internal 
enemies. The others, regardless of the expense France 
has been put to by that fleet, of the tedious, tire 
some voyage which so many men have had for their 
service, though they are angry that the fleet takes 
three wrecks of the whole campaign to rent them 
selves, cannot bear the idea of being brought to a 
small expense, to the loss of a little time, to the 
fatigue of staying some few days more in a camp at 
some few miles off their houses ; for I am very farfrom looking upon the expedition as having miscarried, and I see even a certainty of success. 

If, as soon as the fleet is repaired (which in case 
they are treated as one is in a country one is not at 
war with, would be done in three weeks from this 
time), the Count d Estaing was to come around, the 
expedition seems to offer a very good prospect. If 
the enemy evacuates New York, we have the whole 
Continental army ; if not, we might, perhaps, have 
some more men ; what number, however, I cannot 
pretend to judge. All that I know is, that I shall 
be very happy to see the fleet cooperating with General Washington himself. 

I think I shall be forced, by the Board of General Officers, to go soon to Boston. That I will do as 
soon as required, though with reluctance, for I do not 
believe that our position on this part of the Island is 
without danger ; but my principle is, to do every 
thing which is thought good for the service. I have 
very often rode express to the fleet, to the frigates, 
and that, I assure you, with the greatest pleasure ; on 
the other hand, I may, perhaps, be useful to the fleet. 
Perhaps, too, it will be in the power of the Count to 
do something which might satisfy them. I wish, my 
dear General, you could know as well as myself, how 
desirous the Count d Estaing is to forward the public 
good, to help your success, and to serve the cause 
of America. 

I earnestly beg you will commend, to the several 
chief persons of Boston, to do every thing they can 
to put the French fleet in a situation for sailing soon. 
Give me leave to add, that I wish many people, by 
the declaration of your sentiments in that affair, could 
learn how to regulate theirs, and blush at the sight 
of your generosity. 

You will find my letter immense. I began it oneday and finished it the next, as my time was swal 
lowed up by those eternal Councils of War. I shall 
have the pleasure of writing you from Boston. I am 
afraid the Count d Estaing will have felt to the 
quick the behaviour of the people on this occasion. 
You cannot conceive how distressed he was to be 
prevented from serving this country for some time. 
I do assure you his circumstances were very critical 
and distressing. For my part, my sentiments are 
known to the world. My tender affection for General 
Washington is added to them; therefore, I want no 
apologies for writing upon what has afflicted me, both 
as an American and as a Frenchman. 

I am much obliged to you for the care you are so 
kind as to take of that poor horse of mine ; had he 
not found such a good stable as that at head-quarters, 
he would have cut a pitiful figure at the end of his 
travels, and I should have been too happy, if there 
had remained so much of the horse as the bones, the 
skin, and the four shoes. 

Farewell, iny dear General; whenever I quit you, 
I meet with some disappointment and misfortune. I 
did not need it, to desire seeing you as much as possible. With the most tender affection and high re 
gard, I have the honor to be, &c. 

LAFAYETTE. 

Dear General ; I must add to my letter, that I 
have received one from General Greene, very differ 
ent from the expressions I have to complain of. lie 
seems there very sensible of what I feel. I am very 
happy when placed in a situation to do justice to 
any one. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Camp, near Newport, 28 August, 1778. 

SIR, 

Your Excellency s favor of the 21st came to hand 
the evening of the 25th. 

In my last I communicated to your Excellency the 
departure of the Count d Estaing with his fleet, for 
Boston. This disagreeable event has, as I apprehend, 
ruined all our operations. It struck such a panic 
among the militia and volunteers, that they began to 
desert by shoals. The fleet no sooner set sail, than 
they began to be alarmed for their safety. This mis 
fortune damped the hopes of our army, and gave 
new spirits to that of the enemy. 

We had a very respectable force, as to numbers ; 
between eight and nine thousand, rank and file, upon 
the ground ; but of these we attempted to select a 
particular corps to possess ourselves of the enemy s 
lines, partly by force, and partly by stratagem; but 
w r e could not make up the necessary number that 
was thought sufficient to warrant the attempt, which 
was five thousand, including the Continental and 
State troops. This body was to consist of men, who 
had been in actual service before, not less than ninemonths. However, the men were not to be had, and, 
if they could have been found, there was more against 
it than for it. Colonel Laurens was to have opened 
the passage by landing within the enemy s lines, and 
getting possession of a redoubt at the head of Easton s beach. If we had failed in the attempt, the 
whole party must have fallen a sacrifice, for their 
situation would have been such that there was no 
possibility of getting off. 

I shall inclose your Excellency a plan of the enemy s works, and of their strength, from the best ac 
counts w r e are able to get. They have never been 
out of their lines since the siege began, till, night be 
fore last, Colonel Bruce came out with one hundred 
and fifty men, to take off a small picket of ours, 
posted at the neck of Easton s beach. He partly suc 
ceeded in the attempt, by the carelessness of the old 
guard. He came over after dark, and lay in ambush, 
that when the new guard went down to take their 
post, the enemy came upon their backs before they 
discovered them, it being very dark. We lost twen 
ty-four privates and two subalterns. Ten of the 
picket got off. 

Our strength is now reduced from nine thousand 
to between four and five thousand. All our heavy 
cannon on garrison carriages, and heavy and superflu 
ous stores of every kind, are removed to the main, 
and to the north end of the Island, where we intend 
to intrench and attempt to hold it, and w r ait the 
chance of events. General Hancock is gone to Boston to forward the repairs of the fleet, and to prepare the mind of the Count for a speedy return. 
How far he will succeed, I cannot pretend to say. I 
think it a matter of some doubt yet, whether the 
enemy will reenforcc, or take off this garrison. If 
they expect a superior fleet from Europe, they will 
reenforce ; but, if not, they will remove the garrison. 

Your Excellency may rest assured, that I have doneevery thing in my power to cultivate and promote a 
good understanding, both with the Count and the 
Marquis, and flatter myself that I am upon very good 
terms with them both. The Marquis s great thirst 
for glory, and national attachment, often run him into 
errors. However, he did every thing to prevail on 
the Admiral to cooperate with us, that man could 
do. People censure the Admiral with great freedom, 
and many are imprudent enough to reproach the 
nation through the Admiral. General Sullivan very 
imprudently issued something like a censure in ge 
neral orders. Indeed, it was an absolute censure. It 
opened the mouths of the army in very clamorous 
strains. The General was obliged to explain it away 
in a few days. The fermentation seems to be now 
subsiding, and all things appear as if they would go 
smoothly on. The Marquis is going to Boston, also, 
to hasten the Count s return, and, if possible, to get 
the Erench troops to join the land forces here, which 
will more effectually interest the Count in the success 
of the expedition. 

Eive sail of British ships have got into Newport 
within two days past. We have heard nor seen no 
thing of the fleet of transports your Excellency 
mentioned, in your letter to General Sullivan of the 
23d. If they arrive with a large reenforcenient, ourexpedition is at an end, unless it is by way of 
blockade, and that will depend upon the French 
fleet s being superior to that of the British, 
General Sullivan has done every thing that could 
be expected, and had the fleet cooperated with us as 
was at first intended, and agreeably to the original 
plan of the expedition, we must have been successful. 
I wish it was in my power to confirm General Sulli 
van s prediction of the 17th, but I cannot flatter my 
self with such an agreeable issue. I am sensible he 
is in common very sanguine, but his expectations 
were not ill-founded in the present case. We had 
every reason to hope for success, from our numbers, 
and from the enemy s fears. Indeed, General Pigot 
was heard to say, the garrison must fall, unless they 
were speedily relieved by a British fleet. If we could 
have made a landing upon the south part of the 
town, two days would have put us in complete possession of it. Nothing was wanting to effect this, but 
the cooperation of the fleet and French forces. The 
disappointment is vexatious and truly mortifying. 
The garrison was so important, and the reduction so 
certain, that I cannot with patience think of the 
event. The French ship that was missing has got 
into Boston. The rest of the fleet have not got there 
yet, or at least we have no accounts of their arrival. 

We are verv anxious to learn the condition of Lord 

/ 

Howe s fleet. The French seventy-four that has got 
into Boston had an engagement with a British sixtyfour. The Captain and Lieutenant of the former were 
both wounded; one lost a leg, the other an arm. 

Our troops are in pretty good health, and well furnished with provisions, and every thing necessary for 
carrying on the expedition. 

Our approaches were pushed on with great spirit, 
while we had any hopes of the fleet cooperating with 
us ; but the people lost all relish for digging, after 
that. 
People are very anxious to hear the issue of General Lee s trial. Various are the conjectures ; but 
everybody agrees he is not acquitted. 

August olst. Camp Tiverton. I wrote the foregoing, and intended to have sent it by the express 
that went off in the morning, but while I was writing, I was informed the express was gone; and the 
change of situation and round of events that have 
since taken place, have prevented my forwarding 
what I had wrote, as matters seemed to be coming 
to a crisis. 

On the evening of the 29th, the army fell back to 
the north end of the Island. The next morning, the 
enemy advanced upon us in two columns upon the 
east and west road. Our light troops, commanded by 
Colonel Livingston and Colonel Laurens, attacked the 
heads of the columns about seven o clock in the morning, but were beat back they were reinforced with 
a regiment upon each road. The enemy still proved 
too strong. General Sullivan formed the army in or 
der of battle, and resolved to wait their approach 
upon the ground we were encamped on, and sent 
orders to the light troops to fall back. The enemy 
came up and formed upon Quaker Hill, a very strong 
piece of ground, within about one mile and a quarter 
of our line. We were well posted, with strong works 
in our rear, and a strong redoubt in front, partly 
upon the right of the line. 

In this position a warm cannonade commenced, and 
lasted for several hours, with continual skirmishes in 
front of both lines. About two o clock the enemy 
began to advance in force upon our right, as if they 
intended to dislodge us from the advanced redoubt. 
I had the command of the right wing. After advancing four regiments, and finding the enemy still gaining ground, I advanced with two more regiments of 
regular troops, and a brigade of militia, and at the 
same time General Sullivan ordered Colonel Livings 
ton, with the light troops under his command, to ad 
vance. We soon put the enemy to the rout, and I 
had the pleasure to see them run in worse disorder 
than they did at the battle of Monniouth. Our troops 
behaved with great spirit; and the brigade of militia, 
under the command of General Lovell, advanced with 
great resolution and in good order, and stood the fire 
of the enemy with great firmness. Lieutenant-Colonel 
Livingston, Colonel Jackson, and Colonel Henry B. 
Livingston, did themselves great honor in the transactions of the day; but it s not in my power to do 
justice to Colonel Laurens, who acted both the General and the partisan. His command of regular troops 
was small, but he did every thing possible to be 
done by their numbers. He had two most excellent 
officers with him, Lieutenant-Colonel Henry and Ma 
jor Talbot, 

The enemy fell back to their strong ground, and 
the day terminated with a cannonade and skirmishes. 
Both armies continued in their position all day yes 
terday, cannonading each other every now and then. 
Last night we effected a very good retreat, without 
the loss of men or stores. 

We have not collected an account of the killed and 
wounded, but we judge our loss amounts to between 
two and three hundred, and that of the enemy, to 
much more. 

We are going to be posted all round the shores 
as a guard upon them, and in that state to wait for 
the return of the fleet, which, by the by, I think will 
not be in a hurry. 

VOL. II. 17 
It is reported that Lord Howe arrived last night 
with his fleet and the re enforcement mentioned in 
your Excellency s letter to General Sullivan. If the 
report is true, we got off the island in very good 
season. 

The Marquis went to Boston the day before the 
action, and did not return until last night, just as we 
were leaving the Island. He went to wait upon the 
Admiral, to learn his further intentions, and to get 
him to return again and complete the expedition, if 
possible. 

I observe your Excellency thinks the enemy design 
to evacuate New York. If they should, I think they 
will Newport also; but I am persuaded they will do 
neither for the present. 

I would write your Excellency a more particularaccount of the battle and retreat, but I imagine General Sullivan and Colonel Laurens have done it alrea 
dy, and I am myself very much unwell. I have had 
no sleep for three nights and days, being severely 
afflicted with the asthma. I am, with great respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

NATHANAEL GREENE. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 
(Private.) 

Philadelphia, 29 August, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

I did myself the honor of writing to your Excel 
lency yesterday, by Jones, to which I beg leave to 
refer. 

This morning, upon inquiry, I was confirmed in my 
belief that the former Camp Committee had made no 
application to Congress for gold or silver, to be deposited in your Excellency s hands for public uses; 
wherefore, I suggested to two or three members the 
necessity and utility of establishing such a fund, and 
prevailed upon one of the gentlemen to move the 
House for that purpose. The motion was accepted, 
and, without a pause, the sum of five hundred guineas 
voted. These I shall presently receive, and, if possi 
ble, convey them to your Excellency under the pro 
tection of Captain Josiah Stoddard, of the light dra 
goons. 

I have just received new addresses to Congress 
from the British Commissioners at New York. Go 
vernor Johnstone, in graceless and almost scurrilous 
terms, without exonerating himself from the charges 
alleged against him, submits to the decree of inter 
diction, lately pronounced by Congress.* Nor do the 
gentlemen, late his coadjutors, so highly resent the 
proceedings on our part, as to refuse to treat with 
out the support of the Governor s name. 

Your Excellency will judge best from their respect 
ive performances on the present occasion ; copies of 
which shall- accompany this letter. 

I take the liberty of inclosing, with the present 
despatches, a letter directed " To Lieutenant-Colonel 
Laurens," under a flying seal, and to request yourExcellency to peruse a paragraph contained in it, 
which speaks of a Monsieur Gal van. 

Monsieur Gerard is exceedingly affected by the late 
determinations on the water, near Rhode Island, and 
has communicated his sentiments to me with great 
candor. Good accounts from General Sullivan will do 



* See Governor Johnstone s manifesto in Almon s Remembrancer, 
Vol. VH. p. 15. 
more towards recovering him from a slight intermit 
tent, which really seized that gentleman, immediately 
after he had received Monsieur Chouin s letter, than 
four ounces of bark. Indeed, I never saw people in 
general more anxious than my acquaintance, under 
the present suspense. Within the next two hours, I 
make no doubt, there will be fifty inquirers for news 
within this door. I remain, with the utmost regard, 
dear Sir, 

Your Excellency s obliged and humble servant, 

HENRY LAURENS.* 



FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Tivcrton, 1 September, 1778. 



MY DEAR GENERAL, 



That there has been an action fought where I 



* The following extract from a letter written by Mr. Andrew Adams, 
a Delegate in Congress, to Mr. Samuel Ly man, dated August 17th, presents an interesting sketch of the mode of doing business in Congress, 
at this period. 

"I do not know that I Qan better gratify your curiosity at present, 
than by giving a general account of the proceedings of Congress. Ac 
cording to order we should meet at nine, and adjourn at two ; but, in 
fact, we meet about ten, and sit till three, four, and five, before we ad 
journ. This you will say is very inconvenient, but it leaves us much 
leisure. But you will consider, that much of the business is transacted 
by special Committees in the recess of Congress. Besides these, there 
is a Marine Board, a Navy Board, a Treasury Board, a Commercial 
Board, and a Committee of Foreign Affairs, who have no other time to 
do their business but in the recess of Congress. These Boards are at 
present almost wholly composed of members of Congress. Some of them 
meet at six in the morning, and sit till eight constantly every day ; others 
meet at five in the afternoon, or immediately after they dine, and sit 
till night, and sometimes till late. I believe there are but very few 
members but what are employed in some of these ways, so that those 
who do their duty have not much leisure to spare. 

; The debates in the House are similar to those in the British House 
of Commons. There are here, as in most other assemblies, some very 
could have been, and where I was not, is a thing 
which will seem as extraordinary to you as it seems 
so to myself. After a long journey, and a longer 
stay from home (I mean from head-quarters), the 
only satisfactory day I have, finds me in the middle 
of a town. There I had been sent, pushed, hurried, 
by the Board of General Officers, and principally by 
Generals Sullivan and Greene, who thought I should 
be of great use to the common cause, and to whom 
I foretold the disagreeable event which would happen to me. I felt, on that occasion, the impression of 
that bad star, which, some days ago, has influenced 
the French undertakings, and which, I hope, will 
soon be removed. People say that I don t want an 
action ; but, if it is not necessary to my reputation 
as a tolerable private soldier, it would, at least, add 
to my satisfaction and pleasure. However, I was 

sensible speakers, and some very loud talkers. You may make one ex 
ception, and then conceive a House composed of very able, sensible gen 
tlemen, but belonging to different States, whose laws, manners, genius 
of the inhabitants, and indeed almost every thing else, are very differ 
ent." 

Mr. Hosmer, another Delegate from Connecticut, wrote as follows to 
Governor Trumbull, on the 31st of August. 

" I wish I could with truth assure your Excellency that, in my view, 
our affairs are in a happy train, and that Congress has adopted wise and 
effectual measures to restore our wounded public credit, and to establish 
the United States, their liberty, union, and happiness, upon a solid and 
permanent foundation. I dare not do it, while my heart is overwhelmed 
with the most melancholy presages. The idleness and captiousness of 
some gentlemen, maugre the wishes and endeavours of an honest and 
industrious majority, in my apprehension, threaten the worst conse 
quences. The Southern States are fixed against holding Congress more 
than once a day. Our hours are fixed from nine in the forenoon to two 
in the afternoon. If these were punctually attended, it would be, per 
haps, as much as could be spared from Committees, and other busi 
ness which must be done out of Congress hours. Nine States make a 
Congress. Some States have Delegates so very negligent, so much immersed in the pursuit of pleasure or business, that it is very rare we 
can make a Congress before near eleven o clock; and this evil seems 

17* 
happy enough to arrive before the second retreat; it 
was not attended with such trouble and danger as it 
would have been, had not the enemy been so sleepy. 
I was thus once more deprived of my fighting ex 
pectations. 

From what I have heard, from sensible and candid 
French gentlemen, the action docs great honor to 
General Sullivan; he retreated in good order; he op 
posed very properly every effort of the enemy; he 
never sent troops but well supported; and displayed 
great coolness during the whole day. The evacuation 
I have seen extremely well performed; and my pri 
vate opinion is, that, if both events are satisfactory 
to us, they are very shameful to the British Generals and troops they had, indeed, so many finechances to cut us to pieces ; but they are very good 
people. 

Now, my dear General, I must give you an ac 
count of that journey for which I have paid so dear. 
The Count d Estaing arrived the day before in Boston. I found him much displeased at a protest, of 

incapable of a remedy, as Congress has no means to compel gentlemen s 
attendance, and those who occasionally delay are callous to admonition 
and reproof, which have been often tried in vain. 

" When we are assembled, several gentlemen have such a knack of 
starting questions of order, raising debates upon critical, captious, and 
trifling amendments, protracting them by long speeches, by postponing, 
calling for the previous question, and other arts, that it is almost impossible to get an important question decided at one sitting, and if it is 
put over to another day, the field is open to be gone over auain, precious time is lost, and the public business left undone. I am sorry to 
add, that the opposition between States, the old prejudices of north 
against south, and south against north, seem to be reviving, and are 
industriously heightened by some who, I fear, would be but too well 
pleased to see our Union blasted, and our independence broken and 
destroyed. 

" I wish what I have written may not seem too much like complaining of Congress ; but, besides that I am sure it is a just picture of ourpresent situation, when I look back and see how little has been done


THE AMEKICAN REVOLUTION. 199 

which you have heard, and many other circumstances 
which I have reported to you. I did what I could 
on the occasion ; but I must do the Admiral the jus 
tice to say, that it has not at all diminished his 
warm desire of serving America. We waited together 
on the Council, General Heath and General Hancock, 
and were very well satisfied with them. The last onedistinguished himself very much by his zeal on the 
occasion. Some people in Boston were rather dissa 
tisfied ; but when they saw the behaviour of the Council, Generals Heath and Hancock, they, I hope, will 
do the same ; I therefore fear nothing but delays. 
The masts are very far off; provisions difficult to be 
provided. The Count d Estaing was ready to come 
with his land forces, and put himself under General 
Sullivan s orders, though dissatisfied with the latter; 
but our new circumstances will alter that design. 

I beg you will pardon me once more, my dearGeneral, for having troubled and afflicted you with 
the account of what I had seen after the departure 
of the French fleet. My confidence in you is such, 
that I could not feel so warmly upon this point 
without communicating it to your Excellency. I 
have now the pleasure to inform you that the clis
since I came here, and consider how much there was to do, and the 
vast importance that it should be done without loss of time, I feel my 
self under an obligation to account for my own conduct, among others, 
and can think of no better way to do it, than by telling the truth; 
which I do the more freely, because I can appeal to every gentleman in 
Congress, whether any blame rests upon Connecticut, whether she has 
ever been an hour unrepresented, or whether any time hath been lost 
by the remissness, or captiousness, or long-windedness of her Delegates. 
Besides, though while hopes of a speedy reform prevailed, I thought it 
prudent to be silent, now those hopes have vanished, I thought it best, 
and my duty, to state our real, though unhappy situation to your Ex 
cellency, that we might have the benefit of your wisdom and advice in 
concerting proper measures to retrieve us from the unhappy lethargy 
(shall I call it frenzy?) into whicli we have fallen." 
content does not appear so great. The French hos 
pital is arrived at Boston, though under difficulties, 
which, however, I think I have diminished a good 
deal by sending part of my family, with orders to 
some persons, and entreaties to others, to give them 
all the assistance in their power. Now, every thing 
will be right, provided the Count d Estaing is enabled 
to sail soon. Every exertion, I think, ought to be 
employed for that purpose in all the several parts of 
the Continent; masts, biscuit, water, and provisions 
are his wants. I long to see that we have again the 
command, or at least an equal force, upon the Ame 
rican seas. 

By your letters to General Sullivan, I apprehend 
that there is some general move in the British army, 
and that your Excellency is going to send us reenforcements. God grant you may send us as many 
as, with the militia, will make a larger army, that 
you might command them yourself! I long, my dearGenera], to be again with you, and to have the 
pleasure of cooperating with the French fleet under 
your immediate orders. This will be the greatest I 
can feel; I am sure every thing will then be right. 
The Count d Estaing (if Rhode Island is again to be 
taken, which I ardently wish) would be extremely 
happy to take it in conjunction with General Washington, and it would remove the other inconve 
niences. 

I am now intrusted, by General Sullivan, with the 
care of Warren, Bristol, and the Eastern Shore. 1 am 
to defend a country with very few troops, who are 
not able to defend more than a single point. I can 
not answer that the enemy won t go and do what 
they please, for I am not able to prevent them, only 
with a part of their army, and yet this part must 
not land far from me. But I answer, that, if they 
come with equal or not very superior forces to those 
I may collect, we shall flog them pretty well ; at 
least I hope so. My situation seems to be uncertain, for we expect to hear soon from your Excel 
lency. You know Mr. Tousard, a gentleman of my 
family. He met with a terrible accident in the last 
action ; running before all the others, to take a piece 
of cannon in the midst of the enemy, with the greatest excess of bravery, he was immediately covered 
with their shots, had his horse killed, and his right 
arm shattered to pieces. He was happy enough not 
to fall into their hands ; his life is not despaired of. 
Congress was going to send him a commission of 
Major. 

Give me joy, my dear General. I intend to have 
your picture, and Mr. Hancock has promised me a 
copy of that he has in Boston. He gave one to 
Count d Estaing, and I never saw a man so glad at 
possessing his sweetheart s picture, as the Admiral 
was to receive yours. 

In expecting, with the greatest impatience, to hearfrom your Excellency as to what are to be the general plans, and your private movements, I have the 
honor to be, with the highest respect, the warmest 
and most endless affection, dear General, &c., 

LAFAYETTE. 



FROM COLONEL LAURENS. 
(Private.) 

Providence, 2 September, 1778. 

SIR, 

I had the honor of writing to your Excellency previous to the action of the 29th. My letter was committed to the care of Major Gibbs, and he destroyed 
it as soon as the engagement commenced, to guard 
against accidents. As your Excellency has already 
received minute accounts of the transactions of that 
day from those who saw them in a more collective 
view than the nature of my command afforded me. 
any further relation is rendered unnecessary. I shall 
confine myself, therefore, to congratulating your Excel 
lency on the happy termination of an expedition, 
which at one period was threatened with the most 
tragical catastrophe. The advantages gained in the 
affair of Portsmouth, and the brilliant retreat which 
succeeded it, by doing honor to the American arms, 
consoled us in some degree for the loss of our grand 
object. 

The movements which your Excellency has observed at New York, the arrival of seventy sail of vessels 
in the road of Newport, the appearance of twenty 
sail off Boston, are circumstances which keep us in 
suspense with respect to the enemy s intentions. Ge 
neral Greene has requested that I would remain in 
this quarter till they can be interpreted. In the mean 
time, he agrees with me, that if the enemy mean to 
act offensively here, a few days % preparation will be 
required. I have thought it incumbent on me. as 
part of the commission with which your Excellency 
honored me, to wait on Count d Estaing, and ask if 
he has any despatches for head-quarters. It will be 
my greatest happiness if I can be useful in explaining the causes of mutual jealousy and uneasiness 
which have existed between the officers of the allied 
powers here, and be any ways instrumental in restoring that harmony which the common interest re 
quires. 

I foretold, to the Marquis, the influence which the 
Count s departure from the road of Newport would 
probably have upon the minds of the people, and the 
danger of its reviving those absurd prejudices which 
we inherited from the British nation. Unhappily the 
mischief has become more extensive by the unguarded expressions of some men of rank, who listened to 
their chagrin rather than good policy. Reflection, 
however, begins to induce a more cautious behaviour, 
and I am in hopes that the confidence of the people 
in our new allies will be restored. 

The Count s sensibility was much wounded by the 
manner in which the protest was delivered to him. 
In a letter to General Sullivan he declares, that this 
paper imposed on the Commander of the King s 
squadron the painful but necessary law of profound 
silence ; that he had taken occasion, however, rela 
tively to some other business, to acquaint him, that, if 
the Council of Boston accepted his offer (which was 
to repair to Rhode Island at the head of his land 
troops, and receive General Sullivan s orders), he 
would promise the most implicit obedience on the 
part of his troops, and set them the example of it ; 
that the extreme sensibility, which composed the 
French national character, in every thing that relates 
to their honor, required that the French Commanderin-chief should, by his sentiments for the American 
General, and by a conspicuous measure, announce that 
French delicacy could not be wounded in a moment 
of passion, which arose from disappointment, felt alike 
by both parties. In a postscript he requested that 
the Marquis de la Fayette may explain matters be 
tween them. The expressions of the Count s letter 
are rather obscure; but, by discovering an inclination 
to make great personal sacrifices, it is, in my opinion, 
a foundation for restoring harmony and a good understanding. General Sullivan s answer, I hope, will 
improve it. I have the honor to be, with the greatest attachment and respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

JOHN LAUREXS. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SULLIVAN. 

Providence, 3 September, 1778. 

Mr DEAR GENERAL, 

I had last night the honor of receiving your Excel 
lency s favor of the 1st instant, and impatiently wait 
your Excellency s sentiments on the steps I have 
taken since the 29th ultimo, an account of which has 
been transmitted by Major Morris. 

The justice of the observations, in your Excel 
lency s letter, respecting the departure of the French 
fleet, are so obvious, that, if a consciousness of my 
duty to yield implicit obedience to your Excellency s 
commands did not ever make that obedience a plea 
sure, the reasoning alone must have pointed out 
the part I have to act. I have the pleasure to in 
form your Excellency, that, though the first struggles 
of passion on so important a disappointment were 
scarcely to be restrained, yet, in a few days, by taking advantage of the subsiding passion, I found means 
to restore the former harmony between the American 
and French officers of the army. The Count d Estaing 
and myself are in the same friendship as heretofore. 
The reason of the protest has been explained to him, 
and he is now perfectly satisfied. He has offered to 
come on with his land forces, and do every thing 
which I may request of him and his troops ; but this 
step has become unnecessary. 
The reason of drawing the protest was this; The 
Count himself wished to remain with us, but was, by 
his Captains, overruled in Council. As deviating from 
the voice of his Council would be attended with ill 
consequences to him in case of misfortune, it was 
supposed that the protest might justify his deviating 
from the voice of his Council, and acting a part 
agreeable to his own sentiments, and those of the co 
operating army. Prudence dictated it as our duty to 
keep it secret from all but him, your Excellency, 
and the Congress ; and no publication of it was ever 
thought of on our part ; and your Excellency may 
rely on my exertions to prevent it. Every thing in 
my power shall be done for repairing the injury sus 
tained by the French fleet. 

The fleet off Boston harbour, of which I gave yourExcellency an account yesterday, are eight ships of 
the line, ten frigates, one sloop, and a schooner. 
There can be no doubt of its being Lord Howe s fleet, 
watching the motions of the French fleet, to facilitate 
the relief of Rhode Island, and perhaps to cover the 
retreat of the British army from Rhode Island and 
New York, to other places where they are more 
needed. Those ships were out of sight yesterday 
morning at eight o clock, but I hear they afterwards 
hove in sight again. The report here is, that six 
thousand troops have arrived at Newport. I know 
they are numerous, but cannot as yet ascertain the 
number. Your Excellency will please transmit a copy 
of this letter to Congress ; and believe me to be, with 
every sentiment of gratitude, respect, and esteem, 
your Excellency s 

Most obedient and very humble servant, 

JOHN SULLIVAN. 

VOL. II. 18 
FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Boston, 16 September, 1778. 

SIR, 

The growing extravagance of the people, and the 
increasing demand for the article of forage in this 
quarter, have become a very alarming affair. Hay is 
from sixty to eighty dollars a ton, and upon the 
rise.* Corn is ten dollars a bushel, and oats four; 
and every thing else, that will answer for forage, in 
that proportion. Carting is nine shillings a mile by 
the ton, and people much dissatisfied with the price. 
I have represented to the States of Rhode Island 
and Connecticut the absolute necessity of legislative 
interposition, to settle the prices of things upon some 
reasonable footing, of all such articles and services as 
are necessary for the use of the public in my department. I am going to do the same to the Council of this State. What effect it will have, I cannot 
say; but, if there is not something done to check 
the extravagance of the people, there are no funds 
in the universe that will equal the expense. 

The late affray that happened in this place, be 
tween the people of the town and those of the fleet, 
has been found to originate from a parcel of soldiers 
belonging to the Convention troops, and a party of 
British sailors which were engaged on board a priva 
teer. The secret enemies to our cause, and the British officers in the neighbourhood of this place, are 
endeavouring to sow the seeds of discord as much as 



* Continental currency. At this time, the Continental money passed 
in Massachusetts at the rate of somewhat more than six paper dol 
lars for one silver dollar, and prices of course rose in the same pro 
portion. See Felt s Historical Account of the Massachusetts Currency, 
p. 186. 
possible between the inhabitants of the place and the 
French belonging to the fleet. The French officers are 
well satisfied this is the state of the case, and it 
fills them with double resentment against the British. 
The Admiral and all the French officers are now 
upon an exceeding good footing with the gentlemen 
of the town. General Hancock takes unwearied pains 
to promote a good understanding with the French 
officers. His house is full from morning till night. 

I had a letter from the Marquis, day before yester 
day. He writes me he is endeavouring to represent 
every thing in the most favorable colors to the Court 
of France, in order to wipe away the prejudices that 
the letters of some of the more indiscreet may make 
upon that Court, All the French officers are extrava 
gantly fond of your Excellency; but the Admiral 
more so than any of the rest. They all speak of you 
with the highest reverence and respect. General 
Hancock made the Admiral a present of your picture. 
He was going to receive it on board the fleet by 
the firing a royal salute. But General Hancock 
thought it might furnish a handle for some of the 
speculative politicians to remark the danger of cha 
racters becoming too important. He therefore dissuaded the Admiral from carrying the matter into 
execution. 

I find, by your Excellency s letter to General Sul 
livan, that you expect the enemy are going to eva 
cuate New York, and that it is probable they are 
coming eastward. I can hardly think they mean to 
make an attempt upon Boston, notwithstanding the 
object is important; and, unless they attack Boston, 
there is no other object worthy their attention in 
New England. I am rather inclined to think they 
mean to leave the United States altogether. What 
they hold here now, they hold at a great risk and 
expense. But, suppose they actually intend to quit 
the Continent, they will endeavour to mislead ourattention, and that of our allies, until they can get 
clear of the coast. The Admiral is fortifying for the 
security of his fleet; but I am told his batteries are 
all open in the rear, which will be but a poor secu 
rity against a land force. General Heath thinks 
there ought to be some Continental troops sent here : 
but the Council will not turn out the militia; they 
are so confident the enemy are not coming here. If 
your Excellency thinks the enemy really design an 
attack upon Boston, it may not be useless for you 
to write your opinion to the Council Board, for I 
suspect they think the General here has taken the 
alarm without sufficient reasons. The fortifications 
round this place are very incomplete, and little or 
nothing doing upon them. I have given General 
Heath my opinion what parts to take possession of, 
if the enemy should attempt the place before the 
Continental army gets up. From four to five hundred troops have arrived at Halifax; their collective 
strength will make a formidable army. 

I wish to know your Excellency s pleasure about 
my returning to camp. I expect Mrs. Greene will 
be put to bed every day. She is very desirous of 
my stay until that event; and, as she has set her 
heart so much upon it, I could wish to gratify her, 
for fear of some disagreeable consequences, as women 
sometimes, under such circumstances, receive great 
injury by being disappointed. 

General Sullivan granted me leave to come here 
upon the business of my department. I expect to 
return in a few days. Major Gibbs is with me, and 
is going to Portsmouth. 
This is the third letter I have wrote since I have 
had a line from your Excellency. Should be glad to 
hear from you when at leisure. 

I am your Excellency s obedient servant, 

NATHANAEL GREENE. 



FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Camp, near Warren, 24 September, 1778. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

I am going to consult your Excellency upon a 
point, in which I not only want your leave and opinion, as the Commander-in-chief, but also your candid 
advice, as the man whom I have the happiness to 
call my friend. In an address from the British Com 
missioners to Congress, the first after Johnstone was 
excluded, they speak in the most disrespectful terms 
of my nation and country.* The whole is under 
signed by them, and more particularly by the Presi 
dent, Lord Carlisle. I am the first French officer in 
rank of the American Army; I am not unknown to 
the British; and if somebody must take notice of 
such expressions, that advantage does, I believe, be 
long to me. Don t you think, my dear General, that 
I should do well to write a letter on the subject to 

* The British Commissioners had said, alluding to France, " They 
remain astonished at the calamities in which the unhappy people of 
these Colonies continue to be involved, from the blind deference 
which their leaders profess towards a power that has ever shown 
itself an enemy to all civil and religious liberty, and whose offers, his 
Majesty s Commissioners must repeat, whatever may be the pretended 
date and present form of them, were made only in consequence of 
the plan of accommodation concerted in Great Britain, and with a 
view to prevent the reconciliation proposed, and to prolong this destructive war." 

18* 
Lord Carlisle, wherein I should notice his expressions 
conveyed in an unfriendly manner? I have men 
tioned something of this design to the Count d Estaing, but wish entirely to fix niy opinion by yours, 
which I instantly beg, as soon as you may find it 
convenient. 

As every thing is perfectly quiet, and General Sul 
livan is persuaded that I may, with all safety, go to 
Boston, I am going to undertake a short journey to 
wards that place. The Admiral has several times 
expressed a desire of conversing with me ; he has 
also thrown out some wishes that something might 
be done towards securing Boston; but it seems he 
always refers to a conversation for further explana 
tion. My stay will be short, as I don t like towns, 
in time of war, w r hen I may be about a camp. If 
your Excellency answers me immediately, I may 
soon receive your letter. 

I want much to see you, my dear General, and 
consult you about many points; part of them are re 
specting myself. If you approve of my writing to 
Lord Carlisle, it would be a reason for coming nearyou for a short time/ in case the gentleman is displeased with my mission. 

With the most perfect respect, confidence, and affection, I have the honor to be, &c., 

LAFAYETTE.* 



* The proposed challenge was entirely disapproved by Washington, 
in his answer to the above letter. (Washington s Writings, Vol. VI. 
p. 78.) But the challenge was sent, and it was properly declined by 
the Earl of Carlisle, on the ground that he was " solely responsible 
to his country and king, and not to any individual, for his public 
conduct and language." 
FROM COLONEL OTHO H. WILLIAMS. 

Paramus, Monday, 26 September, 1778. 

I am exceeding sorry to be the author of bad 
news; but lest a more imperfect account should reach 
head-quarters, I think it my duty to acquaint yourExcellency of the misfortune sustained by Colonel 
Baylor s corps. Early on Sunday, the Colonel re 
moved with his regiment from Paramus to Harring 
ton, a small place two or three miles from Tappan, 
and took quarters. Between three and four this 
morning, the enemy, conducted by a number of the 
inhabitants, surrounded his pickets and effectually surprised the whole regiment. At eleven o clock (the 
hour of writing this) Captain Stith, a sergeant, and 
twelve or thirteen men, who escaped, have arrived at 
this place. Captain Stith says, being surprised at 
his quarters, he ran out of the house, and seeing, or 
rather hearing a body of horse, which he took for 
his own troop, he ordered them to form, adding, the 
British troops are near us. He was instantly at 
tacked, and finding himself surrounded, asked for 
quarter, which they refused; he then fired his pistol 
and escaped. 

About sunrise we heard a very brisk fire, for a few 
minutes, at Tappan, supposed to be a feeble resist 
ance of the militia at that place. Some of the 
wounded, just arrived, say that the enemy did not 
stay to take away the horses which were in the sta 
bles; that they saw about twenty of Colonel Baylor s 
horsemen killed, and about twelve or fourteen mor 
tally wounded with bayonets. A party is just goneto bring off the wounded and horses, if possible ; and 
other parties are sent to discover the route and numbers of the enemy. Captain Stith says they were in 
great force, but as it was dark, he could not form 
any opinion of their numbers. He thinks Colonel 
Baylor and Major Clough are certainly taken, as he 
saw the British troops at their quarters, which were 
near his own. It is possible, he says, that some of 
the officers on their right may have escaped towards 
Kakiat, to which place the enemy were directing 
their march by the last accounts. 

I came to the Jerseys with a view of relieving a 
friend from captivity, and have had the happiness to 
meet him, with a number of others, about forty, who 
were exchanged this day week. Several are now waiting, at Morristown, a favorable opportunity to pay their 
duty at head-quarters. Coining here on my way to 
camp, at this critical time, Major Pell, who commands 
at this place, has done me the honor to advise with 
me what measures are most eligible for him to adopt. 
The sick, and the few stores he had, are sent towards 
Pompton. He will continue to be near the enemy, 
but, as his party is weak, will be under the neces 
sity of changing his post often, to elude the treache 
ry of the inhabitants. r General Winds has taken post, 
with about one thousand militia, on an eminence 
near Hackinsac. I cannot learn that General Max 
well has moved from Elizabethtown. Many reports 
are, that the enemy have landed there, and at New 
ark ; but the last and best accounts contradict them. 

I intend to join my regiment to-morrow, as I can 
not be of any further service to Major Pell, who is 
active and vigilant. Your Excellency s 

Most obedient, humble servant, 

OTHO II. WILLIAMS.*

ber, as follows. 

" I am this moment returned from the enemy s pickets, where I went 
FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Boston, 28 September, 1778. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

The news I have got from France, the reflections 
I have made by myself, and those which have been 
suggested to me by many people, particularly by the 
Admiral, increase more than ever the desire I had 
of seeing again your Excellency. I want to commu 
nicate to you my sentiments, and take your opinion 
upon my present circumstances. I look upon this as 
of high moment to my private interests. On the 



to ask permission to remain with the wounded at this place. I found 
the picket (a subaltern and twenty) about two miles below this, but understood that they have parties on all the roads leading to Hackinsac, 
that have no fixed station, but patrol constantly. The first battalion of 
light infantry is close in the rear of their pickets. 

" The wounded left here are, Colonel Baylor, the Surgeon, and oneprivate of his regiment, a militia-man, and an old man seventy-threeyears of age, a resident; whom, besides shooting him through the thigh, 
they severely beat. Major Clough died yesterday morning, and this day 
was buried. Colonel Baylor has a wound in his thigh with a bayonet, 
another in his groin, and several cuts in his hand with a broadsword. 
I do not think that any of his wounds are very dangerous ; his intes 
tines are free from injury. He is in good spirits, and free from all bad 
symptoms. His patrols were taken, which occasioned his being surprised. Dr. Crosby was here an hour ago, and tells me that, besides 
the men that you have seen escaped, sixteen have come into Paramus, most of them wounded ; two are since dead. 

" I understand, from Sir James Manning, who commands the in 
fantry, that they are soon to quit Jersey, and that Sir Henry Clin 
ton and Lord Cornwallis are both returned to New York. The officer that commanded the picket told me, that Sir James Wallace 
came express from New York to the General, and that a picket was 
arrived. He did not mention any news; and I think he would 
not have concealed it, if he had any to tell that was favorable to 
them. 

" I did not obtain the permission I desired. Sir James desired I 
would come to their pickets to-morrow, and he would have it ready 
with such necessaries as Colonel Baylor was in need of." 
other hand, I have some ideas, and some intelligence 
in reference to public interests, which I am very desirous of disclosing to your Excellency. I am sure, 
my dear General, that your sentiments upon my pri 
vate concerns are such, that you will have no objec 
tion to my spending some hours with you. 

The moment at which the fleet will be ready is 
not very far, and I think it of importance to have 
settled my affair with you before that time. I am 
going to write to General Sullivan on the subject, 
and, if he has no objection, I ll go immediately to 
head-quarters; but should he make difficulties, I beg 
you will send me that leave. I intend to ride ex 
press, in order that I may have time enough. You 
may think, my dear General, that I don t ask, what 
I never asked in my life a leave to quit the post 
I am sent to without strong reasons for it; but the 
letters I have received from home make me very 
anxious to see you. 

With the most tender affection and highest re 
spect, &c., 

LAFAYETTE. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GATES. 

Danbuiy, 30 September, 1778. 

SIR, 

I am this moment honored with the receipt of yourExcellency s letter of to-day s date. 

I am sorry for the disgrace we have suffered in 
the Jerseys; but imagine that the enemy take ad 
vantage of the supine ness that constantly seizes ourpeople, w r hen they have been long unmolested. This 
is an evil, that even the best officers cannot remedy. 
General McDougall s division will be put upon 
the march immediately, as your Excellency has commanded. 

Your Excellency will excuse me when I say, I like 
not the divided state of your army. The enemy are 
upon the qui-vive ; they have the advantages of a 
river, to navigate upon each of our flanks. To divideis to conquer, in politics. I hope it may not, with 
regard to us, prove so in the war. 

I hope Lord Stirling and General Maxwell will an 
swer all your Excellency s expectations in the Jerseys ; they certainly are best acquainted with that 
country. 

Inclosed is a letter I have this moment received 
from Major Tallmadge. Your Excellency will please 
to order Colonel Pettit to supply the necessary articles. I am, Sir, your Excellency s 

Most obedient, humble servant, 

HORATIO GATES. 



FROM RICHARD HENRY LEE. 

Philadelphia, 5 October, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

I hope the measures you have taken will be effect 
ual to the purpose of reenlisting the army, because 
it is an object of great importance; and I readily 
admit the propriety of first trying those methods 
which promise fewest ill consequences. Danger will 
only arise from pressing such too far, and urging 
the experiment too long. I very much fear, Sir, that 
the knowledge of depreciation has reached the most 
uninformed, and, therefore, that every evil which can, 
will happen to us from this cause. But I am not 
without hope that such measures will be adopted as 
may, before it is too late, restore our currency to its 
proper value. 

It is, indeed, no easy matter to judge of the designs of the enemy. They have created to themselves 
a great choice of difficulties. I "believe they would 
willingly change their war of conquest to one of re 
venge altogether ; but revenge must be postponed to 
safety. General Clinton s army is the only hope of 
Canada, Nova Scotia, the Floridas, the West Indies, 
and, I may safely add, much so of Great Britain and 
Ireland. Whilst this is the case, although Boston, in 
its present situation, is a very tempting object, I can 
not think they will undertake it. However, what 
can be attempted, may be attempted, and wisdom 
points to precaution. If it be true, and our inform 
ation comes pretty direct, that Dominica has fallen, 
that Jamaica and St. Kitts are in jeopardy, and that 
Keppel has fled from the fleet of France, we may sup 
pose that our enemies can make no long stay with 
us. Distance and land-carriage distress us greatly in 
the article of bread provision- to which is added an 
artificial scarcity, created in the midst of plenty, by 
an infamous set of engrossers, who have raised the 
price of flour from four dollars a hundred to five 
and six pounds. I hope the measures we are taking 
with these gentry will make them suffer in a way 
most hurtful to them. 

Mr. Eustis had quitted this city before your letter 
came to hand, and as he is gone to the army, I have 
inclosed the letter in this. I am, with much esteem 
and regard, dear Sir, your most obedient and very 
humble servant, 

RICHARD HENRY LEE. 
FROM COLONEL LAMBERT CADWALADER.* 

Philadelphia, 7 October, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

A few days since, I received your Excellency s 
letter in Maryland, dated White Plains, inclosing onefrom the Commissioners of Arrangement, respecting 
my not performing the duties incident to my station, 
and desiring I may be ordered to my regiment, with.out being previously exchanged ; and that, in case 
of refusal, there would be a vacancy, to which an 
active officer might be entitled to succeed. 

The motives, which seem chiefly to have influenced 
them in their determination, are, first, the complaints 
of the officers in the Pennsylvania line ; secondly, 
that I am under no obligation, from the terms of 
my enlargement, not to act against the enemy with 
out returning an officer of the same rank ; and, third 
ly, that I have, in no instance since my liberation, 
been considered in the light of a prisoner of war by 
the enemy. 

Although no definitive steps with respect to me, as 
I am informed, have been taken, yet I cannot but 
look upon it as a hardship, that the Commission 
ers should undertake to pass sentence without affording me an opportunity of representing the rea 
sons which have induced me to observe a line of 
conduct so contrary to their opinion and judgment. 
This circumstance, I hope, will plead my excuse for 
troubling your Excellency with the motives and prin 
ciples which have directed my conduct in a case so 

* Colonel Cadwalader had been taken prisoner at the assault on Fort, 
Washington, in November, 1776. See Washington s Writings, Vol. IV. 
p. 188. 

VOL. II. 19 
new and uncommon; and which, I trust, will have 
the desired effect with the Commissioners. 

As soon as I was known, after 1 was made prison 
er, I Avas treated with the utmost politeness and hu 
manity by the enemy; and General Prescott having 
applied to General Howe in iny behalf, from a high 
sense of some civilities shown by my father, procured me my liberty without parole. It was an act of 
generosity, which I felt very sensibly, but the offer 
I did not accept, although I had the opinions of some 
officers who were near me in favor of it. 

The idea I entertained of my situation was, that a 
compliment of the highest nature was paid me in 
the manner of liberating me, and that the point of 
honor of sending in an equivalent before I took an 
active part in the army was left to me. Some few. 
however, when I returned home, being of opinion I 
might instantly join the army without an exchange. 
I thought proper to apply to General Gates, who was 
then in town, and advise with him, he being an old 
officer, and one who had been bred in a military 
school. He replied, he would give his opinion as a 
man of honor and my friend, and that, was he in my 
situation, he would not act before he was exchanged. 

About this time I received your Excellency s let 
ter, making me an offer of sending in to General 
Prescott to fix upon some friend of his, who was 
prisoner among us, to be returned to them on the 
same terms on which I was set at liberty. 

This I most joyfully and thankfully accepted, as a 
mode which would remove every difficulty on my 
part, and place me on an equal footing with the 
other officers of the army. But an order to take up 
all the Field-Officers in our possession, and confinethem, in retaliation of the hard usage of General Lee 
prevented its taking place. 
I then ventured so far to trespass on your good 
ness as to propose sending in such a number of in 
ferior officers as would be equivalent to my rank in 
the army, which, as I have been informed, is a 
usual article in the cartels of Europe. 

This, as far as I recollect, you wrote me was 
out of your power, and inconsistent with the cartel 
settled between the two armies, and could not be 
done. I then thought I had nothing to do but wait 
my exchange in course. 

Some officers of the British army, taken at Prince 
ton, as my brother informed me, having mistaken 
him for me, and heard I was with the army again, 
publicly declared, if I was taken prisoner by the 
enemy, they would have put me to death. 

Sir William Erskine s opinion, given to Colonel 
Fitzgerald at Brunswic, after the above, was, that 
I was perfectly free to take an active part without 
exchange. But, since the evacuation of Philadelphia, 
happening at the City Tavern, in conversation with 
Mr. Willing, he told me that General Howe had ex 
pressed his opinion with respect to me, in the fullest manner ; and, in doing this, his surprise I should 
take an active part without being exchanged. Mr. 
Willing told him he had been misinformed, for that 
he knew I had not joined the army. General Howe 
then instanced my forcing some recruits for the regi 
ment, who had mutinied on board a shallop in this 
city. Mr. Willing said, if I had fallen into their 
hands they would have treated me with great rigor. 

It is unnecessary to mention to your Excellency 
the opinions of a great number of gentlemen in and 
out of the army, corresponding with my own, on the 
manner of my being set at liberty, because I did it 
in a former letter. I did not think it necessary to 
trouble you with every incident, as it fell out, rela 
tive to me, but the conversation between Mr. Willing 
and General Howe is, I believe, quite new to you. 

Whenever I join the army, I hope to be put on a 
footing with the other officers in it; nor can it be 
expected that I should run the hazard of having the 
propriety of my conduct, in case of falling into the 
enemy s hands, made a subject of discussion for a 
Court-Martial, or what is worse, perhaps, for a whimsical, capricious commanding officer, disposed to take 
advantage of ex parte evidence, or to receive the 
mere say-so of any man who may expect to advance 
his interest by showing his rancor against me. 

Having thus stated to your Excellency the motives 
and reasons, on which my conduct has been formed, 
I must beg leave to persist in it, notwithstanding the 
interested discourses of some officers in the Pennsyl 
vania line. 

I have derived no emolument of any kind from 
the public, since I have been in my present situation. My view has been to serve in the army till 
our affairs should wear a favorable appearance, and 
then to quit it, but to apply for a command, if we 
should be again threatened ; and I hope I shall not 
be precluded from this privilege by any partial determination of the Commissioners of Arrangement : 
as it is, and ever has been, my fixed principle that 
it is better not to be, than survive the loss of those 
blessings which are the objects of this contest and 
be a witness of the dreadful scenes which would pro 
bably be acted in this country on so unfortunate an 
occasion. I have the honor to be, with the greatest 
respect and regard, 

Your most obedient servant, 

LAMBERT CADWALADER. 



TPIE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 221 

FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 10 October, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

An accident, which has very seldom happened to 
me in the course of thirty years business, has deprived me of the honor of making an earlier, and 
puts it out of my power even now to make a more 
proper acknowledgment of three of your Excellency s 
favors, which I remember to have been indebted for, 
antecedent to the receipt of this of the 3d instant, 
which now lies before me. Those, in removing my 
desks and their contents from one part of the house 
to a more convenient, I have mislaid among my pri 
vate papers, and, after as much search at different 
times, and particularly this morning, as the fleeting 
and pressing moments which I dare borrow from 
public attentions have permitted me to make, remain 
undiscovered, although I am sure they are safe in a 
wrong class. 

I recollect, however, and shall never forget, a new 
obligation, which, in one of them, your Excellency 
was pleased to lay on me by a very kind notice of 
my son s behaviour at Rhode Island, and that you 
had returned the gold which I sent to head-quarters, 
by Jones, and also the letters of Governor Johnstone, 
Mr. Oswald, and Mr. Manning. In the present cir 
cumstances of Great Britain, rendered deplorable by 
the waste of another campaign on this Continent, by 
the loss of Dominique, in the West Indies, and of 
a great marine battle at her own doors, it is exceedingly difficult to determine what will be her next 
step, although I do not think it is to see the only 
measures remaining for her salvation. 

With respect to South Carolina, I cannot yet treat 
19* 
the idea of an attack, as altogether chimerical. I 
am well warranted to say the British Administration 
held that State and Georgia in reserve, for a stroke 
of necessity, which might, at any time, be made with 
success, and they well know the immense value of 
those States, and great things may be done by drawing their forces to one point. They may, indeed, 
have stayed a day too late. Be that as it will, I 
have fully advertised my countrymen; and, if the 
alarm, shall prove to have been unnecessarily sounded, 
their intermediate exertions towards a defence will 
do them no real injury. Congress have ordered the 
proceedings of the Court-Martial on Major-General 
St. Clair to be printed, and have appointed Friday, 
the 16th, for considering and determining on those 
of the Court on Major-General Lee. 

I have nothing further to offer at present, Sir, but 
the repeated assurances of being, with the highest 
sense of esteem and respect, your Excellency s 
Most obedient and most humble servant, 

HENRY LAURENS. 



FROM COLONEL BAYLOR. 

19 October, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

You have been informed of my unfortunate surprise 
of the 28th ultimo, and, I make no doubt, of the cir 
cumstances ; but I think it my duty to make them 
known to you, and at the same time to justify my 
conduct. 

On the 26th of September I was at Paramus with 
the regiment, where we had been four days. I di 
rected Major Clough, on the 26th, to send the Quarter-master out to provide quarters for the regiment 
within four or five miles of Paramus, and at the 
same distance from the enemy that we then were, 
and at the same time gave him my reasons for so 
doing; which he approved of. They were, that I 
was apprehensive that the enemy would, if we re 
mained more than three or four days in one place, 
attempt what they executed in two days afterwards. 

On the morning of the 27th, I marched the regi 
ment to the quarters provided for us at Harrington, 
and made it my business, the moment I arrived 
there, to make every necessary inquiry about the 
roads leading from the enemy s encampment to ourquarters, and also went out and examined the country myself. I was of opinion it was the most secure 
place I could have stationed myself in, and that it 
was convenient to gain the earliest intelligence of the 
movement of the enemy, as it would have been had 
they not received the most particular intelligence of 
our guard and patrol. 

There were two roads leading from the enemy s 
camp to our quarters, one on each side of the Hackinsac River. They joined at a bridge, at half a mile 
distance from our quarters, where I myself fixed a 
guard, of a sergeant and twelve men, with particularorders to keep a patrol of two men out on each of 
these roads constantly. They were to patrol a mile 
below the guard, and to be relieved every hour. The 
guard were ordered to keep the strictest look-out on 
the bridge; and I have reason to believe that these 
orders were punctually obeyed. 

On the 28th, early in the morning, the enemy 
marched up on the west side of the Hackinsac River, 
within half a mile of the distance the patrols went 
down the roads ; they there sent off a detachment 
through the fields some distance from the road, until 
they had got above the guard, which they cut off 
without our hearing of it. All communication being 
cut off from our parties, they marched up to ourquarters; and executed the horrid massacre of which 
Dr. Griffith will inform you the particulars, as appears from the depositions. 

I am happy to inform you that my wounds are 
nearly well, and that I hope soon to regain my 
former state of health. I am, with respect, 

Your most obedient and very humble servant, 

GEORGE BAYLOR, 



FROM COUNT D ESTAING. 

Boston Road, 20 October, 1778. 

SIR, 

Those who have the happiness to be under yourExcellency s orders, find in you a father. The Marquis de la Fayette has a superior title to your Excel 
lency s affection ; he respects, admires, and loves you. 
I had the honor of asking you whether you permit 
ted him to send his cartel to Lord Carlisle, to satisfy 
myself whether you were informed of it. You were so 
kind as to acquaint me that you had not seen the 
cartel. I thought, from that circumstance, that you 
would forbid the execution of it ; I am still persuaded that this is the case. Such marks of zeal, brav 
ery, and sensibility, are never authorized in Europe, 
by its Generals ; they might fruitlessly rob the re 
spective nations of their best subjects. Besides, Am 
bassadors, Commissioners, and men in office, are sup 
posed to speak only in consequence of orders which 
they have received. As public organs, they owe an 
account only to their own government of the things 
which they hazard. Nations revenge their own in 
juries ; those Avho have most reason and strength on 
their side are the most sparing in opprobrious terms, 
and despise them ; they respect their enemies, while 
they endeavour to subdue them; they surpass them 
in wisdom, when they refrain from such offensive 
terms, which, one would think, should be only the 
useless resource of those who would dissemble their 
injustice. 

I could not, then, but presume that Lord Carlisle 
would not accept a cartel, which he would have doneextremely well to refuse. Older than M. de la Fayette, the experience which age gives tranquillized me 
upon the two subjects which I have just submitted 
to your Excellency, and which made me regard the 
cartel, till now, as almost null. It appeared to me a 
consequence of the interesting character which led 
this brave and amiable Frenchman into the service 
of the United States ; to have entreated your inter 
position in this affair would have appeared like a 
doubt of your doing it. 

The delicacy of my countryman might likewise 
have been wounded, if it should have been known 
that your refusal had been solicited by me. I do 
not hesitate, however, Sir, to make the request. I 
am this moment informed that General Hancock told 
M. de Chouin yesterday, that the English Commis 
sioner had provided himself with a substitute. Can he 
have been guilty of choosing a bully?* It is impossible that you should have suffered a doubtful ex 
pression in this cartel to have had such an effect. 
This challenge can only regard my Lord Carlisle, and 
could not have been construed otherwise. Your Ex

cellency certainly will not have suffered it. Pardon 
an ill-placed uneasiness, if, in consequence of General 
Hancock s phrase, I require you, as chief of the French, 
to hinder an individual to take upon himself alone a 
concern which is precious, which regards us all, and 
which is granted by his Majesty to the zeal of his 
navy and army. I have the honor to be, with re

ESTAING. 



FROM GOUVERNEUE MORRIS. 

In Congress, Philadelphia, 11 November, 1778. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

As Congress have delegated to a Committee, of 
which I have the honor to be a member, the super 
intendence of the Commissary and Quarter-master s 
department, this, together with our finances, which we 
have long been cobbling at, hath obliged me to con 
sider, in a more complete view, the state of ouraffairs, than my former detached attention would per 
mit, or, indeed, than my natural indolence would have 
led to, unsolicited by necessity. While I write to 
you, you must read and interpret with the eye and 
the mind of friendship, and suppose a greater mo 
desty of disposition than the language may indicate. 
For, though I by no means believe myself equal to 
the smallest of the objects thrown upon me, yet, in 
speaking of them, I must give a loose to my imagi 
nation and my pen; nor can I find either leisure or 
inclination to attend to style. 

First, then, it is a position clear, that we must 
act according to our powers, and not our inclina 
tions. It is, I am afraid, as clear, that your army 
will want subsistence, if kept together. Neither the 
Quarter-master nor Commissary departments can, in 
the mercantile phrase, do the needful while you 
are where you are. I take it, the number of the 
enemy, and the season, are against active operations 
on their part. Their situation, the season, our natural 
and political circumstances, are equally against them 
on our part. To ravage the country, and to cover it 
from being ravaged, are then the two objects. The 
first is base, and, beyond a certain degree, impracti 
cable. The second is, to a certain degree, dangerous 
and ideal. If it is reduced to a question, for in 
stance, whether the counties of Bergen and Westchester shall be protected by our arms, or the losses 
paid for, I am ready to purchase the whole of both 
in fee, and lay them waste, by way of saving money. 
The like, I take it, will hold good with respect to 
the environs of Rhode Island. 

I cannot, therefore, help being of opinion, that few, 
very few, troops should remain in the eastern depart 
ment; but that many of them, if many there be, 
and a part of your army, should be cantoned along 
through the towns about the middle of Connecticut 
River. The post in the Highlands cannot, indeed, be 
neglected, and perhaps, for the better support of it, 
another post may be necessary about Fredericksburg. 
To supply them with provisions will be very difficult, 
and, whenever the frosts shall become severe, these 
posts will require much fewer men, and therefore it 
may be good policy to place those whose times are 
near expiring on that ground. The sick can, perhaps, 
be better and safer kept at Albany than elsewhere; 
and then a part of your force will be there to cover 
them, mount the necessary guards, &c. At Newark 
and Elizabethtown, advanced parties may be posted 
to cover the interior country and communication. A 
considerable body at Morristown will be necessary to 
secure the magazines, which may there be drawn to 
a point from all the communications, and there, most 
properly, because perfectly secure, and because na 
turally a good forage country. 

A small body of men will be necessary, for the 
sake of order, at Sussex Court-House, Easton, Coryell s, Brunswic, Princeton, &c. Amboy will, I ima 
gine, be too dangerous, as, by landing at the Blazing 
Star, or, in very cold weather, on the meadows be 
tween that and Amboy, they might be cut off. A 
part of the army might be quartered at Trenton. 
Bordentown, and Burlington, and a part at Valley 
Forge. The wagons of every kind, and horses, should 
be sent away from those not exposed. The advanced 
posts will require a few good horses, but they should 
have very little baggage, and only light, very light, 
artillery. A few good cavalry also may be requisite 
for the videttes. 

I cannot conceive that any clanger can arise from 
such dispersion of the army, and I am confident they 
can in that way be much better fed. My principal 
view is, I confess, this, that almost all the horses of 
the army may travel southward, perhaps as far as 
beyond the Potomac in the two counties of Frederic, 
and in Washington and Barclay counties, there to be 
boarded with the farmers, by which means they will 
be fit for use as early as the season will permit. 
The cavalry might be quartered in little villages, and. 
if the officers are good, the men as well as horses 
might improve. This peace and ease would help re 
cruiting ; but I have said too much already. 

However, as I have disposed of your army, pray 
let me now dispose of their General. I think Philadelphia would be a very proper place for him. In 
short, Sir, you must contrive to spend some time 
near Congress, and I am confident you will do more 
good by establishing a good understanding between 
them and the army, forwarding its business, and the 
like, than can be conceived. To all this I add, that, 
if the General, the Quarter-master, and the Commis 
sary-General are on this spot, all the arrangements for 
the next campaign will be properly made. One thing 
more, and I have done. It is, that I wish most earnestly to see you. Adieu. I am, yours, 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



FROM COLONEL WOOD. 

Williamsburg, 12 November, 1778. 

SIR, 

I have been here near three weeks, without being 
able, as yet, to get a final determination on any part 
of the business I came to transact. On my arrival, 
I discovered that the whole legislative body were 
highly pleased, with a thorough persuasion, that the 
war was at an end, that the British troops were em 
barking, and that there was not the most distant 
probability they would again return to the Continent. 

On Governor Henry s laying your Excellency s let 
ter before the House, I was happy to find it effect 
ually roused them from, their lethargy. They imme 
diately appointed Mr. Mason, Mr. Page, Mr. Nelson, 
and Mr. Parker a Committee, to confer with me on 
the state of the troops belonging to the Virginia line. 
I informed the Committee of the reduction that had 
taken place in the Virginia regiments, owing to the 

VOL. ii. 20 
great deficiency in the quota assigned to the State; 
that this measure had disgusted a number of the 
officers, who, I was confident, would leave the service 
at the close of the campaign; that it would take two 
thousand seven hundred and thirty-one, rank and file, 
to complete the regiments on the present establish 
ment, making a deduction for eight hundred drafts, 
whose time of service expires in February next ; 
that, by some default in the execution of the act of 
Assembly, one half of the drafts had never joined 
the army, but still remain in their respective counties; recommending proper exertions for apprehending 
them, and obliging them to serve for the time they 
have been absent, agreeably to law; that desertion 
prevails, particularly among the troops raised on the 
frontiers, owing, in my opinion, to that pernicious 
measure of sending a body of men for the protection 
of the settlement on Kentucky, which does not con 
sist of more than sixty men, most of whom are land 
robbers and runaways from the different States, which 
has formed a harbour for deserters, and every other 
species of villains. Besides, the idea was ridiculous 
to think of extending our territory, when we ought_ 
to be making use of every exertion to secure what 
we already occupy. 

That a number of enlistments have expired this 
fall, many of whom might have been reenlisted, had 
your Excellency been made acquainted with the ad 
ditional bounty allowed by the Assembly, and been 
furnished with the necessary sum to have answered 
that purpose ; that reserving a sufficient tract of 
country for the army, will have a good effect; but 
that opening a Land-Office, at this time, will be a 
means of many officers resigning, will make the men, 
acquainted with the back country, uneasy under their 
confinement, and would, in my opinion, effectually 
prevent the reenlisting any of those whose times of 
service are near expiring; that the most effectual 
mode for raising a sufficient number of men to fill 
up the regiments, will be to hold out a generous 
bounty, to proportion the number of men to be furnished by each county, according to the number of 
their militia, and limit a time by which they shall 
be raised ; in failure of which, an indiscriminate 
draft to take place. By this means it will induce 
every individual, from motives of interest, to contri 
bute towards increasing the bounty, and in effect to 
become recruiting officers ; that offering large rewards 
for apprehending deserters, and to oblige them to 
serve at least double the time of their absence, will 
be attended with good consequences. In all those 
propositions the Committee unanimously concurred, 
and reported them to the House, which were agreed 
to by a great majority of the House, and bills ordered to be brought in agreeably to the resolutions. 

I have preferred the officers memorial respecting 
the lands which they have been promised by Go 
vernment. It is still depending before a Committee ; 
but I have the pleasure to inform your Excellency, 
that I have the greatest reason to believe they will 
be unanimous in increasing the proportion of both 
officers and men, and that they will reserve a very 
large and valuable part of the back country for their 
use ; indeed, I am happy to find they discover a real 
inclination to make the situation of their troops, in 
every respect, as agreeable as possible. 

A great part of the present session has been taken 
up in considering the grants made by the Cherokees 
to Henderson and Company, which they have at last 
declared totally void. Disagreeable as my present 
situation is, I shall continue here till the bill for 
recruiting the regiments passes, and other matters 
respecting the army are considered; which I am 
afraid will not be long before Christmas, if I am to 
judge from their manner of doing business. What 
makes my stay so very disagreeable is, that my wife 
is in a declining and very dangerous situation, and 
that I had not time to stay more than two days 
with her, on my way from camp. If she should not 
be recovered on my return, I must beg your Excel 
lency s indulgence to stay some short time with her, 
if my absence can be dispensed with. 

I have discovered the most shameful neglects, in 
the Executive Department in this State, respecting 
the clothing and other necessaries furnished by the 
Assembly for the Virginia troops. It appears that 
clothing, liquors, and other necessaries, to the amount 
of near two hundred thousand pounds sterling, have 
been sent on, addressed to a Mr. Hollingsworth, a De 
puty Quartermaster-General at the head of Elk, who, 
from every information I can obtain, has sent a great 
proportion of them to the Clothier-General and Con 
tinental Stores, instead of forwarding them to the 
Virginia agent, for the use of their troops. I have 
represented this matter to the Assembly, who have 
directed a strict inquiry to be made, which, I hope, 
will be a means of our being better supplied in fu 
ture. 

I shall be exceedingly happy if my poor endea 
vours meet with your Excellency s approbation. I 
have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, 
Your Excellency s very obedient servant, 

JAMES WOOD. 
FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 20 November, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

I feel myself doubly honored by your favor of the 
14th instant, from the confidence of General Washington in the free communication of his sentiments, 
and in the coincidence of his ideas with my own 
upon a question, upon the wise decision of which the 
inheritance, possibly the establishment of the freedom 
and independence of these States, seem to depend. 
The respect, Sir, that I owe you demands an imme 
diate reply, and yet the variety of avocations in 
which I am engaged does not afford me moments for 
arranging or expressing my thoughts suitably to the 
importance of the subject. I am, nevertheless, en 
couraged to proceed, without hesitation, from a con 
viction that, were I to deliver my opinions at full 
length, I should be obliged to borrow your Excel 
lency s words, which I have the honor of assuring 
you, Sir, are, in more than one instance, repetitions 
of my own, and that in every other, one excepted, 
our sentiments on this momentous discussion exactly 
accord. 

I believe, and upon good ground, the scheme for 
an expedition into Canada, in concert with the arms 
of France, originated in the breast of the Marquis deLafayette, encouraged, probably, by conferences with 
Count d Estaing, and I also believe it to be the off 
spring of the purest motives, so far as respects that 
origin; but this is not sufficient to engage my con 
currence in a measure big with eventual mischiefs. 
As deeply as my very limited time and faculties had 
suffered me to penetrate, I had often contemplated 
our delicate connection with Erance ; and, although it 
20* 



234 LETTERS TO W A SIIINGT ON. 

is painful to talk of one s own foresight; had viewed 
and foretold, fifteen months ago, the humiliating state 
to which our embryo independence would be reduced 
by courting from that nation the loan of more money 
than should be actually necessary for the support of 
the army and of our unfortunate navy. 

I was one of the six unsuccessful opponents to the 
resolution for borrowing money from France for paying the interest of our Loan-Office certificates. We 
have, in this single article, plunged the Union into a 
vast amount of debt; and, from neglecting to exert 
our very small abilities, or even to show a leadingdisposition to cancel any part of the former demand 
against us, our bills for that interest are now floating, 
in imminent danger of dishonor and disgrace. Fully 
persuaded of the true value of national honor, I 
anxiously wished to support our own by a propriety 
and consistency of conduct, and I dreaded the conse 
quences of subjecting our happiness to the disposal 
of a powerful creditor, who may, upon any specious 
grounds, interpret national honor to our destruction. 
I warned my friends against the danger of mortgaging these States to foreign powers. Every million 
of livres you borrow implies a pledge of your lands ; 
and it is optional in your creditor to be repaid at 
the Bank of England, with an exorbitant premium, 
or to collect the money due to him in any of yourports, and according to his own mode, whenever na 
tional interest shall require the support of pretended 
national honor. 

Hence your Excellency will perceive what were 
my feelings, when the propositions for subduing Ca 
nada, by the aid of a French fleet and army, were 
first broached to me. I demurred exceedingly to the 
Marquis s scheme, and expressed some doubts of the 
concurrence of Congress. This was going as far as 
I dared, consistently with iny office, or considering 
him as a gentleman of equal honor and tenacity. 1 
trusted the issue of his application to the sagacity 
of Congress; the business was referred to a Commit 
tee., who conferred with the Marquis; their report 
was framed agreeably to his wishes; but the House 
very prudently determined to consult the Commanderin-chief previously to a final determination; and al 
though your Excellency s observations are committed, 
I am much mistaken if every member in Congress is 
not decided in his opinion in favor of them. If the 
prosecution of so extensive an object is, from the 
present state of our army and funds, impracticable 
on our part, it becomes altogether unnecessary to 
discuss the point in a political view. And I trust 
the Marquis will be satisfied with such reasonings, in 
apology for our desisting from the pursuit of his fa 
vorite enterprise, as our circumstances will dictate. 

The immense debts which we are involved in, 
abroad and at home, demand the utmost serious at 
tention, and call for an exertion of the collected wis 
dom of all these States, in order to secure what we 
have saved from the ravages of the enemy. I am 
very short-sighted if there be, at this time, any en 
couragement for attempting distant conquests. I have 
been uniformly averse from every proposition which 
is intended to dissipate our strength and to accumu 
late our debt. Events have confirmed my opinion; 
and at this instant, taking in view all circumstances, 
I have doubts of the policy, and more of the success, 
of the pending expedition against East Florida. Con 
gress will probably recommend to the States to raise 
a tax of near twenty millions the ensuing year. This, 
I hope, will have a good effect, by returning many 
of us to first principles, from which we have been too 
long wandering. This almost intolerable burden will 
rouse and animate our fellow-citizens ; they will pro 
bably send men of ability to investigate causes, to 
inquire into expenditures, and to call delinquents for 
unaccounted millions to severe reckonings ; they will 
do, what they have hitherto shamefully neglected, pass 
necessary laws for this purpose. 

This heavy tax, and the prospect of increasing impositions, w r ill show our constituents the necessity for 
consolidating our strength, as well as the impropriety 
and danger of new extensive military enterprises. 
Virtue and patriotism were the motto of our banners, 
when we entered this contest. Y/here is virtue, 
where is patriotism, now; when almost every man 
has turned his thoughts and attention to gain and 
pleasures, practising every artifice of change-alley, or 
Jonathans ; when men of abilities disgracefully neg 
lect the important duties for which they were sent 
to Congress, tempted by the pitiful fees of practising 
attorneys; when members of that body artfully start 
a point, succeed, and then avail themselves of the 
secrets of the House, and commence monopolizers, 
and accumulate the public debt for their private 
emoluments ? I believe many such tricks have been 
acted. The particular instance which I allude to cost 
these States a large sum of money without putting 
the criminal to the expense of a blush. When men, 
in almost every important public department, are ac 
tually concerned in commerce, incompatible with the 
strict duties of their respective offices; when the most 
egregious delinquents meet with support in Congress, 
and escape examination. I am tired, and fear tiring 
you, Sir, with this horrible, half-finished picture. 1 
will therefore leave it, but not before I add that the 
United States of America are in most deplorable cir 
cumstances ; that the requisitions of a foreign Minister 
have fixed the eyes of Europe upon them; that their 
weaknesses, their wickednesses, are no longer hidden, 
and that the States respectively are much to blame, 
and that, without speedy reformation, their shame 
and ruin collectively will folloAV. 

The disaster of Admiral Byron s fleet, and the 
successful departure of Count d Estaing s, are events 
much in our favor; that is to say, if we are pleased 
to make a wise improvement of them; but, from ex 
perience fearing the contrary, I am almost tempted 
to wish they had not happened. These fortunate cir 
cumstances will lull us to sleep again, and, while ourally is gaining honor, aggrandizement, and the highest national advantages, we shall be sinking into a 
state little better than tributary and dependent. Be 
this as it may, the world will ever honor by acknow 
ledging the virtues of the man, who, from my inmost 
soul, I believe keeps us at this moment from crumb 
ling. I have the honor to be, with the most sincere 
respect and esteem, dear Sir, 
Your much obliged and obedient humble servant, 

HENRY LAURENS. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL CADWALADER. 

Philadelphia, 4 December, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

The honorable command given me lately by Con 
gress, would have been very agreeable, if I had not 
conceived the war to be near the close.* You may 

* He had been appointed a Brigadier-General in the Continental 
army on the 10th of September, with the command of the cavalry, 
but he declined the appointment. 
remember, in the last conversation I had with yourExcellency, I gave my reasons fully for declining any 
command in the army. 

It is no small mortification to me, that, by not en 
tering early into the service, I lost the opportunity 
of sharing the honors which many officers have gained by serving under your command. 

The civilities I received from you, whilst I remained in your family at camp, will ever be remembered 
with gratitude ; and if our affairs should again take 
an unfortunate turn, be assured you have not a friend 
more ready than I shall be to share your dangers. 

I most sincerely wish you may live to see the 
liberties of your country established upon the broadest foundation ; which I know has ever been youronly object, from the beginning of this contest. I 
am, clear Sir, with the greatest esteem, 

Your most obedient and very humble servant, 

JOHN CADWALADER. 



FROM EDWARD RUTLEDGE. 

Charleston, 18 December, 1778. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

Your much esteemed favor of the 5th of October 
was put into my hands a few clays ago by General 
Lincoln. I sincerely thank you for your recollection 
of me, and for introducing to my acquaintance a 
gentleman of his character and merit. lie is much 
caressed ; and you may be assured that I shall pay 
him, and every other person whom I shall know you 
to regard, all the attention in my power. 

I wish I could prevail on myself to pass over that 
part of your letter, in which you remind me of onelong since written by you and unanswered, for I 
really blush when I even think of it; but I cannot 
be silent on the subject, or permit you to entertain 
the most distant idea, that a conduct, which was 
really founded in affection, could have proceeded from 
a different motive. Believe me, my dear General, the 
true reason of my silence was the uniform declara 
tion of every person who came from your camp, that 
every moment of your time was occupied by import 
ant business ; and, though I wished for the continu 
ance of a correspondence which afforded me the highest satisfaction, yet I could not permit myself to add 
a single feather to the weight which already pressed 
upon you. Affairs, however, now wear an appearance very different from what they did, and I will 
resume, with much pleasure, a correspondence which 
was laid aside with the greatest regret. 

You tell me that matters are much changed in the 
army and politics, since we last parted. God knows 
they are so, and in more senses than one. In many, 
they afford me very sensible concern ; and, if I am 
not much mistaken in my conjectures, the worst is 
yet to come. For, if report, and loud report too, is 
to be credited, that spirit of cabal and destructive 
ambition, which has elevated the factious demagogue 
in every republic of antiquity, is making great head 
in the centre of these States ; and, if not soon extin 
guished, will do more essential injury to the cause 
of America than the swords of Sir Harry and his 
whole army. I have given my opinion to several 
members of Congress, with great freedom, on this 
subject; and, if the situation of my private concerns 
would admit of it with the least degree of conven 
ience, I would give it them in person. But they are 
much opposed to such a step; and however pleasing 
it might be to me, to give my sentiments of men 
and measures, I must, at present, forego the gratifica 
tion. 

General Lincoln, it seems, is directed by Congress 
to undertake an expedition against St. Augustine ; 
but I believe it will hardly be attempted tin s win 
ter. The season is now far advanced, and but few 
things in readiness. We have not eighteen hundred 

O O 

Continentals in this State ; and your experience,, as 
well as the untimely fate of poor Montgomery, has 
sufficiently taught us how unavailing it is to attempt 
a siege with an impatient militia. Should he think 
himself obliged to it, I shall wish him success ; but 
if you do not hear that he has planted the Ameri 
can standard on the ramparts of the Castle, you must 
not be disappointed. The reduction of the place is 
certainly of importance to the more Southern States, 
as it affords assistance to the Indians, and a place 
of refuge to banditti, called the Florida Scout, who 
are committing continual depreciations on the fron 
tiers ; and, as they live by plunder, it is not to be 
supposed that they will cease their incursions till 
Augustine is our own. But to have made it so, Con 
gress should have concerted measures earlier and bet 
ter than they have ; for, attributing to them the best 
intentions, I do not think they will avail. 

Mrs. Middleton and Mrs. Rutledge desire me to 
present their best respects to you ; and I beg that 
you will believe me, my dear General, to be at all 
times and on all occasions, amongst the most sincere 
and affectionate of your friends. 

EDWARD RUTLEDGE. 
FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LINCOLN.* 

Charleston, 19 December, 1778. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

Immediately on my arrival here, I called for a re 
turn of the troops and Continental stores in this 
State, and the State of Georgia, but I have not yet 
obtained them ; otherwise, I should have done myself 
the honor of inclosing them; but, from all I can 
learn, there are very few Continental stores in either 
of the States. 

The troops have been supplied by this State ; and 
the heads of the several departments of Medical, 
Commissary, and Quarter-master, when supplies were 
necessary, have applied to the civil authority (there 
being no military chest here), who granted them, or 
not, as their own judgments dictated, which mode of 
doing business often created dissensions between the 
civil and military, and a militation of orders. 

In this situation I found matters, and that the 
army (to use Major-General Howe s own words) "had 
been in a state of abject dependency on the civil 
authority." Indeed, the Continental officer commanding in the department has not had it in his power, 
from the want of supplies which he could control, to 
march the troops without the consent of the Presi 
dent of this State, however urgent the necessity. I 
hope things will be better settled, and that I shall 
never be driven to the hard necessity of altercating 
with the civil power, than which nothing would be 
more disagreeable. 

* It was resolved in Congress, on the 25th of September, " that Ma 
jor-General Lincoln take command in the Southern department, and 
repair immediately to Charleston, South Carolina." 
VOL. II. 21 
The enemy from St. Augustine lately marched into 
Georgia. They summoned a small fort in Sunbury, 
but, satisfied with the spirited answer given by the 
officer commanding it, retreated over the Altaniaha 
River. They plundered negroes, cattle, c., to a 
considerable amount. I am not able to learn whether 
they have left the State or not. What was their 
original motive, whether a diversion of the troops 
here, whether to cooperate with a force from Xew 
York, or to secure a quantity of provisions, is not 
yet determined. I think the latter is most probable, 
though there are some reasons to suppose they ex 
pected to act in conjunction with a body from Xcw 
York. 

There are here very few troops, and I think a 
very small proportion of those called for by Congress 
will arrive. By the next opportunity, I hope to for 
ward the returns of the troops, and of the few Con 
tinental stores in this department. I have the honor 
to be, dear General, with the greatest esteem and 
affection, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 



FROM GOVERNOR LIVINGSTON. 

Elizabetlitown, 21 December, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have to acknowledge your Excellency s favors 
of the IGtli and 17th instant. 

From your Excellency s known disposition to afford 
this State all the assistance which the circumstances 
of your troops will permit, I think the reasons assigned., in your letter of the 16th, against sending 
a detachment into Monmouth, have their weight ; 
and one is often obliged to make those applications 
against one s own judgment, for the satisfaction, and 
through the solicitations, of others. 

I am happy to find your Excellency concur with 
me in sentiment respecting the prisoners lately be 
longing to the British ship, stranded on our coast ; 
and I have acquainted Colonel Beatty that they are 
to be considered as the prisoners of this State, and 
to be delivered to the order of Mr. Boudinot, ourCommissary. I am exceedingly pleased with the 
plan your Excellency proposes, in your letter of the 
17th, for suffering flag-boats to pass only once a 
month, except on extraordinary occasions. For the 
inhabitants of the States, who have no military busi 
ness to transact, it is quite sufficient ; and the inconvenience of being delayed for that space of time, 
when such establishment is found necessary for the 
public good, ought to be, and by all true Whigs 
will be, cheerfully acquiesced in. Indeed, of all 
those who have applied to me for recommendations 
to the commanding officer at Elizabethtown, to go to 
Statcn Island or New York, not above one in twenty 
appeared entitled to. that indulgence ; and many of 
them were as venomous Tories as any in the country. It is either from a vain curiosity (extremely 
predominant in women), cloaked with the pretence 
of securing their debts or effects, in which they 
seldom, if ever succeed ; or, for the sake of buying 
tea and trinkets (for which they would as soon for 
feit a second Paradise, as Eve did the first, for the 
forbidden fruit), that they are perpetually prompted 
to those idle rambles. I have, accordingly, been 
very sparing in gratifying their requests ; but have 
often had the mortification to find that many of 
those whom I had denied, were, notwithstanding, 
successful in their subsequent addresses to the mili 
tary officers, who, from a mistaken complaisance, 
seemed incapable of resisting the solicitations of 
those eloquent and pernicious vagrants. The men 
are still more seriously mischievous, and go with 
commercial motives, and to secure capital quantities 
of British merchandises. 

By a late law, our Legislature has made it penal 
for any of the inhabitants of this State to go into 
the enemy s lines without your Excellency s pass or 
mine ; and I am sure I shall not find myself disposed to grant any but in cases in which the prin 
ciples of charity or humanity evidently appear to 
require it. 

I hope the capture of the thirty Dutch vessels by 
the enemy on their passage to the West Indies, on 
pretence of their being intended for America, laden 
with French goods, will animate their High Mighti 
nesses to vindicate their rights, and protect their 
commerce. I have the honor to be, with the highestesteem, Dear Sir, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

WILLIAM LIVINGSTON. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LINCOLN. 

Purysburg, on the banks of the Savannah, thirty miles 

from its mouth, South Carolina; January 5, 1779. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

On the evening of the 25th ultimo, I received 
information at Charleston, that the enemy had arrived, with upwards of twenty ships, at Tybee, nearthe mouth of the River Savannah, and in a harboursouth of the river. The few troops at Charleston were 
immediately put in motion, and marched for Georgia, 
On my way, I met an express from General Howe, 
who w^as in Georgia, informing that, on the morning 
of the 29th, the enemy landed, in force, a little 
below the town of Savannah ; and that he, with five 
or six hundred men, occupied the heights in front of 
it ; but, upon perceiving that the enemy had turned 
his right, at some considerable distance, through a 
swamp he thought impassable, ordered a retreat, 
which he effected with part of the troops, though 
the enemy, it is said, were twenty-five hundred or 
three thousand strong. His loss, in men and officers, 
I inclose. What stores were lost, I cannot yet learn; 
among them were six field-pieces. One of the fieldpieces only was under the direction of Major-General 
Howe. 

The General speaks well of his officers and men ; 
and that more than they did, could not have been 
expected. lie retreated over the Savannah. I met 
him here, where we are collecting the troops. Ourwhole force at this place amounts to about fourteen 
hundred. As soon as a body of men, equal to covering the State of Georgia, can be collected, we shall 
recross the Savannah. It ought to be with a respect 
able force, for the communication with this State is 
frequently cut off by the Savannah overflowing its 
banks, which renders the causeways impassable in 
boats or otherwise. There are no strong grounds in 
this country; many of the inhabitants of the State 
are unfriendly; and, besides, the country abounds 
with navigable rivers; all of which the enemy command, and through which they can, at any time, fall 
in our rear. 

21* 
I have met with almost every disappointment since 
I came into this department. After an encourage 
ment to expect a force consisting of seven thousand 
men, besides the militia of South Carolina and Geor 
gia, I have now only fourteen hundred. I was as 
sured that there were a great plenty of supplies 
and military stores ; instead of which, there were no 
field-pieces, arms, tents, camp utensils, lead (and very 
little powder), intrenching tools; and, in short, hardly 
an article in the arsenal or Quartermaster-General s 
store, under the direction of the Commanding Officerin this department. This deficiency of stores did not 
arise from the neglect of the Commanding Officer, 
but the want of a military chest. I forbear; the 
subject is disagreeable ; for you to hear, will be 
painful. 

I expected, before now, to have had the honor of 
forwarding to your Excellency a return of the troops 
here, but the distracted state of affairs still prevents it. 

I have daily the unhappiness to see families of 
affluence fleeing before the enemy, reduced in a few 
hours to a state of want. 

My w r ound, which was nearly closed when I left 
camp, is opening again, and in a worse condition 
than it was seven months ago ; but I flatter myself 
nothing worse than some small exfoliations will take 
place. I am, my dear General, with the highest sen 
timents of esteem, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 

January Qth. Last evening I heard that the enemy were reenforced by troops from St. Augustine, 
and now amounted to four thousand ; and that Colonel Campbell, the Commander of the British forces 
in Georgia, had left Savannah, and marched, with his 
main body, up the river, whether with a design to 
cross and attack this post or not, is uncertain. 



FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Boston, 5 January, 1779. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

In my difficult situation, at such a distance from 
you, I am obliged to take a determination by my 
self, which I hope will meet with your approbation. 
You remember that, in making full allowance for 
deliberations, the answer from Congress was to reach 
me before the 15th of last month, and I have long 
since waited without even hearing from them. Nay, 
many gentlemen from Philadelphia assure me Con 
gress believe that I am gone long ago. Though my 
affairs call me home, private interests would, how 
ever, induce me to wait for your Excellency s letters, 
for the decision of Congress about an exchange, in 
case I should be taken, and for the last determina 
tions concerning the plans of the next campaign. 

But I think the importance of the despatches I 
am the bearer of; the uncertainty and improbability 
of receiving any others here (my giving intelligence 
at Versailles may be for the advantage of both na 
tions) ; the inconvenience of detaining the fine fri 
gate, on board of which I return; and the danger of 
losing all the men, who desert very fast, are reasons 
so important as oblige me not to delay any longer. 
I am the more of that opinion, from Congress having 
resolved to send, about this time, three fast-sailing 
vessels to Franco, and the Marine Committee having 
promised me to give the despatches to such officers 
as I would recommend. It is a very good way of 
forwarding their letters,, and sending such as yourExcellency may be pleased to write me. I beg you 
will send copies of them by the several vessels. 

To hear from you, my most respected friend, will 
be the greatest happiness I can feel. The longer the 
letters yon write, the more blessed with satisfaction 
I shall think myself. .1 hope you will not refuse me 
that pleasure as often as you can. I hope you will 
ever preserve that affection, which I return by the 
to nd. crest sentiments. 

How happy, my dear General, I should be to conie 
next spring, principally, as it might yet be proposed, 
I need not to say. Your first letter will let me 
know what I am to depend upon, on that head ; and. 
I flatter myself, the first from me will confirm to 
you that I am at liberty, and that most certainly I 
intend to come next campaign. 

My health is now in the best condition, and I 
would not remember I ever was sick, were it not for 
the marks of friendship you gave me on that occa 
sion. My good doctor has attended me with his 
usual care and tenderness. He will see me on board, 
and then return to head-quarters; but the charge of 
your friend was intrusted to him till I was on board 
the frigate. I have met with the most kind hospi 
tality in this city; and, drinking water excepted, the 
doctor has done every thing he could to live happy. 
He dances and sings at the assemblies most charm 
inl. 






The gentlemen who, I hope, will go to France, 
have orders to go to head-quarters ; and I flatter my 
self, my dear General, that you will write me by 
them. I beg you will let the "bearer of this, Captain 
Lacolombe, know that I recommend him to yourExcellency for the commission of Major. 

Be so kind, my dear General, as to present my 
best respects to your lady, and the gentlemen of yourfamily. I hope you will quietly enjoy the pleasure 
of being with Mrs. Washington, without any disturb 
ance from the enemy, till I join you again ; I also 
hope you will approve of niy sailing, which, indeed, 
was urged by necessity, after waiting so long. 

Farewell, my most beloved General ; it is not with 
out emotion I bid you this last adieu, before so long 
a separation. Don t forget an absent friend, and be 
lieve me, forever and ever, with the highest respect 
and tenderest affection. 

On board the Alliance, 10 January. 1779. 

I open again my letter, my dear General, to let 
you know that I am not yet gone ; but, if the wind 
proves fair, I shall sail to-morrow. Nothing from 
Philadelphia ; nothing from head-quarters. So that 
everybody, as well as myself, is of opinion that I 
shall be WTong to wait any longer. I hope I am 
right, and I hope to hear soon from you. Adieu, my 
dear and forever beloved friend, adieu. 

LAFAYETTE. 



FROM PHILIP MAZZEI. 

Colle, in Albemarle, 27 January, 1779. 

SIR, 

Although I had not in my power to pay you my 
respects as often as I did wish, the notice you were 
pleased to take of me, when I came into the country, will, I hope, apologize for the liberty I take of 
asking the honor of ypur commands for Franco and 
Italy, which I am certain to receive, if lodged with 
the Governor or Mr. Blair, in Williamsburff. 

O 

I am going to Europe with the most sanguine ex 
pectations of success in my endeavours to promote 
whatever may be of present and future advantage to 
this Continent. Mr. Ilarvie and another gentleman 
told me, some time ago, that you had inquired what 
success I have had, and what prospect I have, rela 
tive to the new branches of agriculture which I have 
attempted to introduce in our country. Experience 
has convinced me that this country is better calculated than any other I am acquainted with for the 
produce of wine ; but I cannot say the same in re 
gard to oil and lemons. It is true that we cannot 
call what I have had as yet a fair trial, the seasons 
having been, by all accounts, much worse than any 
man remembers. And it is not improbable that the 
same seasons would not have been so detrimental to 
the plants, if they had previously acquired age and 
vigor. One spring as bad as those we have had 
ever since I came, except the last, would, in Italy 
and the south of France, have destroyed all the young 
vines and many of the old. Here many of my vines, 
planted under several disadvantages, have not only 
survived repeated severe spring frosts, but they are 
now more vigorous and luxuriant than vines of the 
same age would be in those countries, and have 
sooner produced grapes in respectable quantity and 
as good. 

Should I be so happy as to succeed in my endea 
vours abroad, I hope soon to return with the means 
of prosecuting my undertaking with vigor; in which 
case my veneration for your personal merit, and the 
natural desire of seeing the Deliverer of our country, 
must excuse me for assuming to go and give you, in 
person, an account of what I shall have done to that 
place of rural felicity, where I wish you may long 
enjoy the fruits of your heroism. With profound re 
spect I have the honor to be, Sir, your Excellency s 
Most humble and most obedient servant, 

PHILIP MAZZEI. 



FROM THOMAS PAINE. 

Philadelphia, 31 January, 1779. 

SIR, 

Hearing that you leave this place to-morrow, I beg 
you to accept a short reason why I have not waited 
on you. 

I have been out nowhere for near these two months. 
The part I have taken in an affair, that is yet depending, rendered it most prudent in me to absent 
myself from company, lest I should be asked ques 
tions improper to be answered, or subject myself to 
conversation that might have been unpleasant. That 
there has been foul play somewhere, is clear to every 
one and where it lies, will, I believe, soon come 
out. 

Having thus explained myself, I have to add my 
sincerest wishes for your happiness in every line of 
life, and to assure you that, as far as my abilities 
extend, I shall never suffer a hint of dishonor or 
even a deficiency of respect to you to pass unnoticed. 
I have always acted that part, and am confident that 
your virtues and conduct will ever require it from 
me as a duty, as well as render it a pleasure. 

I never heard either Colonel R. or Colonel T. Lee 
express a sentiment in your disfavor. I can answer 
for nothing farther. I likewise take the liberty of 
mentioning to you that, at the time some discontents 
from the army and the country last winter wore doing you great injustice, I published the fifth number 
of the CRISIS, in which I hoped, by bringing yourformer services in view, to shame them out, or at 
least to convince them of their error. I was then at 
Lancaster, and on my return to Yorktown I saw the 
Foreign Committee, of which Colonel E. II. Lee was 
chairman, had sent off despatches to France. The 
copy was in his handwriting, and in these despatches 
he inclosed that pamphlet, and spoke of it as "the 
general sentiments of America on what the enemy 
had so boastingly called their successes." 

I am very desirous of bidding you farewell, and 
intend making you a short visit to-day for that purpose, notwithstanding the reasons I have before men 
tioned. I am, with every wish for your happiness, 
Your obedient, humble servant, 

THOMAS PAINE. 



FROM ROBERT RUTHERFORD. 

Berkley County, Virginia, 8 February, 1779. 

DEAR SIR, 

It is with singular pleasure I congratulate yourExcellency on the short relaxation from the utmost 
exertions in the field, where you have rendered yourcountry most essential services, and gained lasting 
honor to yourself. I have not ventured to trouble 
you with letters, truly sensible how many and great 
were the important matters that must necessarily engage your unceasing attention ; but your safety, ho 
nor, and happiness, were ever very near to inc. 

I well know the generous goodness of your heart 
in the case of every brave officer, or common senti 
nel, and that nothing on your part will be wanting 
to alleviate their sufferings ; but the bearer, Ma 
jor Drake, my neighbour, and of whose integrity I 
have long been convinced, being now on his way to 
New York, I cannot withhold my particular recommendation of him to your Excellency s notice, and 
hope that Congress will cooperate with you in all 
possible means for the ease and advantage of him, 
and every other officer of distinguished merit. 

It is with much concern I find the resolve of 
Congress, respecting the money emissions of May 
20th, 1777, and April llth, 1778, giving great and 
general alarm, tending to depreciate the currency, as 
the holders of these emissions are really deprived of 
the use of their money for six months, as it in a 
great measure ceases to pass here in payments; and, 
what is an additional misfortune, our Assembly have 
laid on an enormous assessment, in payment of which 
not one shilling of this money can be applied, as 
the sheriffs cannot make any part of their collections 
by the 1st of June. Assuredly Congress have not 
taken the whole matter into the account, as I am 
informed that large sums of this money are now in 
the possession of the subjects of Spain upon the Mis 
sissippi, they being enjoined by the Governor of Or 
leans to receive it, not to mention many other obvi 
ous objections ; so that I am sensible it will be con 
sistent with the wonted justice and prudence of that 
august body, without loss of time, to revise and 
greatly change the terms of that resolve. 

It is now with me conclusive, that nothing will 
VOL. n. 22 
answer our purpose but adopting a former recommendation of Congress in the several States (though 
I then thought it impolitic), that of fixing some 
bounds to our produce, manufactures, &c. ; at the 
same time that I should be for allowing very liberal 
prices, even five or six times as -much as formerly 
(if the demand obliged the purchaser to bid so high), 
and to encourage manufactures in the highest degree; 
but not to suffer the mechanic, the extortioner, those 
in the character of tavern-keepers, and a few others, 
to swallow up the States. Foreign trade will, of 
course, be regulated by the demand for European 
articles ; if they are very high, w T e shall purchase the 
fewer of them. 

Indian affairs do not strike me in an agreeable 
point of view ; for certainly we can expect no real 
friendship from that troublesome and formidable people, till we supply them upon equal terms, at least, 
with our enemies, and convince them, in every other 
respect, of our justice, equality, and moderation to 
wards them. 

I cannot enlarge upon many other matters, having 
already given your Excellency too much trouble ; and 
I shall only add my ardent wishes, that you may 
continue to be the peculiar care of a superintending 
Providence ; that your life may be prolonged for the 
temporal saving of the United States, and to enjoy, 
with the most perfect felicity, your family, friends, 
and fortunes amidst the grateful acclamations of a 
great and generous people. I am joined by my 
brother and our families. Pray make my compli 
ments agreeable to your good lady. I am, with 
great affection, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

ROBERT RUTIIEIIFOHD. 
FROM GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Poughkeepsie, 3 March, 1779. 

DEAR SIR, 

Although there have been no hostilities committed 
by the enemy during the winter on the western 
frontier of this State, the inhabitants, particularly of 
Tryon county, are so strongly impressed with apprehensions of danger on the opening of the spring, that 
many of them have already, and I am informed that 
most of them will speedily, remove into the interior 
parts of the country, unless they can have reason to 
expect more perfect protection than we were able to 
afford them last year. Within a few weeks I have 
received repeated applications from them on this sub 
ject, intimating their intentions to abandon their set 
tlements, unless I could assure them that such measures would be pursued as would render them se 
cure ; and, as I am sensible that nothing short of 
spirited offensive operations against the savages can 
effect this, I find myself particularly embarrassed. 
If I am much longer silent, they will remove, and 
to encourage them to continue might, in the event, 
be cruel. 

I would therefore wish, if offensive operations are 
really intended in that quarter, that I might have 
such intimation of it as would enable me to give 
general assurances to the inhabitants to induce them 
to continue on their farms, which, considering the present general scarcity of bread, will be a capital ob 
ject, as that county is one of the principal granaries 
of this State. I am also induced to make this appli 
cation to your Excellency, as our Legislature is now 
sitting, and discover a disposition to enable me k 
call out a body of men for the ensuing season to 
cooperate with such Continental troops as your Ex 
cellency may destine for this service. 

I am advised that Lieutenani&gt;Colonel Willett, Vv r ho 
has an influence among the people of Tryon county 
(from his exertions at Fort Schuyler when invested 
by St. Leger), might be serviceably employed in arranging the militia there for a few months, and I 
would be glad to have it in my power to call himto that service, if I should esteem it necessary ; and 
this, I presume, might be done without injuring his 
regiment, as it is completely officered. 

I will be much obliged to your Excellency for any 
late intelligence which you are at liberty to commu 
nicate. I am, with the highest respect and esteem, 
Your most obedient servant, 

GEORGE CLINTON. 

P. S. I omitted mentioning that, if we raise any 
number of men, we shall be at a loss to arm them 
fit for the field, unless we can be supplied by the 
public, the arms to be returned at the expiration 
of the time allotted for the service. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GATES. 

Boston, 4 March, 1779. 

SIR, 

Yesterday I had the honor to receive your Excel 
lency s letter of the 14th ultimo, from Middlebrook. 
I am sorry to find your Excellency seems to have 
given over all thoughts of penetrating into Canada 
by the route of Coos, after the preparations made for 
that purpose, at an incredible expense. 
I am satisfied you could not have advised with 
two men, upon this Continent, better acquainted with 
the practicable routes to the River St. Lawrence, than 
General Bayley and Colonel Hazen, the latter being 
an officer of great merit and service, and who long 
resided upon the River Sorel ; and the former, the 
best of any acquainted with the country between 
Coos and Lake St. Peter s, who likewise has the most 
extensive influence upon the brave and numerous in 
habitants in the northern parts of the States which 
lie near Canada. As your Excellency advised with 
them, and determined upon the route by Coos, I beg 
leave to express my astonishment at the sudden 
change of your sentiments, and relinquishment of that 
plan. 

To go into Canada by Lake Champlain, before the 
enemy s fleet are taken or destroyed, is almost impracticable ; to attempt it by Lake Ontario, before 
Niagara is taken, and vessels upon that Lake are re 
moved, is still more difficult, as the Fort at La Galette must be reduced before the passage down the 
River St. Lawrence is open to Montreal. I believe 
that, in the present state of our army, and the actual 
situation of our magazines, to attempt a serious inva 
sion of Canada, by whatever route, would prove unsuccessful, unless the fleet of our allies should, at the 
same time, cooperate with us, by sailing up the River 
St. Lawrence. In that case, the enemy s force would 
all (their fleet excepted) move down the river, to 
succour Quebec ; and our armament from Coos, as 
sisted by the Canadians, who would flock to meet us, 
might march in the utmost security from Coos to 
Lake St. Peter s. The Upper Canada would then be 
wholly ours, and the English fleet on Lake Champlain, thus rendered useless, would be destroyed by 
22* 
its own crews, before these should be ordered down 
the river, to make the best of their way to Quebec. 

I much lament the amazing and needless expense 
that is incurred by the preparations making on the 
upper part of Hudson s River; for, I am confident, 
no force of ours can get into Canada by either of the 
routes from Albany, in 1779. 

The last paragraph of your Excellency s letter 
alarms me exceedingly. There is no magazine of 
flour in all these States ; and to have no hopes of 
procuring one, either by land or sea, is a most me 
lancholy consideration. 

The Navy Board, here, just now acquainted me 
with their having lost all hopes of any supply of 
rice from South Carolina, that State having laid an 
embargo on that article. With very great respect 
and esteem, I am, Sir, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

HORATIO GATES. 



FROM THOMAS CHITT^NDEN, GOVERNOR OF VERMONT. 

Bennington, G March, 1779. 

SIR, 

I am directed, by my Council and the General 
Assemby of this State, to recommend to your Ex 
cellency the present unhappy situation of the inhabit 
ants of the northern frontiers of this State, and to 
pray your Excellency s interposition for their future 
relief. 

The contiguous situation of those inhabitants to the 
enemy, has rendered their safety peculiarly uncertain, 
from the first commencement of the present war. 
The many alarms, occasioned by the approaches of 
the enemy, have kept its inhabitants in such a fluc 
tuating condition, as has rendered it impracticable for 
them to have secured any considerable supplies of 
provisions for the subsistence of their families before 
hand. The encroachments of the army, under the 
command of Lieutenant-General Burgoyne, into this 
State, in the year 1777, their daring attempt to destroy this town, and the public stores then deposited 
here, commanded the attention, as well as the most 
vigorous exertions of those inhabitants ; and, although 
there were at that time very plentiful crops of grain, 
corn, hay, &c., on the ground, yet the enemy prevented the inhabitants from securing any considera 
ble part of it. 

By their continuing in service, for the purpose 
of reducing General Burgoyne to a submission, the 
season of the year was so far advanced, as to put 
it out of the power of those inhabitants to make the 
necessary preparations for a crop of winter grain, on 
which they have had their greatest dependence, since 
the first settlement of this part of the country. 

They are, therefore, the principal part of them, re 
duced to an Indian cake, in scant proportion to the 
number of their families ; and by the destruction of 
their sheep by the enemy, and their loss of them 
otherwise, as well as of their flax, their bellies and 
backs are become co-sufferers. 

In this deplorable situation, may it please yourExcellency, they remain firm and unshaken, and being generally well armed and accoutred, are ready, on 
any sudden emergency, and on the shortest notice, 
to face and encounter their inveterate foe undaunted ; but, on viewing their present circumstances, it 
may be your Excellency may be prevailed on to 
make such provision for the security of those frontiers (which are no less so to three other States), as 
to prevent the fatal necessity of continuing those in 
habitants in constant service the ensuing summer. 

With this will be communicated a copy of Briga 
dier-General Clinton s letter, of the 25th ultimo, by 
which your Excellency will perceive his readiness to 
grant every relief in his power. 

In consequence of his advice, I have ordered the 
continuance of the company of militia therein named, 
and an addition of fifty men, exclusive of officers, to 
join them immediately. 

If, after all that has been exhibited on this sub 
ject, it should be found inconsistent to adopt any 
other measures in the case, I desire an order may be 
granted for the subsistence and pay of the officers 
and soldiers, that may be found necessary to be raised from time to time, within this State, for the purpose aforesaid. 

The bearer hereof, Joseph Fay, Esq., in whose at 
tachment to the common cause your Excellency may 
repose the greatest confidence, will be able to give 
any further intelligence in the premises, and particu 
larly wait any advice or directions your Excellency 
may please to communicate. I am, Sir, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

THOMAS CIIITTENDEN. 



FROM GOVERNOR HENRY. 

Williainsburg, 13 March, 1779. 



SIR, 

The reasons hinted in your Excellency s last favor 
are certainly of such weight as to prevent the flagof-truce vessels, coming with stores, &c., for the Convention troops, from proceeding further than Hamp 
ton Road. Orders are, therefore, issued to-day, for 
vessels of our own to be ready at that place to con 
vey the stores upwards to their destination, under 
the superintendence of proper Commissaries. 

My last accounts from the South are unfavorable. 
Georgia is said to be in full possession of the enemy, 
and South Carolina in great danger. The number of 
disaffected there is said to be formidable, and the 
Creek Indians inclining against us. One thousand 
militia are ordered thither from our southern counties ; but a doubt is started whether they are by law 
obliged to inarch. I have also proposed a scheme to 
embody volunteers for this service; but I fear the 
length of the march, and a general scarcity of bread, 
which prevails in some parts of North Carolina and 
this State, may impede this service. About five hundred militia are ordered doAvn the Tennessee River, 
to chastise some new settlements of renegade Cherokees that infest our south-western frontier, and prevent 
our navigation on that river, from which we began 
to hope for great advantages. Our militia have full 
possession of the Illinois, and the posts on the Wabash; and I am not without hopes that the same 
party may overawe the Indians as far as Detroit. 
They are independent of General Mclntosh, whose 
numbers, although upwards of two thousand, I think 
could not make any great progress, on account, it is 
said, of the route they took, and the lateness of the 
season. 

The conquest of Illinois and Wabash was effected 
with less than t\vo hundred men, who will soon be 
reenforced ; and, by holding posts on the back of the 
Indians, it is hoped may intimidate them. Forts 
Natchez and Morishac are again in the enemy s hands ; 
and from thence they infest and ruin our trade on 
the Mississippi, on which river the Spaniards wish to 
open a very interesting commerce with us. I have 
requested Congress to authorize the conquest of those 
two posts, as the possession of them will give a co 
lorable pretence to retain all West Florida, when a 
treaty may "be opened, and, in the mean time, ruin 
our trade in that quarter, which would otherwise be 
so beneficial. I can get no answer to this applica 
tion, although it is interesting to our back settle 
ments, and not more than four hundred men required 
for the service. 

I beg pardon for intruding these several subjects 
upon you. If you find leisure to make any observa 
tions upon them, they will be highly acceptable. 
With every sentiment of regard and esteem, I am, 
dear Sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

PATRICK HENRY. 



FROM GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Pouglikeepsie, 18 March, 1779. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have had the honor of receiving your Excel 
lency s letters of the 4th and 6th instant, and am 
happy in being thereby enabled to give such general 
assurances of protection to the frontier inhabitants as, 
I have reason to hope, will prevent their deserting 
their settlements. This your Excellency may be as 
sured will be done, with the utmost regard to that 
secrecy which is necessary to insure success in of 
fensive operations ; and, therefore, the greatest care 
will be taken not to give them the most remote idea 
of any such intention. 
The Legislature, before they adjourned, empowered 
me to embody one thousand men for the defence of the 
northern and western frontiers, or such other service 
as I should judge proper to employ them in. This 
was the most they conceived the State, under its 
present distressed situation, was able to raise ; and 
the greater part of them were intended to join the 
troops to be employed in defensive operations against 
the savages. Since the rising of the Legislature, I 
have received the resolve of Congress for filling up 
the Continental battalions ; and this will put me under the necessity of taking at least one half of these 
levies for the purpose, as it would be impracticable 
to convene the Legislature in season to make any 
new provision for that service, even though our cir 
cumstances would admit of it. 

I do not imagine we shall be able to derive any 
considerable force from the inhabitants, whose settle 
ments have been destroyed. Their losses and conse 
quent distresses are so great, that it requires the ut 
most industry to support their families ; and the pay 
in the army, considering the depreciated state of ourcurrency, would not be competent for this purpose. 
The most of their young men are already engaged in 
the Continental battalions. Some, however, from a desire of revenge for their losses, will, at all events, 
engage ; and the neighbourhoods that have been less 
distressed will furnish a considerable proportion, who, 
being as well acquainted with the country, will be 
equally serviceable. 

In order to deceive the enemy into a belief that 
we intend acting on the defensive only, I submit to 
your Excellency the propriety of erecting one or two 
small posts on the nearest navigable waters of the 
Susquehanna, They would not only answer the 
above purpose, but serve also as a security to the 
settlements, and, of course, induce the militia to en 
gage in the service with greater alacrity. I am not 
sufficiently acquainted with the country to determinewith certainty the particular places best calculated 
for such posts ; but, from the general idea I have of 
the country, I am led to believe that Unadilla, and 
where the Susquehanna empties out of the Lakes 
west of Cherry Valley, would be the most eligible. 
These posts might be maintained by militia, at least 
while the other troops were employed in offensive 
operations. I have the honor to be, with the highestesteem and regard, dear Sir, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

GEORGE CLINTON. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SULLIVAN. 

Mill Stone, 1C April, 1779. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

As your Excellency has honored me with an 
appointment to command the intended expedition/ 1 "- I 
must beg leave to lay my sentiments before you in 
writing ; as words used in conversation may vanish 
in air, and the remembrance of them be lost, while 
writing will remain, either to justify my opinion, 
or to prove that it was erroneous. The variety of 
reasons, which I urged yesterday, for passing with 
the main body up the Mohawk River, and down by 
Wood Creek to the Cayuga Lake, still have their 
weight in my mind ; but, as General Schuyler writes 

* An expedition against the hostile tribes of the Six Nations of 
Indians. See the Instructions in Washington s Writings, Vol. VI. 
p. 2G4. 
that they cannot be supplied with provisions, the 
plan must be given up, and that of passing with 
the main body up the Susquehanna adopted. 

The force which I have requested for that quarter, is three thousand effective men, after all proper 
deductions are made for guards at the several posts, 
for boatmen, hospital guards, tenders, &c. &c. That 
these should be collected before we enter the Indian 
country, appears to me essentially necessary, as it 
is supposed that the principal opposition we shall 
meet will be between Wyoming and Tioga. Should 
this be the case, as seemed to be the general opinion in Council yesterday, we can derive no advan 
tage from the party on the Mohawk River, as they 
are not to join us until we have established a post 
at Tioga. Should they attempt to join us before, 
they must be defeated in passing down the Susquehanna ; and, should our numbers be such as to 
admit of a defeat before we arrive at Tioga, as we 
can have no communication with the other party, 
and they are to regulate themselves by a plan fixed 
before we march, they will remain ignorant of ourdefeat, and of course proceed at the time appointed, 
and in all probability fall into the hands of the 
enemy. If we are to expect the principal opposition 
before we arrive at Tioga, it is absurd to reckon, 
for part of our force, troops who are not to attempt 
joining us before we have passed the principal dan 
ger. 

Indeed, I have no great dependence upon the 
advantages to be derived from so small a party in 
that quarter. It was yesterday said, that we might 
expect fourteen hundred Indians to oppose us in ourmarch. Your Excellency will permit me to say, that 
fourteen hundred Indians, perfectly acquainted with 

VOL. ii. 23 
the country, capable of seizing every advantage which 
the ground can possibly afford, perfectly acquainted 
with the use of arms, inured to war from their youth, 
and, from their manner of living, capable of enduring every kind of fatigue, are no despicable enemy, 
when opposed to three thousand troops, totally unac 
quainted with the country and the Indian manner of 
fighting, and who, though excellent in the field, are 
far from having that exactness with fire-arms or that 
alertness in a wooded country, which Indians have. 
As so many facts have contributed to prove this, it 
will be unnecessary for me to say more upon the 
subject. If I was not a party concerned in this ex 
pedition, and my opinion was asked of the force necessary to insure success, I should give it, that the 
force of each party should be equal to the highestestimate of the enemy s force in that country, that 
they might be able to form a junction at all events, 
and put the matter beyond possibility of doubt; and, 
after that, they would be enabled to detach and con 
quer the country in an eighth part of the time that 
they would, if obliged, for their own safety, to keep 
in a body. I know that the estimated force of the 
Indians is small ; but, when I consider that under 
rating the number of the enemy has been a prevailing error with us since the commencement of the 
war, that we have had persons from among them, both 
inhabitants and deserters, and have had the proceedings, debates, and calculations of Parliament before us, 
and yet have frequently mistaken their number more 
than one half, I cannot suppose but that we are still 
liable to fall into the same error, where we can have 
no evidence, and every thing told us respecting them 
is a mere matter of opinion. In addition to this, let 
me repeat what I observed yesterday, which is the 
probability of a force being sent from Canada by 
way of Lake Ontario. I also beg leave to observe 
that, when our advancement upon the Susquehanna is 
known, it will probably be conjectured that our in 
tention is against Niagara, which will induce the 
enemy strongly to reenforce that post. This they 
may do in a fortnight, as it is but one hundred and 
ten miles from Montreal to Oswegachie, and their 
vessels can take troops from thence to Niagara in 
three or four days; and, when they find that our in 
tention is against the Indian settlements, those troops 
will undoubtedly join them. From these considera 
tions it must appear that the demand I have madeis far from being unreasonable, even exclusive of 
the party sent on their flanks. I well know that 
Continental troops cannot be spared for this purpose, 
but good militia should undoubtedly be called for. 
The expedition is undertaken to destroy those Indian 
nations, and to convince others that we have the 
power to carry the war into their country, whenever 
they commence hostilities. Should we fail in the at 
tempt, the Indians will derive confidence from it, and 
grow more insolent than before. 

I beg leave further to mention, that, in my opinion, the troops selected for this expedition are by no 
means equal to those they must expect to encounter ; 
especially the Pennsylvania troops, as they are prin 
cipally made up of old countrymen, who are totally 
unacquainted with that kind of fighting, which they 
must adopt. I have conversed with General St. Clair 
upon this head, who is fully of my opinion. The 
best troops, in my opinion, for this expedition, are 
General Poor s brigade, who are all marksmen, and 
accustomed to the Indian mode of fighting. I think 
the Jersey troops good ; the York troops I know nothing of; the other broken corps I can say nothing 
about., only that, when they come to act in a body 
with others, much cannot be expected from them. 

Thus have I submitted my sentiments to your Ex 
cellency, and trust that my reasoning upon the sub 
ject must prove, that three thousand good and effect 
ive men, at least, will be necessary to march from 
Tioga, exclusive of those which your Excellency may 
think proper to direct to operate on the other flank 
of the enemy. I have the honor to be, with the 
most lively sentiments of esteem and respect, 
Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

JOHN SULLIVAN. 

P. S. Since writing the above, I have shown it to 
General St. Clair, who says that his sentiments correspond with mine in every particular. J. S. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.* 

Philadelphia, 21 April, 1779. 

DEAR SIR, 

Accept my thanks for the long and friendly letter 
of the 14th instant, which I have had the pleasure 
of receiving from you. It was, for many reasons, 
grateful to me. I value the esteem of the wise and 
virtuous, and had wished to know the particulars of 
transactions respecting which only vague and unsatis 
factory reports had come to my knowledge. Delicacy 
forbad my breaking the subject to you when here. 

* Mr. Jay was elected President of Congress on the 10th of Decem 
ber, 1778. 
I was sure of your politeness, but not certain of a 
more than usual degree of confidence. The latter has 
now been made manifest, and, permit me to assure 
you, it shall be mutual. 

The impression attempted to be made has not 
taken. It passed without a single remark. Yourfriends thought it merited nothing but silence and 
neglect. The same reason induced me to take no 
notice of it in my answer. I have perused the several papers with which you favored me. The delicacy, 
candor, and temper diffused through your letter, form 
a strong contrast to the evasions and design observ 
able in some others. Gratitude ought to have attached a certain gentleman to the friend who raised him. 
A spurious ambition, however, has, it seems, madehim your enemy. This is not uncommon. To the 
dishonor of human nature, the history of mankind 
has many pages filled with similar instances ; and we 
have little reason to expect that the annals of the 
present or future times will present us with fewer 
characters of this class. On the contrary, there is 
reason to expect they will multiply in the course of 
this revolution.* 

Seasons of general heat, tumult, and fermentation, 
favor the production and growth of some great vir 
tues, and of many great and little vices. Which will 
predominate, is a question which events not yet pro 
duced, nor now to be discerned, can alone determine. 
What parties and factions will arise, to what objects 
be directed, what sacrifices they will require, and who 
will be the victims, are matters beyond the sphere 
of human prevision. New modes of Government, not

270 LETTERS TO AV A SHIN GTON. 

generally understood, nor, in certain instances, approved; want of moderation and information in the 
people ; want of abilities and rectitude in some of 
their rulers; a wide field open for the operations of 
ambitious men, raised from low degrees to high sta 
tions, and rendered giddy by elevation and the ex 
tent of their views ; laws dictated by the spirit of 
the times, not the spirit of justice and liberal policy ; 
latitude in principles, as well as commerce; fluctua 
tion in manners and public counsels; suspension ofeducation; indifference to religion and moral obliga 
tion, &c., &c., are circumstances that portend evils, 
which much prudence, vigor, and circumspection are 
necessary to prevent or control. 

To me there appears reason to expect a long 
storm, and difficult navigation. Calm repose, and the 
sweets of undisturbed retirement, appear more distant 
than a peace with Britain. It gives me pleasure, 
however, to reflect, that the period is approaching 
when we shall become citizens of a better ordered 
State ; and the spending a few troublesome years of 
our eternity in doing good to this and future generations, is not to be avoided or regretted. Things 
will come right, and these States will be great and 
flourishing. The dissolution of our Governments threw 
us into a political chaos. Time, wisdom, and perse 
verance will reduce it into form, and give it strength. 
order, and harmony. In this work you are (in the 
style of one of your professions) a master builder ; and 
God grant that you may long continue a free and 
accepted one ! 

Thus, my dear Sir, I have indulged myself in thinking loud in your hearing ; it would be an Hibernicism to say in your sight, though, in one sense, more 
true. It is more than probable that I shall frequently 
do the like. Your letter shall be my apology, and 
the pleasure resulting from converse with those weesteem, my motive. I am, dear Sir, with perfectesteem and regard, 

Your most obedient servant, 

JOHN JAY. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Philadelphia, 24 April, 1779. 

SIR, 

Your Excellency s favor of the 22d was delivered 
to me this afternoon. I am happy to find you have 
wrote so fully to Congress, upon the disagreeable con 
sequences that may follow from starving the Quarter 
master s department at this critical season. I wish it 
may have the desired effect, and rouse their atten 
tion; but I must confess I am afraid the stupor is 
so great, that nothing can alarm their fears, or pro 
mote a spirit of industry. 

I had but very little prospect, from my own appli 
cation, of obtaining the necessary supplies of cash. 
What additional influence your Excellency s letter will 
give to my reasons and representation, time only can 
manifest. 

The treasury appears to be hard pressed on every 
side ; and the demands of this time are infinitely 
greater than it is in their power to satisfy with the 
greatest exertions, upon the present plan of striking 
money. The truth of the affair is, there lias been a 
great degree of negligence and want of timely atten 
tion, to prepare seasonably for the present demands. 
When I was in town in the winter, I reported to the 
Treasury Board what I thought would be absolutely 
necessary for the Quarter-master s department to the 
2d of March; not one half of which have we been 
able to get, although every thing has been urged to 
induce them to supply our wants. 

On my arrival here, I laid your Excellency s letter 
respecting wagoners, before a Committee of Congress. 
They immediately confirmed it by a resolution, not 
withstanding they had been hammering upon the 
business for almost two months, off and on; and 
finally had put it (before the receipt of your letter) 
upon a very restrictive plan. 

The business of financing is in a poor way. There 
is no plan found, or scheme digested, for mending ourmoney. There are a thousand projects on foot; but 
none appears to be taken up on a practical footing. 

There are complaints and murmurings in Congress 
against the people of this State, and the people of 
the State complain against the proceedings of Con 
gress. It is said, days and weeks together are spent 
upon the most trifling disputes in the world; and 
those generally of a personal nature. What will be 
the issue of this policy", I know not, 

I have wrote circular letters to all the deputies in 
my department on the east side of the Susquehanna, 
to enlist as many wagoners as they possibly can by 
the middle of next month; and to have all the pub 
lic teams forwarded so as to be in camp by that 
time. I expect our wagon-horses will fall short, as 
our agents have but a scanty supply of money. 
However, I will do the best I can. 

I wish to know whether I must increase the num 
ber of pack-horses. Orders have been given for onethousand; but General Sullivan thinks near five hundred more will be wanted. It does not appear so to 
me ; but I am not a good judge of the business. 
The Board of War are out of lead ; and I fear the 
ammunition will not be ready. This is only conjec 
tural. 

I wrote your Excellency before, that the Minister 
of France sets out for camp on Tuesday next. Don 
Juan will accompany him. There is a French ship 
just arrived from the West Indies; but I cannot 
learn that she brings any thing new. 

I intended to have set out for camp to-morrow, 
but I believe I shall not be ready until Monday in 
the forenoon. I have desired Congress to give rneleave to resign, as I apprehended a loss of reputa 
tion, if I continued in the business. They are not 
disposed to grant my request at all. But unless 
they change their system, or publish their approba 
tion upon the present, I shall not remain long in the 
business. I will not sacrifice my reputation for any 
consideration whatever. I am willing to serve the 
public ; but I think I have a right to choose that 
way of performing the service which will be most 
honorable to myself. I should be willing to serve in 
the department I am in for a proper consideration, if 
I could serve without the loss of reputation; but not 
without. 

I believe it has been a received opinion, that I 
was so very fond of the emoluments of the Quarter 
master s office, that nothing but absolute necessity 
would induce me to quit it, I will not deny but 
that the profits are flattering to my fortune, but not 
less humbling to my military pride; and he who has 
entertained such sentiments is a stranger to my feelings. While I had a prospect of pleasing your Ex 
cellency, the army, and the Congress, the service 
was agreeable ; but if a combination of circumstances 
changes these prospects, nothing shall induce me to 
continue in the business, even if the profits were 
made five times as large as they are. 

There is a great difference between being raised to 
an office and descending to one ; which is my case. 
There is also a great difference between serving where 
you have a fair prospect of honor and laurels, and 
where you have no prospect of either, let you discharge your duty ever so well. Nobody ever heard 
of a Quarter-master in history, as such, or in relating 
any brilliant action. I engaged in this business as 
well out of compassion to your Excellency as from a 
regard to the public. I thought your task too great, 
to be Commander-in-chief and Quarter-master at the 
same time. Money was not my motive. For you may 
remember I offered to serve a year unconnected with 
the accounts, without any additional pay to that which 
I had as Major-General. However, this proposition 
was rejected as inadmissible. Then I told the Com 
mittee that I would serve upon the same terms that 
Mr. Cox and Mr. Pettit could be engaged upon; and 
I have nothing more now, although I have a double 
share of duty, and am held responsible for all failures. 

Before I came into the department, your Excellency 
was obliged often to stand Quarter-master. However 
capable the principal was of doing his duty, he was 
hardly ever with you. The line and the staff were 
at war with each other. The country had been plundered in a way that would now breed a kind of civil 
war between the staff and the inhabitants. The man 
ner of my engaging in this business, and your Ex 
cellency s declaration to the Committee of Congress, 
that you would stand Quarter-master no longer, are 
circumstances which I wish may not be forgotten ; as 
I may have occasion, at some future day, to appeal 
to your Excellency for my own justification. 
One thing I can say, with truth and sincerity, that 
I have conducted the business with as much pru 
dence and economy, as if my private fortune had 
been answerable for the disbursements. And I be 
lieve your Excellency will do me the justice to say, 
the department has cooperated with your measures 
as far as circumstances were to be governed by me ; 
and this you had reason to apprehend would not 
have been the case had I not taken direction of the 
business. And here, in justice to my colleagues, I 
shall mention that I think them entitled to yourExcellency s personal esteem, from the warmth of 
their wishes, and a desire to promote your ease and 
convenience. 

I am more acquainted with Mr. Petti t s mode of 
doing business than I am with Mr. Cox s ; but I 
think the public under great obligations to the for 
mer for his method and economy. I am, with the 
most perfect esteem, your Excellency s 

Most obedient, humble servant, 

NATHANAEL GREENE. 



FROM PRESIDENT REED, OF PENNSYLVANIA.* 

In Council, Philadelphia, 24 April, 1779. 

SIR, 

Your Excellency s letter of the 20th instant has 
been laid before the Board, informing us that a 
Court-Martial will be held at camp on the 1st of 
May instant, "for the trial of General Arnold on the 
first, second, third, and fifth charges exhibited against 
him by this Board." 

* General Reed had been elected President of Pennsylvania on 
the 1st of December, 1779. 



276 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON 

We apprehend there must have been some mistake 
in the mode of transmitting this business to yourExcellency, as we never exhibited any other charge 
against General Arnold to Congress, than that of appropriating the public wagons of the State to private 
uses, and that only that he might remain to answer. 
Nor do we think it by any means consistent with 
the duty we owe the State to be considered in the 
light of parties, as thereby we may establish a prin 
ciple, under which we may either submit silently to 
injuries and insults, or follow military Courts into 
any part of the country, wherever the service may 
require the army to be. 

The light in which we have ever considered ourselves, and which we would wish to be considered 
by your Excellency, is as a public body, the representatives of the freemen of Pennsylvania, expressing our opinion of General Arnold s conduct, founded 
upon facts disclosed to us, and answering to our own 
knowledge, asking nothing of Congress but that he 
should not continue to command in this State. The 
history of this country affords many instances of this 
proceeding in the cas6s of oppressive Governors, and 
it is a right which we hold independent, and unac 
countable to any other power. No one doubts the 
right of a public body to praise, and this shows very 
strongly they have a power to censure, it only operating as an opinion, unaccompanied with any punish 
ment. 

In the present instance, General Arnold refused to 
give any explanation of his conduct, though civilly 
requested, or ever offered to disprove the facts al 
leged ; of course we were obliged to exercise ourjudgments upon the evidence and proofs we had. 
At the same time we perfectly approve the trial, being of opinion, that General Arnold s conduct deserves some military reprehension; and we doubt not 
the officers of the army will impartially weigh the 
duty they owe to the country, as well as the person 
charged ; and if the facts are proved, let the palliating circumstances, if there are any, operate on the 
sentence, not on the nature of the transaction. Such 
is the dependence of the army upon the transporta 
tion of this State, and such the feelings of the people upon this sort of duty, that, should the Court 
treat it as a light and trivial matter, and found an 
opinion upon any other grounds than the innocence 
of the charge, we fear it will not be practicable to 
draw forth wagons in future, be the emergency what 
it may, and it will have very bad consequences. 

We could have wished your Excellency had appointed a later day, or we could have had earlier 
notice. Your letter is dated the 20th instant, and 
was not received till the 22d; and, considering the 
distance of some of the witnesses, we fear it will not 
be possible to give them notice, much less to procure 
their attendance, and we presume no ex paric testi 
mony ought to be received by the Court, Our view 
of the matter was, and it was so considered by the 
Joint Committees, that we should transmit the papers 
to your Excellency, and inform you of the names of 
the witnesses to prove the several points ; that then 
your Excellency, by your own authority, or that of 
Congress, would have procured the attendance of the 
witnesses. Two officers of Congress, not in any re 
spect under our control, are material witnesses, of 
which we informed Congress, requesting they might 
not proceed to Carolina till their testimony could be 
had. No notice was taken of it, and they set off 
about a week ago, and, as we have reason to think, 

VOL. ii. 24 
with a view to be absent till the trial is over. 
Colonel Fitzgerald, who is also a material witness, 
we suppose is in Virginia. 

As substantial justice, not a mere formality, is undoubtedly your Excellency s object on this occasion, 
we submit to your judgment whether a competent 
time for the attendance of those witnesses, at least, 
who are within reach, and the adjustment of some 
previous points, will not make a further delay neces 
sary. These points are, at whose expense and by 
whose procurement are the witnesses to be had ; and 
whether the service will not admit of the sitting of 
the Court at some nearer point than camp. If that 
cannot be, we must rely upon your Excellency to 
give further directions for the accommodation of the 
persons who may attend in behalf of the prosecution. 
As the idea expressed in your Excellency s letter 
does not correspond with the resolve of Congress 
transmitted to us, and differs from that entertained 
by the Joint Committee of Congress, Council, and As 
sembly, in which it was expressly declared that this 
Board was not to be considered as a party, we trust 
the proceedings in this business will conform to this 
idea ; otherwise, besides the inconvenience above men 
tioned, we shall be liable to a charge of inconsistency 
not well founded. We are, Sir, with every sentiment 
of respect and regard, 

Your most obedient, humble servants, 

JOSEPH REED. 

P. S. By the time this will reach your Excellen 
cy, there will remain but three days, so that we shall 
be glad to have as early an answer as possible ; for 
we beg leave to assure you, that no other delay is 
sought but what is necessary to proceed to business 
with effect. 
FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Philadelphia, 26 April, 1779. 

SIR, 

Your Excellency s favor of the 24th I had the 
honor of receiving last evening. I dined yesterday 
with the Minister of France, and find him still deter 
mined to set out for camp to-morrow. He sets out 
at seven in the morning, and intends lodging at 
Trenton. On Wednesday, he will be in camp, if no 
accident attends him ; but at what hour, cannot be 
ascertained, as the place he dines at is not yet determined on. I intend to wait upon him some time 
this morning, and learn more particularly his stages. 
Don Juan accompanies him. 

I thank your Excellency for your generous and 
obliging offer. Most certain, my inclination leads me 
to a resignation.* My reputation I value more than 
any advantages of gain ; and I consider it in great 
danger. I wrote your Excellency lengthy upon this 
subject yesterday, and therefore shall say but little 
upon it to-day. I intend to write to Congress to 
day, upon the subject of my apprehensions and determination ; and, if they do not give me those kinds 
of assurances, which are necessary to guard my re 
putation from malice and detraction. I shall insist 
upon leaving the business. The politics of Congress 
are really alarming, and the state of the finances 
astonishing ; where they will end, time only can unfold. 

Mr. Holker made many inquiries yesterday, respecting the temper and disposition of our army. He 
seemed desirous to know, whether peace, upon a plan 

* Resignation of the office of Quartermaster-General. 
of independence agreeable to the state of the alli 
ance, would be satisfactory ; the fishery to be con 
fined to the limits of the States. This would wellnigh ruin the Eastern States. Upon the whole, I 
think there have been some overtures made upon the 
subject of peace. It is said Russia on the part of 
England, and Spain on the part of France, are to 
stand mediators. This is merely conjectural. Mr. 
Jay says the Congress have no official propositions 
of peace ; but I believe it is beyond a doubt there 
have been debates upon the subject for several days 
past, particularly with regard to the fishery. 

I spent last evening with Governor Reed. I took 
occasion to hint that General Sullivan was to command the western expedition. lie took the alarm at 
once, and insisted he had no hopes of success, if he 
was to direct the operations. So deep are the prejudices of human nature. I had several hours con 
versation with him; and, I believe, satisfied him, as 
far as is possible, that the appointment was the re 
sult of the maturest deliberation. We were in pri 
vate. 

If I leave the Quarter-master s department, I should 
be glad of the South Carolina appointment. How 
ever, I shall wish to consult your Excellency upon 
the affair. 

We have an agreeable piece of intelligence from 
the eastward ; which is, that Colonel Campbell and 
thirty or forty officers, and six or eight sail of transports, bound to Europe, were taken lately, by a cou 
ple of our frigates, and carried into Boston. 

I had letters, last night, from South Carolina, 
which indicate a great disgust between the State 
and the Congress. They think themselves neglected. 
There is a large number of public vessels now on 
pay in the harbour, loaded with rice, which want to 
sail ; but the State is so much soured, that they will 
not grant exclusive privileges to the Continental ves 
sels from the embargo. The express is waiting ; I 
can only add, that I am, with esteem and affection, 
Your Excellency s obedient servant, 

NATHANAEL GREENE. 



FROM GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

Philadelphia, 26 April, 1779. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

You must permit me most heartily to congratulate 
you upon the very important intelligence which Monsieur Gerard will confidentially communicate to you. 
It is, and ought to be, a secret even from Congress, 
for which I need give you no reasons, as you are 
but too well acquainted with them. Measures have 
already been taken for obtaining the necessary sup 
plies, which the Minister will detail to you. These 
you will undoubtedly assist, as far as may fall within 
your line. 

When the enemy went to the Southern States, I 
considered it as a kind of madness, and I think they 
will feel the consequences ; but certainly it cannot be 
worth while to lose a moment unnecessarily in that 
quarter, for the climate will fight for us during the 
summer, and what shall remain may be completed in 
the autumn, if the other objects succeed. The first 
then should be, to bring on a considerable quantity 
of rice, which, together with flour from the Middle 
States, must be transmitted eastward, for the ulterior 
operations. To accomplish New York, perhaps the 
western detachments may be useful, as a feint; but 
24* 
will it not bo still more effectual to risk almost a re 
treat, in case of attack, by detaching to Albany, as 
if in prosecution of an expedition to Canada, calling 
upon Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey, for a 
body of militia, to answer the immediate purpose of 
protecting the country, and the remote purpose of 
more consequence ? This would probably lull the 
enemy into security, and false intelligence might be 
superadded to deceive them. In a few days the 
force, nevertheless, would be collected from Fort Ed 
ward and the Mohawk River to Albany, brought 

/ O 

down to the Highlands by water, and cooperate, &c. 
A part, with the militia of Connecticut and New York, 
might alarm the enemy at Fort Knyphausen, and 
make the necessary preparations to throw a bridge 
over the river at Haerlem. The main body, by possessing themselves of the landing opposite to Greenwich, 
might, at a proper opportunity, be thrown across. 
The Jersey militia would keep Staten Island in alarm, 
and secure the posts in the rear. The other troops 
might be landed to attack, as the enemy lauded to 
attack you. This, with a fire upon the town, would, 
in all human probability, effect the purpose. 

That point gained, Hhode Island w r ould be an easy 
acquisition, as the whole force might then be turned 
to that object, and then the great end would follow 
in its course. The magnitude and importance of 
things like these speak for themselves. The practi 
cability will, I think, be made evident, when the 
means are considered. You will see the necessity of 
opening yourself fully to M. Gerard upon your designs, and taking, with him, all proper measures. Catr 
tie, carriages for heavy artillery, and the like, should 
be assembled at Portsmouth, or some such convenient 
place. You will have the advantage, on this occasion 
at least, to be sure of your secrets ; and, indeed, such 
steps may be taken, that, in the ignorance of the 
enemy as to the state and probable state of things 
in the West Indies, it will be impossible for them to 
develop the combination of incidents, so distinct as 
those which may be necessary at once to fulfil the 
objects in view, and blind them. 

Excuse the length and tediousness of this letter, 
and believe me, with all the sincerity of private friend 
ship, superadded to public esteem, affectionately, 
Your friend and humble servant, 

GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia. 26 April, 1779. 

DEAR SIR, 

The questions contained in your favor of the 23d 
instant, are as important as the manner of introducing them is delicate. While the maritime affairs of 
the Continent continue under the direction of a Com 
mittee, they will be exposed to all the consequences 
of want of system, attention, and knowledge. The 
Marine Committee consists of a Delegate from each 
State. It fluctuates, new members constantly coming 
in, and old ones going out. Three or four, indeed, 
have remained in it from the beginning, and have a 
proportionate influence, or, more properly, interest in 
it. Very few of the members understand even the 
state of our naval affairs, or have time or inclination 
to attend to them. But why is not this system 
changed? It is, in iny opinion, convenient to the fa 
mily compact. The Commercial Committee are equally 
useless. A proposition was made to appoint a Commercial Agent for the States, under certain regula 
tions. Opposition was made ; the ostensible reasons 
were various ; the true reason was, its interference 
with a certain commercial agent in Europe, and his 
connections. 

You will, if I mistake not^ find M. Gerard disposed 
to be open and communicative. He has acquired an 
extensive knowledge of our affairs. I have no reason 
to believe he will use it to our prejudice. There is 
as much intrigue in this State House as in the Vati 
can, but as little secrecy as in a boarding-school. It 
mortifies me, on this occasion, to reflect, that the rules 
of Congress on the subject of secrecy, which are fartoo general, and, perhaps for that reason, more fre 
quently violated, restrain me from saying twenty 
things to you, which have ceased to be private. 

The state of our currency is really serious. Where, 
or by what means, the progress of its depreciation 
will be prevented, is uncertain. The subject is deli 
cate, but the conduct of some men really indicates at 
least great indifference about it. It will not be many 
days before measures^ having a great though not 
immediate influence on this subject, will be either 
adopted or rejected. I shall then have an opportu 
nity of being more particular. I am, very dear Sir. 
with perfect esteem and regard, 

Your most obedient servant, 

JOHN JAY. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL MCJNTOSH. 

Ccimp [Pittsburg], 27 April, 1779. 

SIR, 
In obedience to your Excellency s desire, I am to 
inform you of the situation of the several posts west 
of the mountains, and will add the reasons for esta 
blishing them, which may enable you to judge the 
better of their propriety. 

When I went there first, I found Fort Pitt, in the 
fork of Ohio, Fort Randolph, at the point or mouth 
of Great KenhaAva, three hundred miles down the 
river Ohio, and Fort Hand on Kiskiminitas. fixed 
stations, and garrisoned by Continental troops; and 
they are still kept up, as there is an independent 
company, raised upon the application of Colonel G. 
Morgan, for the sole purpose of maintaining each, 
and would not weaken the force I had to carry on 
the expedition. Besides these, there were thirty or 
forty other little stations, or forts, at different times 
garrisoned by militia, between Wheeling and Pittsburg, upon the waters of the Monongahela, the Kiskiminitas, and in the interior parts of the settlements, 
which were frequently altered, kept, or evacuated, 
according to the humors, fears, or interest of the 
people of most influence, which General Hand was 
obliged to comply with, as his chief dependence was 
upon militia. Those I endeavoured to break up, as 
soon as I could, without giving too much offence to 
people whose assistance I so much required, as they 
were very expensive, and of little service ; and, for 
that end, authorized the Lieutenants of Monongahela 
and Ohio county, to raise a ranging company, jointly, 
of one Captain, one Lieutenant, one Ensign, threeSergeants, three Corporals, and fifty-four privates, to 
scout continually along the River Ohio, from Beaver 
Creek downwards, where the Indians usually cross to 
annoy these two counties, and would secure them 
equally alike ; and the Lieutenant of Westmoreland 
county to raise two such companies to scour their 
frontiers, and protect them from scalping parties of 
the Mingoes or Northern Indians, which would ren 
der their little forts useless, and keep our regulars 
entire for other occasions. 

I found also, upon inquiry, a number of stores, or 
magazines of provisions, built at public expense by 
our Purchasing Commissary, at great distances, difficult 
of access, and scattered throughout all the counties, 
which required a number of men at each, for commissaries, coopers, packers, guards, &c. These I also discharged gave the stores up ; as, by the report of a 
Court of Inquiry, all the provision in them, which 
was intended for our expedition, proved to be spoiled, 
and altogether useless, through neglect; and, in place 
of them, I had one general storehouse built, by a fa 
tigue party, in the fork of the Monongahela Iliver, 
where all loads from over the mountains are now discharged, without crossing any considerable branch of 
any river, and can be carried from thence, at any 
season, either by land or water, to Big Beaver Creek; 
to which place I opened a road, and built a strong 
post, with barracks and stores, by fatigue of the 
whole line, upon the Indian shore of the Ohio Iliver, 
for the reception of all our stores, clear of all ferries 
and incumbrances, while our troops and supplies were 
coming up ; and, in case I was disappointed in both, 
as I had many reasons to apprehend, it would secure 
a footing so far advanced into the enemy s country, 
be better prepared for another attempt, and show 
them we were in earnest. 

So late as the 3d of November, Mr. Lockhart appeared at Beaver, with the cattle, extremely poor 
after driving them four or five hundred miles, and 
meeting with many obstacles, and could not slaughter 
them for want of salt. The same day I received a 



THE AMERICAN EEVOLUTION. 287 

message from the savages, reproaching our tardiness, 
and threatening all their nations would join to op 
pose my progress to Detroit, at Sugar Creek, a few 
miles below Tuscarawas, where they intend giving 
me battle. Immediately upon this intelligence, I or 
dered twelve hundred men to be ready to march, 
though we had only four weeks flour, which Mr. 
Lockhart fortunately brought with him, and left Lieu 
tenant-Colonel Campbell, with the rest of the troops, 
at Beaver, to escort and send after me the longlooked for supplies, so often and repeatedly promised 
by our Deputy Quartermaster-General, Mr. Steel, when 
they arrived, and, in the mean time, to finish the 
fort and stores. 

We were fourteen days upon our march, about 
seventy miles, to Tuscarawas, as our horses and cattle 
tired every four or five miles from our first setting 
out, and were met there only by some Cochocking 
Delawares and Moravians, who informed me the Chippewas and Ottowas refused to join the other Indians, 
upon which their hearts failed them, and none came 
to oppose our march. But, unfortunately, a letter, by 
express, from Lieutenant-Colonel Campbell, a little 
afterwards, informed me that no supplies came yet, 
and we had very little to expect during the winter, 
nor could he get the staff to account, or give any 
reasons for their neglect and deficiencies, which disappointed all my flattering prospects and schemes, 
and left me no other alternative than either to march 
back as I came, without effecting any valuable purpose, which the world would justly reflect upon me 
for, after so much expense, confirm the savages in 
the opinion the enemy inculcates of our weakness, 
and unite all of them, to a man, against us ; or, to 
build a strong stockade fort upon the Muskingum, 
and leave as many men as our provision would allow, 
to secure it until the next season, and to serve as a 
bridle upon the savages in the heart of their own 
country ; which last I chose, with the unanimous approbation of my principal officers, and we were em 
ployed upon it while our provision lasted ; and, in the 
mean time, thought it necessary to make some propo 
sals to all the Indians, if they came in a certain fixed 
time, to offer terms, and prevent our being molested. 
I am the more particular in giving my reasons for 
building Fort Laurens, as Morgan. Steel, and their 

O 7 O ^ J 

dependents, for want of other matter, have cried it 
down, as a designed slaughtering-pen, impossible to 
maintain ; and endeavoured to prejudice the whole 
country against it, although the former laid the plan, 
that was afterwards adopted, for taking and keeping 
Detroit. 

I always was, and still am, firmly of the opinion, 
that the only way to subdue Indians effectually, is, 
to carry a chain of forts directly into their country, 
so near as to support each other, the last always 
having the most force, and keep possession as we go; 
and to make excursions at pleasure into their towns, 
when in force, and opportunity offers, or retreat to 
them when weak, ill-supplied, or in other cases of 
necessity, which will often happen in Indian wars, 
and they know well how to take advantage of. 

By the best information I can get, there is no na 
vigation above the Wabash (which is eight or ninehundred miles below Pittsburg) to Lake Erie, equal 
to Muskingum, the way of Cuyahoga, or, the Alleghany, the way of Presrjue Isle ; and both of these 
are very uncertain, to go up against the stream, as 
the waters are often too high and rapid, and oftcner 
too low. Yet they may be serviceable at times. The 
Scioto and Hockhocking are mere rapid creeks, of no 
account, and are not much better than Beaver, al 
though traders have frequently brought their loaded 
canoes down each, in time of high freshets. 

For any further particulars, respecting the western 
department, I will attend in person, and beg leave to 
refer you to my general orders, and private instruc 
tions and letters. I have the honor to be, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

LACHLAN MC!NTOSH. 

P. S. If your Excellency is already determined 
to attack the Seneca nation from the westward as 
well as from the Susquehanna, at the same time, I 
would give it as my humble opinion, that the two 
garrisons on the Indian side of the Ohio should be 
maintained, and go no farther that way at present ; 
and to erect posts, at proper distances, up along the 
River Alleghaiiy, as far as, or farther than Kushkushing, which may be done by fatigue, when the 
party is going up, if the river is then too low, or, 
if it is in good order for the boats, after they strike 
the blow intended, in concert with the other army. 
And I should apprehend the same would be neces 
sary up the Susquehanna, as far as Tioga, which, I 
think, must undoubtedly remove the northern as well 
as the western tribes over the great Lakes, or bring 
them to terms, as they cannot otherwise think of 
planting so near our garrisons ; and show them w r e 
mean to retaliate their injuries by keeping possession 
of their country. 



VOL. ii. 25 
FROM MAJOR-GENERAL ARNOLD. 

Philadelphia, 5 May, 1779. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I have been honored with your Excellency s two 
letters of the 26th and 28th April, and am extreme 
ly sorry to find it should be thought there was a 
necessity of postponing my trial to so late a period 
as June or July, from no other reason than the Pre 
sident and Council of this State representing that 
the period appointed for the purpose, and the previous notice given, w r ere too short to admit of the 
necessary evidence being produced in time. 

Their pretence of the witnesses being in Virginia 
and Carolina, and the time being too short to pro 
duce them, I can view in no other light than a base, 
pitiful evasion; evidently calculated to put off the 
trial, that my character, unjustly aspersed, may still 
suffer, while the villains who have injured me cow 
ardly cloak themselves under office. They have had 
three months to look for evidence, and cannot pro 
duce one against me v I suppose the gentlemen they 
mention being in Carolina are my two Aids, gonethere, as volunteers, to spend the summer. They left 
this city long since the Court-Martial was ordered, 
and might easily have been detained, had the Council thought proper to do it. 

Believe me, my dear General, the w : hole is nothing 
more than pretence and artifice to delay the matter, 
the final determination of which must make the Pre 
sident and Council appear to the world in their true 
colors, as a set of unprincipled, malicious scoundrels; 
who have prostituted their honor and truth, for the 
purpose of gratifying their private resentment against 
an innocent person. 
From a candid view of the charges and whole pro 
ceedings against me, contained in the papers transmitted to your Excellency, you must be fully per 
suaded I have been unjustly accused, and that I have 
been refused justice from Congress on the report of 
their Committee. 

From a knowledge of my public conduct, since I 
have been in the army, no man is a better judge if 
I have merited the treatment I have received. If 
your Excellency thinks me criminal, for Heaven s sake 
let me be immediately tried, and, if found guilty, 
executed. I want no favor ; I ask only for justice. 
If it is denied me from your Excellency, I have 
nowhere to seek it but of the candid public, before 
whom I shall be under the necessity of laying the 
whole matter. Let me beg of you, Sir, to consider 
that a set of artful, unprincipled men, in office, may 
misinterpret the most innocent actions; and, by raising the public clamor against your Excellency, place 
you in the same disagreeable situation I am in. 

Having made every sacrifice of fortune and blood, 
and become a cripple in the service of my country, 
I little expected to meet the ungrateful returns I 
have received of my countrymen; but, as Congress 
have stamped ingratitude as a current coin, I must 
take it. I wish your Excellency, for your long and 
eminent services, may not be paid in the same coin. 

I have nothing left but the little reputation I have 
gained in the army. Delay, in the present case, is 
worse than death ; and, when it is considered that 
the President and Council have had three months to 
produce" their evidence, I cannot suppose the ordering 
a Court-Martial to determine the matter immediately, 
in the least precipitating the matter, which, in justice, 
ought to have been determined long since, and Avhich 



292 LETTEKS TO WASHINGTON. 

the President and Council wish to put off until the 
campaign opens \ concluding, undoubtedly, that the 
service will then prevent the Court from sitting, the 
trial postponed until the end of the campaign, and 
their cruel and villanous purposes answered. I must, 
therefore, entreat your Excellency that a Court-Martial 
may be ordered to sit as soon as possible ; and, if 
the Court find sufficient reasons, they will of course 
adjourn to a longer time. Not doubting my request 
will be granted, I have the honor to be, with the 
highest respect and esteem, your Excellency s 
Most obedient, humble servant, 

BENEDICT ARNOLD.* 

* Many other particulars respecting Arnold s trial by a Court-Martial, the charges brought against him, and a correspondence between 
General Washington and the Council of Pennsylvania on the subject, 
may be seen in Washington s Writings, Vol. VI., APPENDIX, pp. 514-530. 

Some time before the date of this letter, General Arnold seems to 
have entertained the project of forming a settlement in the western 
parts of the State of New York. On the 3d of February, 1779, Mr. 
Jay, and the other Delegates in Congress from that State, wrote as 
follows to Governor Clinton. 

" Major-General Arnold has in contemplation to establish a settle 
ment of officers and soldiers who have served with him in the present war, and to lay the necessary foundation without loss of time. 
From a desire to become a citizen of New York, he gives our State 
the preference, and now visits your Excellency to make the neces 
sary inquiries, it being out of our power to give him any information. 
The necessity of strengthening our frontiers is as obvious as the po 
licy of drawing the attention of the people to that quarter in season. 
Virginia, we learn, has taken the lead, and already passed laws for 
laying out a district of country for settlement, and assigning farms 
for their own soldiers, as well as those of Maryland, Delaware, and 
New Jersey. A strong predilection, however, prevails in favor of ourState, on account of its situation for trade, the acknowledged excel 
lency of its Constitution, and the steady and vigorous exertions of 
its Government. Nothing, we are persuaded, will be wanting for 
its rapid settlement and cultivation, but a w r ise and liberal system for 
the distribution of the public lands. 

" To you, Sir, or to our State, General Arnold can require no re 
commendation. A series of distinguished services entitle him to respect 
and favor." 
FROM MAJOR-GENERAL PUTNAM. 

Camp, Reading, 7 May, 1779. 

DEAR SIB, 

I am now taking the earliest opportunity to ac 
quaint your Excellency with my arrival in camp, to 
resume the command of my division. 

In the course of my tour to the eastward, I was 
at Hartford, during the sitting of the Assembly, who 
supposed, from a resolution of Congress which then 
lay before them, that all the men raised for the pub 
lic service in this State, under whatever description, 
whether artillery, dragoons, or artificers, were to be 
considered and credited as part of the eight batta 
lions of infantry, which were assigned as a quota to 
this State for the year 1779. 

This sentiment I opposed, at the time that the re 
turn of the number wanting to complete the eight 
battalions to the present establishment was laid be 
fore them. However, instead of raising fourteen hundred men, the deficiency of the two brigades under 
my command, they have made such deductions as 
leave, by their calculation, but six hundred men to 
be raised, and these are to be procured by voluntary 
enlistment. In consequence of this resolution, very 
few recruits, I fear, will be brought into the field, 
unless your Excellency should think proper to make 
some representations upon the subject to the Assem 
bly, who will sit the next week at Hartford ; and this, 
I presume, will be of more efficacy than any other 
means whatever. 

From the letters which passed in my absence, and 
which I have seen since my return, I find there was 
reason to apprehend the enemy would have been in 
25* 
motion before this time, and that, upon these appearances, it was judged necessary for all the troops 
which were under my command to march for the defence of the posts on the North River, except the 
first Connecticut brigade, which is now held in readi 
ness for that purpose. 

Although I do not in the least doubt the necessity 
and propriety of these measures, or w r ish to be in 
formed of the secrets of the ensuing campaign, yet 
it is exceedingly natural for me to have some little 
curiosity about my future destination ; whether I am 
to command those troops which have been with me 
the winter past, or in some new department, or whe 
ther I am to remain to guard the huts at this place. 
For after General McDougall is reenforced with the 
whole of my division (which will augment his to a 
very respectable command), nothing is said concerning the part which I am to act. However disagreea 
ble the situation may be, I know there is a delicacy 
in thinking and treating on a subject, where one s 
self is so intimately concerned, beyond the limits of 
which, I hope I shall not be accused of passing. 

I am unhappy to inform your Excellency that, 
upon the removal of our detachments from the seacoast, the enemy have exhibited some specimens of 
enterprise, so little usual for them. A few nights 
since, a small party from a whaleboat landed at 
Fairfield, surprised and carried off Brigadier-General 
Silliman, of the militia, and his son Major Silliman. 
Last night, another party landed at Middlesex, nearNorwalk, in quest of one Captain Selleck, who happened to be absent; but a Mr. Webb, late a Lieu 
tenant in the train, two of the inhabitants, and theingenious Dr. Bushnell, fell into their hands. As the 
last-mentioned gentleman, who was there in the 
prosecution of his unrernitted endeavours to destroy 
the enemy s shipping, is personally known to very few 
people, it is possible he may not be discovered by 
his real name or character, and may be considered 
of less consequence than he actually is. 

I am this instant informed, that about fifty of the 
enemy s plunderers landed at Telleck s Farms this 
morning, and carried off every man his sheep, that is 
to say, fifty, before the militia could be collected to 
oppose them. These incursions I expect will be fre 
quent and troublesome, but I hope not decisive, or 
very important. I am your Excellency s 

Most obedient and very humble servant, 

ISRAEL PUTNAM. 

P. S. I designed to have suggested to your Ex 
cellency the difficulties I am apprehensive will arise 
in procuring forage for the baggage-horses and teams. 
The grass is by no means sufficient to support them; 
and dry forage will be furnished with great difficulty, and I fear in very small quantities. 



FROM GOVERNOR LIVINGSTON. 

Trenton, 8 May, 1779. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have received the honor of your Excellency s fa 
vor of the 4th instant, and am very far from differing with you in sentiment, that the militia of the 
country should be drawn out by the authority of the 
Government, rather than by the pecuniary reward at 
tached to their service. This has always been my 
opinion ; and I have used my utmost exertions to get 
our militia upon that footing ; but it is a thing rather 
to be wished than expected, as our Legislature have 
uniformly manifested a disinclination to use compul 
sion. And when it is considered that the five shil 
lings per day which they have added to the pay of 
the militia, is not equal to what they have lately donefor the standing troops, I flatter myself that it will not 
be attended with the disagreeable consequences which 
your Excellency apprehends. The truth is, the mili 
tia have, of late, been so extremely backward to come 
out in the monthly service, that, without some addition to their past allowance, it was universally apprehended that our frontiers would be entirely left to 
the mercy of the enemy. But, for the reason yourExcellency assigns, I wish it had been by way of 
bounty, instead of augmentation of wages. 

The confidence your Excellency is pleased to place 
in my friendship affects me with inexpressible plea 
sure. I hope, Sir, you will never have reason to 
think it misplaced ; and your friendship, in return 
(which, indeed, so bought, is too cheap a purchase), I 
shall always consider is the greatest felicity of my 
life. The communication of your sentiments, in the 
freest manner, upon my public measures, I shall not 
only esteem an honor done me, as a convincing mark 
of your confidence, but shall ever endeavour to improve to the public emolument, which I am sure 
will be the only motive that suggests them. 

Please to accept of my acknowledgments for yourpromise of continuing the troops, or the principal 
part of them, at their present stations, a few days 
beyond the period limited in your former letter. 

Our political stupor and security, owing to our last 
year s successful campaign, and a thirst for the mam 
mon of unrighteousness, is truly lamentable ; and I 
am entirely of your Excellency s opinion, that there 
is the greatest reason to believe, that a vigorous 
prosecution of the war is determined on the part of 
the enemy. The slowness of our progress towards 
completing our quota of your reenforceinents, affects 
me with unspeakable chagrin. And I can assure 
your Excellency, that I do not lose a day, without 
exerting myself to accelerate the motions of some 
gentlemen, who ought not to wait a prompter to 
that indispensable measure. With every sentiment 
of esteem, I have the honor to be, dear Sir, 

Your Excellency s most humble servant, 

WILLIAM LIVINGSTON. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LORD STIRLING. 

Valley of Lebanon, 10 May, 1779. 

DEAR SIR, 

As my business with the Legislature of New Jersey will require my being at Trenton on Wednesday 
next, a visit to camp this week, which I intended, 
would be inconvenient, as it would keep me con 
stantly on the roads, with horses not in the best 
order. My being at Trenton last week, I believe, 
was favorable to the affairs of the Jersey brigade. 
The officers, under orders of march, sent up a very 
spirited memorial to the Legislature, and strongly 
pointed out the mischiefs which would immediately 
follow, if an equitable provision was not instantly 
made for the officers and men of the brigade. How 
ever true and just, the legislature could not brook 
the thought of being frightened into the measure ; 
and some of the obstinate members talked of rather 
seeing the brigade disbanded, than submit to the 
appearance of being bullied. As I saw that the appearance was now the chief obstacle in the way, I 
proposed to some of the leading members the expe 
dient of withdrawing the memorial, and the Legislature taking the matter up (to all appearance) of their 
own mere motion. This was instantly agreed to on 
all sides, and in a few hours pretty ample resolves 
were made by both Houses. Among the rest it was 
ordered that two hundred pounds be paid to each 
commissioned officer, and forty dollars to each soldier, 
to enable them to pay their debts, and to fit them 
for the campaign. The money for this purpose is 
already gone to Elizabethtown. 

I am sorry to find that the Legislature is slow 
in all business, particularly in determining on the 
means of recruiting their brigades, in which, as yet, 
they have made but little progress ; but they pro 
mise to give it their serious attention this week. 
My business seems to have a favorable reception 
among them; but it must be followed up closely, or 
it may halt by the way. 

Lady Stirling, and, all the gentlemen and ladies of 
these two families, join in their most respectful compli 
ments to your Excellency and Mrs. Washington, with 
Your Excellency s affectionate, humble servant, 

STIRLING. 



FROM GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Poughkcepsic, 18 May, 1779. 



DEAR SIR, 

I was honored with your Excellency s confidential 
letter of the 3d instant on the 12th, at Kingston, 
whither I was called by an alarm on the frontiers 
of Ulster county, occasioned by the appearance of 
about one hundred Indians and Tories, at Shendeacon, 
a small settlement in the gorge of the mountains, 
about twenty miles west of Kingston, and twelve 
from Marbletown. They were joined at this place by 
twenty-seven Tories from the east of Hudson s River. 
mostly Hessian deserters from the Convention troops. 
The sudden assembling of the militia deterred them 
from penetrating farther into the country, and prevented them from doing any material injury. 

It is needless to remark to your Excellency, that 
the execution of military business by militia officers 
is (from the want of activity and knowledge) seldom 
attended with the necessary despatch. Add to this, 
the raising of the levies for the defence of the fron 
tiers, and for filling up the Continental battalions, 
has been unavoidably much interrupted and retarded, 
in the frontier regiments, by almost continual alarms, 
since the departure of Colonel Cortlandt s regiment 
from the former station. I have, therefore, found it 
necessary to order the levies in this county to ren 
dezvous on the western frontiers of Ulster and Orange 
counties, to serve as a cover to the settlements, and 
to afford the militia leisure to make their drafts. The 
officer who commands them has orders, the moment 
this is accomplished, to forward such part of them as 
are to be annexed to the Continental battalions, with 
such additional number as can be spared, consistent 
with the security of the frontier settlements in that 
quarter, to Albany, by detachments, without the least 
delay. From the best information I have been able 
to obtain, there is a collection of Indians (consisting 
of those who are called Esopus Indians and other 
stragglers) and Tories, at Shohawken and Kollitye, 
on the Delaware, at one of which places it is said 
they have erected a block-house, or some other small 
works of defence. Our accounts were, that they con 
sisted of upwards of one hundred, and we have the 
best evidence of their having been lately joined by 
a very considerable additional number of Tories and 
deserters. It is this banditti, that have committed 
the most of the mischiefs which have been done in 
the counties of Ulster and Orange, and have occasioned all the late distressing alarms. They are supplied 
with provisions from the different settlements on the 
Delaware by the disaffected inhabitants who live on 
the frontiers. They are perfectly acquainted with the 
back country, and, I am apprehensive, will be very 
troublesome, by rendering the supplies to our western 
army precarious, and by keeping the back settlements 
in perpetual apprehensions of danger. 

The amazing tract of uninhabited and mountainous 
country, which lies between the intended route of 
our army and the western settlements, will afford 
them a secure asylum, as long as they can procure 
provisions. I would therefore submit to your Excel 
lency the propriety of marching a body of men into 
these parts, sufficiently large to scour that country, 
and rout the enemy there, and destroy the settle 
ments which feed and harbour them. As these set 
tlements are scattered and remote from each other, 
and as the enemy may be succoured from the con 
tiguous Indian settlements on the Suscjuehanna, not 
less than five hundred men will be competent to 
perform this business effectually. If the measure is 
approved by your Excellency, I will most readily 
furnish that number from the militia for this short 
service, and undertake to conduct the business my 
self. Nothing will be wanted, but the means of 
transporting about ten days or two weeks provision, 
and some other little matters from the Quarter-mas 
ter s department, which cannot be obtained otherwise, 
and which, I presume, may be spared from thence, 
without inconveniency, for so short a period. The 
horses wanted may either be impressed in the country by the Quarter-master, or, if purchased, returned 
before the campaign is fairly opened on the sea-coast. 
I am the more desirous of having this business 
accomplished, as it will relieve the inhabitants of the 
frontier settlements from any farther apprehensions of 
danger, and induce many, who have already abandoned 
their farms, to return to them, and also enable us to 
spare a greater proportion of the levies, raised for 
the defence of the frontiers, who are now stationed 
at the different passes, where they at best afford but 
a very partial security, for active service. It may 
be thought most advisable to delay the matter until 
the army, intended for the western service, begin to 
move ; in which case this may serve as a favorable 
diversion. The intermediate time may be only suffi 
cient to get out the men and make the necessary 
preparations. I have the honor to be, with the most 
perfect respect and esteem, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

GEORGE CLINTON. 



FROM GOVERNOR TRUMBULL. 

Hartford, 29 May, 1779. 

SIR, 

I suppose your Excellency is not wholly unac 
quainted with the character of Mr. David Bushnell, 
the bearer. He has had a liberal education, and discovers a genius capable of great improvement, in ma
VOL. ii. 26 
thematical ; philosophic, and mechanical literature. His 
inventions for annoying the enemy s shipping are new 
and ingenious, and, I trust, founded on such principles 
as would insure success. The vigilance practised in 
guarding the shipping has, I suppose, been the only 
means of preventing such execution as would have 
been attended with very alarming and beneficial con 
sequences. He has, with persevering and indefati 
gable industry, pursued the object with very little 
prospect of any other reward than that of serving 
his country. 

Misfortune and accident have prevented the execu 
tion of this design ; but there is reason to believe 
the explosion of one of his machines, taken on board 
one of the enemy s ships some time since, has greatly 
alarmed their marine, and made them very cautious 
in their approaches to any of the neighbouring shores. 

It is a pity that so promising a genius should 
not be encouraged. I understand an establishment of 
miners and sappers is forming under, your Excellen 
cy s direction, and would therefore take the liberty 
to propose to your Excellency, whether a person of 
his particular genius might not be very useful in 
that department. 

If you should not have filled, and cannot probably 
fill, the offices with gentlemen of greater merit and 
genius, permit me to recommend Mr. Bushnell to the 
office of Captain in that service, which, from his abili 
ties, genius, and integrity, I should judge him capa 
ble to execute with honor and advantage. The Council 
of this State, now convened, join with me in this re 
commendation. I am, with very high respect andesteem, your Excellency s 

Most obedient and very humble servant, 

JONATHAN TRUMBULL. 
FROM MAJOR-GENERAL ST. CLAIR. 

Pompton, 7 o clock A. M., 3 June, 1779. 

SIR, 

Colonel Burr arrived here about three o clock, from 
General McDougall, and brings intelligence of the surrender of the Fort upon Verplank s Point, yesterday, 
about eleven o clock, by capitulation. The garrison 
are prisoners of war, and the officers have liberty to 
wear their side-arms. 

I have no letter from General McDougall; but he 
is clearly of opinion the enemy mean to attack the 
posts (at least Fort Arnold, the carrying of which 
would open to them the navigation of the river) 
in the Highlands. Colonel Burr informs me, that, 
by landing near where Fort Montgomery stood, and 
marching to the Forest of Dean, they would fall into 
a clove, which runs entirely round that ridge on 
which the forts are situated, and through which a 
road might be made almost as fast as an army could 
march. By this clove General McDougall thinks the 
forts will be invested. Betwixt this clove and Smith s 
is a chain of hideous mountains, but through them 
are, no doubt, many passes, with which they may 
be made acquainted by the inhabitants whom they 
have debauched, and would thereby be able to give 
much annoyance to any convoys that might pass by 
Smith s, supposing it necessary to make use of that 
road. 

It seems to be General McDougall s wish that I 
should move to New Windsor, and he thinks that the 
occupying Butter Hill might prevent the attack upon 
Fort Arnold from the upper side. At the same time 
the state of the provision is very alarming. Not 
much above three weeks in the respective forts, and 
the militia called in; and their principal dependence 
for further supplies is upon their being transported 
across the country, from Sussex or Delaware. 

I think I could easily reach New Windsor, or at 
least be so far advanced, through the clove, as to be 
out of all clanger of being intercepted. But it is necessary first to have intelligence from the river, lest 
the parts of your army on this side of it should be 
too much separated, and exposed to be beaten by 
piecemeal. This I will endeavour to procure, and act 
according to circumstances, of which I will take care 
to give your Excellency notice. Notwithstanding the 
general opinion, that the forts are the enemy s object, 
Colonel Burr mentions circumstances that leave it 
still doubtful. Their troops are landed at various 
places on the east side of the river, and at Ilaverstraw on the west; and, after the surrender of the 
fort, their largest armed vessel, supposed to be of 
eighteen guns, and a galley, which had passed be 
fore, were seen towing down again. 

As the passage through the clove is somewhat dan 
gerous for single persons, I shall send two horsemen 
back with Colonel Burr, and shall, through him, communicate to General McDougall verbally. It may, 
perhaps, be necessary to form a march through the 
clove, in which case, I shall leave my baggage at this 
place, to be forwarded afterwards, as your Excellency 
may think proper. 

Our provision wagons will not be able to supply 
us, when at a greater distance, four only being al 
lowed to each brigade, and three of these broke down 
upon the road. I am, Sir, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

ARTHUR ST. CLAIR. 


FROM MAJOR-GENERAL MCDOUGALL. 

Budd s, in the Highlands, opposite to 

West Point, 4 June, 1779. 
SlR ; 

The enemy having, as I have informed your Ex 
cellency, landed at Teller s Point, on the olst ultimo, 
the troops under my command took a position in the 
Highlands, with their van at the Village. The prin 
cipal stores being removed from thence, and the enemy having my flanks open on the North River, on 
which he could move undiscovered at night, I judged 
it expedient to retire to this place, to keep open my 
communication with West Point, as well as to secure 
the pass in my rear to Fishkill. General Parsons 
joined me the 2cl instant. I have now here the threeContinental "brigades, and a good body of militia. 

The State has made a very great exertion to 
remove the stores and collect provision. We have 
double the quantity of provision secured which you 
mentioned necessary in your letter of the 2d, for a 
certain purpose. Yesterday I informed you of the 
enemy s advancing near the Continental Village. He 
retired in the afternoon toward Peekskill. His con 
duct is exceedingly inexplicable ; and it is extremely 
difficult to determine what is his object. He has now 
been seven days on the river, and has not made the 
despatch which he might, toward West Point, if that 
is his object. One thing, however, is very clear, that 
he can pillage the country, by drawing our attention 
to the fort, without any risk, and can always em 
bark. Perhaps these movements may be designed to 
divert us from our western expeditions. 

General Patterson not having returned from fur26* 
lough ; I appointed General Parsons to command at 
West Point, as he is well acquainted with the post. 

Yesterday Lieutenant-Colonel Sherman, with threecompanies of light infantry, marched downwards to 
reconnoitre, and skirmish with the enemy. He pro 
ceeded to Fort Independence, at the mouth of Peekskill Creek, but saw nothing of the enemy, although 
his small parties went near Peekskill ; only heard the 
noise of cattle, driving towards King s Ferry. This 
morning he discovered all their shipping (except two 
galleys) in Peekskill Bay, standing downward, and a 
few boats off Fort Independence. 

Sir Henry Clinton commanded in person the body 
which I told you were advancing yesterday. He was 
exceedingly cautious in his advance, and very particu 
lar in his inquiries. He asked where I was; whether 
I had destroyed the bridge* over Peekskill Creek; 
what force I had; whether the militia were alarmed; 
the situation of the country toward Fishkill, if strong; 
whether there was a great body of men at West 
Point ; and whether your Excellency s army was in 
motion this w T ay. 

Colonel Burr, whom I sent to General St. Glair, 
returned this morning. The General told him he 
would be at New Windsor this night. Provisions 
were sent from Newburg to Chester for his troops, 
which has removed the difficulty he apprehended. 

By comparing these accounts, it appears the enemy 
has given over his design against West Point. Fort 
de Lafayette, on Verplank s Point, surrendered the 
1st instant. The inclosed is a copy of a letter of 
Captain Armstrong, who commanded it ; and the 
terms of capitulation. 



* This bridge was carried away by a freshet. 
It is now past two o clock, P. M., and I nave no 
account of the enemy s moving up. I have the ho 
nor to be, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

ALEXANDER McDouGALL. 



FROM COLONEL WILLIAM MALCOM. 

On the road leading from Fort Montgomery 
towards the Furnace, 11 o clock, A. M., 5 June, 1779. 

SIR, 

I have this moment seen Captain Christie, who has 
communicated his business, and I am thereby induced 
to send a gentleman, Captain Hughes, a volunteer, on 
to your Excellency w r ith information. The enemy s 
fleet, consisting of about seventy sail, many of them 
very small, are at King s Ferry; a body of their 
troops are on the east side of the river, extending 
from the ferry upwards ; a very few on Stony Point ; 
but the greatest part of their army are on board. 
They have one hundred and fifty flat-bottomed boats 
with them, which are in Peekskill Cove. 

It is true that they have penetrated as far as the 
Village, and have burnt a few huts, &c. ; but have 
got no stores at all, nor have we sustained any loss, 
but the block-house at the ferry, with eighty men, 
&c., of which, in my opinion, nothing else could be 
expected. 

I command the militia of this State, on the west 
side of the river, and am posted on the cross-road, 
leading from Fort Montgomery (seven miles ad 
vanced from the garrison) to the Furnace, with parties advanced on the passes from Haverstraw, and 
scouts as far as that place. 
Your Excellency may be assured that every thing 
in my power shall be done for the defence of the 
garrison. If a few companies of light infantry could 
be sent me, it would be useful ; if so, they must turn 
off near Junes s, in the clove. 

If your Excellency should want any further intel 
ligence, I shall be happy to furnish it, and render 
every service in my power. General McDougall, 
with Huntington s and Parsons s brigades, is ninemiles below Fishkill ; Nixon s, opposite the fort. 
The Governor is in the field, with the militia on 
the east side of the river, also with General Mc 
Dougall. General Parsons took command of Fort 
Clinton, on the 3d instant, in the evening. The 
garrison consists of Learned s, Patterson s, and the 
Carolina brigade, about seventeen hundred strong ; 
the militia with me, as yet, about six hundred. 

If the fort is invested, it will fall. I am clearthat the enemy must be opposed in the passes and 
in the woods. I therefore have posted myself here ; 
but without more light troops, not a great deal can 
be expected. 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

WILLIAM MALCOM. 

P. S. I am now of opinion that the enemy will 
give up their design against the fort. A few days 
ago I thought it in danger; but I am persuaded, a 
body of troops posted where I am, at all events, 
would answer valuable purposes. The baggage of 
the army, perhaps, will go by "Windsor; but it is 
perfectly safe, and shorter, to cross the troops at 
the fort. 


FROM MAJOR-GENERAL ARMSTRONG.* 

Philadelphia, 5 June, 1779. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I am for some time possessed of your Excellency s 
favor of the 18th ultimo, and perfectly convinced of 
the truth and importance of the contents, but have, 
and shall, punctually observe that degree of reserve, 
which is equally just as it can be agreeable to yourwishes. 

You are not mistaken when, on a late amplification 
of certain powers, you imagine Congress had an eye 
to something particular, or out of the common road. 

The fact was this; that we were taught to believe 
the return of the Count d Estaing to our coasts be 
fore this time, and that, by the assistance of his 
fleet, you will not be surprised that flattering and 
new manoeuvres should be formed in embryo, and the 
event of his coming be followed with hostile attacks 
on the enemy at New York and Rhode Island. Those 
sanguine ideas so far operated on the minds of 
some gentlemen, as led them to move, that your Ex 
cellency should be directed to recall General Sulli 
van, &c. ; but these motions were so far overruled, as 
to leave you to the exercise of your own judgment, 
on the campaign at large. But upon what ground 
we were amused with the coming of the Count, and 
these hopes have so early died away, are matters 
that to me require some farther explanation. 

The business of finance, although not yet finished 
according to the system proposed, has, nevertheless, 

* An officer of the Pennsylvania militia, and now a Delegate in Con 
gress, from that State ; distinguished for his military services on the 
frontiers in the previous war. For some time he was a Brigadier- General in the Continental service, which office he resigned in April, 1777. 
passed sundry stages apparently proper, and from 
which I expect, at least, a sudden period to the depreciation of our money. Indeed, the mere expecta 
tions of the populace, although our resolutions have 
not yet appeared, joined to the efforts of the sundry 
Committees in this State, have not only prevented a 
farther depreciation, but have actually lessened the 
price of several of the more, necessary articles of life. 

Foreign affairs continue to perplex and procrasti 
nate. Who shall be the great men over the water; 
and whether a common right in the fishery shall, like 
other claims of right and convenience, be made an ulti 
matum, in case Great Britain should offer to concedeour independence ; or whether the fishery, at least for 
the present, shall be left to the effect of our Minis 
ter s negotiation, are subjects of tedious and disagreeable debate. It may be feared these points are blended, the business itself, and who shall transact it. 
Whoever wishes to be the Minister, may wish the 
latitude of negotiation. Others apprehend the risk 
might be too great in the hands of a Minister. How 
ever this important matter may be, many things, unjust and impolitic, have been said and propagated 
about it (I mean the fishery), by making unnecessary 
obstacles about it, giving it an undue and unnatural 
weight in the business of peace, as though itself 
should be the only sine qua non of Great Britain. 
And, if left on the easy footing of negotiation, at 
least oblique insinuations have been held up to the 
people, that we might have our independence con 
ceded us whenever we please, and might have had 
peace before now ; and thus have the true grounds of 
the debate been much shaded by a parcel of false 
hypotheses and delusive stuff. 

It is also true, that several gentlemen, far removed 
from any expectation or wish to go to Europe, think 
the fishery ought to be left to the "best terms the 
Minister can make about it; being of opinion, that it 
is not essential to the well-being of these States ; that 
the Eastern States only, or more principally, must be 
gainers by it, viewing it as the only hinge upon 
which peace or war must turn. In this light, I con 
fess, I am neither willing or able to conceive it, be 
lieving that the real springs of peace or war must 
arise from sources considerably diiferent from that of 
the fishery. 

The army is also a topic of great consideration ; I 
mean its smallness and dissatisfaction. Glad would I 
have been to have it taken up in a series or chain 
long ago ; but our unpardonable, or at least unac 
countable delays on other business, have prevented 
that design, which, I am persuaded, if not early at 
tended to, must undo our cause. The business of 
half-pay for life, of which I have been fond, as the 
best compound of justice and gratuity to our soldiery, 
I find, will meet with more opposition in Congress 
than I had imagined. Many declaim against the po 
licy of that measure, but say they are ready to agreeto something tantamount, by reducing the necessaries 
of life to a moderate price, and making the pay good 
from the beginning, as though there had been no depreciation. Which of these modes Congress ought to 
adopt, I am at a loss to know; but would gladly 
urge the best. 

By a letter of the 6th instant, from Captain Kearsley, I am pleased to find he is returned to the service, and gone up the Susquehanna to join the troops 
with General Sullivan. 

Kearsley I take to be one of those officers, who 
will do his duty from principle, and make no doubt 
a line from your Excellency will at once please and 
fix him. 

Our reputed success on the llth of May, nearCharleston, becomes more and more doubtful, and 
may probably turn out to be only a change of route 
or manoeuvre, upon which Pulaski has charged and 
somewhat harassed their rear. Yet may we have some 
good news from General Lincoln, although the enemy s position, said to be in an island, must render 
his access difficult. The enemy s acquisitions of places 
on the North River are very interesting, and must 
call the attention of the States to strengthen the 
army, of which I am afraid little to the purpose can 
be done before the winter. With perfect respect, I 
have the honor to be, 

Your Excellency s affectionate, humble servant, 

JOHN ARMSTRONG. 



I have just seen an intelligent young gen 
tleman, who left Dublin on the 1st of March last ; 
who informs us that only about fifteen hundred troops 
were sent, he thinks, to Jamaica ; that Britain cannot 
soon send any considerable force to America, as no 
preparation of that sort was made when he left Ire 
land, but the prevailing opinion rather, that no more 
troops would be sent to the Continent of America 
this season ; that a great majority of the Irish were 
in love with the American cause, and much opposed 
to the late speeches of the King ; that the public 
orders for fasts and prayers for his Majesty s arms, 
were highly contemned by the first gentlemen in 
town and country, as farcical and hypocritical. 
FROM THOMAS JEFFERSON, GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA. 

Williamsburg, 23 June, 1779. 

SIR, 

I have the pleasure to inclose you the particulars 
of Colonel Clark s success against St. Vincent s, as 
stated in his letter but lately received; the messen 
ger, with his first letter, having been killed. I fearit will be impossible for Colonel Clark to be so 
strengthened as to enable him to do what he desires. 
Indeed, the express who brought this letter gives us 
reason to fear St. Vincent s is in danger from a large 
body of Indians, collected to attack it, and said, when 
he came from Kaskaskia, to be within thirty leagues 
of the place. 

I also inclose you a letter from Colonel Shelby, 
stating the effect of his success against the seceding 
Cherokees and Chuccamoggas. The damage done them 
was, killing half a dozen, burning eleven towns, and 
twenty thousand bushels of corn, collected probably 
to forward the expeditions which were to have been 
planned at the Council, which was to meet Governor 
Hamilton at the mouth of the Tennessee, and taking as many goods as sold for twenty-five thousand 
pounds. 

I hope these two blows, coming together, and the 
depriving them of their head, will, in some measure, 
effect the quiet of our frontiers this summer. We 
have intelligence, also, that Colonel Bowman, from 
Kentucky, is in the midst of the Shawanee country, 
with three hundred men; and hope to hear a good 
account of him. The inclosed order, being in its na 
ture important, and generally interesting, I think it 
proper to transmit it to you, with the reasons sup 
porting it. It will add much to our satisfaction, to 

VOL. ii. 27 
know it meets your approbation. I have the honor 
to be, with every sentiment of private respect and 
public gratitude, Sir, 

Your most obedient and most humble servant, 

THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

P. S. The distance of our northern and western 
counties from the scene of southern service, and the 
necessity of strengthening our western quarter, have 
induced the Council to direct the new levies from the 
counties of Youghiogania, Ohio, Monongalia, Frederick, 
Hampshire, Berkley, Buckingham, and Greenbrier, 
amounting to somewhat less than three hundred men, 
to enter into the ninth regiment at Pittsburg. The 
aid they may give there will be so immediate and 
important, and what they could do to the southward 
would be so late, as, I hope, will apologize for their 
interference. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL PARSONS. 

Wilton, 11 July, 1779. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

In my last I informed that the enemy landed last 
night. At four this morning, the enemy, on their ad 
vance, were met by the militia,, and some skirmishing 
ensued, but without any considerable effect on either 
side. At about six o clock, the troops under General 
Wolcott and my small detachment of one hundred 
and fifty Continental troops were joined, and took 
possession of an eminence at the north end of the 
town. The enemy advanced in our front, and on ourleft flank, until about nine o clock, when they were 
checked in their progress by the vigorous exertions 
of the parties of militia and Continental troops sent 
out to oppose them; and, in turn, were compelled to 
retire from hill to hill, at some times in great disor 
der. We continued to advance upon them until neareleven o clock, when, a column having nearly gained 
our right flank, the militia in the centre gave way, 
and retreated in disorder. This ga*ve the enemy possession of our ground. 

General Wolcott, who commanded, exerted himself, 
on this occasion, to rally the troops, and bring them 
to order again, but without effect, until they had re 
tired about two miles, when some troops, being again 
formed, returned to the aid of the right and left 
wings, who had retired but a small distance and in 
order. With these the enemy were pursued again, 
and retreated with precipitation to their ships. I 
have the pleasure to assure your Excellency the Con 
tinental troops, without exception, they being all en 
gaged, behaved with the greatest bravery. Captain 
Betts, who was the first engaged with the enemy, 
and who continued longest in action, deserves parti 
cular notice, for his great fortitude and prudent con 
duct in the battle. He continued advancing on the 
enemy until the centre of the main body gave way ; 
and he and his party, advanced near a mile at the 
time, by his prudence were able to effect a regularretreat, without any considerable loss. Captain Eells 
on the right, and Captain on the left, were also 

engaged; and, when obliged to retire, kept their or 
der, and retreated with regularity. A body of the 
militia (I think they were commanded by General 
Porter), and another considerable detachment, deserve 
honorable mention to be made of them. 

I am not yet able to ascertain our own or the 
enemy s loss; but in my next shall be able to give 
you a more particular account. In my handful of 
Continental troops, I have lost five men killed; Lieu 
tenant Gibbs, and six privates, wounded. I do not 
know of any missing. Some loss the militia have sus 
tained. I am satisfied the loss of the enemy must 
have been considerable. About twenty boats landed on 
the west side the harbour, at Sock, and immediately 
began to set fire to the buildings. They completed 
burning the town (Norwalk) at about twelve o clock. 
This appears to have been their sole business, as they 
did not stay to carry off any plunder of considerable 
value. A few Tory houses are left, which, I hope, 
our people will burn, as the owners are here, and 
have committed no act by which the public can seize 
them. I imagine Stamford will be the next object to 
wreak their hellish malice upon. To that place I 
shall repair to-morrow. I am fully persuaded that 
five hundred more men, such as the brave militia I 
have before mentioned, and the one hundred and fifty 
Continental troops, would have given the enemy a 
.total defeat. The numbers of the enemy were about 
two thousand ; our numbers between nine hundred 
and one thousand. I am, dear General, 

Your obedient Servant, 

SAMUEL II. PARSONS. 



FROM PRESIDENT REED. 

In Council, Philadelphia, 14 July, 1779. 

SIR, 

Your Excellency s favor of the 5th instant was 
duly received, and, though it was and is the uni 
versal opinion, that the number of men under General Sullivan is greater than can be fed, when he proceeds a little further on the expedition, yet we gave 
early and peremptory orders to the companies of 
rangers to join him, as soon as they were completed 
to any tolerable number. We also directed the mili 
tia of the adjoining counties to give all possible aid, 
as we were resolved that, should the expedition fail 
of success, no imputation should justly fall upon the 
State of Pennsylvania, Our prospects of raising these 
men were very flattering, the success in recruiting, 
for a little time, having equalled, or rather exceeded, 
our expectations ; but the Quarter-master s depart 
ment having occasion for a number of bateau-men, 
and offering forty-five pounds per month, and a ration 
and a half per day, were terms so superior to what 
we had to offer, that the service has languished ever 
since, and it is very doubtful whether they will, or 
can be completed. 

It is a general opinion, that the boatmen might 
have been procured upon more favorable terms ; but, 
as it was a necessary service, and well meant, we 
can only wish better information had been had. 
Every State and country is limited in its powers, 
and if its resources are drawn off in one service, 
they cannot be had in another. Five hundred are en 
gaged in this boat service, all of this State, besides 
which, the deputies, assistants, and helpers, amount 
to a great number. "We would not infer from this 
that they are unnecessary, but to account for the deficiencies of these companies, which otherwise would 
have been very complete. 

We beg leave to refer your Excellency to the in 
closed letter, which will show that no orders have 
been wanting on our part, and that there is every 
disposition in the officers under us to execute them, 
as far as they can.

It is much to be wished that, instead of troubling 
your Excellency with this circuitous mode of applica 
tion, General Sullivan would address himself directly 
to us. We have assured him that we will endeavourto give him every aid and assistance in our power, 
and, when it cannot be done, we shall, at least, be 
able to give him sufficient reasons. We have not 
had a line from him since he left Easton; and, though 
we know from other advices that these companies 
had not joined, we had not any information on the 
subject from the General himself. 

We are very sensible, Sir, that this expedition has 
received all possible aid from you. It has also been 
fostered and cherished by this State. We have drawn 
off our wagons at four pounds ten shillings per day, 
which will not pay the drivers and shoe the horses. 
We have stopped a great number of ploughs. The 
encouragement of one hundred dollars, by Congress, 
was so small, that the State added shoes, shirts, leg 
gings, blankets, and arms, amounting to triple the sum. 
Our orders and measures since, would show your Ex 
cellency our anxiety on the subject in so striking a 
view as to exclude any supposition that any thing 
is omitted, in our power, to procure the desired suc 
cess. But we cannot change the course of things 
and order of Providence, to advance General Sulli 
van s views, be they ever so apparently salutary ; and 
we hope his recollection of past periods, wherein ho 
has seen you rise superior to disappointments and 
deficiencies far more important, will strengthen his 
mind to obviate those which may occur to him. With 
perfect esteem and respect, I have the honor to be, 
your Excellency s 

Most obedient, and very humble servant, 

JOSEPH REED. 
FROM MAJOR-GENERAL HOWE. 

Peekskill, Saturday, 17 [July], 1779. 

SIR. 

I joined the division at the Continental Village, the 
last evening, and arrived at this post at five this 
morning. I now only halt for the return of a recon 
noitring party, sent out last night, and shall imme 
diately proceed to execute your Excellency s orders. 
The field-pieces you suppose to have been taken on 
with the brigades, are not with them. General Nixon 
informs me there are not any attached to his bri 
gade y those of General Patterson I think to send 
for. 

Colonel Putnam informs me, that Peekskill would 
be a very precarious situation, as the enemy, by more 
than one road, and by a march of a few hours, might 
post themselves in our rear, and cut off the retreat ; 
and that, without horsemen to act as videttes, we 
could not receive information in time to prevent it. 
If, therefore, there should be occasion to take post in 
this neighbourhood, I shall endeavour to fix on a situ 
ation not liable to this inconvenience. 

Lest any difficulty should arise as to the pieces, I 
should be much obliged to you, Sir, to send such 
orders as may hasten them to me. I am, Sir, with 
the greatest respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

EGBERT HOWE. 

P. S. The field-pieces, attached to these brigades, 
I am just informed, are all at Fishkill.*

Point, on the night of the 15th of July, are in Washington s Writings,

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL HOWE. 

Before Verplanck s Point, 17 July, 1779. 

DEAR SIR, 

I am now very near Verplanck s Point, which I 
have been reconnoitring, and shall still more fully 
inspect. "What I discern of the works appears to be 
properly constructed, and seems capable of considera 
ble defence, if the numbers and spirit of the garrison 
are adequate to the task. The troops, except such 
as I have fixed at particular passes, are with me. 
The heavy cannon are, by this time, I hope, at the 
Continental Village ; and I have sent to hasten them 
as fast as possible. The ammunition appointed for 
them was not over the ferry when I left it, I gave 
the officers orders to expedite it. 

Understanding from your Excellency, that the can 
non and the requisites for them had been ordered, 1 
did not presume to interfere before with the detail. 
I doubt not that, if your Excellency s orders have 
been complied with, I shall receive the ammunition 
with the pieces ; but the field-pieces, I informed you 
this morning, were at Fishkill. 

If works should be necessary to be thrown up, I 
am not furnished with one intrenching or other tool 
for the purpose. Should your Excellency think pro 
per, please order them, arid any other articles requi 
site. If the cannon do not get up in time to-day, 
shall retire till I meet them, if their security makes 
it necessary. 

The men are out of provisions to-day, and I have 
no Commissary to apply to for a supply. Will it not 
be convenient to your Excellency to order some, as 
I am without wagons to bring it? I had sent 
videttes down the roads you mentioned, before the 
receipt of your letter; but, as I am entirely unfurnished with horsemen, I was obliged to employ such 
of the country people as Colonel Putnam recommended. 

Early this morning I sent an express to General 
Heath, and am sorry I had not then your Excellen 
cy s instructions with regard to horse. If I can pro 
cure an express, I shall send to the general again, 
as horsemen are so essential to our situation. Being 
informed of a militia troop of horse about twelve 
miles distant, I have desired Captain Delaval, who 
commands them, to join me. Whether in this appli 
cation I shall be successful, remains a matter of 
speculation. 

Inclining to make short work of the enemy, I or 
dered the engineer to reconnoitre their works, which 
he did at a very short distance. He reports, that 
storming them, at present, would be ineligible. I 
take the liberty to refer your Excellency for ournumbers to Lieutenant Slade, not choosing to transmit a written return of them. With the greatest 
respect. I am your Excellency s 

Very obedient and humble servant, 

EGBERT HOWE. 

P. S. The chaplain of General Patterson s brigadejust informs me that, as he passed our cannon, he 
perceived the horses were jaded, and he thought they 
would not be up to-night. 

I think it necessary to add, that Colonel Putnam 
has informed me there is more danger of being dou 
bled between Continental Village and Peekskill, than 
between Peekskill and Verplanck s Point. 



322 LETTERS TO W ASIIINGT ON. 

FIIOM MAJOR-GENERAL MCDOUGALL. 

West Point, 7 o clock, P. M., 17 July, 1779. 
SlR ? 

Your Excellency s favor of this day is this moment 
received. Colonel Hamilton s, of equal date, reached 
me at three, P. M. Only eight of the boats written 
for can be procured, and are now ready. It is impossible, at this post, to furnish the horse-harness desired ; 
for few of the artillery, brought here, are accompanied 
with horse-harness. I have, however, directed the 
Quarter-master to write immediately to New Windsor 
for them. If they can be had, they will be sent 
with all possible despatch. The pettiaugers are or 
dered ; but watermen are so scarce for the demand, 
and many of them marched with Patterson s brigade, 
I fear the number necessary cannot be got to man 
the galley. Every effort, however, will be made. I 
have the honor to be 

Your Excellency s humble servant, 

ALEXANDER MCDOUGALL. 

P. S. If my conjectures are just, as to the use to 
be made of the galley, I fear it is out of our power 
to send her properly provided to take in heavy can 
non. 



FROM GOVERNOR JEFFERSON. 

Williamsburg, 17 July, 1779. 



SIR, 

I some time ago inclosed to you a printed copy of 
an order of Council, by which Governor Hamilton 
was to be confined in irons, and in close jail. This 
has occasioned a letter from General Phillips, of which 
the inclosed is a copy. The General seems to sup 
pose that a prisoner on capitulation cannot be put 
into close confinement, though his capitulation shall 
not have provided against it. My idea was, that all 
persons, taken in war, were to be deemed prisoners 
of war ; that those who surrender on capitulation (or 
Convention) are prisoners of war also, subject to the 
same treatment with those who surrender at discre 
tion, except only so far as the terms of their capitu 
lation or Convention shall have guarded them. In 
the capitulation of Governor Hamilton (a copy of 
which I inclose), no stipulation is made as to the 
treatment of himself, or those taken with him. The 
Governor, indeed, when he signs, adds a flourish of 
reasons, inducing him to capitulate, one of which is, 
the generosity of his enemy. Generosity, on a large 
and comprehensive scale, seems to dictate the making 
a signal example of this gentleman ; but waiving that, 
these are only the private motives inducing him to 
surrender, and do not enter into the contract of Co 
lonel Clark. 

I have the highest idea of the sacredness of those 
contracts which take place between nation and na 
tion at war, and would be among the last on earth 
who should do any thing in violation of them. I 
can find nothing in those books, usually recurred to 
as testimonials of the laws and usages of nature and 
nations, which convicts the opinions I have above ex 
pressed, of error ; yet there may be such an usage as 
General Phillips seems to suppose, though not taken 
notice of by these writers. 

I am obliged to trouble your Excellency, on this 
occasion, by asking of you information on this point. 
There is no other person, whose decision will so authoritatively decide this doubt in the public mind, 
and none with which I am disposed so to comply. 
If you shall be of opinion, that the bare existence of 
a capitulation in the case of Governor Hamilton, pri 
vileges him from confinement, though there be no article to that effect in the capitulation, justice shall 
most assuredly be done him. The importance of this 
question in a public view, and my own anxiety, under a charge of a violation of national faith by the 
Executive of the Commonwealth, will, I hope, apolo 
gize for my adding this to the many, many troubles 
with which I know you to be burdened. I have the 
honor to be, with the most profound respect and es 
teem, your Excellency s 

Most obedient, and most humble servant, 

THOMAS JEFFEHSON. 

P. S. I have just received a letter from Colonel 
Bland, containing information of numerous desertions 
from the Convention troops (not less than four hundred in the last fortnight). He thinks he has reason 
to believe it is with the connivance of some of their 
officers. Some of these have been retaken, all of 
them going northwardly. They had armed themselves 
with forged passports, and with certificates of having 
taken the oath of fidelity to the State, some of them 
forged, others really given by weak magistrates. I 
mention this to your Excellency, as perhaps it may 
be in your power to have such of them intercepted, 
as shall be passing through Pennsylvania and the 
Jerseys. 

Your letter, inclosing the opinion of the Board of 
Officers, in the case between Allison and Lee, is come 
safe to hand, after a long passage. It shall be an 
swered by next post. 


FROM MAJOR-GENERAL HOWE. 

Camp, near Yerplanck s Point, 
4 o clock, P. M.; Sunday, 18 July, 1779. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have received intelligence, three different ways, 
of the approach of the enemy. One informs me, that 
" several thousands of the enemy were, yesterday, onemile below White Plains, moving towards this place;" 
another, a verbal account, says that about two hundred of their horse were seen on some heights at 
New Bridge, by the informant. As I cannot doubt 
the credibility of these accounts, from the character 
of the persons who gave them, and as, consequently, 
there is the greatest reason to believe the enemy are 
making this effort to get me between two fires, duty 
and prudence enjoin me to avoid the snare. But, unwilling to risk too much on my own judgment, I have 
consulted that of the Brigadiers, who are of opinion, 
that no time should be lost to effect a retreat. Ano 
ther express is just arrived, and confirms me in the 
above. I shall take post on the most convenient part 
of my route, and inform your Excellency farther. I 
have the honor to be, with great esteem, your Excel 
lency s 

Most obedient and humble servant, 

EGBERT HOWE. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL HEATH. 

Bald Hill, 18 July, 1779. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

Yesterday, at half past nine o clock, A. M., I re 
ceived your orders to march for Peekskill. At twelve, 
VOL. ii. 28 
the division began their march ; marched fifteen miles,, 
and halted ; at three, this morning, pursued the march, 
and reached Peekskill at half past three, P. M. On 
my arrival, I found General Howe had sent off his 
cannon, and his division was filing off towards the 
Highlands. The enemy appeared to be advancing in 
force near the New Bridge. I threw my division in 
the rear, sent Patterson s to the Gorge, and Nixon s, 
Parsons s, and Huntington s to these heights, not being able to get further with the baggage. 

Early in the morning I shall send on the baggage 
into the Highlands, and follow with the troops, giving the enemy an offer of attacking us in rear, if 
they choose it. Sir Henry Clinton is once more disappointed, after marching all day on my flank. For 
tunately, I have formed a junction. Since I arrived 
here, I have been honored with yours of yesterday, 
inclosing one to General Glover. Immediately on the 
receipt of your letter, I sent off an express to hurry 
his brigade on, with all possible expedition, by the 
shortest and best route ; and directed the express to 
take fresh horses. I &lt; shall critically observe the mo 
tions of the enemy in the morning. I have the 
honor to be, with the greatest respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

WILLIAM HEATH. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL HEATH. 

Mandeville s, 19 July, 177!). 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I was honored with your favor of yesterday, on 
niy way from Bald Hill to this place. I had before 
ordered Parsons s brigade to encamp near Robinson s ; 
Huntington s, near the place where Parsons s encamped 
before they left this place; Patterson s, between that 
place and Danforth s ; Nixon s, at the gorge of the 
mountains. Glover s is not yet arrived. May I be 
permitted to request that, when it does, it may be 
attached to General Howe s division? 

By intelligence received since I had the honor to 
write in the morning, I learn that the enemy s ad 
vanced sentinels and videttes were posted, the last 
night, on the New Bridge. They appear to advance 
with the greatest caution. I think Major-General 
Howe was very fortunate in making his retreat the 
instant he did. Had he remained, I think he would 
have been Burgoyned; his intelligence being good, 
he escaped it. I have taken measures to obtain in 
telligence from every quarter on this side the river. 
Such as I receive shall be transmitted. I have or 
dered the light-horse to the left, and am determined 
to harass the enemy, if possible. I have the honor 
to be, with the greatest respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

WILLIAM HEATH. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL HOWE. 

Mandeville s, opposite West Point, 19 July, 1779. 

DEAR SIR, 

Deprived, as I was by the enemy s advances, of 
reducing their post at Verplanck e, which, but for 
that event, I persuade myself I should have effected, 
I had nothing left but to retreat, which I performed, 
and was so happy as to be joined by General Heath 
at Peekskill. My situation was critical, and it was 
well for me that I had found means to obtain tolerably exact information of the enemy s motions. 
Though disappointed of the ultimate end of my aim, 
if my conduct meets the approbation of my General, 
I shall be happy. 

I beg leave to suggest the exceeding weak state 
of my division, and venture to express a wish, that 
an addition could be made to it. General Heath 
mentions Glover s brigade as unattached. I have the 
honor to be, with all respect, your Excellency s 
Obedient and very humble servant, 

ROBERT HOWE. 



FROM COLONEL RICHARD BUTLER. 

Fort Montgomery, 9 o clock, 19 July, 1779. 

SIR, 

General Wayne, being indisposed, desires that I 
inform your Excellency that I remained to see the 
whole of the troops off the ground, and just as the 
last party moved, a cannonade from the enemy s ships 
began to cover their Janding. At five o clock they 
took immediate possession of the Point and disman 
tled w r orks, confining themselves within the morass 
that encircles the Point, on which they placed a 
guard, and confined themselves within their sentries. 

I observed some officers busily pointing from place 
to place, as if they were directing the repair of the 
works. I counted fifty-eight sail of shipping, of dif 
ferent kinds, in view, about twenty of which were 
square-rigged; and about ten of these I took to bo 
frigates and sloops of war, from eighteen to thirty 
guns. I think they had landed about six hundred 
men, and were still very busily landing. Four large 
transports were very full of men, that I think nonehad been sent from, as the boats were still plying 
from other vessels. They have many galleys and 
armed boats. The General thought it absolutely necessary your Excellency should have this intelligence 
immediately, and I have given it as circumstantially 
as in my power. I am, with respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

RICHARD BUTLER. 

P. S. It is my opinion they will soon march for 
West Point, from the number of small sail-boats they 
have, as they had no need for these to land at Stony 
Point, and they are empty. 



FROM WILLIAM FITZHUGH. 
Lower Marlborough [Maryland], 17 August, 1779. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I had the honor to receive your favor of the 25th 
of June, and should have wrote you long before this, 
but, as the meeting of our General Assembly was at 
hand, I waited for the event, in order to give you 
the result of their proceedings, especially relating to 
our army, speculating, engrossing, &c., &c. 

We have passed an act to provide annually for 
our officers one complete suit of regimentals, fourshirts, and an allowance of rum, sugar, tea, coffee, 
chocolate, tobacco, &c., at the current prices of such 
articles when the war commenced; and left it at the 
officer s choice to receive, if he pleased, seven hundred and fifty pounds currency, instead of the regi 
mentals and shirts; and have provided an allowance 
of rum and tobacco for the non-commissioned officers 
28* 
and soldiers. We have also continued the prohibition 
on the export of all kinds of provision, and passed 
an act to prevent forestalling and engrossing, and to 
appreciate our money, with very severe penalties ; 
and have appointed a Committee in every county to 
see it duly executed. By this act, all provisions purchased, except what may be thought sufficient to 
serve the family of the purchaser twelve months, are 
seizable for the public use; and there is such provi 
sion made, respecting the sale of goods and merchan 
dise, as will nearly amount to the stoppage of trade, 
and, I hope, will have a good effect, especially as we 
have, at the same time, laid a tax on all estates, real 
and personal, of thirteen pounds in the hundred, to 
be collected by the first day of November next. 

These several regulations, with heavy taxes, I think 
must shake the speculators, though there are several 
wealthy companies, w r ho have placed their agents from 
one end of the Continent to the other; and, at the 
head of one of them, Don Juan, a Spaniard, at Phila 
delphia, called the Spanish Ambassador. And much 
will depend on the measures adopted in other States. 
With respect to filling up our battalions, recruitingis to continue ; and W T C have made an additional al 
lowance, to every recruit, of a suit of clothes, a shirt, 
hat, shoes, and stockings. 

I am greatly obliged to your Excellency for the 
several judicious hints, contained in your letters of 
the 10th of April and 25th of June, particularly 
those relating to our officers, and the black tribe of 
speculators. They had much weight in our Legislature, and assisted our deliberations. I could wish 
that Congress would bend their attention to some 
general regulation respecting trade, forestalling, en 
grossing, and speculations, to be recommended to the 
whole United States. It would remove the evil effects 
of that jealousy which the States entertain of one an 
other, respectively, regarding their trade ; indeed, if 
adopted, the very foundation of its existence, and 
greatly strengthen the Union. 

I have reflected with concern on the long and 
tedious confinement of our prisoners at York and 
Long Island (I mean our officers, for I "believe the 
enemy have disposed of most of our private men) ; 
and on reading the report of our Commissioners, late 
ly appointed to settle a cartel, I find that the British declare they wish not to exchange for the officers 
of the Convention troops (Burgoyne s), until the regi 
ments, to which they belong, are also discharged. 
This is acknowledging an interest in their officers 
remaining prisoners, and, if not removed, will always 
operate against the settlement of a cartel. Separate 
the officers from the men, and the interest ceases. I 
believe it is not the custom of any nation to keep 
officers and privates prisoners of war together ; where 
fore, I presume, this singular instance has proceeded 
from some article of the Convention of Saratoga, 
Congress resolved that the Convention was broken on 
the part of Burgoyne, and therefore refused to comply with one capital article, which was, suffering the 
troops to embark at Boston to be transported to 
Great Britain. 

If the Convention was broken, as I have no doubt 
it was, why comply with any part or article of it? 
Does it not imply a contradiction unfavorable to the 
wisdom or justice of Congress ? I am confident, if 
that honorable body had reflected a moment on the 
impropriety and evil consequences of keeping such a 
number of officers and men together, they never 
would have suffered it, and would even now separate them immediately. The irnpoliey of this indul 
gence is equally obvious. Had the men been sepa 
rated from their officers, they would have mingled 
with the inhabitants of the several States, and most 
of them become good and useful citizens; we should 
have gained strength, and the enemy been weakened 
by it. Common soldiers, when they have an opportunity, are fond of quitting the military service, and 
especially on a Continent like this, where they can be 
so readily accommodated with the necessaries of life. 
Your Excellency will naturally conceive that 1 am 
rather sanguine on this subject, and may impute 
it to interest. It is true, I have the feelings of a 
father for a captive son, and sincerely regret his 
long detention from his country s service, as w r ell as 
improvement in his profession; but still am clear in 
opinion that justice, sound policy, and the public 
good, require an immediate separation of the officers 
from the soldiers or private men of that army. 

Be pleased to accept my thanks for the kind men 
tion you make of my son. I have not had a letter 
from him since the 10th of July. He was then very 
well, on Long Island, and seems satisfied with every 
thing except his loss of time. The letters, which I 
mentioned as stopped by an officer on the British 
lines, were not to have passed by head-quarters, but 
through the hands of our Commissary of Prisoners, 
via Philadelphia, I have now requested my son to 
send his letters by way of head-quarters, and I take 
the liberty to inclose you one for him. 

I very sincerely congratulate you on the success 
of our arms at Stony Point. It was a glorious action, 
and reflects much honor and credit on the brave officers and men who performed it. 

I have been lately afflicted with the gout, and am 
so blind that I cannot walk out without a guide. 
These infirmities, I am afraid, will disable me to con 
tinue in the public service ; though I am determined, 
if possible, to hold out until there is a happy end to 
the war. 

Mrs. Fitzhugh presents her respectful compliments, 
and joins with me in best wishes for your health 
and success in arms. I have the honor to be, with 
the warmest affection and regard, your Excellency s 
Most obedient and obliged humble servant, 

WILLIAM FITZHUGH. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 25 August, 1779. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have had the pleasure of receiving your favor of 
the 16th instant. Britain refused the mediation of 
Spain at a time when their spirits were elated by 
their successes in the West Indies and the Southern 
States, and by the accounts they received of discord 
in Congress, discontent among the people, and a pros 
pect of the evils with which we were threatened by 
the depreciation of our currency. Deceived by these 
illusory gleams of hope, they permitted their counsels 
to be guided by their pride. What reason they may 
have to expect succour from other powers is, as yet, 
a secret. M. Gerard is decided, in his opinion, that 
they will obtain none. The conduct of France, inestablishing peace between Russia and the Porte, has 
won the heart of the Empress ; and the influence of 
Versailles, at Constantinople, will probably give dura 
tion to her gratitude. The Emperor and Prussia are 
under similar obligations. The latter wishes us well, 
and the finances of the former are too much exhausted to support the expenses of war, without subsidies 
from Britain, who, at present, cannot afford them. 
There is no reason to suspect that the peace of Ger 
many will soon he interrupted. Britain may hire 
some troops there, but it is not probable she will be 
able to do more. Portugal and the Dutch, while di 
rected by their interest, will not rashly raise their 
hands to support a nation, which, like a tower in an 
earthquake, sliding from its base, will crush every 
slender prop that may be raised to prevent its fall. 

General Wayne s letter has been referred to the 
Committee of Intelligence for publication. 

You may remember, Sir, to have received a letter 
from me last winter, recommending the person who 
carried it as an honest man, and w r ho, in my opinion, 
w r ould, with great fidelity, do the business you wished, 
and I advised him, to undertake. 

In May last, I received a letter from him, informin 2; me of his having written to vou at the same 

O C! \J 

time, and mentioning a matter of very delicate na 
ture, which, I believe,- was omitted in your letter, as 
he gave mo reason to expect he would soon be here. 
I avoided particulars, not choosing to risk more on 
paper than was necessary. lie has not, however, been 
here, nor have I received a line from him for some 
time past. From this circumstance, I have been apprehensive of his having relinquished that business ; 
and the more so, as he intimated to me his doubts 
of its being well conducted, unless under your imme 
diate direction; that the views of the gentleman, with 
whom he first conversed on the subject, were not very 
extensive, and his attention to expense too great. 

The opinion I have of this man s usefulness leads 
me to mention these matters, that, if he has left the 
business, I might, if you think proper, press him to 
resume it. If he still perseveres, I do not wish to 
be informed of any other particulars. With perfect 
respect, and sincere regard, I am, dear Sir, 
Your most obedient servant, 

JOHN JAY. 



FROM MONSIEUR GERARD. 
(Translation.) 

Philadelphia, 18 September, 1779. 

SIR, 

My plan and my dearest desire were, personally 
to take leave of your Excellency, and to go once 
more to admire, in a near view, the greatest man 
and best citizen of America. But a multitude of 
business, some indisposition, and the uncertainty of 
the epoch of my departure, have deprived me of the 
infinite satisfaction which I promised myself from, the 
journey. Receive then, Sir, my adieus in writing, as 
well .as the assurances of all my respect, and of all 
my attachment. I shall count it among the most 
flattering events of my life, to have been able to 
merit some share in the esteem and in the confi 
dence of your Excellency. 

France knows as well as America, Sir, that which 
she ought to place in your talents, and in your man 
ner of thinking. Your attachment to the true inte 
rests of your country is the pledge of your disposi 
tions towards the alliance ; and I dare assure yourExcellency, that my Court knows how to do you 
justice, and that your personal glory and personal 
happiness are as precious to the French nation as 
they ought to be to the people of America, I have 
the honor to be, with the most respectful attachment, 
your Excellency s 

Most humble, and most obedient servant, 

GERARD. 



FROM GOVERNOR JEFFERSON. 

Williamsburg, 1 October, 1779. 

SIR, 

On receipt of your letter of August Gth, during 
my absence, the Council had the irons taken off the 
prisoners of Avar. When your advice was asked, we 
meant it should decide with us ; and, upon my re 
turn to Williamsburg, the matter was taken up, and 
the inclosed advice given. A parole was formed, of 
which the inclosed is a copy, and tendered to the 
prisoners. They objected to that part of it which re 
strained them from saying any thing to the prejudice of the United States, and insisted on "freedom 
of speech." They were, in consequence, remanded to 
their confinement in the jail, which must be considered as a voluntary one, until they can determine with 
themselves to be inoffensive in word as well as deed. 

A flag sails hence to-morrow to New York, to negotiate the exchange of some prisoners, By her I 
have written to General Phillips on this subject, and 
inclosed to him copies of the within, intending it as 
an answer to a letter I received from him on the 
subject of Governor Hamilton. I have the honor to

Your most obedient, and most humble servant, 

THOMAS JEFFERSON. 


FKOM COLONEL HAMILTON AND BRIGADIER-GENERAL DUPORTAIL. 

Great Egg Harbour Landing, 
26 October, 1779. 

SIR. 

We are honored with two letters from your Excel 
lency, of the 10th and 21st, to the contents of which 
we beg leave to assure you of our strictest attention. 
That of the 18th has not yet come to hand. It 
is not improbable it has gone round by Lewistown, 
which has occasioned the delay. 

Colonel Hamilton wrote to your Excellency from 
Philadelphia, acquainting you with our arrival there, 
and our intention to proceed to Lewistown at Cape 
Ilenlopen; and from Great Egg Harbour, communicating our progress since, and our determination to esta 
blish ourselves at Bat Stove Furnace. We have since 
fixed on this place, about forty-four miles from the 
extremity of Cape May (eighteen miles short of the 
Furnace, which we found to be more remote than 
had been represented), and, as far as we are able to 
learn, from one hundred to one hundred and ten miles 
from Sandy Hook about fifty from Philadelphia. 
Your Excellency will easily perceive the reasons of 
our choosing this station. It did not appear to us, 
from our inquiries in Philadelphia, to be a point well 
ascertained that the fleet would stop at the Delaware; 
and the time which had elapsed made it the more 
possible, if the Count should be determined to prose 
cute any further operations on the Continent, that he 
would not lose time by a procedure of this sort, but 
might content himself with sending some transports, 
under escort of a few frigates, to receive the provi 
sions for the fleet, and proceed himself directly on to 
the Hook. On this supposition, our position at LewisVOL. ii. 29 
town was entirely ineligible. The distance at which 
we were from the city, as well as from the Hook, 
the delays that would consequently attend our intelligences from every quarter, the difficulty and impossi 
bility sometimes of traversing the Bay, made our first 
situation inconvenient in every respect, in the event 
of the fleet s proceeding immediately to the Hook. 
These considerations induced us to cross the Delaware, 
and take the position at which we now are, where, 
or in the vicinity, we propose to remain till the 
arrival of the Count, till intelligence from him decides the inutility of a longer stay, or till we receive 
your Excellency s orders of recall. 

We have now a better relation to the different 
points in which we are interested, and have taken 
the necessary precautions to gain the earliest notice 
of whatever happens. We have stationed expresses 
at the pitch of the Cape, and have established a re 
gular communication with Major Lee, and with the 
city. If the fleet should appear off the Delaware, we 
can be there in twelve hours after its first appearance ; and if at the Jlook, in less than four days, 
provided Major Lee is punctual in conveying the 
intelligence, arid the expresses from either side in 
bringing it. 

By recent information from Philadelphia (though 
not quite so distinct and accurate as we could wish), 
we find that, so late as the 4th of this month, the 
Count was yet to open his batteries against the enemy at Savannah. The time that will probably inter 
vene between this and their final reduction, the reembarkation of the Count s troops, the dispositions 
for sailing, and his arrival on this coast, may, we 
fear, exhaust the season too much to permit the co 
operation to which our mission relates. We do not, 
however, despair; for, if the Count has been fully 
successful to the southward, and should shortly arrive, 
which may be the case, the enterprise may possibly 
still go on. 

In a letter from Major Lee, of the 22d, he informs 
us that a vessel from Georgia arrived on the 16th, 
since which the two sixty-fours and the Renown, 
which were at the Hook, had fallen down towards 
New York, and the troops at the Hook had em 
barked, and gone to the city. At first sight this 
account alarmed us, and made us apprehensive that 
the enemy had received some favorable advices from 
the southward, which put them out of danger, and 
superseded the necessity of continuing their prepara 
tions for defence. But, on further reflection, we think 
it more probable that this is only a change of dispo 
sition; and that finding, on close examination, they 
would be unable to defend the Hook, they had determined to relinquish the attempt. This seems the 
more likely, as Major Lee mentions that a part of 
the hulks, sunk in the channel, had gotten afloat 
and drifted ashore. 

To this experience of the difficulty of obstructing 
the channel, may, perhaps, be attributed the change 
we suppose. And we are confirmed in this conjec 
ture by the evacuation of the two posts at King s 
Ferry, which appears, by your Excellency s letter, to 
have taken place on the 21st, five days after the 
supposed arrival of the. vessel from Georgia ; a proof 
that they had not received information of any deci 
sive good fortune on their side, or ill fortune on ours; 
and that they persisted in their defensive plan. We 
are persuaded, too, that their exultation would have 
given wings to any good news they might have re 
ceived, and that it would have reached us before this. 
Were the season less advanced, we should regret this 
change of disposition, because we believe the attempt 
to defend the entrance of the Hook would have been 
fruitless ; and it might have thrown a part of their 
ships and of their troops into our hands in the first 
instance, which could not fail to facilitate the suc 
cessive operations. 

But, at this late period, it may rather be an ad 
vantage. To force the passage, might have required 
land operations against the Hook, which would lose 
time, and expose the fleet to the hazard of winds, 
which would have rendered its situation critical. 
Now, the fleet may probably enter the Bay on its 
first approach, and be in security ; and the whole 
operation will be brought to a point, and may demand less time for its accomplishment. 

As a large number of fascines, ready for use, appears to us essential to any operations that may be 
undertaken, we presume your Excellency has been 
preparing, and will continue to prepare, as many as 
possible. We beg leave to suggest the utility of 
having at the same time a sufficient number of gabi 
ons and sand bags. Of the former, Colonel Gouvion, 
if your Excellency thinks proper, may bo charged 
with the construction. The latter may be made under the care of the Quarter-master at Philadelphia. 
Several thousands may be necessary. The usual di 
mensions are fifteen or eighteen inches long, and 
twelve wide. If, notwithstanding the advices from 
Major Lee, any thing by land is to be attempted 
against the Hook, these will be peculiarly useful on 
such a flat, sandy spot ; and, indeed, it would be 
impracticable to construct batteries in any reasona 
ble time without them. We have the honor to be, 

ALEXANDER HAMILTON, 
DUPORTAIL. 
FROM GOVERNOR GREENE. 



Warwick, Rhode Island, 5 November, 1779. 

SIR, 

I most sincerely congratulate your Excellency upon 
the enemy s having evacuated Rhode Island ; but am 
sorry to be under the necessity of troubling you with 
a resolution of the Council of War of this State, which 
I take the liberty to inclose, by which you will please 
to observe the distressed situation the inhabitants of 
those towns must labor under for want of their records. 
I doubt not you will take every necessary measure 
that may tend to convince General Clinton of his 
error in continuing to hold them, as they certainly 
cannot be of any use to the enemy, exclusive of the 
pleasure they enjoy in distressing mankind, who are 
not to be controlled by them. I am, with every 
sentiment of respect, your Excellency s 

Most obedient and most humble servant. 

WILLIAM GREENE. 



FROM GOVERNOR TRUMBULL. 

Hartford, 5 November, 1779. 

SIR, 

The time, when the arrival of the fleet under the 
command of the Count cl Estaing may be expected, 
being so far advanced that the utmost readiness to 
cooperate with him is become necessary, should he 
appear on this coast, and the immediate danger to 
which our own seaports will be exposed from the 
collected force of the enemy, should he be prevented 
from coming this way, have prevailed to induce the 
General Assembly of this State to order the militia, 
29* 
requested by your Excellency, to be assembled at the 
places of rendezvous proposed, as soon as possible. 

Should the advanced season, or any other unfore 
seen cause, prevent the Count from coming this way, 
and the intended enterprise against the enemy at New 
York be laid aside, the frontiers and sea-coasts of this 
State will be eminently exposed to the ravages and 
depredations of the enemy. We would flatter ourselves it will be in your Excellency s power to send 
a part of the troops, under your command, into this 
State, to take post so as to cover and protect the 
most exposed part of our sea-coasts and frontiers ; and 
desire you to inform us whether we may expect that 
our hopes and wishes, in this respect, may be realized. 

The keeping up large guards of the militia on the 
coasts, besides the enormous expense attending, injures 
the public service by withdrawing the men from the 
field, and lessening our ability to supply the army 
with men or provisions. But, I persuade myself, 1 
need not use arguments to prevail upon your Excel 
lency to indulge our request, if consistent with the 
public service and a jdue regard to the general interests of the States. I am, with great esteem and 
regard, my dear General, 

Your most obedient, humble servant, 

JONATHAN TRUMBULL. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SULLIVAN. 

Suffern s, 6 November, 1779. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I am now moving to Pompton, agreeably to yourExcellency s orders of yesterday. I find that the 
whole of the Rhode Island army is encamped on Staten Island, in addition to the troops before stationed 
there ; that they are making preparations for an ex 
cursion somewhere, and it is generally conjectured 
that they intend a descent upon the Jersey shore. 
This conjecture seems to be strengthened by the 
light-horse being sent on to the Island, and the preparations they are making in the boat way. If the 
forage is their object, will our troops at Pompton be 
within sufficient distance to give a timely opposition? 
May not the magazines at Pluckamin be an object? 
I see the disadvantage which may arise from this di 
vision of the army being sent at too great a distance 
from the others, and beg pardon for the above hints, 
which are only intended to express my wishes to be 
in such a situation as may enable me effectually to 
answer your Excellency s wishes. The place which 
will best answer this purpose, your Excellency can 
best determine. I have the honor to be, with the 
most perfect respect, dear General, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

JOHN SULLIVAN. 

P. S. I have not a horseman, or any thing in place 
of one, for expresses, or any other purpose. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SULLIVAN. 

Suffern s Tavern, 6 November, 1779. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I am sorry to inform your Excellency, that I am 
under the painful necessity of leaving a service to 
which I am, by principle and interest, attached ; and, 
among the variety of mortifications I must suffer in 
quitting it, that of being deprived the pleasure of 
serving under your Excellency, stands among the 
foremost. My health is too much impaired to be re 
covered but by a total release from business ; and, 
though the physicians give me encouragement that 
this will restore me, I am myself convinced of the 
contrary, and fear that I must content myself with 
enjoying the reflection of having used my utmost to 
serve my country, as the only thing I shall receive 
in exchange for a constitution sacrificed in endea 
vouring to promote its interest. 

Should there be a probability of Count d Estaing s 
arrival, I would willingly wait, to give the little as 
sistance in my power to extirpate the enemies of 
this country ; but, should this not be likely to happen, and the season be too far advanced, I must 
beg your Excellency s leave to retire as soon as 
possible, that I may take every measure in my 
power to restore my health in some degree, or at 
least to live in such a manner as will not tend to 
put it beyond a possibility of being restored, which 
a longer continuance in the service undoubtedly will. 
I have the honor to r be, most respectfully, my dearGeneral, your Excellency s 

Most obedient and very humble servant, 

JOHN SULLIVAN. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LINCOLN. 

Charleston, 7 November, 1779. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I had the honor of your very obliging favor of the 
28th of September, the last evening. I wish it was 
in my power to give you such an account of matters 
in this department, as would afford you some satisfaction in the perusal ; but, unfortunately for me, and 
perhaps it may soon be more so for the public, I 
cannot do it. We remain unsupported by troops, unsupplied with many essential articles, and uncovered 
with works ; and, what adds to the unhappiness, is 
the little prospect that our affairs will speedily be in 
a better channel. For, with regard to troops, General 
Scott is not arrived, nor do I know when he may be 
expected, for I have not had a line from him since 
he was ordered this way ; but, from the best informa 
tion I can obtain, if he comes at last, he has not 
more than four hundred men now fit for duty. 

That is all we are encouraged to expect from Vir 
ginia, which, with those here from that State, will 
amount to between six and seven hundred ; from 
North Carolina, we have about one hundred and fifty 
Continental troops. More may not be expected from 
them, excepting militia. What number of those may 
be sent is uncertain ; and, indeed, unless they serve 
for a longer time than the last (namely, three months 
from the time they entered this state, a time too 
short, either to learn the duty, or to be inured to 
the fatigues of the camp), little may be expected 
from them. With regard to this State, they have not, 
in their five regiments, seven hundred men fit for 
duty ; and we have no reason to expect that their 
number will be much augmented, considering the 
aversion the people have for the service here ; or that 
any permanent force will be brought by them into 
the field. For, after solemn debate in the House of 
Assembly, they resolved, that the militia should not 
be drafted to fill up the Continental battalions, and 
that the militia, when in the field, should not be under the Continental articles of war ; and refused, on 
the recommendation of Congress, to raise any black 
corps. The Georgia battalion does not amount to onehundred men in the whole ; they are not in a capa 
city to keep that number up, for they have no legis 
lative power in the State. The militia, therefore, are 
not properly organized, nor can be ; they come out at 
their own option, and return at their discretion. 

Thus, Sir, you see the state of our force, and ourexpectations. We are very deficient in many neces 
sary articles, such as ammunition, tent-cloth, blankets, 
clothes, c. This arises, in a great measure, from a 
large proportion of the vessels being taken, which 
were sent out hence for the public, and from others 
coming to a bad market. 

This town, which is the magazine of the State, and 
which, for that and many reasons, claims the atten 
tion of the enemy, and to possess themselves of which 
is among their first objects, is in a very defenceless 
situation. The works about it, begun, are not finished ; many more are necessary to be constructed, but 
from the want of negroes (the only laborers in this 
country), the matter is neglected. They have been 
sent for into the country, but, from some defect in 
the law, they are not brought in. 

Fort Moultrie, on Sullivan s Island, six miles from 
the town, supposed to be the key of the harbour, is 
in a very decayed state, and without a ditch, pick 
ets, or abatis to it. The repairs of that, also, are delayed from the same cause. Two floating batteries 
have been recommended to cover the bar, and they 
would undoubtedly answer the most valuable purpose, 
as no heavy ship can come over it, unless they take 
out their guns, or they are so much careened as 
they cannot work them. These, also, though indispensably necessary to the safety of the harbour, are 
unprovided. 
By this short state of affairs, you will see what 
little expectations there are., that we shall be able to 
make any considerable defence, in case any thing 
serious is attempted here by the enemy. Besides, if 
they should attack the town, I think they will at 
tempt to amuse us in the back parts of the country, 
and keep those people at home ; indeed, there has 
been a late attempt to seize our magazines at Ninety Six and Camden. A very considerable number 
of men got in arms, but their designs were fortu 
nately discovered, and many of them are taken. Yet 
the combination is alarming, and requires particularattention, considering what great proportion of the 
back inhabitants of these States are unfriendly and 
indifferent to the cause. 

I have frequently, and, I think, faithfully, represented these matters to Congress, and to this State ; 
and have endeavoured to convince them, by every argument in my power, that this State also was surely 
an object which claimed the attention of Britain, 
and policy, as it would affect us, and interest, would 
stimulate her to attempt the subjugation of it. We 
have about one thousand Continental troops in this 
State, and at Augusta, in Georgia. The Virginia dra 
goons and infantry are at Augusta. They were sent 
there on our retreat from before Savannah, in order 
to give confidence to the inhabitants and the militia 
of the country, and to be some check on the unfriendly, and the Indians. The second, third, and 
fifth South Carolina battalions, and part of the artil 
lery, are at Sheldon, opposite Port Royal Ferry, and 
between thirty and forty miles from the Savannah, 
as a cover to the country, while the people take in 
their crops, and remove their stock, which should be 
done immediately. The first and sixth battalions are 
at Fort Moultrie, and the North Carolina troops in 
this town. 

As soon as it shall become necessary, I mean to 
collect the Continental troops to a point, and to 
leave the well-affected militia to cover the back part 
of the country. They will render more service there 
than in garrison. The militia in the vicinity of 
Charleston will be called in to its aid. I have re 
quested the State to provide some secure place, pro 
perly supplied with provisions, as an asylum for the 
aged, the infirm, the women, and children ; that, in 
case of a siege, we may have no useless mouths in 
town, or any circumstance which would induce a 
more early surrender, or add to the absolutely necessary distresses of a siege. 

I think this town might be defended against a 
very formidable attack, if all was done for its secu 
rity which ought to be done. For it is situated on a 
peninsula our lines in the rear of it are about half 
a mile in length, and will soon have in front of 
them, at the distance of a musket shot, a fosse, in 
which the water wilL be retained six or seven feet 
by dams, one towards Cooper, and the other towards 
Ashley River ; this completed, and the necessary 
works about the town finished, and the floating bat 
teries provided, we should not be easily insulted, 
with a proper garrison and magazines, I am, my 
dear General, with the warmest sentiments of regard 
and esteem, unalterably yours, 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 
FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GATES. 

Providence, 8 November, 1779. 

SIR, 

Thursday night I had the honor to receive yourExcellency s letter of the 1st instant, and immedi 
ately gave orders for moving the Continental troops 
over the bay to Greenwich; but, the weather proving 
so very stormy the whole day, that could not be ef 
fected before Saturday evening. I came myself that 
night to Providence, and gave orders for Jackson s 
regiment, stationed here, to march this morning for 
Plainfield ; if the weather continues tolerable, I have 
no doubt but the whole will reach Hartford Saturday. 
I have advised with those who are the best acquainted with the different routes at this season of the 
year ; they all prefer that by Hartford, upon account 
of the facility of passing the ferries, and the good 
ness of the roads that way. 

I shall bring with me only four pieces of light 
brass field artillery, and propose leaving what is 
called the park, here, with a small guard to take 
care of it. If your Excellency wishes more to be 
brought forward, it may be easily done after the re 
ceipt of your farther orders. I am, Sir, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

HORATIO GATES. 



FROM COLONEL BRODHEAD. 

Pittsburg, 10 November, 1779. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I am honored with your favor of the 18th ultimo. 
The honorable notice you have been pleased to take 
VOL. n. 30 
of my little expedition, fills my mind with the warmest gratitude, and I hope to merit your future esteem. 

It is some time since I inclosed to the honorable 
Board of War a return of the troops under my command, and of the articles of clothing necessary for the 
respective corps, to render them tolerably comfortable 
during the ensuing winter. The troops have received 
a small supply of money, and I expect they will 
be contented, until more can be procured from the 
treasury. 

An expedition against Detroit, in the winter season, 
will doubtless put us in possession of the enemy s 
shipping, and, of course, give us the command of 
Lake Erie. Winter expeditions are generally attended 
with great loss of horses and cattle, except where 
large magazines of forage are laid in, and can be 
transported. But the British garrison and shipping 
will be a full compensation for every loss of that 
kind, and, indeed, every difficulty we can meet in the 
obtaining it, as it will likewise secure the future 
tranquillity of this frontier. 

I will endeavour to, have every thing in perfect rea 
diness, and procure the best intelligence that circum 
stances will admit. I believe a considerable number 
of Indians will join me ; but I have little expectation 
of supplies, except from the French settlement in the 
vicinity of that post ; and, as the British yearly cause 
the inhabitants to thresh out the grain, and sell to 
them for the purpose of filling their magazines, little 
dependence can be placed on receiving supplies from 
them ; and the Indians, on the Biver St. Lawrence, 
subsist chiefly on animal food. I have frequently 
applied to the Board of War for supplies and trinkets 
for the Indians, but fear it is not in their power to 
procure them. I will, however, renew my application. 
It is with great pleasure I hear of the destination 
of his Excellency Count d Estaing, and I have a happy 
presage that he will have the most ample success. 

I herewith remit a return of the cannon and mili 
tary stores belonging to these garrisons, and an esti 
mate of the cannon and military stores necessary for 
the intended expedition, to the best of my judgment. 
My best intelligence, at present, is, that the enemy 
have erected a very strong work, near to the old fort, 
and on the only commanding eminence, behind the 
soldiers gardens ; that the garrison consists of threehundred regulars (some say more), and about the 
same number of militia ; some of the latter description, 
it is said, will join our troops on their arrival in that 
neighbourhood. The Wyandots, Tawas, Chippewas, and 
Pottawattomies, live in the vicinity of Detroit, and 
many of them are, without doubt, under British in 
fluence. 

If the expedition cannot be prosecuted before the 
month of February, it will then be too late, on ac 
count of the high floods to which the intermediate 
country is subjected. Should it prove impracticable 
to carry on the expedition against Detroit, the troops 
under my command, with some volunteers, in my 
opinion, might be advantageously employed on an ex 
pedition against the Shawanese, on the Miami River, 
and from thence against the enemy s post at Natchez, 
with very little or no additional expense, and return 
early in the spring to march against Detroit. For I 
apprehend no danger to this frontier during the win 
ter season, and the troops will be healthier, if con 
tinued in action, than in these garrisons. 

A couple of French gentlemen, of good address, 
would be very serviceable in this district, and espe 
cially on an expedition. I shall be happy to hearfrom you, and receive further instructions. I have 
the honor to be, with the highest sentiments of re 
spect and esteem, your Excellency s 

Most obedient and most humble servant, 

DANIEL BRODHEAD. 

P. S. I am this moment informed that two thou 
sand Indians, who were driven from their towns, are 
in great distress, and live on the pittance afforded 
them by the enemy at Niagara. This intelligence 
is from Sandusky, and may be relied on. They in 
form the other Indians that they are afraid to hunt, 
on account of the Americans. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

West Point, 14 November, 1779. 

SIR, 

Your Excellency undoubtedly has frequently had 
under consideration a proper position for winter-quarters. It is not always in the power of a General to 
take a position most favorable to his wishes, on ac 
count of provision and forage, or to place himself in 
the most advantageous point of view for covering the 
country and securing his capital posts. A certainty 
with respect to provision and forage is an object of 
the first consideration in taking a position. All in 
ferior evils, of whatever nature, may, in some sort, be 
remedied by foresight and precaution; but there is 
no contending with hunger. Therefore, what would 
be considered only as secondary objects in some cases, 
become principals here. 

In the choice of a position, we must pay some re 
gard to the enemy s collected force, and to our divided condition, in which the army must of necessity 
be cantoned. The enemy now appear to be putting 
their troops into winter-quarters ; but it cannot be 
supposed they will remain inactive all winter, if we, 
by the manner of cantoning the army, open to them 
an opportunity of insulting us to advantage. The 
mischievous consequences of having our quarters beat 
up, in the dead of winter, cannot readily be foreseen. 
That it would be their duty and interest to lay hold 
of such an opportunity, nobody can deny; and that 
the character of the General, and many national cir 
cumstances, lead to the supposition, must be agreed 
to. It is necessary, therefore, to take a position which 
.will secure us from a surprise, and have as much 
force together as possible, to free us from insult. The 
place where, and the force necessary, to these ends, 
are the two capital points to decide upon. 

The command of the North River is an object of 
such importance, that the force and supplies neces 
sary for this purpose must be had at all events. The 
force requisite for these garrisons, I suppose, has been 
very judiciously calculated by General Duportail; and 
I imagine there cannot be any great variation from 
his report. 

Your Excellency will find, after detaching a proper 
force for this place, a covering party for the State 
of Connecticut, and the other necessary guards for 
King s Ferry, stores, and posts of communication, 
your force will be greatly inferior to that of the enemy ; and it will be growing more and more so as 
the service of the soldiers expires. It will be necessa 
ry, therefore, to endeavour to remedy, by the strength 
of ground, the deficiency of force. 

I have no doubt but that every State bordering 
upon the enemy, will apply for a proper force, to 
30* 
protect them against their ravages. To comply with 
these demands, will hazard the safety of the whole 
army. Divide your force,, and you will fall a prey 
in every quarter; and, I am persuaded, were you to 
adopt the plan which would be most flattering to the 
wishes of the people, it would be so far from affording them that protection and security which they 
promise themselves, that it would become one of the 
principal causes of the enemy s making inroads, and 
committing depredations upon them. 

There can be but two modes of cantonment, to 
prevent the enemy from disturbing us in quarters. 
One is, to keep such a force together as to bid defiance to all their menaces ; the other is, to disperse 
the troops in such a manner as to afford no object. 
The first is infinitely the most favorable to disciplineand economy. To disperse the troops among the 
inhabitants, will be attended with a certain loss of 
discipline to the soldiers and a general corruption of 
manners among the people. They will mutually debauch each other. Besides these disadvantages, the 
expense and waste of stores will be nearly double, 
and a great addition to the list of Staff Officers (al 
ready too numerous from the state of our money) 
will be found necessary. For these, and many other 
reasons too obvious to need explanation, dispersing 
the troops should be avoided at all events. 

Whatever covering is given to any part of the 
country, except where the principal force is stationed, 
should be so calculated as to be able to check the 
enemy s small ravaging parties, and yet not be an 
object worthy any considerable movement of theirs. 

From the representation of both the CommissaryGeneral and the Foragemaster-General, I find yourExcellency will be obliged to quarter the troops in 
New Jersey. The great consumption of forage, that 
has taken place in this State for five months past, 
will render it very difficult to provide for this garrison, and the different posts of communication. 

In cantoning the troops and drawing supplies for 
their subsistence, it may not be amiss to have an eye 
to the affair of next campaign. The expense and difficulty of transportation from the Western States, yourExcellency is perfectly acquainted with. You are 
also sensible that the long tract of barren country, 
through which the supplies must come, will only ad 
mit of a certain quantity of transportation; therefore 
I conceive, that good policy points out the necessity 
of keeping as many stores in reserve in this State 
as possible. This is necessary, not only to be prepared for any emergency that may happen from the 
enemy s turning their force against the Eastern States, 
but to have a magazine in readiness for a secret 
purpose, which your Excellency hinted to me a few 
days since. 

The further we move our main force to the westward, and still be within supporting distance of this 
garrison, the better, both for the preservation of the 
provision and forage of this State, as well as to les 
sen the general expense of transportation. And the 
greater stock of provision and forage we can leave 
in this State, and upon the communications, the less 
difficulty we shall find in giving support to this 
place, should the enemy approach it. I should re 
commend, therefore, to quarter the army as far wesir 
ward as Morristown or Baskingridge. The country is 
strong, secure from a surprise, happily situated to re 
ceive supplies of provisions and forage, and not very 
inconvenient for giving protection and cover to the 
inhabitants. It is true, it is considerably removed 
from this place. But were we to take a position at 
Suffern s or Pompton, the consumption of forage would 
be so great that it would destroy the possibility of 
keeping up a communication with the Western States, 
however pressing the necessity, before the grass sea 
son. Suppose the enemy should move up, early in 
the spring, and lay siege to West Point, and the 
supplies of this State prove unequal to our support, 
should we not be obliged to abandon it to its fate ? 

There is another objection to the Suffern s or Pompton position, which is, the advantage it gives the 
enemy of dividing our attention, by taking post at 
King s Ferry. It will be impossible for us to deter 
mine which is their object, the camp or West Point; 
and it will be almost as dangerous to expose ourcamp as these garrisons, especially early in the 
spring, when we have all our baggage about us, and 
no possibility of moving it off. If we take a position 
near Morris, we can always tell, by the motions of the 
enemy, what is their object; and, having our camp 
in a secure situation, should they turn their force to 
wards this place, we can march to its relief in such 
force as to give certain support, and at the same 
time leave our camp in perfect security. 

The fortifications here are so strong, and the garrison will be so numerous, that I think we have but 
little to fear, either from a surprise or storm ; and 
therefore we have only to guard against an investi 
ture or siege. 

As the enemy have the advantage of a w r ater transportation, and the spring is the most difficult part of 
the year for a land conveyance, it is most probable, 
if they have any designs upon this post, they will 
commence their operations before the grass season. 
Will it not be worth while, therefore, to form a small 
magazine of provision and forage, at or near Mr. Erskine s Iron Works, for the purpose of subsisting the 
army on their march to this place ? And another 
considerable magazine of provision and forage at 
Chester or Warwick for the support of this army in 
whatever position it may take for the relief of this 
garrison? These magazines should be formed from 
the westward, in the winter season, when there is 
the least call for transportation, and the roads the 
most favorable for the purpose. 

I imagine there will be great interest made for 
the eastern troops to be posted on the east side of 
the North River, to favor their recruiting. These 
reasons have something plausible in them, but I have 
my doubts with respect to their truth and reality. 
Men, when they are near home, are much more influ 
enced by domestic attachments than they are when 
they are at a great distance. The friends and rela 
tions of the soldiers very seldom use their influence 
to engage them in the service. On the contrary, 
they commonly make use of every argument to dissuade them from it. I am of opinion, therefore, the 
further the troops are removed from home, the more 
favorable it will be to the recruiting service in camp. 

There is but one reason for cantoning the eastern 
troops on the east side of the North River; and that 
is, they are more convenient to receive their State 
stores. But this is so trifling a consideration, that it 
ought to have no weight, when it is opposed to so 
many more important considerations. 

My present opinion favors the following disposition 
of the troops for winter-quarters. The garrison here 
should consist of Patterson s, Learned s, Clinton s, and 
the North Carolina brigades, which, I believe, will form 
a force sufficient for the purpose. If the horse is 
posted in Connecticut, as seems to be thought on, I 
think the troops coming from Rhode Island, in con 
junction with the horse, will form a sufficient covering party for the exposed parts of Connecticut and 
Westchester. I would only wish Clinton s brigade to 
be here, because it may interest the inhabitants to 
furnish supplies in the winter, and to encourage the 
militia to turn out with spirit, should the enemy make 
a sudden move towards the post. The connection be 
tween the army and country will have an influence 
in both these respects. 

The Delaware regiment can furnish guards for 
King s Ferry, and the stores at Ilingwood, should 
your Excellency think proper to establish a magazinethere. I mention this regiment for this service, be 
cause it seems to be unconnected with any brigades ; 
or, at least, the Maryland brigades are complete with 
out it. 

The rest of the troops I would quarter, as before 
mentioned, somewhere not far distant from Morris or 
Baskingridge, according as wood and water may favor 
a position. 

Should the enemy make any considerable detach 
ments from New York, a larger covering party may 
be necessary for the State of Connecticut, as I should 
have more apprehensions of their committing depredations, if they detach, than if they do not; for then 
they will have nothing left but to play the small 
game. 

The earlier the position is fixed upon, the better 
for quartering the army. I wish your Excellency, 
therefore, as soon as you have decided in your mind 
the places and force requisite for each side of the 
North River, and the garrison for these fortifications, 
would please to acquaint me therewith, as it will 
be a more perfect guide to niy conduct, in making 
the preparations for cantoning the army. I am, with 
great respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

NATHANAEL GREENE. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GATES. 

Hartford, 15 November, 1779. 

SIR, 

In obedience to the orders contained in your Ex 
cellency s letters of the 1st and 2d instant, I marched the whole of the Continental troops from the 
State of Rhode Island, and arrived yesterday morning, with the first division, consisting of a detach 
ment of Colonel Crane s artillery, with two six-pound 
ers, Colonel Livington s, Colonel Jackson s, and Colonel 
Webb s regiments, at Hartford. The second division, 
consisting of the rest of Colonel Crane s, with the 
like artillery, Colonel Greene s, Colonel Angell s, and 
Colonel Sherburne s regiments, will be here this evening. As I find no orders here, and have not received 
any letter from your Excellency since that dated the 
2d instant, I shall encamp the troops, and wait yourfurther commands. I am, Sir, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

HORATIO GATES. 



FROM GOVERNOR JEFFERSON. 

Williamsburg, 28 November, 1779. 

SIR, 

Your Excellency s letter, on the discriminations 
which have been heretofore made between the troops 
raised within this State, and considered as part of 
our quota, and those not so considered, was delivered 
me four clays ago. I immediately laid it before the 
Assembly, who thereupon came to the resolution I 
now do myself the honor of inclosing to you. The re 
solution of Congress, of March 15, 1779, which you 
were so kind as to inclose, was never known in this 
State till a few weeks ago, when we received printed copies of the journals of Congress. It would be 
a great satisfaction to us to receive an exact return 
of all the men we have in Continental service, who 
come within the descriptions of the resolution, to 
gether with our State troops in Continental service. 
Colonel Cabell was so kind as to send me a return, 
of October, 1779, of the Continental regiments, commanded by Lord Stirling, of the 1st and 2d Virginia 
State regiments, and of Colonel Gist s regiment. Be 
sides these, there are the following ; Colonel Harrison s regiment of artillery, Colonel Baylor s horse, 
Colonel Eland s horse, General Scott s new levies (part 
of which are gone to South Carolina, and part are 
here), Colonel Gibson s, regiment stationed on the Ohio, 
Heath s and O Hara s independent companies at the 
same stations, Colonel Taylor s regiment of guards 
to the Convention troops. Of these we have a re 
turn; there may possibly be others riot occurring to 
me. A return of all these would enable us to see 
what proportion of the Continental army is contri 
buted by us. 

We have, at present, very pressing calls to send 
additional numbers of men to the southward. No in 
clination is wanting, in either the legislative or ex 
ecutive powers, to aid them, or strengthen you ; but 
we find it very difficult to procure men. I herewith 
transmit to your Excellency some recruiting commissions, to be put into such hands as you may think 
proper, for reenlisting such of our soldiery as are 
not engaged already for the war. The act of Assem 
bly, authorizing these instructions, requires that the 
men enlisted should be reviewed and received by an 
officer, to be appointed for that purpose ; a caution 
less necessary in the case of men now actually in 
service, and therefore doubtless able-bodied, than in 
the raising new recruits. The direction, however, goes 
to all cases, and therefore we must trouble your Ex 
cellency with the appointment of one or more officers 
of review. Mr. Moss, our agent, receives orders, which 
accompany this, to pay the bounty money and re 
cruiting money, and to deliver the clothing. We have, 
however, certain reason to fear he has not any great 
sum of money on hand ; and it is absolutely out of 
our power, at this time, to supply him, or to say, 
with certainty, when we shall be able to do it. He 
is instructed to note his acceptances under the drafts, 
and to assure payment as soon as we shall have it 
in our power to furnish him, as the only substitute 
for money. Your Excellency s directions to the officer of review, will probably procure us the satisfac 
tion of being informed, from time to time, how many 
men shall be reenlisted. 

By Colonel Matthews, I informed your Excellency 
of the situation of Governor Hamilton and his companions. Lamothe and Dejean have given their pa 
roles, and are at Hanover Court-IIouse. Hamilton, 
Hay, and four others, are still obstinate. They, there 
fore, are still in close confinement, though their irons 
have never been on since your second letter on the 
subject, I wrote full information of this matter to 
General Phillips also, from whom I had received let 
ters on the subject. I cannot, in reason, believe that 

VOL. II. 31 
the enemy, on receiving this information, either from 
yourself or General Phillips, will venture to impose 
any new distresses on our officers in captivity with 
them. Yet their conduct, hitherto, has been most suc 
cessfully prognosticated, by reversing the conclusions 
of right reason. 

It is, therefore, my duty, as well as it was my 
promise to the Virginia captives, to take measures 
for discovering any change which may be made in 
their situation. For this purpose I must apply for 
your Excellency s interposition. I doubt not but you 
have an established mode of knowing, at all times, 
through your Commissary of Prisoners, the precise 
state of those in the power of the enemy. I must, 
therefore, pray you to put into motion any such 
means as you may have of obtaining knowledge of 
the situation of the Virginia officers in captivity. If 
you shall think proper, as I could wish, to take upon 
yourself to retaliate any new sufferings which may be 
imposed on them, it will be more likely to have due 
weight, and to restore the unhappy, on both sides, to 
that benevolent treatment, for which all should wish. 
I have the honor to be, with the most perfect esteem 
and respect, your Excellency s 

Most obedient and most humble servant, 

THOMAS JEFFERSON. 



FROM THOMAS NELSON. 

York, 28 November, 1779. 



MY DEAR GENERAL, 

Your kind favor of the 26th of last month, by 

some means reached me only a few days ago. I am 

greatly obliged by your concern for my health, which 
is perfectly restored. The confinement absolutely necessary for a member of Congress, who pays the at 
tention he ought to the great concerns of this Con 
tinent, is totally inconsistent with my constitution. 
It was with reluctance that I left Congress at the 
time I did; but my disorder, brought on and increased by a sedentary life, compelled me to do so. I am 
never so well as when I take upon me the soldier. 
It may be asked, why I do not engage seriously in 
that line. Believe me, when I tell you, that I have 
often lamented my not taking the field with you 
at the commencement of this war, and there is a 
punctilio at this time that prevents it. To enter 
in a subordinate rank would not suit my own feelings ; and to take rank of the worthy officer who had 
seen the brunt of the war, would wound his feelings, 
and show a want of generosity in myself. 

You have heard, before this day, of our misfortunebefore Savannah. The disappointment was increased 
by our great certainty of success. Some of our allies, 
who suffered in that affair, are now in this town in a 
very sickly condition indeed. The , one of the 

seven ships that were to winter in this Bay, is arrived with about three hundred land forces. The 
others, it is imagined, have borne away for the West 
Indies. Count d Estaing is certainly gone to Europe. 

Our Assembly has been sitting some time, and, 
about a fortnight ago, appointed a Committee of 
Ways and Means, to consider of measures for complying with the requisitions of Congress, as well as 
to support our own credit. I think I may venture 
to say, there will be not the least doubt of both 
being effected by taxes and loans. Congress may 
rely on her quota of money from this State, which, 
I hope, will quickly restore her credit. Never was 
America in more danger than at this time. The 
Continental treasury exhausted; internal commotions 
in some of the States; differences in Congress re 
specting the back territory claimed by Virginia., which, 
I fear, will be attended with serious consequences. 
It was determined, yesterday, to put all the officers 
and soldiers, who are citizens of this Commonwealth, 
upon the same footing with those in the Virginia line. 
A motion has been made to give the same quan 
tity of land to the officers and soldiers belonging to 
those States that have no back territory, as is pro 
vided for our own troops; but, to my great sorrow, 
it failed. I think it would have been but just, arid 
I am sure it would have been politic. The injury 
done to America, if those troops should quit the service, will be as great as if the Virginia line should 
quit it ; for, although I may not think those States 
have the least claim upon our back lands, yet I 
think the officers and soldiers should all be upon an 
equal footing, having, indeed, equal services; and to 
compel the States, so circumstanced, to purchase these 
lands for their troops, is subjecting them to a burden 
which they ought not to bear. I distinguish between 
the citizens of those States and the troops. The for 
mer cannot, upon any principle of justice, insist upon 
that country being thrown into the common stock, 
towards defraying the expenses of the war ; but the 
latter may complain of great injustice done them, 
when they see such a difference made between them 
and their fellow-soldiers, who have all engaged in 
the general defence of the States. Accept my sincere 
wishes for a continuance of your health, an object 
in which no one thinks himself more interested than 
Your friend and obedient servant, 

THOMAS NELSON, JR. 
FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SULLIVAN. 

Pompton, 1 December, 1779. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

Perhaps there was never more justice in any ad 
vice than that given by the philosopher to his prince, 
namely, "Always beware of the man that flatters you, 
and appears to coincide with your sentiments on all 



occasions." 



I am confident that I have never appeared to yourExcellency in this character; nay, I have studied to 
avoid even the appearance of being a flatterer. I 
knew, at the same time, that your Excellency, as 
well as all others in high office, had those animals 
constantly courting your favors ; and, I confess that 
I have sometimes felt an uneasiness, lest my neglect 
of expressing those sentiments of esteem and affec 
tion which I really felt should be construed into a 
want of cordial esteem for that Commander, to whom 
America stands so much indebted. Conscious, how 
ever, of my own sincerity, I contented myself with 
yielding a cheerful obedience to all orders your Ex 
cellency was pleased to honor me with; not doubting 
that some future period might discover in whose 
bosom the most lively sentiments of friendship andesteem were lodged. But, as my present state of 
health almost forbids me to hope for the honor of 
serving again under your command, your Excellency 
will excuse me in declaring that I have ever felt 
those exalted sentiments of esteem and affection for 
you, that even your sincerest friend can boast. My 
public and constant declaration has been, and I now 
repeat, that, in my opinion, you are the saviour of 
this country ; and that to your fortitude, bravery, and 
31* " 



36G LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

steady perseverance, do we owe the independence and 
freedom we enjoy. 

This I say, to remove any doubts that may have 
arisen respecting my friendship and affection ; and I 
should now have avoided it, did not my own feelings 
too strongly indicate that I can never have the plea 
sure of again serving under your Excellency s command. 

You will please to pardon this long and (I daro 
say) to you tedious introduction to something more 
interesting. Permit me, then, to inform your Excel 
lency, that the faction raised against you in 1777, 
into which General Conway was unfortunately and 
imprudently drawn, is not yet destroyed. The mem 
bers are waiting to collect strength, and seize some 
favorable moment to appear in force. I speak not 
from conjecture, but from certain knowledge. Their 
plan is to take every method of proving the danger 
arising from a Commander who enjoys the full and 
unlimited confidence of his army, and alarm the people with the prospect of imaginary evils; nay, they 
will endeavour to convert your virtues into arrows, 
with which they will seek to torment you. 

This plan was adopted the last winter ; and, if you 
will take the trouble of reading Mr. Tudor s oration, 
delivered at Boston in March last, you will find every 
line calculated to answer this purpose. The words 
are Tudor s, but the thoughts are borrowed. I heard 
them thrown out long before they were by him laid 
before the public. 

Here I cannot help digressing to congratulate yourExcellency on your compelling them to attack yourvirtue, and not putting it in their power to point out 
a single vice. 

The next step is to persuade Congress that the 
military power of America should be placed in threeor four different hands; each having a separate quarter of the Continent assigned him ; each commander 
to answer to Congress only for his conduct. This, 
they say, will prevent an aspiring commander from 
enslaving his country, and put it in the power of 
Congress, with the assistance of the other command 
ers, to punish the attempt. This is a refinement in 
politics, and an improvement on public virtue, which 
Greece or Rome could never boast. 

The present time is unfavorable to their design. 
They well know, that the voice of citizens and sol 
diers would be almost unanimously against them. 
But they wait a more favorable opportunity, whicli 
they will certainly improve. I am well convinced 
that they cannot succeed; yet I thought it my duty, 
in the moment of my departure, to give your Excel 
lency this notice, that you may not only be on yourguard, but avoid intrusting those in matters where 
your interest and honor are nearly concerned. Ap 
pearances may deceive even an angel. Could you 
have believed, four years since, that those adulators, 
those persons so tenderly and so friendly used, as 
were Gates, Mifflin, Reed, and Tudor, would become 
your secret and bitter, though unprovoked enemies? 
If we view them now, we cannot help lamenting the 
want of sincerity in mankind. I persuade myself 
that your Excellency s steady and prudent conduct 
will baffle every attempt, and I feel happy in having 
discharged my duty to the best of commanders ; and 
only beg leave to assure your Excellency, that, in 
whatever station fortune may place me in future, no 
man will be more ready to bestow the rewards due 
to your Excellency s disinterested zeal, bravery, fortitude, and perseverance, than, dear General, your Ex 
cellency s 

Most obedient and devoted servant, 

JOHN SULLIVAN. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LORD STIRLING. 

Baskingridge, 9 December, 1779. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have your Excellency s favor of this date, on the 
subject of the movement of the Virginia troops. I 
should have been very happy to have continued the 
command of them, as they are an excellent body of 
men, and, among the officers, many valuable men for 
whom I have the greatest esteem ; but, in all arrangements of the army, I have always been content 
with the commands that have been allotted to me, and 
I do not doubt I shall have reason to be so in the 
future arrangements. However pleasing the command 
of the Southern army might have been to me, the 
very great esteem I fyave for General Lincoln would 
prevent my entertaining a wish to take it out of his 
hands. Besides his abilities, the knowledge he has 
acquired of that country points him out as the fittest 
officer for that command, and I am happy he is con 
tinued in it. Whatever commands your Excellency 
may commit to my care, you may be assured will be 
executed with cheerfulness and faithfulness; and that, 
with much sincere affection, esteem, and regard, I 
have the honor to be your Excellency s 

Most obedient, humble servant, 

STIRLING. 
FROM GOVERNOR JEFFERSON. 

Williamsburg, 16 December, 1779. 

SIR, 

I take the liberty of putting under cover to yourExcellency, some letters to Generals Phillips and 
Riedesel, uninformed whether they are gone into 
New York or not, and knowing that you can best 
forward them in either case. 

I also trouble you with a letter from the Master 
of the Flag, in this State, to the British Commissary 
of Prisoners in New York, trusting it will thus be 
more certainly conveyed than if sent to Mr. Adams. 
It is my wish the British Commissary should return 
his answer through your Excellency, or your Com 
missary of Prisoners, and that they should not pro 
pose, under this pretext, to send another flag, as the 
mission of the present flag is not unattended by cir 
cumstances of suspicion, and a certain information of 
the situation of ourselves, and our allies here, might 
influence the measures of the enemy. Perhaps yourCommissary of Prisoners can effect the former modeof answer. 

I inclose to you part of an act of Assembly, as 
certaining the quantities of land which shall be al 
lowed to the officers and soldiers, at the close of the 
war, and providing means of keeping that country 
vacant which has been allotted for them. 

I am advised to ask the attention of your Excel 
lency to the case of Colonel Bland, late Commander 
at the barracks in Albemarle.* When that gentleman 
was applied to, to take that command, he attended 

* Colonel Bland had commanded at Charlottesville, after the arrival 
of the Convention troops at that place. See " The Bland Papers,"edited by Charles Campbell, pp. 1-29. 
the Executive here, and informed them, that he must 
either decline it, or be supported in such a way as 
would keep up that respect which was essential to 
his command, without, at the same time, [sacrificing] 
his private fortune. 

The Executive were sensible, that he would be ex 
posed to very great and unavoidable expense. They 
observed that his command would be in a department 
separate from any other, and that he actually relieved 
a Major-General from the same service. They did 
not think themselves authorized to say what should 
be done in this case, but undertook to represent the 
matter to Congress, and, in the mean time, gave it 
as their opinion that a decent table ought to be 
found for him. On this he undertook the command, 
and, in the course of it, incurred expenses which 
seem to have been unavoidable, unless he would 
have lived in such a way as is hardly reconcila 
ble to the spirit of an officer, or the reputation of 
those in whose service he is. Governor Henry wrote 
on the subject to Congress. Colonel Bland did the 
same ; but we learn .that they have concluded the 
allowance to be unprecedented and inadmissible in 
the case of an officer of his rank. The Commissaries, 
on this, have called on Colonel Bland for reimburse 
ment, A sale of his estate was about to take place. 
when we undertook to recommend to them to sus 
pend their demand till we could ask the favor of 
you to advocate this matter with Congress, so far as 
you may think it right ; otherwise the ruin of a very 
worthy officer must inevitably follow. I have the ho 
nor to be, with the greatest respect and esteem, yourExcellency s 

Most obedient and most humble servant, 

THOMAS JEFFERSON. 
FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Morristown, January, 1780. 

SIR, 

The situation of my department has been, for a 
long time, peculiarly embarrassed. My greatest soli 
citude and efforts have scarcely satisfied the common 
exigencies of the service ; and I have the mortifica 
tion to find that, in spite of all my endeavours, the 
difficulties are every day increasing. 

I have repeatedly mentioned to your Excellency, 
for some months past, that the supplies of money 
furnished the department were very unequal to the 
current expenses. I have all along flattered myself 
that affairs would take a new and more favorable 
turn. As Congress were deliberating upon the sub 
ject of finance, I was led to believe that the schemes 
and plans they were adopting would afford more 
ample relief; and have encouraged the agents, under 
such an expectation, to proceed in the execution of 
the business. They have been enabled to extend 
their credit thus far, so as to keep the wheels in 
motion, hoping not to fail until government could 
find ways and means for furnishing us with cash 
more adequate to the demands. 

But whatever grounds I supposed there were for 
authorizing such expectations, I now find they were 
vain and nugatory. The cloud thickens, and the 
prospects are daily growing darker. There is now 
no hope of cash. The agents are loaded with heavy 
debts, and perplexed with half-finished contracts, and 
the people clamorous for their pay, refusing to pro 
ceed in the public business unless their present demands are discharged. The constant run of expenses, 
incident to the department, presses hard for further 
credit., or immediate supplies of money. To extend 
one, is impossible ; to obtain the other, we have not 
the least prospect. I see nothing, therefore, but a 
general check, if not an absolute stop, to the pro 
gress of every branch of business in the whole department, I have little reason to hope that, with the 
most favorable disposition in the agents, it will be 
in our power to provide for the occasional demands 
of the army in their present cantonments; much less, 
to have in readiness the necessary apparatus, and 
supplies of different kinds, for putting the army in 
motion at the opening of the campaign. My apprehensions of a failure in these respects are so strong, 
and my anxiety for the consequences so great, that I 
feel it my duty once more to represent to your Ex 
cellency our circumstances and prospects. From such 
a view of our situation, you may be led not to ex 
pect more from us than we are able to perform, and 
may have time to take your measures consequent 
upon such information. 

I know not whether government can command such 
sums of money as are necessary for the current ex 
penses of the nation ; but it is a folly to expect that 
this expensive department can be long supported on 
credit. A further attempt would only bring ruin and 
distress upon ourselves, without affording any sub 
stantial advantage, either to the public or the army ; 
and, therefore, I think it highly necessary, as all mili 
tary movements are under your immediate direction, 
and as the affairs of this department are intimately 
connected with all the active operations, that you 
should have a right understanding with Administra 
tion, with respect to the support they can give. 
in executing the measures you may think proper to 
take. 
There is no deficiency in the resources of the 
country. On the contrary, I have authentic reasons 
to conclude the country is more plentifully stored 
with every material necessary for the provision and 
support of an army, than it has been for three years 
past. The defect lies in a want of proper means to 
draw them into public use. I cannot see how a re 
medy will be applied to this evil in the present ma 
nagement of finance. The wretched state in which 
that is involved, creates HCAV obstructions, and an ac 
cumulation of expenses in every branch of the department. 

Hitherto our principal difficulty has arose from a 
want of proper supplies of money, and from the inefficacy of that which we obtained ; but now there 
appears a scene opening which will introduce new 
embarrassments. The Congress have recommended to 
the different States to take upon themselves the furnishing certain species of supplies for our depart 
ment. The recommendation falls far short of the 
general detail of the business, the difficulty of ad 
justing which, between the different agents as well 
as the different authorities from which they derive 
their appointments, I am very apprehensive will intro 
duce some jarring interests, many improper disputes, 
as well as dangerous delays. Few persons, who have 
not a competent knowledge of this employment, can 
form any tolerable idea of the arrangements neces 
sary to give despatch and success in discharging the 
duties of the office, or see the necessity for certain 
relations and dependencies. The great exertions 
which are frequently necessary to be made, require 
the whole machine to be moved by one common in 
terest, and directed to one general end. How far the 
present measures, recommended to the different States, 

VOL. IT. 32 
are calculated to promote these desirable purposes, I 
cannot pretend to say; but there appears to me such 
a maze, from the mixed modes adopted by some 
States, and about to be adopted by others, that I 
cannot see the channels, through which the business 
may be conducted, free from disorder and confusion. 

It would be a folly for me to attempt to change 
the general disposition of mankind, or to flatter my 
self with the hopes of a different conduct from those 
who may be employed in the various branches of the 
department, than what is known to influence and 
govern men. If experiments are necessary, I have 
not the least objections to their being made ; but I 
cannot agree to be responsible for the consequences. 
If government is distressed, and these expedients are 
requisite for her relief, my aid shall not be wanting, 
during my stay in the department, to give them a 
fair and full operation ; but I cannot say that I think 
they will either answer the expectations of the pub 
lic, or prove competent to the demands of the army. 

It cannot be more disagreeable to your Excellency 
to receive, than it is to me to make, so unfavorable 
a representation. I have left no steps unattempted, 
that appeared calculated to put affairs on a more 
prosperous footing; and I have hoped that every 
succeeding account would be more promising than the 
last. I should betray my trust, were I to amuse yourExcellency with hopes and encouragements; and I 
beg that this description of my department may not 
only be considered as justly drawn, but dictated by 
motives of duty, and aiming at the advantage of the 
public. I am, with great respect, 
Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

NATHANAEL GREENE. 
FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LINCOLN. 

Charleston, 8 January, 1780. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

I was, a few days since, honored with your Excel 
lency s favor of the 26th of October last, by Lieuten 
ant-Colonel Ternant. I am too fully convinced of the 
utility of the new regulations, not to afford him every 
countenance and assistance in my power; and it will 
be my greatest attention to have the troops in this 
department formed on the plan adopted for the order 
and discipline of the army of the United States. 

I hear, but have no official notice of it, that the 
Virginia line are ordered from the main army, to reenforce this department. If this should prove true, 
it will be fortunate indeed for this country, and, I 
think, exceedingly so for the United States and the 
cause in general ; for it is such an attention to the 
safety of this people, that, if ever an idea has been 
formed and nourished among them that they were 
neglected by Congress, it must now be removed; be 
sides the security it will afford to this State and 
Georgia. 

By the last accounts I have received from Savan 
nah, the enemy seem to be alarmed by the move 
ments of the Spaniards ; and, towards the end of the 
last month, sent off the sixty-eighth regiment to St. 
Augustine, and, some say, another small corps. What 
has been the fate of Mobile and Pensacola, is uncertain; by some accounts, we have reason to believe 
that they are in the hands of the Spaniards. This I 
have from a number of deserters ; and it is since con 
firmed by Mr. Cowen, one of our officers who was 
lately exchanged and left Savannah. I think there 
cannot be a doubt but that such a report prevails 
there but what gave rise to it, I know not. Though 
I have not so full evidence in favor of the report, as 
gives me satisfaction respecting the truth of it, yet 
I have thought it necessary and my duty to give 
your Excellency this hint. 

While I congratulate your Excellency on the suc 
cess of the arms of the United States, in the depart 
ment more immediately under your direction, I have 
to lament that so little has been done here, that we 
have nothing for our consolation, but that we have 
not permitted the enemy to run away with us. I 
have tlie honor to be, with the highest esteem, 
Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 



FROM ELBRIDGE GERRY, IN CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 12 January, 1780. 

SIR, 

The requisitions to the several States for reenforcements to the army, proposed in your letter of the 
18th November last, are not yet adopted by Con 
gress, and a fresh application from your Excellency 
appears to me necessary for promoting that important 
business. A report has been long since made on the 
subject, and been several times under the considera 
tion of Congress ; but an opinion has been lately 
suggested, and I fear with too much effect, "that the 
number of men enlisted for the war is already suffi 
cient, and that reinforcements are not necessary for 
the army in this quarter." Should this sentiment 
prevail, or the requisitions be much longer delayed, 
we shall probably lay the foundation of an inactive 
campaign, if not of greater misfortunes ; and renew 
the uneasiness of the Court of France, who last yearremonstrated in very friendly, but expressive terms, 
against the delays of our military preparations for 
that campaign. As the measures of our good ally 
for the establishment of our independence, as well as 
those of the common enemy against it, are prose 
cuted with the greatest vigor, it appears to me that 
we are urged by every principle of policy, generosity, 
and honor, to be equally vigorous and decisive, and 
I have been thus induced to trouble your Excellency 
on the subject. 

I hope that the measures taken and such as are 
under the consideration of Congress, for obtaining 
supplies of provisions, will effectually relieve the 
wants of the army, which, I confess, distress me ex 
ceedingly. I am, Sir, with every sentiment of respect 
and esteem, 

Your most obedient and humble servant, 

ELBRIDGE GERRY. 



FROM JOHN ARMSTRONG. 

Carlisle, 12 January, 1780. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

The present distressing aspect of our public affairs 
compels me to add to your Excellency s present trou 
bles the reading of the following lines. About this 
time I hoped to have heard of your being in Phila 
delphia, and fully intended writing at some greater 
length than the haste of the bearer will now admit. 

I need not take up the train, much less the 
causes, of our present most critical and dangerous 
situation. The flames of political destruction are en32* 
kindled all around us, and have made their formida 
ble progress but too obvious even to common reflec 
tion; nor have I ever separated the great public con 
cern from, that peculiar degree of anxiety, which 
must possess your mind, on the languishing state of 
our finance. On the subtile subject of finance, iny 
pretensions are truly small; but on the necessity of 
some different measures from any yet adopted, what 
man can shut his eyes ? To say nothing of the vari 
ous aerial schemes which have been thrown out, onething is clear, that even such as have been tried, 
from their show of more reason and solidity, either 
from their being inadequate in their nature, or too 
late in their application, have palpably failed of the 
effect. For some time past we have resembled a pa 
tient far gone in disease, given up by his physicians, 
and left to the mere efforts of nature. Now, whether 
we shall proceed in this same natural, or rather 
slothful and timid way, leaving our internal commerce to regulate itself, and take chance for the 
event, or attempt the plain highway of law and pub 
lic authority, in the regulation of prices generally, 
appears to bo the question, and that without an al 
ternative that can promise success. 

The latter, however degraded by merchants, or ex 
ploded by some politicians of more refined senti 
ments, if I have any opinion at all, is the better, 
if not the only fundamental means of our political 
recovery. I know there are powerful objections to 
this doctrine of regulation of prices by law, or rather 
they are powerfully made; for, at this time I must in 
truth declare, I think their whole operation imperti 
nent, inconclusive, and lost in the superior force of 
those arguments, which inevitably result from the 
present circumstances of this country ; whereby the 
great law of necessity is now clearly introduced for 
the trial of a legal regulation of prices, and must, at 
least, fully justify the experiment. I know the grand 
difficulties, as well as the niceties attending such 
regulations, must lie in the execution and penalties 
of this law. Hard they may be, but ought not to 
be supposed insurmountable. True, the virtue of the 
populace is very low, but not altogether extinct, the 
latent remains whereof must yet instrumentally save 
us. If so, how are we to animate these remains, when 
the natural springs thereof are so much relaxed ? 
No other probable, or perhaps possible w r ay, but by 
the salutary stimulus of public authority, and the en 
couragement they may derive from a near prospect 
of peace, or at least of retrenching the extra ex 
penses of the civil staff of the army, which would 
naturally lead to some further observation; I mean 
such as arises on the remarks, sentiments, and tem 
per of many people far out of your sight and hearing. 

But now Colonel Davis waits with impatience, and 
obliges me to conclude. Your Excellency will easily 
conceive my design, in these hasty lines, arises from 
a wish that your helping hand may be put to this 
business, although out of your strict sphere of action, 
as it is to be apprehended that different sentiments 
on politics may obstruct the measure. I am, with 
great truth and respect, your Excellency s 

Most obedient and affectionate humble servant, 

JOHN ARMSTRONG. 

P. S. I could sincerely wish the policy of Virgi 
nia, respecting their Land-Office and extent of terri 
tory, were otherwise timed, and more disinterested. 
FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LORD STIRLING. 

Elizabeth town, 16 January, 1780. 

SIR, 

I have the honor to inform your Excellency that 
early yesterday morning the corps under my command crossed the sound at Do Hart s Point, and pro 
ceeded towards the watering place. The enemy having received previous intelligence of our movements, 
a surprise was out of the question ; and as their works 
Avere well situated, and appeared otherwise strong, an 
assault was deemed unadvisable, as it would probably 
have cost us more than we could have gained by 
success. We found, too, contrary to our expectation, 
that the communication between the Island and New 
York was open. 

Immediately on our arrival in front of the enemy s 
works, they sent off a boat to the city and in the 
evening several vessels came down from thence to 
the Island. As, from this circumstance, there was no 
hope of reducing them, for want of provision or 
fuel, and a reenforcement might have rendered ourcontinuance dangerous, we determined to march off 
this morning. The retreat was effected in good or 
der, and with very little loss. A party of the en 
emy s horse charged our rear-guard, under Major Ed 
wards, but was immediately repulsed. The Major had 
three men killed, and killed one of the light horse 
men, and took his horse. Some of the men were 
frost-bitten, and, though we took all the pains in ourpower to have all those unable to march transported 
in sleighs, yet I imagine a very few may have been 
left behind. We took a few prisoners, and had a 
few deserters from the enemy. 
Immediately after crossing, a party was detached 
under Lieutenant-Colonel Willett, to Decker s Point. 
The corps there had been alarmed, and barely madeits escape. The house (as a garrison place), and 
eight or nine small vessels near it, were burnt. A 
considerable quantity of blankets and other stores 
were found. 

While the troops were upon the Island, a number 
of persons from this side took advantage of the 
occasion to pass upon the Island, and plunder the 
people there in the most shameful and merciless 
manner. Many of them were stopped on their re 
turn, and their booty taken from them; in addition 
to which, I have sent an order for publication, re 
quiring those who had eluded the search, to restore 
the articles in their possession, and exhorting the 
good people at large to assist in detecting them. All 
the soldiery, on re-crossing the ice, were searched, 
and the little plunder they had, taken from them ; 
and their names noted, that they may be brought to 
punishment. The articles recovered are and will be 
deposited with the Reverend Mr. Caldwell (who is 
exerting himself in the affair), to be returned to the 
owners. I am happy to inform your Excellency that 
a very inconsiderable part indeed of the troops dishonored themselves by participating in these enormities. 

The officers and men, in general, showed a good 
disposition; and I only regret there was no opportu 
nity of turning it to advantage. I have the honor 
to be, your Excellency s 

Most obedient and humble servant, 

STIRLING. 
FROM THE CHEVALIER 1)E LA LUZERNE, MINISTER FROM 
FRANCE. 

(Translation.) 

Philadelphia, 23 January, 1780. 

SIR, 

Advices recently received from Europe, make men 
tion of the efforts, which the English have made in 
Germany to procure recruits and new levies, and of 
the difficulty they have experienced, even on the part 
of those Courts with whom they have before treated. 
The greatest part of the German Princes, who have 
sold soldiers to the Court of London, now blush at 
these sales, which have excited their subjects against 
them, and which, besides, have drained their States. 
They are reluctant to give troops to a power that is 
making war against France, with whom they have 
always preserved amicable tics ; and I am. assured, 
that it is even doubtful whether the English will be 
able to procure a few recruits to complete the corps 
they have in America. 

I am informed that these circumstances have determined the British Government to make every effort 
to obtain men in America, whom they cannot procure 
in Europe \ and that Mr. Clinton has received orders 
to spare no pains to effect the exchange or deliver 
ance of the troops of the Convention of Saratoga, and 
of other prisoners who are in the hands of the 
Americans. It is added, that the want of the Court 
of London for soldiers is so pressing, that General 
Clinton has been authorized to surmount all the difficulties which may arise in the negotiation of this 
exchange; and that he is even permitted, in case of 
absolute necessity, to treat with Congress, or their 
Ministers, on terms of perfect equality, and as with 
an independent power. He has also equally full 
liberty to agree upon the number of private soldiers 
who may be given in exchange for an officer of any 
rank whatsoever ; and they order him simply to re 
member, in treating of this matter, that an English 
soldier, transported to America, is of an infinite price 
to England, and they exhort him to employ all his 
efforts to bring about an exchange, whatever may be 
the conditions. 

I hasten to communicate these interesting ideas to 
Congress ; and I have learned that they were confirmed by the event, and that Major-General Phillips had 
in effect drawn on a negotiation, the progress of 
which had been entirely confided to your Excellency. 
They prayed me, at the same time, to send you a 
communication of these objects, which the Congress 
think ought greatly to influence the measures which 
it will be in your power to take, when you know 
that the English Commissioners have orders to pass 
over all difficulties, and to grant all the demands 
which may be made, rather than to lose the occasion 
of reenforcing the army they have upon this Continent, 

I join to this some extracts, the contents of which 
have appeared to me of a nature to interest yourExcellency. You will see, besides, Sir, by the des 
patch of the British Minister, with what affectation 
he seeks to make the Thirteen States to be consi 
dered as subjected to the English domination, and you 
will judge of what importance it is to you to treat 
with the Court of London upon the footing of per 
fect equality, and how useful an act of this nature 
may be to the negotiations of Congress in Europe, 
when they can add to all the facts, of which the 
Court of Madrid makes mention in its memoir, a cartel regulated on the footing of perfect parity, and 
which would prejudge, beforehand, the question of 
your independence. I congratulate myself that this 
negotiation is in your hands and I am well per 
suaded that nothing will pass derogatory to the part 
which my Court has taken, in acknowledging the 
independence and perfect sovereignty of the United 
States. 

I shall intrust to your Excellency, that the King is 
disposed to send over succours to this Continent, of 
arms and ammunition ; but, as the events of the sea 
are uncertain, I believe that it will be proper to make 
no change in the measures which may have been taken 
otherwise to procure them. This news not having 
reached me till yesterday, I have not yet been able 
to make a communication of it to Congress. 

As you may be retained in your quarters by important considerations, I propose to go to pay you my 
respects in the course of the next month, and con 
fer with your Excellency on objects of great import 
ance, and relative to the measures necessary to push 
the next campaign with vigor, and to put the Ame 
rican army in a condition truly proper to hold the 
enemy in check upon the Continent, whilst his Ma 
jesty and the King of Spain shall display, in the 
other parts of the world, all their forces, to secure 
advantageous terms of peace to the allies. 

I am, with respect, Sir, 

LUZEIIXE. 

P. S. This letter will be delivered to your Excel 
lency by M. de Gal van, who has been raised to the 
rank of Major by your goodness. He desires to 
merit it anew, and prays me to solicit you to put his 
zeal in activity. I shall be very grateful for what 
you may be pleased to do for him. He was particu 
larly recommended to me by the Minister of France. 
He appeared to me to merit a great deal from his 
zeal, and from his personal attachment to your Ex 
cellency. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LINCOLN. 

Charleston, 23 January, 1780. 

MY PEAR GENERAL, 

I had, a few days since, the honor of your favor 
of the 12th ultimo, by Colonel Laurens, announcing 
that the Virginia line were ordered to this depart 
ment, than which nothing could be more acceptable, 
saving that of their not being needed. Their speedy 
arrival is an event most ardently wished for. 

By our late accounts from Philadelphia, and from 
a large ship being seen off this bar on the 10th, 
with troops on board, said to be from New York to 
Savannah, we are led to believe that the enemy will 
be early reenforced in Georgia. From that idea, and 
from a belief that this town will be the object which 
will claim their first attention, I have requested the 
Governor of this State to order into Augusta a num 
ber of his militia, to relieve the Continental troops 
there; all of which I mean to draw, as soon as possible, into such post as will facilitate their being 
thrown suddenly to a point. 

I find myself greatly embarrassed to know what 
ground to occupy; for, if we draw them into this 
town or its vicinity, and the enemy should attempt 
the same route as the last year, we shall lose the 
advantages of opposing them at the several strongpasses between this town and the Savannah. If we 

VOL. ii. 33 
should throw the troops near that river, from an idea 
that the enemy will cross it, and instead of that they 
should take shipping, and land between us and this 
town, they will shut us out of it; the consequence 
of which would, I think, be its loss. Besides, if we 
keep the troops near this town, and the enemy should 
land northward of the bar, they will, in that case, 
probably reach Haddrel s Point before us, and there 
by Fort Moultrie will be in danger. If we divideour few troops, there will be danger that w r e shall 
be beaten in detachment. 

It is, my dear Sir, among my first misfortunes, that 
I am not near enough to your Excellency to have 
the advantage of your advice and direction. But this 
I cannot enjoy. I feel my own insufficiency and 
want of experience. I can promise you nothing but 
a disposition to serve my country. If this town 
should be attacked, as now threatened, I know my 
duty will call me to defend it as long as opposition 
can be of any avail. I hope my inclination will co 
incide with my duty. 

If the enemy mean seriously to attack this town, 
I think, previous thereto, they will have their emis 
saries in the back part of this country to stimulate 
the Indians, and the unfriendly, to acts of hostility. 
We have, therefore, to guard against their baneful in 
fluence as much as possible. For this purpose, it is 
necessary that we at all times keep a body of men 
in arms near the inland frontiers. I have requested 
the Governor of North Carolina, immediately on the 
attack of this town, to embody a number of militia, 
and march them towards the frontiers of his State, 
where there are many disaffected people ; as they 
would not only quell any disturbance there, but, in 
case they should not be needed for that purpose, 
they might march this way, and serve as a ree nforcement to us. 

Two of ours, and the French frigates, are going out 
to see what discoveries they can make. They would 
have gone sooner, but the French ships had not 
water over the bar, and ours were out of repair. 

I have requested the Governor of Virginia to or 
der shoes, stockings, and other clothing to be sup 
plied the troops on their march, and that he would 
forward clothing here for their future supply. I wish, 
if you approve of the application, that you would 
support it. 

I am very sorry that Colonel Laurens, after waiting a number of days, could not get a passage by 
water as he expected; for thereby, my letter to you, 
instead of being the first, was long detained, and the 
consequence was that you received the information of 
our raising the siege before Savannah from Congress, 
when you ought to have had it from me. Though I 
was in hopes that I had given too great evidence of 
my attachment to you, to believe that it was from a 
designed neglect, yet I could not so fully rely on the 
candor of the world, and was afraid that it would be 
construed to my disadvantage, and that some might 
attempt to persuade your Excellency that I have not 
really that attachment and esteem which I have al 
ways expressed. I hope no such attempt has been 
made, for nothing could be more injurious. 

24:(/i. Since I began this letter, what was before 
conjecture, is now nearly reduced to a certainty ; 
namely, that the enemy mean a descent on this 
State, which probably will happen soon. Yesterday, 
a vessel was decoyed into this harbour, by a tender 
to our Continental frigates, bound from New York to 
Savannah, in company with a fleet of about ninety 
sail, bound to that port, convoyed by the followingships, namely; three seventy-fours, three sixty-fours, 
one fifty-four, one forty, and one frigate ; the Europe, 
Russel, Roebuck, Robust, Renown, Defiance, Romulus, 
and Perseus. She was separated from the fleet off 
Cape Hat-terns, in a storm, about twenty days since. 
She has on board a few bales of clothing, some furniture, &c., but the whole, as it is said, of inconsider 
able amount. Passengers in her, one Lieutenant and 
one Ensign in the British service, besides other pas 
sengers; and five privates in Robinson s corps. 

This news has induced me to write to Governor 
Jefferson and Governor Caswell, requesting them to 
give every possible assistance to facilitate the march 
of the troops ordered from the main army to reenforce this. I have the honor to be, my dear General, with the greatest regard and esteem, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL ST. CLAIR. 

Crane s Mills, 28 January, 1780. 

SIR, 

I arrived at Colonel Hazen s quarters the night be 
fore last; and yesterday, with him, visited the several posts, which I found to bo Rahway, Crane s Mills, 
Connecticut Farms, Elizabethtown, and Newark. Elizabethtown and Newark are occupied by small detach 
ments only, and guards are posted at De Hart s and 
Ilalstcd Points. A small guard is also kept at the 
New Blazing Star from the post at Rahway. 

In this situation the troops are as compact as, I 
believe, the nature of the cantonment will allow, con 
sistently with the objects in view; yet they are farfrom being so much so as could be wished. The 
distance these different places lie from one another, 
and the want of horse to communicate speedily any 
movements of the enemy, render it very easy to surprise one or other of the posts, particularly Railway, 
which is only two miles from the Sound, and lies 
five miles from hence and five miles from the Blazing Star. The small detached guard at that place 
may be very easily taken off; and then their flank, 
and even their rear, is entirely open. 

To cover effectually such an extent of country as 
from Newark to Arnboy, in the present state of the 
ice, would require a very considerable body of troops; 
and the dispersing them in small bodies exposes them 
to many accidents, and greatly favors desertion, which, 
with much regret, I find has prevailed on these 
commands. 

In Elizabethtown I found a four days guard, con 
sisting of one hundred men with a Field-Officer. 
This I reduced to a Captain and fifty, to be relieved 
daily, which I thought would answer every purpose 
that could be expected from the hundred, as they 
may, when on for one day only, be kept constantly 
alert, and half of them at a time patrolling during 
the night. Indeed, I believe good patrols would 
answer every purpose better than small guards; but, 
where the distance betwixt posts is considerable, they 
should be composed of horse. The guards at De 
Hart s and Halsted Points are certainly much ex 
posed, and if the enemy suffer them to remain, it 
must arise from extreme caution, or their having 
something of more importance in contemplation, for I 
cannot suppose they want information of our position. 
33* 
I have not yet been able to ascertain the enemy s 
number on Staten Island, or at Paulus Hook, but 
expect to-day to have pretty good accounts of the 
last, as also of the state of the ice on both the North 
and East Rivers 5 but from all that I can learn, and 
from the intelligence Colonel Hazen has received, 
their numbers on the Island amount to two thousand 
and upwards. The reinforcement, thrown in from 
New York, consisted of three regiments, supposed 
about seven or eight hundred men ; part of them are 
cantoned, and part encamped about the middle of the 
Island. Intelligence is, however, very difficult to be 
obtained, and is not, in my opinion, in a good train; 
the person who seems to be most depended upon 
bearing a very bad character, and known to act as 
an agent for the enemy. Indeed, it will be almost 
impossible to get it into another train, unless the in 
tercourse betwixt the inhabitants and the Island can 
be prevented ; nor can a stop be put to the traffic 
carried on with the city, unless some other way of 
rewarding those we employ be fallen upon, than 
countenancing it in their favor. 

Nothing has yet presented itself to induce any 
attempt upon the enemy which should at least 
have probability in its favor. Their advanced picket 
at Mills might be taken off, but it is a tri 

fling object, and the retreat of the party might be 
prevented. If any thing is to be done on the Island, 
it must, I believe, be by open force, which they seem 
to expect, as, from the information of a deserter, 
they are improving their works, and adding abatis, 
and keep their troops as close to them as possible. 
They are also constructing a new work with timber, 
on a hill that commands the redoubt at the watering 
place. There is, at present, an open passage to New 
York, but it is frequently interrupted by the driving ice. 

Doctor Burnet expected a trusty, intelligent person 
from New York last night, and I shall see him to 
day. By him I expect the information your Excel 
lency wishes with respect to the East River, and the 
situation of the enemy s vessels. If it favors Colonel 
Willett s enterprise, I shall desire him to wait upon 
your Excellency immediately. I find, by an order of 
General Tryon s of the 13th, that a number of ba 
teaux are to be laid up at De Nuys s Ferry, at the 
Narrows. 

I suppose Colonel Hazen has informed your Excel 
lency of the attempt the enemy intended upon the 
detachment at Rahway, on Wednesday last, which 
was prevented by Colonel Gray s having obtained 
some notice of it. I cannot help repeating that 
horse are much wanted to give any degree of se 
curity to the cantonments ; but, as one object is to 
cover and secure the inhabitants, they ought, some 
of them at least, to be furnished by the State, and 
if these were trusty, good men, acquainted with the 
country, they would make the best patrols possible. 
I believe, too, they would more effectually check the 
spirit of traffic than it will ever be done by the 
soldiery, who hold it, in some measure, a disrepu 
table employment. 

I wish I could give your Excellency any hint that 
might help to prevent or check the shameful desertion that prevails, and for which the troops of Penn 
sylvania, especially, have so little reason. It would, 
perhaps, answer a good end, whilst the ice continues 
firm, instead of detachments from the army, to send 
whole corps; the first to be taken from those lines 
where that vice has not crept in. By the time oneor two commands are completed, the communication 
will probably be more difficult. 

I have inquired, of every person I thought could 
give me proper information, into the causes of ourmisfortune at Newark and Elizabethtown, and it appears to have been owing to negligence in not having the patrols out in proper time, and to their having fatigued themselves too much the night before ; 
and it is certain, that the Captain had not a single 
vidette, nor even a sentry on the stable where his 
horses were. I am not quite satisfied whether yourExcellency intended a formal inquiry, or that I should 
inform myself in the manner I have done. Nothing 
further occurs at present. If any intelligence of mo 
ment arrives, it shall be immediately communicated, 
and I will detain Colonel Hazen until I hear from 
your Excellency. I have the honor to be, Sir, 
Your most obedient servant, 

ARTHUR ST. CLAIR. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL WAYNE. 

Wayncsborough, 4 February, 1780. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

I was so unfortunate as not to be acquainted with 
the intended attempt upon Staten Island ; otherwise 1 
certainly would not wish to be absent. But the mis 
fortune I most regret is, that nature had not formed 
her bridge previous to the dissolution of the light 
corps ; for, be assured, w r e remained some days, wishing and anxiously waiting for that event, after the 
state of our magazines, together with your orders, 
rendered a separation inevitable. 

I am confident that your Excellency will do me 
the justice to believe that, if any opening had offered 
to strike the enemy with a prospect of success, and 
where the object would have justified the attempt, 
not one moment would have been lost in asking yourpermission and final direction. 

In addition to my former request respecting the 
command in the light corps, I beg to be employed 
on every occasion where your Excellency may think 
me worthy of trust, either as a volunteer, or in any 
other character that you may deem most conducive 
to the benefit of the service; and to believe me, with 
the truest esteem, your very affectionate, and 
Most obedient, humble servant, 

ANTHONY WAYNE. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Morristown, 7 February, 1780. 

SIR, 

The inclosed copy of a representation from Colonel 
Barry, an Assistant Deputy-Quartermaster-General in 
this State, will show your Excellency that a new 
difficulty has arisen to delay transportation. It is 
very unfortunate that we should lose the advantage 
of this favorable term of conveyance, as the time is 
just at hand when it will be almost impossible to 
bring forward the supplies. 

The inhabitants are unwilling to give their aid, at 
the prices regulated by law, unless the regulation 
extends through all the States. I do not consider 
myself authorized to instruct my agents to break 
over the laws of the State; and now find a stagna 
tion in bringing on the provisions. 

People will withhold their services in this State, 
as long as they receive a less compensation than 
their neighbours. They seem to claim it as a right, 
that they be allowed their usual prices until the 
other States adopt measures for enforcing a regula 
tion. I do not hear them object to have a limitation 
of prices take place ; but they insist upon its not 
being binding on them till it is so on others. YourExcellency can foresee the consequences of the present difficulty, and will direct and authorize me in 
what manner to proceed. I am your Excellency s 
Most obedient, humble servant, 

NATIIANAEL GREENE. 



FROM GOVERNOR JEFFERSON. 

Williamsburg, 10 February, 1780. 

SIR, 

It is possible you may have heard that, in the 
course of last summer, an expedition was meditated 
by our Colonel Clark against Detroit; that he had 
proceeded so far as^ to rendezvous a considerable 
body of Indians, I believe four or five thousand, at 
St. Vincent s ; but, being disappointed in the number 
of whites he expected, and not choosing to rely prin 
cipally on the Indians, he was obliged to decline it. 
We have a tolerable prospect of reenforcing him this 
spring, to the number which he thinks sufficient for 
the enterprise. We have informed him of this, and 
left him to decide between this object and that of 
giving vigorous chastisement to those tribes of Indi 
ans whose eternal hostilities have proved them inca 
pable of living on friendly terms with us. It is ouropinion his inclination will lead him to determine on 
the former. 
The reason of my laying before your Excellency 
this matter, is, that it has been intimated to me that 
Colonel Brodhead is meditating a similar expedition. 
I wished, therefore, to make you acquainted with 
what we had in contemplation. The enterprising and 
energetic genius of Clark is not altogether unknown 
to you. You also know (what I am a stranger to) 
the abilities of Brodhead, and the particular force 
with which you will be able to arm him for such an 
.expedition. We wish the most hopeful means should 
be used for removing so uneasy a thorn from ourside. As yourself alone are acquainted with all the 
circumstances necessary for well-informed decision, I 
am to ask the favor of your Excellency, if you 
should think Brodhead s undertaking is most likely 
to produce success, that you will be so kind as to 
intimate to us to divert Clark to the other object, 
which is also important to this State. It will, of 
course, have weight with you in forming your deter 
mination, that our prospect of strengthening Clark s 
hands sufficiently is not absolutely certain. It may 
be necessary, perhaps, to inform you, that these two 
officers cannot act together, which excludes the hopes 
of insuring success by a joint expedition. I have 
the honor to be, with the most sincere esteem, yourExcellency s 

Most obedient and most humble servant, 

THOMAS JEFFERSON. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL HEATH. 

Highlands, 10 February, 1780. 

DEAR GENERAL, 
In the following I shall give your Excellency a 
state of facts relative to the late capture of Lieuten 
ant-Colonel Thompson and part of his detachment, on 
the lines of this post, on the 3d instant. 

Lieutenant-Colonel Thompson was at that time at 
Young s, near the White Plains ; his detachment con 
sisted of five companies. Captain Watson, of the 
third regiment, with his company, was at Young s 
house with the Lieutenant-Colonel. Captain Roberts, 
of the fifteenth regiment, and Captain Stoddard, of the 
first regiment, were on his right ; their greatest distance about two miles. On his left were CaptainLieutenant Farley, of the ninth regiment, and Captain 
Cooper, of the fourteenth regiment ; their extreme 
distance rather greater than the companies on the 
right. Pickets were advanced from each. 

On the morning of the 3d instant, about nineo clock, the Lieutenant-Colonel was informed that a 
body of the enemy s horse were advancing, and, at 
that time, about two and a half miles distant. Ap 
prehending the enemy to be horse only, he determined to remain where he was, and sent to the several 
companies to join him. Soon after this, the enemy 
attacked his picket (a sergeant and eight men), who 
fired on the horse, which checked them. On which 
the picket attempted to join the body, but were over 
taken by the horse, one or two of them wounded, 
and the whole taken prisoners. Not long after, the 
enemy s horse appeared in sight of the house. The 
Lieutenant-Colonel had been joined by Captain Roberts s company, who formed on the right. The enemy s horse halted at a distance, and discharged their 
rifles. Soon after, the infantry appeared, advancing to 
the front and right flank of our troops, who were now 
joined by Captain-Lieutenant Farley s company on 
the left; Captain Stoddard and Captain Cooper coming up, one on the right, the other on the left. Our troops preserved their order, and did not fire until 
some time after the enemy began. When they re 
ceived orders to fire, the enemy immediately scattered, 
availing themselves of trees and the ground, of which, 
it must be acknowledged, they very judiciously took 
the advantage, springing from one tree and place to 
another, and constantly gaining ground ; their fire being directed both against the front and flank of our troops, and a number being killed and wounded, 
they broke, some retreating up the road, others into 
the house, from the doors and windows of which 
they fired on the enemy. 

At this time, Captain Stoddard and Captain Cooper 
came up ; the former gave the enemy two or three fires, but, the distance being great, probably did little 
or no execution. The horse, at this instant, were 
very active, and overtook several of our men who 
were making their escape. It is said our troops discovered great bravery, and fought well for about fif 
teen minutes, when the Lieutenant-Colonel was compelled to surrender. We had fourteen men killed on 
the spot, including Captain Roberts ; and seventeen 
wounded, three of w r hom are since dead. Lieutenant Colonel Thompson, of Marshall s, Captain Watson, of 
Greaton s, Captain Farley, of Wesson s, Lieutenant Burley, of Tupper s, Lieutenant Maynard, of Greaton s, 
Ensign Fowler, of Nixon s, and Ensign Bradley, of 
Sheppard s, with ninety non-commissioned officers and 
soldiers, w r ere taken prisoners ; nine of whom, w T ho 
were wounded, were left by the enemy at a house 
some miles down the road. 

The enemy set fire to Young s house, and soon re 
tired, leaving two dead, and carrying off their wounded; among whom was a Captain of grenadiers, w r ound
VOL. n. 34ed in the hip, and a Lieutenant of the infantry, in 
the thigh. Our troops immediately after went on to 
the ground, and buried the dead. The enemy s force 
is said to have consisted of about sixty horse, 

and forty of the refugees, and between four hundred 
and five hundred infantry, detached from different 
corps, including a part or the whole of the grenadier 
and light infantry companies of the guards. Colonel 
Enimerick was out as a volunteer, on foot, with his 
rifle, and was very active. Colonel Morton, of the 
guards, commanded the whole, and Colonel Delany 
was with the refugee horse. 

Ilih. By two deserters, who left Fort Washington 
a few days since, I am informed that the enemy had 
at that place about one hundred and fifty sleighs, 
when they came away. The sleighs were employed 
in hauling wood. I am just now informed, by Colonel 
Badlam, who is on the advanced post, that a body of 
three hundred of the enemy s horse (probably part of 
these militia), and the seventh British regiment, came 
the last Monday from -Long Island to Westchester on 
the ice, where they now are. Whether their takingpost at Westchester is with offensive or defensive 
views, is uncertain; probably both. I have written 
Brigadier-General Poor to hold his brigade in the 
most perfect readiness for action, have patrols on the 
ice of Hudson s River, against Peekskill, and from the 
guard at , down towards Eort Montgomery. 

Every precaution is in exercise; and I trust the enemy will be disappointed, should they attempt to surprise us. I have the honor to be, with the greatest 
respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

WILLIAM HEATH. 
FROM COXONEL BRODHEAD. 

Fort Pitt, 11 February, 1780. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I wrote you on the 10th and 22d of November, 
and on the 13th of December last, and not having 
been honored with a line in answer to either of those 
letters, I begin to fear you have not duly received 
them, wherefore I take the liberty to inclose dupli 
cates. I likewise inclose the proceedings of a General 
Court-Martial on the trial of Lieutenant Arthur Gor 
don, Adjutant of the ninth Virginia regiment, and a 
return of the provisions in store. 

I have not seen Colonel George Morgan since I 
came to this department; neither have I seen the 
Deputy Quartermaster-General since last March. I 
have not a tent for my men, and, by the inclosed 
return, you will see that the provisions are scanty ; 
but I hope to be better supplied in the spring. 

I have frequently given the most pointed orders 
respecting the public craft, notwithstanding which, 
the greatest part is, or will be, carried away with 
the ice. What I could retain at this place I did, 
and secured it by hauling it upon land. If the officers commanding at the different posts had taken the 
same care, little or none would have been driven off. 
Such a deep snow and such ice have not been known 
at this place in the memory of the oldest natives. 
Deer and turkeys die by hundreds for want of food. 
The snow on the Alleghany and Laurel Hills is fourfeet deep. 

By one of our prisoners, who lately made his 
escape from the Wyandots, and who has frequently 
been at Detroit, I am informed that the new fort 
erected there has two bomb-proofs of wood ; that the 
walls are very high, fifteen feet thick, and made of 
fascines and clay ; that the barracks are sunk some 
distance into the ground, and that their roofs cannot 
be seen from without; that it stands on a fine commanding piece of ground, with a gentle descent each 
way ; likewise that it is surrounded by a ditch twen 
ty feet wide. The garrison consists of four hundred 
and fifty regulars, and the enemy have eighteen hundred men at Niagara, besides a great number of In 
dians. If this intelligence is true, unless some di 
version is occasioned by troops marching up the Susquehanna River, it is not improbable that the enemy 
may pay us a visit down the Alleghany Paver next 
spring, and I have neither men nor cannon sufficient 
for this fort, unless a reenforcement can be spared 
from the main army. I shall, however, make the 
best disposition that circumstances will admit, and, if 
possible, gain further intelligence from the Dela wares, 
who continue their declarations of friendship for us. 

I beg your Excellency will indulge me with twenty 
boat-builders, and some armourers, early in the spring. 
If I receive no orders to the contrary, and can be 
supplied with craft, I am determined to drive the Shawanese over the Lakes, which I can do before provi 
sions can be furnished for a capital expedition. 

I shall now transmit an estimate of cannon and 
military stores to the Board of War, in hopes that, 
by the time they arrive at this place, I shall be 
enabled to do something worthy the confidence you 
have placed in me. With the most exalted regard 
and esteem, I have the honor to be, your Excellency s 
Most obedient and most humble servant, 

DANIEL BIIODIIEAD. 
FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LINCOLN. 

Charleston, 12 February, 1780. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

I have received information that, on the 3d instant, 
the enemy landed about eight thousand troops, commanded by Sir Henry Clinton. If this is true, we 
may soon expect them before this town; for they 
probably know that we soon expect reinforcements. 

Two o clock, P. M. I have just received informa 
tion that a large fleet is off. Matters are fast ripening, and will, I think, soon become very serious. 

Eight o clock. I am told that fifty sail of vessels 
got into North Edisto this day. 

February 13^, three o clock in the morning. By a 
person just from Edisto, I learn that the number of 
vessels in at the harbour there is a little short of fifty. 

I am collecting the troops, and posting them in 
and near this town, saving the light-horse, and two 
hundred light troops. Those are in the southern 
part of the State, left with a view to hang on the 
enemy s left flank, should they attempt to march 
across land, and prevent the small parties strolling 
into the country, plundering, and distressing the in 
habitants. I am, my dear General, with the highestesteem, 

Your most obedient servant, 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 



FROM COLONEL JOHN LAURENS. 

Charleston, 14 February, 1780. 

DEAR GENERAL, 
I should have done myself the honor of writing to 
you earlier, "but postponed my intention in hopes of 
obtaining satisfactory intelligence of the force and 
designs of the enemy in this quarter. Although my 
expectations are far from being answered, I must en 
treat your Excellency s acceptance of what I have 
been able to collect on those subjects, lest the ex 
pected siege prolong my silence beyond the proper 
bounds. 

The day before yesterday, we had certain intelligence of the arrival of forty-five sail at North Edisto. 
A debarkation immediately commenced on Shnmons s 
Island; and an advanced corps, it is said, of five 
hundred, proceeded the following day to John s Is 
land. The Vigilant and two galleys are at Port 
Royal. Private accounts say that General Prevost is 
left to command at Savannah; that his troops consist 
of the Hessians and Loyalists that were there before, 
reenforced by a corps of blacks and a detachment of 
savages. It is generally reported that Sir Henry 
Clinton commands the present expedition. It appears 
to me to be the British policy to transfer the thea 
tre of the war to this vulnerable part of the Con 
tinent ; and, should their Commander-in-chief be here. 
I hope you w r ill do him the honor to meet him. 
The command of your winter-quarters might very 
well be left to a Major-General, and the appearance 
of your Excellency, in person, would produce such 
effects as would decide the American contest. The 
Carolinians, as usual, have been superior to foresight 
and precaution. The delay of the enemy produced 
no other effect than to increase their supineness, and 
finally to introduce a disbelief of the enemy s inten 
tions. But they begin to be roused. 

My father desires his most respectful compliments 
to your Excellency and Mrs. Washington. He has 
been detained here by M. Durumain s having taken 
French leave. This gentleman, who commanded the 
French frigate in this harbour, engaged to accommo 
date my father with a passage to France, but previously undertook a cruise in company with our Ame 
rican frigates. As soon, however, as he had passed 
the bar, he made the best of his way for Europe. 
A brace of two-deckers and a frigate are constantly 
standing off-and-on our harbour; but my father is 
determined, at all hazards, to prosecute his voyage, 
and fulfil his engagements to the public. 

I preferred a hasty letter to a total silence ; yourExcellency will be so indulgent as to excuse me for 
it, and assure Mrs. Washington of my respects. I 
have the honor to be, with the greatest veneration 
and attachment, 

Your Excellency s faithful Aid, 
JOHN LAURENS. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LINCOLN. 

Charleston, 4 March, 1780. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

Sir Harry seems to be collecting his force on 
James s Island, and is there throwing up some works ; 
one among the ruins of Fort Johnson, another a lit 
tle to the westward of it. It is said that he is also 
throwing up a bomb-battery opposite the town. Drawing his principal force to this Island, hauling his gal 
leys and other armed vessels of small draught of 
water near the mouth of Wappoo, collecting a num 
ber of boats there, indicate that an attempt on the 
southerly part of the town, by boats, will be made. 
It is pretty evident that he means to introduce his 
ships into the harbour, which I find he may effect 
with more safety than I once supposed he could ; for 
our frigates, which it was thought could lie before 
the bar, so as to command the entrance of it, appearto draw too much water for the purpose, and cannot 
anchor with safety nearer to it than three miles, and 
there they are liable to be annoyed from the shore; 
and the channel is so narroAV that they cannot an 
chor in line of battle. It is the opinion of all the 
Captains of the ships, that they can render more 
essential services by lying abreast, and acting in con 
junction with Fort Moultrie, than by taking any 
other post. 

General Hogan s arrival, last night, gives great happiness and spirit to the garrison; for we were be 
fore, and are now, much too weak ; we have but very 
little support from the country militia of this State ; 
there are but about two hundred of them in town, 
and it will be with difficulty that they will be 
brought into it, notwithstanding the exertions of the 
executive. The spirit with which they are conducting themselves, your Excellency will learn by the 
inclosed proclamation. 

The southern part of the State is exposed to the 
immediate incursions of the enemy, and to the depredations of the Tories. This, at present, keeps a 
number of men in that part in arms, to protect their 
families and property, which they say cannot be re 
moved. In the middle part of the country most of 
the inhabitants are disaffected, and a fcAV days since 
were in arms, and killed a number of people. This 
forbids any troops being drawn from that part of the 
country; force might be sent into it. The frontiers 
of the State are obliged to arm to restrain the sa 
vages, and for the defence of themselves, and the upper part of Georgia. The Eastern Shore is left for 
the defence of Georgetown and the sea-coast. 

Governor Caswell has, in the most pointed terms, 
ordered on the whole of the late drafts of threethousand. About one third of them are arrived, and 
he has directed two thousand more to embody nearthe bounds of the northerly part of this State, to act 
in either State, as circumstances may require. I was 
in hopes General Scott would have been here before 
now, but I cannot learn that he has yet left Peters 
burg. 

Our works are constantly going on, and matters 
every day grow better. The people are recovering 
their spirits, and have now high expectations. I 
have the honor to be, my dear General, with the 
highest respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Morristown, 6 March, 1780. 

SIR, 

Inclosed I send your Excellency a copy of my 
last letter to Congress, to which they have given no 
answer, and which necessarily involves very import 
ant consequences. 

The affairs of the Quarter-master s department are 
so intimately connected with the operations of the 
army, and the security, support, and movements of 
the latter so dependent on the former, that I think 
it my duty to give your Excellency the earliest in 
formation of every change and embarrassment in it, 
which may affect the service. This measure is necessary, not only for the public welfare, but for my own 
justification. 

Although I esteem it a peculiar misfortune to be 
reduced to the necessity of taking steps tending to 
my own justification, yet when I have not that sup 
port which was promised me by the Committee of 
Congress, when I engaged in the duties of the office, 
and which was and still is necessary to the order 
and management of the business, I have nothing left 
but to point out the causes of the failure. And I 
trust, when my conduct comes to be fully understood, 
and the business of the department stripped of vulgarprejudices and private enmity, it will be found to 
have been both prudently and honestly conducted. I 
shall not enter into a justification of all the detail of 
the business. I know it is too extensive for the wis 
dom of an angel to guard against every imposition. 
I am not chargeable for such evils, where the mis 
fortune originates in the plan of the war and the 
state of the finances. Though I cannot pretend to 
be responsible for the fidelity, discretion and prudence 
of every agent employed in the lesser branches of 
business, yet I presume the much greater part of 
every order are men of integrity, and some of them 
are the first characters for business upon the Continent. One thing I will venture to affirm with con 
fidence, which is, that every exertion has been madeby all the agents to promote the service in general, 
and to fulfil your Excellency s orders in particular, 
as far as the means in their hands or their personal 
credit or influence could be extended for the purpose. 

The crisis is now fast approaching, when there will 
be a general stagnation of business, as some of the 
deputies have already left the department, and others 
preparing to follow their example. Some have advertised to stop all purchases on the public account, for 
want of money to fulfil the contracts ; others will be 
reduced by necessity to do the like. Transportation 
cannot be kept up for want of money to pay those 
employed in that service ; and even those teams, 
which serve with the brigades, begin to refuse further service, unless they are paid for the past. 

Thus we seem to be threatened with distress and 
ruin on every side. I shall continue to give every 
aid to the business in my power, but it must sink 
under its own weight, unless it is better supported 
than it has been for months past. I am, with great 
respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

NATHANAEL GREENE. 



FROM PHILIP SCHUYLER. 

Philadelphia, 6 March, 1780. 

SIR, 

In the letter, which I had the honor to address 
your Excellency on the 15th ultimo, from Saratoga, 
I proposed personally to have explained myself to 
Congress on the subject of the appointment of the 
21st of January last. But reflecting that, notwithstanding the entire confidence I entertain in the honor 
and candor of every individual member of Congress, 
it is nevertheless possible, that, through want of per 
spicuity in expressing myself, or misapprehension in 
others, what I may verbally deliver on the subject 
may be unintentionally construed, or repeated, in a 
manner widely different from my intentions, this 
consideration induces me to convey my determination 
in writing. 
Every reflection. Sir, I have made, since the re 
ceipt of your Excellency s letter of the 24th January 
last, on the appointment mentioned in it, has con 
firmed the conclusion I very early drew, that I could 
not, consistently with my honor and reputation, ac 
cept of any employment under Congress, in a station 
either less honorable or less important than that which 
I once had the honor to hold; and, when the circum 
stances which led to my quitting the army shall re 
cur to Congress, I trust they will acquiesce in the 
propriety of this determination on my part. 

I do not mean, Sir, to convey the most distant 
idea, that I solicit a restoration to the rank and 
place I held in the army ; for, although it is true 
that I quitted it with reluctance, and that I have 
often since lamented that I was drove to the neces 
sity of doing it, yet the delicacy I entertain with re 
spect to the feelings of others, who might possibly 
conceive themselves injured by a perfect restoration 
of my rank, added to other considerations, have in 
duced me to lay aside every wish for a roapp oint 
ment. But, Sir, as I am incapable of withholding 
any services my country may deem me capable of 
rendering ; as a reform in the civil departments of the 
army is of the highest necessity, and as Congress 
have thought proper to apply to me for my aid on 
the occasion, permit me to tender them an offer of 
my services, as a member of their House, on a Com 
mittee to consult with the Commander-in-chief, and 
the Heads of the several civil departments of the 
army, and to adopt such measures as will have a 
probable tendency to complete the great object of the 
resolutions of the 21st January. As a member of 
such a Committee, I should esteem it my duty to 
visit every part of the Continent, for the purpose of 
introducing good order and a proper economy, and 
should deem myself fully rewarded for every possible 
exertion, in the success of the business, and in the 
approbation of Congress. I am, &c. 

PHILIP SCHUYLER. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL ARNOLD. 

Philadelphia, 6 March, 1780. 

DEAR SIR, 

I am requested, by the Board of Admiralty, to in 
form your Excellency that they have in contempla 
tion an expedition with several of their frigates, which 
will require three or four hundred land forces to act 
in conjunction, and who may act as marines when on 
board, which will obviate the great difficulty of pro 
curing men for the ships. They wish to be informed 
if the men can be spared from the army. They will 
be wanted to embark (probably at New London) by 
the middle of April, for an expedition of about two 
months. If seamen can be drafted, they will be much 
preferable to other troops. 

From the injury I have received in my leg, and 
the great stiffness in my ankle, my surgeons are of 
opinion it will not be prudent for me to take a command in the army for some time to come. As I 
wish to render my country every service in my 
power, I have offered the Board to take the command 
of the expedition, provided it is agreeable to yourExcellency, and the men can be spared from the army; in which case, I shall soon have the honor of 
laying the plan before your Excellency, and believe 
you will think it an object of importance. 

I have just received a letter from Major ClarkVOL. ii. 35 
son, dated Charleston, January 30th, who writes me, 
that " the fleet which sailed from New York in De 
cember, are certainly arrived and arriving at Savan 
nah ; their force uncertain, but very large." Two 
of our frigates have captured a brigantine, with clothing, and two sloops, with dragoons of Lord Cathcart s 
legion, who have saved only two horses of forty-five. 
The fleet were dispersed in a few days after they 
sailed, and greatly injured by several storms. 

I suppose your Excellency will receive particularinformation from Congress. I have the honor to be, 
with great respect and esteem, your Excellency s 
Affectionate and obedient humble servant, 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 



March 20t/i. Dear Sir, The foregoing is a copy 
of a letter I did myself the honor of writing yourExcellency, which went by express the day it was 
wrote, from Colonel Mitchei s office. As a fortnight 
has elapsed, and I have not been favored with an 
answer, I conclude the letter has miscarried ; I there 
fore take the liberty of sending a copy. If the 
service will not admit of a draft of men from the 
army, the expedition must, of course, be declined, as 
there is not the least probability of manning the 
ships without; in which case, I must request of yourExcellency a leave of absence for the ensuing sum 
mer, or until my wounds are so well as to admit 
my riding and walking with some degree of ease, 
and, of course, being able to take the command of a 
division in the army. 

Your Excellency will believe I should not ask this 
indulgence, could I, with justice to myself or country, take a command in the condition I am at present. My surgeons flatter me that a voyage to sea, 
and bathing frequently in salt water, will be of great 
service in strengthening my leg, and relaxing the 
muscles, which are greatly contracted, and thereby 
rendering it more useful. 

Mrs. Arnold yesterday presented me with a son. 
She joins me in best respects to Mrs. Washington. I 
have the honor to be, very sincerely and affectionate 
ly, your Excellency s 

Most obedient and very humble servant, 

BENEDICT ARNOLD.* 



FROM PHILIP SCHUYLER. 

Philadelphia, 7 March, 1780. 

DEAR SIR, 

I arrived on Sunday, but did not take my seat in 
Congress until this morning, as I deemed it prudent 
previously to address them on the subject of their 
appointment of the 21st January, which I did by 
letter ; a copy whereof I have the honor to inclose 
for your Excellency s perusal. I believe there is a 
determination not to accept of any services I may be 
able to render them, in the line in which I have of 
fered them. Many here affect not to see the pro 
priety of the distinction I have drawn ; but I shall 
be satisfied if the candid and ingenuous, who are not 
always a majority, in or out of doors, shall discover 
that it is not one without a difference. 



* In a letter to Silas Deane, dated March 22d, General Arnold 
wrote; "I have proposed to the Board of Admiralty an expedition, 
which will require three or four hundred land forces, to act in conjunc 
tion with the ships. The matter rests with General Washington. If 
men can be spared, and my plan takes place, you will hear from me 
soon. If it should not, I propose going to Boston, with the intention to 
take the command of a private ship." 
The measure I proposed to General Greene, the 
moment before I parted with him, I learnt, on my 
arrival, had already been decided upon as unneces 
sary, and I was confidentially advised that it would 
be in vain to urge it. I must, therefore, forbear, 
however strongly impressed with its importance. 

I do not advise you of the intelligence from Caro 
lina, as General Lincoln will probably be more full 
on the subject than I can be. The Minister has a 
letter from an agent, in which he informs the former, 
that part of the British were destined pour Ics An 
tilles. 

I believe it will be necessary for General Greeneto address Congress very pointedly on the subject of 
the wagoners, as I find a disposition in many to 
have them drawn from the army. The reasons why 
they should not, if even the army would after all be 
sufficiently in force, will be obvious to him, and I 
wish him to adduce them fully, to corroborate what 
I shall deliver on the subject before his letter arrives. 

Our finances are completely deranged. A Committee 
of the Whole have had them under consideration, for 
some time before my arrival. They have been on 
the business to-day, without making any progress. It 
seems a paradox, that the whole should be more in 
competent than a part; but I am so perfectly per 
suaded of it, that I shall strive to get it referred to 
a few. I have thrown together my ideas on the sub 
ject. How they will be accepted I must leave to 
time; though I believe some good would result, if 
they were adopted. 

Be so good as to entreat your lady to accept of 
my best respects ; and to believe that I am most sin 
cerely, with those sentiments of affection and esteem, 
which afford an ingenuous mind the most sensible of 
all satisfactions, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

PHILIP SCHUYLER. 



FROM LIEUTENANT-COLONEL JOHN LAURENS. 

Charleston, 14 March, 1780. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

The enemy s present disposition of his force, and 
all his late operations, indicate a design to attack 
Charleston by a siege in form. To complete the in 
vestiture, he must introduce his ships of war into the 
harbour. That it is his intention, appears from his 
fixing buoys on the bar, barricading his ships waists, 
and anchoring them in a station where they may 
embrace the first favorable spring tides to enter. 
His transports and store-ships have removed from 
Edisto up Stono River, where they lie contiguous to 
Wappoo Cut, which is the water communication from 
thence to Ashley River. At a point of the main 
land, formed by the issuing of the former into the 
latter, he raised, in the course of a night, the llth 
instant, a battery of six embrasures. This situation, 
naturally advantageous, he will probably render very 
strong, and establish in it his deposit of military 
stores and provisions. He then may either force a 
passage over Ashley River, or turn it by a circuitous 
march, fortify a camp on the Neck, and open his 
trenches. The best communication between his maga 
zines and camp will be across Ashley River, from a 
bluff, marked Bull, in your large map. 

Your Excellency will have learnt that the Commo 
dore and all his officers renounce the idea of defend35*ing the passage of the bar ; they declare it impracti 
cable for the frigates to lie in a proper position for 
that purpose. The Government has neglected to pro 
vide floating batteries, which might have been sta 
tioned there j so that it has been agreed, as the next 
best plan, to form a line of battle, in such a manner 
as to make a cross-fire with Fort Moultrie ; a shoal, 
called the Middle Grounds, being on the right of the 
ships, and the fort advanced of the left. As it would 
be the enemy s policy, with a leading wind and tide, 
to pass the fire of the fort, and run aboard of ourships, the Commodore is contriving an obstruction, 
which he thinks will check their progress, and allow 
time for the full effect of our fire. 

The impracticability of defending the bar, in the 
first instance, appears to me a great diminution of 
our means of defence. We must not only have a 
greater number of shipping below, and consequently 
withdraw them from flanking the enemy s approaches 
on the Neck, but are subject to the chances of a 
combat, which, in the other case, were out of the 
question. The Commodore has destroyed one set of 
the enemy s buoys 5 and I hope he will cut away 
such as may have been since put down, and order 
the galleys to give all possible annoyance to the 
enemy s ships in the act of entering. 

The attention of the Engineers has been distracted 
by different demonstrations on the part of the enemy, and they have not perfected the line across 
Charleston Neck. Henceforward I hope they will 
confine themselves solely to completing it, and then 
proceed to the construction of some interior inclosed 
works, to prolong the defence. 

As the enemy is determined to proceed by regularapproaches, all his operations are submitted to calculation, and he can determine, with mathematical precision, that with such and such means, in a given 
time, he will accomplish his end. Our safety, then, 
must depend upon the seasonable arrival of such reenforcements as will oblige him to raise the siege. 
The Virginia line is much more remote than we 
could have thought it would have been, at this mo 
ment. Your Excellency, in person, might rescue us 
all. Virginia and North Carolina would follow you. 
The glory of foiling the enemy in his last great ef 
fort, and terminating the war, ought to be reserved 
for you. Whatever fortune attends us, I shall, to my 
latest moments, feel that veneration and attachment, 
which I always had for your Excellency; and I beg 
leave to continue to subscribe myself, 

Your faithful Aid, 

JOHN LAURENS. 

P. S. I entreat your Excellency s pardon for transmitting the annexed letter, in its present imperfect 
state. It was a sketch, which I intended to have 
put in better form, if time had permitted. 



FROM COLONEL ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 

Amboy, 17 March, 1780. 

DEAR SIR, 

I duly received your letter of the 14th, and shall 
not fail, in conjunction with General St. Clair, to 
attend to the military object of it.* I am much oblig
* General St. Clair, Colonel Carrington, and Colonel Hamilton had 
proceeded to Amboy on the 9th instant, to meet British Commission 
ers, for the purpose of settling a general cartel for the exchange of 
prisoners. Washington s Writings, Vol. VI. p. 483.ed to your Excellency for the communication of yoursouthern advices. The enemy are still in the dark 
about their fleet and army gone that way, as we 
gather from the Commissioners. They pretend to 
have little European news, though a vessel arrived 
two or three days since from England, after ten 
weeks passage. We send you some late New York 
papers. The Commission has been several days at an 
end. The enemy, as was supposed, had no idea of 
treating on national ground. We are now in private 
conversation, and so far not without hopes that the 
liberation of our prisoners will be effected on admissi 
ble terms. Two or three days more will probably put 
an end to the interview. General St. Clair and Colo 
nel Carrington beg their respects may be presented 
to your Excellency. I have the honor to be, very 
respectfully and affectionately, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 



FROM COLONEL BRODHEAD. 

Fort Pitt, 18 March, 1780. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

The savages have already begun their hostilities. 
Last Sunday, they killed five men at a sugar camp 
upon Raccoon Creek, in Youghiogany county, and 
took prisoners three girls and three lads. It is generally conjectured that the Delawares perpetrated this 
murder ; but it is possible it may have been done by 
other Indians. If the Delaware nation should declare 
against us, this frontier will be greatly distressed ; 
as many other nations, who have hitherto been neu 
tral, will join them, and my force is by no means 
sufficient to protect the settlements. I have inclosed 
to the Adjutant-General a return of the troops for 
the month of February, since which near to fifty men 
have been discharged from the ninth Virginia regi 
ment, and many more will expect their discharges 
very soon. 

I have lately been favored with a letter from Co 
lonel Clark, declaring his readiness to cooperate with 
me in any measure I shall undertake, either for the 
reduction of one of the enemy s posts, or against the 
Indian towns. He is now at the Illinois, and will be 
considerably reenforced in the course of this spring. 
He proposes throwing up some works at the mouth 
of the Ohio River. If your Excellency can possibly 
spare a small reenforcement of well-appointed regulartroops for this district, I will pledge my honor to be 
as active as circumstances and situation will admit. 

I am exceedingly anxious to receive a line from 
you; and have the honor to be, with the most per 
fect regard and esteem, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

DANIEL BRODHEAD. 



FROM BENJAMIN FRANKLIN. 

Passy, 19 March, 1780. 

SIR, 

I beg leave to introduce to your Excellency s ac 
quaintance and civilities, Monsieur le Chevalier De 
Chastellux, Major-General in the French troops, now 
about to embark for America, whom I have long 
known, and esteemed highly in his several characters 
of a soldier, a gentleman, and a man of letters. His 
excellent book, on Public Happiness, shows him the 
friend to mankind, and, as such, entitles him, whereever he goes, to their respect and good offices. He 
is particularly a friend to our cause, and I am sure 
your Excellency will have great pleasure in his con 
versation. I have the honor to be, with great re 
spect, your Excellency s 

Most obedient and most humble servant, 

BENJAMIN FRANKLIN. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LINCOLN. 

Charleston, 24 March, 1780. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

Since my last, the enemy have, very unexpectedly, 
brought over the ships mentioned in the inclosed 
paper. It has been thought there was not water 
enough for a sixty-four gun ship. Before they came 
into the harbour, it was determined to form a lineof battle across the channel, with our ships, to act in 
conjunction with Fort Moultrie ; but afterwards, as the 
enemy were so vastly superior to our force, it was 
thought best to remove our ships up to the town in 
Cooper River, and land their heavy cannon and men. 
We are endeavouring to obstruct the channel from the 

o 

town to Shute s Folly. If we should succeed, great 
good will result from the measure, as thereby we 
shall prevent the enemy from running up that river, 
and cutting off our communication with the country 
on the east. 

The enemy are extending their works on Ashley 
River, from the mouth of Wappoo, with a design to 
cover their stores, which they can land near the first 
work, at the mouth of the creek, and remove them a 
mile or two across land to the head of another creek, 
which empties into the Ashley, where they have a 
work also, which is opposite a good landing on this 
side. I think they will throw their troops across 
above, take post at this landing, and then transport 
their stores, which will save them a very long land 
carriage. 

I lament, most sincerely, that, from the want of a 
sufficient power, we cannot oppose their passing this 
river, which might easily be effected, and oblige the 
enemy to take a circuit of forty miles. General 
Woodford is not yet arrived. By his letter of the 
6th instant, he informs me that his troops would 
leave Petersburg the day after. His numbers, by 
some means or other, are greatly reduced. By his 
return, he has only seven hundred and thirty-seven 
fit for action. 

General Scott informs me that he is coming on 
without the remainder of his troops. Want of clothing 
is the cause. A few of them have been persuaded to 
take care of General Woodford s baggage. Many of 
the North Carolina militia, whose times have expired, 
leave us to-day. They cannot be persuaded to re 
main longer, though the enemy are in our neighbourhood. 

General Mclntosh received, a few days since, a re 
solve of Congress, founded on a letter from the Go 
vernor of Georgia, and one from the Speaker of the 
Assembly of that State, purporting that he had lost 
the confidence of the people; in which resolve he is 
suspended from acting in the Southern department. 
I have not only to lament the loss of so good an officer, but that Congress have so suddenly come into 
a resolution, which must wound the feelings of an 
old servant of the United States, and who, by the 
war, is reduced from a state of great affluence to 
that but a little removed from beggary. He has the 
command of the country militia of this State, now in 
garrison. I have the honor to be, my dear General, 
with the highest esteem, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL BARON STEUBEN. 

Philadelphia, 28 March, 1780. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

The propositions I made to Congress, respecting 
the formation of the army, of which I had the honor 
of transmitting your Excellency a copy, remain yet 
on their table, without any decision thereon. They 
have, however, set aside the report of the Board of 
War on a motion for reducing the battalions, as you 
will perceive by the resolve annexed, so that all re 
duction or incorporation is now out of the question ; 
and for next campaign the regiments in the line will 
be augmented more or less by the respective States. 
What is to be done with the additional regiments 
and the cavalry, Congress cannot or will not decide; 
though I am rather led to believe their delay in this 
matter proceeds from the grand cause of all our mis 
fortunes, the bad state of our finances, which will 
not allow the recruiting of men, or purchasing of 
horses. 

I observed to you, my dear General, in my last, 
that every wheel of the machine seemed stopped. 
Of the truth of this observation I become more and 
more convinced, and must confess, that to me oursituation appears very critical. The late resolves re 
specting the money, though attended with all the 
success that can be wished, cannot make any imme 
diate alteration for the better. Some months must 
elapse before their good effects will be felt; and, during this time, we are disabled from doing any thing, 
whilst, at this very moment, the greatest exertions 
are necessary. 

My anxiety for our Southern affairs, I cannot help 
saying, is considerably increased by the last accounts, 
which seem to announce a determination of General 
Lincoln to defend Charleston with all his force; this, 
to me, appears to be playing a hardy game. , 

Another danger which threatens us, and which is 
much to be dreaded, is the declared division be 
tween Virginia and Pennsylvania; the latter State 
having actually passed a law for the raising fifteen 
hundred men to defend their pretended rights. All 
these things offer but a dull prospect, rendered still 
more dull by the cabals and factions which reign 
among us. The civil departments of the army, at a 
time when their whole attention should be taken up 
in providing for the approaching campaign, are in 
such a state of dissatisfaction and confusion, that I 
am very apprehensive they will make things still 
worse than they are. 

You will perhaps think, my dear General, that I 
am in anxiety for things which are out of my sphere ; 
but when you consider that all my happiness depends 
on our success, you will not blame me for,, the interest I take , in the cause. The same motives make 
me apprehensive that the necessary arrangements will 
never be firmly established without your personal 
assistance ; and I submit to you, my dear General, 
whether your presence is not absolutely necessary at 
Congress, in the present critical situation of our affairs. Your right to the confidence, both of Congress 
VOL. ii. 36 
and the people, is too well founded not to command 
the greatest attention to every thing you propose. 
The time is precious, and the prospect before us 
threatening. Your presence will animate our counsels, as it does our armies. My attachment to the 
cause, and the respectful confidence I have in yourperson, induces me to express, in the strongest terms, 
the desire I have to see you here. I have the honor 
to be, your Excellency s 

Most obedient and very humble servant, 

STEUBEN. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Philadelphia, 31 March, 1780. 

SIR, 

Your Excellency s public and private letters, of the 
26th, were handed me day before yesterday, and I 
wish it had been in my power to have given them 
an earlier answer; but the difficulty of satisfying 
myself, in all the matters contained in your letter, 
has prevented it. 

Many people are apprehensive for the fall of Charles 
ton ; and I think it in jeopardy, as w r ell as the troops 
under Lincoln s command. I am more anxious for the 
fate of the troops than the city. Should they both 
fall together, in this critical stage of our finance, it is 
difficult to determine what will be the consequences. 
Most people seem to agree, that a further detach 
ment of troops from this army cannot add any safety 
to the city, as its fall must be decided long before 
the troops can get up. Governor Reed, Generals 
Schuyler, Scott, and Wayne, are all of this opinion, 
as well as Mr. Sherman, and the Massachusetts Delegates; and this is clearly my opinion. But Colonel 
Gray son, and, I believe, the Board of War in general, 
are of opinion that a detachment ought to be sent 
on immediately, as they are apprehensive the city will 
fall, and the enemy push on to the northward. 
Should this happen, a proper force can be detached 
seasonably hereafter, as it cannot make but a few 
days difference whether they march now, or when 
the fall of the city shall be decided. If the enemy 
are defeated, the detachment ought not to go; and 
if they are not, it is already too late to give timely 
succour to the place. 

The business of finance is yet a matter of mere 
speculation. Nothing can be determined upon it from 
the present appearances. Most people are silent 
upon the subject; and this I interpret into a favora 
ble symptom. I find the measure passed in Congress 
but by a majority of one, and the members are more 
split and divided about the matter now, than any 
other order of men; indeed, some of them reprobate 
the measure. I perfectly agree with your Excellency 
in sentiment, that it is the duty of every well-wisher 
to the cause to give all the support in his power to 
the plan, now it is taken. For the measure will en 
tail just as much disgrace upon us if it does not pro 
ceed, as if if does ; and, if the plan fails, I am at a 
loss to conceive how we are to support the war. 
Public and private credit is almost at an end. 

Nothing is done in the Quarter-master s depart 
ment. The new system I mentioned in my last, is 
yet undecided on. The more I view it, the less I 
like it, and the stronger my conviction is, that it is 
calculated not less to embarrass your Excellency than 
to disgrace and injure me. Mifflin and Pickering are 
gone to Reading; and Mifflin has got the Massachusetts Delegates into his house, in town, upon 
very moderate terms, and, it is said, with a view of 
strengthening himself in that quarter. Depend upon 
it, he has a scheme, in concert with others. 

Public business is in a wretched train. All things 
at a stand ; and I don t believe the great depart 
ments of the army will be organized for a month to 
come, unless the new system is adopted, which will 
starve and disband the army in half the time. 

Generals Schuyler and Scott think it a most pal 
try thing. What I had in contemplation as a sys 
tem, I am persuaded is the only plan which will 
yield proper support to the army, and cooperate with 
your Excellency s military manoeuvres. An army is 
viewed in Congress as a city, which may be supported and provided for, without regarding the emergen 
cies of service. That body seem to be insensible of 
the great difference there is, in their public estima 
tion, betwixt now and four years ago, not only among 
individuals, but with the States in general; and, in 
stead of strengthening their influence by a just and 
generous conduct to individuals, they add insult to 
injury. A political body, that acts upon such barba 
rous maxims of policy, cannot fail to bring ruin and 
distress upon the people, as no honest man, that has 
a regard for his reputation, would feel himself in the 
power of such people. Conscious of my own integri 
ty, as well as faithful attention to the business committed to my trust, I cannot help feeling an honest 
indignation at the little arts made use of to lessen 
my merit and create suspicions to my prejudice. As 
I was placed in the office I now hold by your Ex 
cellency s particular request, and as you are the only 
person who can do me ample justice, I flatter myself 
I may safely rest my reputation with you, to place 
me in that point of light which justice and equity 
demand. 

It is the wish of many here, that your Excellency 
should come to town; and, I am persuaded, you 
would have it in your power to settle and arrange 
many matters, which, for want of being done, every 
thing is in a train the most ruinous and distressing 
imaginable. All our public horses in this State are 
starving. Hundreds have been drove into this city 
from the country, because the people refuse to keep 
them any longer. From the distressed situation the 
Forage department is in, I am afraid the most of ourhorses, if not all, will be altogether unfit for opening the campaign. After this day, we shall not have 
an ounce of forage in this city. This, I must con 
fess, would not grieve me much, were we well pro 
vided elsewhere ; but, alas ! we are in just the same 
wretched situation in every quarter. People may 
sometimes be convinced by feeling, when they cannot 
by reasoning. 

I am very apprehensive we shall lose a great part 
of the articles we have manufacturing, as the people 
will not deliver them without payment. What grieves 
me most, is the loss of several hundred fine new 
wagons, which were in great forwardness, and on 
which we depended for the opening campaign. 

There is no arrival, or foreign news. We learn 
here, by the way of New York, that Clinton was to 
attack Charleston on the 15th of this month. 

I thank your Excellency for the information re 
specting Mrs. Greene, and desire my compliments to 
Mrs. Washington. With great respect, I am, 
Your Excellency s obedient servant, 

NATHANAEL GREENE. 
36* 
FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Philadelphia, 2 April, 1780. 



I am sorry it has not been in my power to give 
your Excellency an earlier answer to your letter of 
the 26th ultimo. The subject is a matter of such 
moment, that, although it required despatch, yet the 
delay must be less injurious than a want of fall 
information to decide with certainty. 

It is not less mortifying to me, than unhappy for 
the public interest and national security, that circum 
stances oblige me to confess myself unable, for want 
of sufficient support, either to make the proper provi 
sion in my department, necessary for marching the 
troops to the southward, or for putting the army in 
motion in these Northern States. There would be no 
difficulty, either in the one case or the other, could 
the treasury furnish the proper supplies of cash. But 
in its present exhausted state, with the enormous demands upon the department, the agents have neither 
credit nor influence equal to the business. 

Orders were seasonably issued for an ample provi 
sion for the opening campaign. Many are in part 
executed, and might be easily completed, were the 
agents enabled to fulfil their contracts. But the 
manufacturers, for want of payment, will neither go 
on with the business, nor deliver what they have completed. And though the loss of these articles will 
be a capital injury to the public, as well in point of 
saving in expense as that of accommodating the 
army, yet there is not the remotest prospect of ob 
taining cash, seasonably, to prevent the misfortune. 

I have given general and particular orders to the 
agents, to collect from the manufacturers as many of 
the articles contracted for as possible, and to hold 
them in readiness for further orders. But the people 
have suffered so much by the depreciation of the 
money, that they will not part with their property 
without immediate payment. In this predicament are 
the stores manufacturing for public use ; what part 
we shall be able to obtain, is difficult to determine. 

The public horses, which are quartered about in 
different parts of the country, are suffering for want 
of forage ; and I am afraid many will perish, before 
the States, under the new requisition, will provideamply for their support. But, could the whole be 
made fit for service at the opening of the campaign, 
which will by no means be the case, the number 
would be very insufficient to answer the demands of 
the army. I am, with great respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

NATHANAEL GREENE. 



FROM PHILIP SCHUYLER. 

Philadelphia, 5 April, 1780. 

MY DEAR SIR, 

On the 3d instant I was favored with your Excel 
lency s letter of the 30th ultimo. I have, for ten 
days successively, deferred writing, in hopes that I 
should have been able, at last, to have advised you 
that public business was closely attended to in this 
quarter, and that we had adopted measures to disen 
cumber us from that variety of embarrassment we 
experience ; but, alas ! we have made little or no ad 
vances. 

Mifflin, Pickering, Jones, and General Sherman, 
have furnished the first part of a voluminous system 
for the Quarter-master s department. The second part 
is to direct the Commissary-General of Issues in the 
discharge of his duty; and the third will point at 
the regulations for the Hospital. I do not mention 
the Purchasing department, because that is to be abo 
lished ; the States are to do all. As General Sher 
man roundly asserts, that system will strike off fourthousand officers from the civil departments. As it is, 
replete with absurdity, it will pass into a law, unless 
it should be thought proper to confer with the Com 
mander-in-chief on the subject. There has been some 
wicked work, respecting a certain appointment, which 
General Greene will advise you of verbally. 

The gentleman I have last mentioned addressed 
Congress, in a letter of the 3d instant, wishing for 
their sense on his general conduct in the Quarter 
master s department. A resolution was proposed, that 
Congress had full confidence in his integrity and 
ability, and requesting his future exertions. This 
brought on much debate ; amendments were moved, 
and the House got into heats, and an adjournment 
was deemed necessary to give the members time to 
cool. A member, more zealous for the General s re 
putation than prudent, observed, that he was an officer in whom the Commander-in-chief had the highest 
confidence; that he was the first of all the subordi 
nate Generals in point of military knowledge and 
ability ; that, in case of an accident happening to 
General Washington, he would be the properest per 
son to command the army; and that General Washing 
ton thought so too. Another observed, that he had a 
very high opinion of General Greene s military abili 
ties ; that he believed the General had too ; but that 
he believed no person on earth was authorized to say 
as much as the words, above scored, implied. I mention this, that your Excellency may guard against 
any misapprehensions which this may occasion with 
your officers. General Greene will inform you who 
delivered the imprudent speech. 

Yesterday your letter of the 2d was read. There 
appeared a disposition in many to leave the whole 
business, which was the subject of it, to your discre 
tion. Great part of the morning was spent on the 
subject before the resolution took place, which will 
be transmitted by the President. 

Some days since, I moved for a Committee to prepare a letter to the States, to call on them for exer 
tions more competent to the great object we have in 
view. After some altercation, a Committee was appointed. Ellsworth, Muhlenberg, and Schuyler composed it. They prepared the letter, and reported but 
some gentlemen were averse at the decisive plainness 
with which we intended Congress should address the 
States ; whilst others contended that we should speak 
still more pointedly. After a whole day s debate, the 
letter was recommitted. 

I have entreated General Greene to remain a day 
or two longer in town, that I may be able to advise 
with him on the measures necessary to be pursued 
to prevent the ill consequences of his being driven 
to the necessity of a resignation, which, I conceive, 
would at any time be an event to be much lamented, but, in the present conjuncture, ruinous. 

Pray entreat Mrs. Washington to accept of my re 
spects, and the gentlemen of the family those wishes 
which my esteem for them induces. I am, dear Sir, 
with perfect esteem, and the sincerest affection, 
Your Excellency s obedient servant, 

PHILIP SCHUYLER. 
FROM JAMES BOWDOIN. 

Boston, G April, 1780. 

Sm ? 

A new Constitution of Government being generally 
apprehended necessary for this State, a majority of 
the towns, on recommendation of the Assembly, some 
months ago appointed Delegates for the purpose of 
forming one ; and they have lately, in Convention, 
agreed upon one, which is to be laid before the 
people at large for their consideration. They ordered 
a number of copies to be printed, two or three of 
which being at my disposal, I have the honor of in 
closing one of them to your Excellency. If it should 
afford you any amusement, I shall be much gratified. 

By a letter, in January, from our peace Ambassa 
dor, Mr. Adams, so far as he then had the means of 
judging, he did not expect to have any thing to do 
in the business of his department, at least for this 
year ; so that another campaign seems unavoidable. 
I wish it may be productive of such happy events 
as to insure a lasting- peace, established on American 
principles. I have the honor to be, with the most 
perfect esteem, Sir, your Excellency s 

Most obedient, humble servant, 

JAMES BOWDOIN. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL WOODFORD. 

Charleston. 8 April, 1780. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

After a forced march of five hundred and five 
miles, which we performed in thirty days, I had 
the pleasure of throwing my troops into town in 
good health and spirits, by the only passage now 
left open. We arrived on the 7th, at two o clock, to 
the great joy of the garrison. Our embarkation was 
made on the east side of Cooper River, distant from 
town nine miles. 

So far as my indisposition would enable me to 
make myself acquainted with the situation of mat 
ters, they stand nearly thus. 

Their ships, to the number of nine, passed Fort 
Moultrie yesterday afternoon, at five o clock. The 
fire from both sides was warm, but, the wind being 
fair and blowing very fresh, they passed with much 
more ease than I expected, and I fear with less 
damage. All that we can discover is, one of the 
frigates lost her foremast ; a ship ran aground in 
her passage up, but got off with the evening s flood, 
and, in attempting to come up in the night, was set 
on fire and blew up, whether from the fire of the 
fort, or by what other means, or of what force she 
was, we are not informed, having heard nothing from 
Fort Moultrie since the ships have taken their sta 
tion before the town, at two and a half miles distance. If they can get past the obstructions in the 
mouth of Cooper River, they will enfilade our works, 
and the consequences will be fatal, besides entirely 
cutting off all communication with the country. Ourbatteries are strong, and the artillery numerous ; but 
it appears to me they will not be so well manned as 
I could wish. Some part of the lines are rather low, 
and I think the men off duty will be much exposed 
when their batteries open. 

Their army crossed the Ashley the 29th of March, 
and the first of this month they broke ground in ourfront. Their nearest work is upon our right, at six 
hundred yards distance from ours, and they fall off 
from eight and nine, to eleven hundred yards on ourleft. They have done a good deal of work ; their 
battery upon the Cooper is in the greatest forward 
ness. It does not appear they can open for several 
days, unless they do it partially, which, I suppose, 
will not be the case. They have been employed, for 
several days and nights, in opening lines of communication between their batteries, which appear in 
great forwardness. Exclusive of these, they have a 
battery upon our left flank at Wappoo Cut, and 
some galleys, brought in by the passage of Stono 
River. These are mounted with thirty-two and twen 
ty-four pounders; but the distance is at least onemile and a quarter from our left, too far to do any 
considerable execution. 

The garrison appears in high spirits, and our arrival seemed to give them fresh confidence. My want 
of experience, in the defence or attack of a place, 
will not enable me to give your Excellency my 
opinion upon the w r hole of our situation, with any 
degree of precision. 

On our arrival he-re, the officers of the Virginia 
line, that came out last year, have applied to General Lincoln for a new arrangement of the regiments. 
I cannot, at present, inform your Excellency what will 
be done in it; but I shall oppose any alteration at 
this critical juncture, upon the principle of its doing 
mischief. And, as it w r as done by authority of the 
Board of War for this expedition, and I have been 
at much pains and infinite fatigue to get them pro 
perly organized for service, an alteration at this time 
will occasion much confusion, and make the troops 
of the line much less serviceable in the siege than 
they would be to remain as they are till it is ended, 
at least, or till your Excellency s pleasure, or that of 
the Board of War, is known. 
General Scott is here ; Colonel Buford s battalion 
on its march, but where I cannot inform you ; nor 
can I say any thing, with certainty, about the State 
troops on their march, under command of LieutenantColonel Porterfield. I shall think it my duty to take 
every opportunity of writing your Excellency from 
this place; and have to request, that you will be 
pleased to give my respectful compliments to all the 
General Officers, and the gentlemen of your family, 
and to be assured that I am, with the greatest re 
spect and affection, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

WILLIAM WOODFORD. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LINCOLN. 

Charleston, 9 April, 1780. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 

The enemy crossed the Ashley, in force, near the 
ferry, on the 29th ultimo, and the next day moved 
down, and encamped about three thousand .yards from 
our lines. Before this, they had transported their 
heavy baggage, ordnance, and stores, from out of 
Wappoo, across land, about two miles, to Old Town 
Creek, on the west side of the river, opposite their 
encampment. In the morning of the 1st instant, we 
discovered that they had opened ground in several 
places in our front, about eleven hundred yards there 
from. The next night they threw up a work on ourleft, distance nine hundred yards. The next which 
appeared was on Cooper River, six hundred yards 
from our right ; these, and some which they have 
since raised, seem to be closed. They have been some 
nights perfecting their works, and opening lines of 

VOL. ii. 37 
communication. What they have done seems rather 
calculated to cover their approaches, than to annoy 
us from them. 

Seven ships of war passed Fort Moultrie yesterday 
afternoon, and anchored near where Fort Johnson 
stood, with no other apparent injury than the loss 
of one topmast. We have been busily employed in 
throwing obstructions in their passage of the Cooper. 
I wish they may prove effectual, for it is of the highest importance for us to keep that open ; thereby 
we preserve a communication with the country, from 
which we can draw our succours and supplies. In 
order the more effectually to do this, we mean to 
throw up a work on Lempriere s, one at Cainhoy up 
Wando, where we shall have our deposit of stores, 
besides some on the several landings, on the east 
side of Cooper River. These things have been some 
time in contemplation, but the necessary works to 
be made in town have prevented their being exe 
cuted. Indeed, before the Virginia troops, under General Woodford, arrived, which was on the 7th, we could 
not man them; but from the addition of that force, 
and the North Carolina militia, who are coming in, 
we hope to spare some few men for this purpose, 
and that we shall be able to draw down some of the 
militia of this State into these works, who will not 
come to town. One of the enemy s ships, said to be 
a transport, fell to leeward last night (within Fort 
Moultrie), which ship they burned this morning. 

I expect soon the remainder of General Scott s 
troops, and some militia from North Carolina. I have 
the honor to be, my dear General, with the highestesteem and affection, 

Your most obedient servant, 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 



THE AMEEICAN EEVOLUTION. 435 

FROM COLONEL JOHN LAURENS. 

Charleston, 9 April, 1780. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

When I last had the honor of writing to your Ex 
cellency, the enemy had not extended their opera 
tions beyond their place of arms on Wappoo Neck. 
On the 29th ultimo they crossed Ashley River, in 
force, one mile above the ferry. The next day they 
advanced to Gibbes s, a convenient landing, about two 
miles from town, having previously -collected a num 
ber of boats at the opposite shore, for the purpose of 
crossing their heavy artillery and stores. My batta 
lion of light infantry, posted there to prevent a surprise or too sudden approach of the enemy, was 
ordered not to engage seriously, but skirmish with 
advanced parties, retiring slowly and orderly towards 
town, as there was no object in maintaining any ad 
vanced post, and the advantages of a serious affair 
were all on the side of the enemy. 

On the night of the 1st instant, the enemy broke 
ground, and have been working slowly ever since. I 
scarcely know how to denominate what they have 
executed hitherto. It consists of several redoubts, 
with a covered communication from right to left, 
which is still unfinished. Their nearest work is an 
inclosed battery on their left, at about the distance 
of six hundred yards, which induces me to believe, 
that they intend the line in question for a first paral 
lel, although some parts of it are rather too remote. 
Our shells and shot have disquieted them, and inter 
rupted their operations; but General Lincoln, sensible 
of the value of these articles in a siege, economizes 
them as much as possible. Fatigue parties are con 
stantly employed in improving our works. The whole 
front of our lines, within the abatis, is armed with 
wolf-traps. All this affords an excellent defence 
against storm, but must finally yield to a persever 
ance in regular approaches, which appears to be Clin 
ton s present plan, unless we can work under his fire 
as fast as he can, and afford time for the arrival of 
your Excellency. 

Our obstructions in Cooper River are completed ; 
which gives a prospect of our maintaining a communication with the country, and hitherto prevents 
the accomplishment of the investiture. Since the 
arrival of General Woodford, General Lincoln will 
have it in his power to execute his plan of establishing the necessary posts for this purpose, on the east 
ern shore of the river. Colonel Malmedy is to take 
command of the troops destined for that service. 

The enemy s squadron of seven armed ships, threeof which are two-deckers, and two transports, availed 
itself of a brisk southern breeze to pass Fort Moultrie yesterday afternoon. The Admiral s ship led the 
van, and escaped without apparent injury; the fri 
gate which followed her. had her foretopmast carried 
away ; a large transport, in the rear of the whole, 
ran aground, and, after receiving some shot from Sul 
livan s Island, was fired and abandoned by her crew. 
The remainder are now anchored near the ruins of 
Fort Johnson, out of the reach of our cannon. 

My notice of the present opportunity was so sud 
den, that I have not been able to make atonement 
for my last hurried letter. Helving upon your Ex 
cellency s goodness, I have preferred writing, at any 
rate, to total silence, and losing an occasion of re 
peating the assurances of attachment and veneration, 
with which I have the honor to be, 

Your Excellency s faithful Aid, 

JOHN LAURENS. 
P. S. I beg to be respectfully presented to Mrs. 
Washington. The reason above mentioned makes me 
trouble your Excellency to present my love to the 
family, as I shall not be able to write to any of 
them. 



FROM COLONEL BRODHEAD. 

Fort Pitt, 24 April, 1780. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I am honored with your favor of the 4th of Janu 
ary, and the 14th of March. That of the 4th of 
January I did not receive until the 18th instant. 
Returns of the troops under my command have been 
duly forwarded to the orderly office, agreeably to 
general orders, except one or two months in the win 
ter, when the mountain was impassable. As no reenforcement can be had from your Excellency, the 
intended expedition against Detroit must be laid 
aside until a favorable turn of affairs takes place, unless you would recommend a junction of Colonel 
Clark s troops with mine. 

I have called upon the different counties, on this 
side the mountain, for eight hundred and twenty-five 
rank and file, to be drafted from the militia, and in 
tend to visit the Shawanese, provided the men are 
furnished. But the unhappy dispute of jurisdiction 
will, I fear, prevent my getting them ; and, as many 
renegadoes from the different Indian nations are col 
lected at the Shawanese towns, I do not incline to 
make an attempt with an inconsiderable number of 
men, because a defeat would be attended with fatal 
consequences to the settlement. 

I am honored with a line from the Honorable 
Board of War, informing me that an officer of Colonel 
37* 



438 LETTERS TO AVASIIINGTON. 

Proctor s regiment; with some stores and cannon, was 
in readiness to be sent up as soon as the roads 
would permit^ and the means of transportation can be 
procured. 

Mr. Arthur Gordon has deserted from his arrest,, 
and will probably avoid a new trial. 

With a view of saving land-carriage expenses, when 
water-carriage was practicable, I suffered only a few 
of the boats to be used ; and greater care could 
scarcely have been taken, than what I took, to prevent their being lost or spoiled; but it was out of 
my power to watch every person. 1 have, however, 
the pleasure to assure you, that not more than seven 
are past Fort Henry, which, as I have given orders 
to some of Colonel Clark s officers, will, I trust, be 
saved and sent back to this post. 

I Avas much inclined, last fall, to do myself the 
honor of waiting upon your Excellency, with a view 
of proposing some things which, at that time, I ex 
pected would have promoted the service in this district in the course of this campaign; but I do not 
recollect that I expressed my desire to visit my 
family. I am much obliged to your Excellency for 
the indulgence; but, as Colonel Gibson is absent on a 
visit to his family, at Carlisle, and the Indians are 
remarkably hostile, I must remain, until I see whe 
ther it will be in my power to prosecute an expedi 
tion against the hostile Indians, or not, and until I 
have the honor of hearing from you again. 

O t/ &lt;T5 

The Lieutenants of Monongalia county, and Ohio, 
write, that they arc happy to hear of the intended 
expedition against some of the hostile Indians, and 
that they will exert themselves to furnish the men 
required; but they conceive that it will be difficult to 
effect it, on account of the disputed territory. 
I take the liberty to inclose the copy of a letter, 
lately received from the Delaware Council at Coochocking, number One ; likewise a copy of the Reve 
rend Mr. Ileckewelder s letter, number Two ; and an 
extract from the Reverend Mr. Heckewelder s letter, 
number Three and I will likewise inclose the return 
of the troops, as nearly as possible, to your wish ; 
but as Colonel Gibson s regiment, my own, and the 
independent corps, were chiefly raised within the disputed territory, it will be impossible to determine in 
which State they were raised, until the line is run. 

Fearing a scarcity of salt provisions for the out 
posts, and the better to enable me to subsist a num 
ber of the militia upon the proposed expedition, I 
have been obliged to reduce the ration of meat onequarter, but I have allowed some Indian meal in lieu 
thereof. Since the 1st of March, the Indians have 
killed and taken forty-three men, women, and child 
ren, in the counties of Youghiogany, Monongalia, and 
Ohio, including those killed and taken upon the river ; 
and they have destroyed a number of horses and 
cattle in Tiger Valley. 

The Honorable Board of War mention the expense 
of expresses in such a manner, as must prevent my 
employing any ; but I will do myself the honor to 
communicate to you every material occurrence, by such 
private conveyance as may from time to time offer. 
I have the honor to be, with the most sincere respect 
and esteem, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

DANIEL BRODHEAD. 
FROM GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Pougbkcepsie, 24 April, 1780. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have to acknowledge the receipt of your Excel 
lency s favors of the 26th ultimo and 12th instant. 
Two days before the former came to hand, I received 
the act of Congress respecting the troops proposed to 
be raised for the defence of our frontiers. Some con 
siderable time will necessarily elapse before they can 
be embodied ; and, as the enemy have already appeared at different times and places on the northern and 
western frontiers, I am very apprehensive that, in 
the interim, the more remote settlements will be 
abandoned. Every measure will be used to expedite 
this business, and your Excellency will have the earliest information of the disposition which, in conse 
quence of your letter, I shall cause to be made of 
these levies. 

The act of Congress, of the 26th of last month, re 
specting the quotas of supplies for the army, to be 
furnished by the different States, was not received 
until some days after the rising of the Legislature. 
This, together with some other important matters 
from Congress, has induced me to call them together 
at an earlier day than that to which they stand ad 
journed; and I have accordingly issued my proclama 
tion for convening them at Kingston on the 9th of 
next month, when this business will be submitted 
to their consideration. In the mean time, I think it 
my duty to inform your Excellency, that, in conse 
quence of the several laws which have been enacted 
for obtaining supplies of provision and forage for the 
army, this State is so exhausted, that I am persuaded there is not more grain and meal left in possession of the farmers, than a bare competency for the 
support of its inhabitants until the new crop comes 
in ; and with respect to forage, few of the farmers 
have a sufficiency to bring their stock through until 
grass. Should, therefore, the present supplies, besides 
what are already in the hands of the public officers, 
be wanted before harvest, they are not to be had in 
this State. I should have written to your Excellency 
earlier on this subject, but I did not receive yourletter until a few days ago. I have the honor to be, 
with the highest sentiments of respect and esteem, 
Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

GEORGE CLINTON. 



FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

At the entrance of Boston Harbour, 27 April, 1780. 

Here I am, my dear General, and, in the midst of 
the joy I feel in finding myself again one of yourloving soldiers, I take but the time to tell you that 
I came from France on board a frigate, w r hich the 
King gave me for my passage. I have affairs of the 
utmost importance, which I should at first communicate to you alone. In case my letter finds you any 
where this side of Philadelphia, I beg you will wait 
for me, and do assure you a great public good may 
be derived from it. To-morrow we go up to the 
town, and the day after I shall set off in my usual 
way to join my beloved and respected friend and 
General. 

Adieu, my dear General ; you will easily know the 
hand of your young soldier. My compliments to the 
family.*

(Translation.) 

Philadelphia, 29 April, 1780. 

SIR, 

I have received, with all the gratitude possible, 
the news which your Excellency has been pleased to 
give me of Don Juan.* I begin to flatter myself 
that the cares he has received from you, and from 
all those who surround him, will reestablish him. 

I cannot sufficiently express to you, Sir, my senti 
ments in this respect, and for the kindnesses, without 
number, which you have heaped upon me during the 
time passed with you. I shall render an account to 
my Court of all that I saw at the army; of the good 
order and discipline of the troops ; of the zeal and 
talents of the officers; of the good disposition reigning among them ; as well as of the respect and public 
confidence in the Commander-in-chief. These circum 
stances united form an augury the most favorable 
for the enterprises which your army may be in con 
dition to undertake, when it shall be completed, in 
consequence of the measures that have been just 
taken. I am certain, beforehand, that his Majesty 
will take a true satisfaction in learning details so in 
teresting to a power so dear to him. 

I dare supplicate your Excellency to receive anew 
the assurances of the sentiments of veneration and 
respect, with which you have inspired me, and with 
which I have the honor to be, 

Your most humble and most obedient servant, 

LUZERXE.

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL HEATH. 

Roxbury, 30 April, 1780. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I was, some time since, honored with yours of the 
28th ultimo, respecting clothing for the recruits, and, 
this morning, with that of the 17th instant. 

Several officers have already come from West Point 
on the recruiting service, and others are on the road. 
I wish they may be successful, but am at a loss, from 
the tenor of your Excellency s letter, to determinewhat bounty the recruits, raised by this State (Mas 
sachusetts), are to receive. It seems the Continental 
bounty, after the act of March, 1779, w T as to be two 
hundred dollars. The General Assembly of this State, 
on the 30th of September last, passed the following 
resolution, namely ; " Resolved, that a bounty of 
three hundred dollars, in addition to the bounty and 
subsistence-money allowed by Congress, be paid to 
each non-commissioned officer and soldier, who has or 
shall enlist as one of this State s quota of the Continental army, during the continuance of the present 
war between the United States of America and Great 
Britain." This bounty appears to be intended over 
and above the Continental bounty, and extended to 
all the soldiers belonging to their quota of the army 
enlisted at any preceding period. I purpose, to-mor 
row, to lay the matter before the Assembly, who, it 
is probable, may have received some particular in 
struction on the subject, or, at least, that they may 
conduct as they think proper. 
On Tuesday last two privateers, belonging to Sa 
lem (the Franklin and Jack), sent into that port a 
large letter-of-niarcjue ship, having on board one thou 
sand barrels of pork and beef, seven hundred and 
fifty barrels of flour, eight hundred firkins of butter, 
and dry goods to the amount of fifteen thousand 
pounds. 

A Dr. Apedale, lately come from New York to 
Boston, and, some time before, from Canada to New 
York, reports, that before he left Canada, it was said 
that about one thousand regulars and Tories, with as 
many Indians as could be collected and would join 
them, were to make an excursion on our frontiers on 
the Mohawk River, as soon as the season was suit 
able, in two divisions, under the command of John 
son and Butler; and that Lieutenant-Colonel Stacy 
was held a prisoner in Canada with a view to be 
exchanged for Johnson or Butler, should either of 
them happen to be taken. How much credit is to 
be given to this report, your Excellency may be able 
best to determine. 

I have the happiness to forward this by MajorGeneral the Marquis de Lafayette, who arrived at 
Boston on the 28th instant, where he was received 
with every demonstration of joy. I have the honor 
to be, with the greatest respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

WILLIAM HEATH. 



FROM JAMES DUANE. 



In Congress, Philadelphia, 4 May, 1780. 

MY DEAR GENERAL, 
We are here in anxious suspense for the fate of 
Charleston. It is not to be wondered at, when 
we consider the greatness of the stake, and the uncertainty and importance of the event. The Gover 
nor, Council, and magistrates have shut themselves 
up in the town, determined to share the glory of 
preserving it, or to perish in the attempt. We understand that this resolution was submitted to with 
reluctance by the principal officers of the army, and, 
in my opinion, it is rather a display of heroism than 
of deliberate policy. The influence of government 
would have been well employed, as far as we can 
judge at so remote a distance, in preparing against 
a disaster, and drawing the internal strength of the 
country to some point for its defence. On the present plan, the loss of the whole State seems to be 
hazarded with the capital. 

We learn from a Mr. Cannon, who left the neigh 
bourhood of Charleston on the 12th, and parted with 
General Lincoln on the 9th, that the garrison and in 
habitants were greatly elated on the arrival of the 
Virginia line, and in full expectation of success ; and 
it is his opinion, that if the Maryland line were nearthe scene of action, Sir Henry Clinton would be glad 
to raise the siege. We have endeavoured to learn 
from him the sentiments of General Lincoln on the 
fate of the town ; but it appears that he is as re 
served in his conversation as his letters, though his 

/ o 

activity and vigor inspire the highest respect ana 
confidence. These circumstances do not appear in 
any correspondence; and I conclude, though they are 
not very material, you will not think them too trivial 
to be communicated. 

We are exerting every means in our power to ex 
pedite the march of the reenforcement destined for 
Charleston. It is committed to the joint efforts of 
VOL. ii. 38 
the Board of War and the Treasury, and I hopeevery obstacle is surmounted. I have but one wish 
left, that Virginia may, on so decisive and interesting 
an occasion, be able to detach a body of militia, 
which, in conjunction with the Continental reenforcements, will be sufficient to support the communication 
between the town and country, and harass the be 
siegers in their rear. The reluctance against the 
southern service, though easy to be accounted for, is 
much to be deplored ; and I reconcile myself to the 
embarrassments which our weakness in that quarter 
superadds to all our other difficulties. 

In spite of the disagreeable aspect of our money 
affairs, I look forward to a happy termination of ourarduous conflict. We have not experienced half the 
distresses which, considering the power of our enemies, every contemplative mind must have expected. 
I am, in this view, much engaged in another attempt 
to get the Confederation accomplished, which, in my 
opinion, would fully compensate for the temporary 
loss of any city on the Continent. It gives me great 
pleasure to assure your Excellency that the Delegates 
from Virginia are warmly disposed to give it all the 
aid in their power ; and they have the fullest expect 
ation that our joint exertions will succeed, and the 
future safety and tranquillity of the States be fixed 
on a permanent basis. Without a federal alliance, 
peace itself, independence, and security from external 
assaults, would scarcely deserve the name of a blessing. The flame of disaffection to the British Administration has, at length, reached the bosom of ourenemies. Hemonstrances and complaints, always ter 
rible to an arbitrary government, cannot fail of pro 
ducing embarrassment in public councils, or of en 
feebling the national exertions. We have a right to 
hope that they will be attended with serious conse 
quences, and put an end to their operations against 
these States. If Britain, unsupported by friends or 
allies, and rent asunder by domestic jars and discon 
tents, can continue an unjust and unpopular waragainst the joint efforts of America, France, and 
Spain, she will exhibit an example of obstinacy and 
of vigor unparalleled in history. 

To hold a place in your Excellency s confidence 
and friendship, is an honor which I most highly prize, 
and which I shall always regard as one of the most 
happy circumstances of my life ; for no man can be 
more entirely attached to you, by every tie of affec 
tion, esteem, and gratitude, than, my dear General, 
Your most obedient and most faithful servant, 

JAMES DUANE. 

P. S. Be pleased to present my most respectful 
compliments to Mrs. Washington and the gentlemen 
of the family. "We have this moment letters, informing us that the Connecticut and Massachusetts Legis 
latures have cheerfully adopted the new plan of 
finance. The Connecticut traders have done them 
selves great honor, as well as the principal farmers. 
The former, in an address to the Assembly, declare 
their readiness to receive the new money at its value 
specified for by congress, in payment for their commodities. New York, I am persuaded, will concur; 
and their example will probably bring all the States 
into the measures. 
FROM MAJOR-GENERAL THE BARON DE KALB. 

Philadelphia, 12 May, 1780. 

SIR, 

The providing the troops, under my command, with 
every necessary for their march, has been attended 
with many difficulties and delays, which it was not 
in my power to remove as soon as I could have 
wished- and, therefore, I was not able to give a 
satisfactory account to your Excellency before now. 

The Board of War have fixed upon Richmond as 
the place of rendezvous for the whole. The two bri 
gades embarked at the Head of Elk; the artillery, 
ammunition, and baggage, proceeded by land. I shall 
set out to-morrow morning. I should have done it 
many days ago, had I not been detained by the 
Board of War and of the Treasury. I should have 
been happy to see the Marquis de Lafayette, but 
would not lose a moment in going on. 

From Richmond, I will write to your Excellency 
the situation of the troops, the number of recruits 
joined on the march, and the measures I shall take 
to march with most expedition. I have the honor to 
be, with great respect, 

Your Excellency s obedient servant, 

THE BARON DE KALB.

FROM COLONEL BRODHEAD. 

Fort Pitt, 13 May, 1780. 

DEAR GENERAL, 
I have put off the assembling of the militia until 
the 4th of next month, to endeavour to procure a 
sufficient quantity of provision for them. But I fearit will not be in my power, as General Gates, who 
presides at the Board of Inspection, has ordered the 
Commissaries to stop purchasing ; and the Mingoes, in 
sundry parties, have been discovered on their march 
toward the inhabitants. Several persons have lately 
been killed and wounded in Westmoreland county, 
which will probably prevent my receiving any aid 
from the militia of that county. They have hired 
sixty men, who are now stationed upon their frontier. 
A Delaware Indian informed me this day, that two 
parties of warriors had just crossed the Ohio River, 
near Logstown and Chartier s Creek, which will, pro 
bably, by alarming and driving the inhabitants, prevent my getting the men from the other counties as 
I expected. The remaining Continentals are the cullings of our troops, and I cannot promise any thing 
clever from them. 

I have wrote to the artillery officer to hurry up 
the artillery and stores ; but I hear he is badly furnished with carriages and forage, which must prevent 
his marching with expedition. 

I think it is probable that the enemy are medi 
tating an attack upon some of our posts, which, for 
want of sufficient garrisons and supplies, cannot make 
much resistance. I am preparing to receive them 
here, but the detachments to Fort Mclntosh, Holliday s Cave, Fort Henry, and Fort Armstrong, leave 
but a small garrison to defend this post. The Dela 
ware Indians continue their professions of friendship, 
and some of their warriors are now out with my 
scouts. But, as I have little or nothing to give them 
but good words and fair promises, I apprehend they 
will soon decline the service. I have the honor to 
38* 
be, with the highest sentiments of respect and es 
teem. 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

DANIEL BRODHEAD.

FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL DUPORTAIL. 

Charleston, 17 May, 1780. 

SIR, 

You will have probably heard of the surrender of 
Charleston, by the time you will receive this letter. 
I arrived there the 25th of April, at seven o clock 
in the morning, after having past, during the night, 
in the middle of the enemy, through the woods, with 
the assistance of good guides. I found the town in a 
desperate state, almost entirely invested by the British army and fleet, which had passed the bar, and 
Fort Moultrie. They had surmounted difficulties which 
were generally looked upon as insurmountable, with 
out experiencing scarce any resistance. The enemy 
had brought their trenches, upon the Neck, within 
about one hundred and twenty or one hundred and 
thirty yards from the fortifications; in a word, the 
fall of the town was unavoidable, unless an army 
came to her assistance, which then did not appearlikely. 

After having examined the situation of things, I 
thought an evacuation highly advisable, and proposed 
it ; but the Council found an impracticability in the 
measure, although, for my part, it only appeared to 
me difficult and hazardous, and such as we ought to 
risk, in our present situation. That plan being re 
jected, the only object was to protract the term of 
our capitulation. I have done, on my part, every 
thing that was in my power to fulfil that object, in 
the same manner as Colonel Laumoy had, before my 
arrival; but time brought us to close sight of the 
term of our resistance. 

The enemy succeeded in draining part of our ditch, 
which was in front of our intrenchments, and raised 
new batteries in the third parallel. The day they 
opened them, they sent a flag, with a letter, to sum 
mon General Lincoln to surrender. Upon this a 
Council of General and Field-Officers was called; and, 
after having asked whether terms ought to be pro 
posed to the enemy, it was carried in the affirmative, 
by a great majority. I myself was of that number. 
The first proposals were from the enemy. We might 
expect advantageous conditions; I had even some 
hopes that we might have saved the garrison. Be 
sides, a positive refusal to treat with an enemy who, 
within a few days, would have been in a condition 
of giving us the law, appeared imprudent and unseasonable. It was then determined, in Council, that 
propositions should be made; but afterwards, by an 
extraordinary oversight, they left to the General Offi 
cers the care of determining whatever might be pro 
posed. 

This is the moment where I left off taking any 
part in what has been done, being of a contrary 
opinion to that of the General Officers. They agreed 
to propose that the Continental troops should be pri 
soners of war. I opposed that measure with all my 
might, I represented that, if even our situation re 
quired it, it was not our business to propose it, and 
that we showed an ignorance of what is practised in 
those cases, which would make us appear in a ridiculous light. I represented that, if I had been of 
opinion with the greatest number to propose terms 
to the enemy, I meant that they should be honor 
able terms, both advantageous to the army and the 
Continent; as, for instance, to surrender the town 
alone, with the artillery, stores, and ships, but to 
save the troops. That, if the army must be prisoners 
of war, it was more eligible to hold out, in order to 
justify such unfavorable conditions, by a longer re 
sistance and a more distressing situation. 

My representations had not the desired effect. The 
propositions were made such as you will see them. 
Fortunately, such as they were, the enemy would not 
grant them, and proposed others less advantageous, 
which General Lincoln did not, however, think proper 
to accept. The truce was broke, and the operations 
of the siege vigorously continued. But the second 
day after, the militia refused to do duty. General 
Lincoln thought from this that the capitulation was 
absolutely necessary, and called the Council, who 
countenanced the measure. For my own part, I 
thought that we ought to try before, to bring the 
militia to their duty by all possible means, by acts 
of authority, and, if necessary, by exemplary punish 
ments. This was likely deemed impracticable, and 
the capitulation took place, to my great regret; not 
that I thought we could have held out longer than 
three or four days, but that time would have put 
the enemy in such a situation as to render a further 
resistance on our part blamable to everybody. Then 
our defence would have done us much more honor. 
It is true that, in that case, the conditions would 
not have likely been the same ; but I was for sacrificing that advantage to a little more glory. 

Fortunately, in all this the honor of the American 
arms is secure, and the enemy have not yet great 
subject to triumph. To remain forty-two days with 
open trenches before a town of an immense extent, 
fortified by sandy intrenchments, raised in two months, 
without covered way, without outworks, open in several places on the water, and exposed everywhere to 
an open attack, and defended by a garrison which 
was not sufficient by half; to remain, I say, forty-two 
days before such a place, and display all the apparel 
of a regular siege, is nothing very glorious. The 
British General has, perhaps, followed the rules of 
prudence in this conduct ; but, at least, the troops 
under his command will never have subject of boasting of their audaciousness and enterprising spirit. 
The American troops, on the contrary, have given 
certain proofs of their firmness in supporting a tremendous fire, and remaining all the while exposed 
to the danger of a surprise and open attacks, of 
which the success was almost certain, if the enemy 
had taken proper measures. I have the honor to be, 
with the greatest respect, your Excellency s 

Most humble and obedient servant, 

DUPORTAIL. 

P. S. This is the copy of the letter that I write 
to the Congress. I am very sorry they don t let me 
have time enough to add a great many things I 
should be glad to say.

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Morristown, 23 May, 1780. 

SIR, 

I have had a long conversation with General 
Schuyler this morning, and have seen the powers 
and appointments upon the present business intrusted to the direction of the Committee, as well as their 
powers to act under.* From all which I am fully 
of opinion, that the plan is altogether incompetent to 
the purpose and end proposed. Time w r ill not permit 
me to enter into the detail of objections, nor perhaps 
would their force appear in the same point of light 
to another, who has had less experience in the difficulties attending the business, than I have. 

It is my opinion, that your Excellency ought to 
ask the decided opinion of the Committee, in writing, 
whether they think their powers are competent to 
the business expected of them. If they say not, as 
I am sure they must, then I would require of them 
the powers and the plan they conceive necessary to 
support the enterprise ; the whole of which I would 
state to Congress, supported with my own sentiments, 
as well with respect to the defects of the present 
plan, as the plan necessary for the business. Nothing, 
but some such decisive measure as this, will put the 
business on a proper footing. The measure will, at 
least, place your conduct in the fairest point of light. 
It will free the Committee from their present embarrassments, and place the labouring-oar where it ought 
to be. If you undertake the business upon the present footing, and exercise powers beyond the present 
scheme, it will be asked, why you did not ask for 
an enlargement of the Committee s pOAvers, if you 
deemed them inadequate. And if you engage and 
fail for want of support, it will be asked, why you 
embarked in such a business, without being fully per 
suaded that the means were adequate to the end. In 



* General Sclmylcr, Mr. Matlicws, and Mr. Peabody, Delegates in 
Congress, had been appointed a Committee to proceed to head-quarters for the purpose of consulting with the Commander-in-chief on 
the affairs of the army. 
whatever point of view I consider the subject, I see 
the greatest propriety in your Excellency stating to 
the Committee this qusere, whether it is their opinion they can give you such support as will warrant 
your engaging in a cooperation with the French 
forces for the redemption of New York. 

I have just seen Colonel Hamilton, who says yourExcellency desires my opinion upon the position the 
fleet off the Hook ought to take, upon the supposi 
tion it is a French fleet, and come with a view of 
cooperating with us. It is my opinion, if your Ex 
cellency intends to support the expedition against 
New York at all events, without regard to the pow 
ers or plan laid down by Congress (if that should 
fail or appear inadequate to the end), then the fleet 
and forces ought to be immediately brought into the 
Hook, and the troops landed upon Staten Island, 
where our army ought to reenforce them at the 
same instant of time. But, if your Excellency is determined to depend upon civil government for sup 
port altogether, without any exertions of your own, 
and you think the present plan and powers of the 
Committee defective, it is my advice, to let the fleet 
and forces go into Rhode Island ; unless you should 
think it advisable to put one thousand or fifteen 
hundred men on board, and push on the fleet, without 
loss of time, to the soutlrvvard. 

To bring the fleet into the Hook, without having taken some decisive resolution upon the lineof conduct you mean to pursue, may tend to embarrass you and injure our ally. We ought carefully to 
avoid bringing our friends into distress and disgrace, 
if we cannot avail ourselves of the benefit intended us. 

I shall be at head-quarters in a few minutes, and 
will give your Excellency my further sentiments on 
the matter. I am, with great respect. 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

NATHANAEL GREENE.

FROM JAMES BOWDOIN. 

Boston, 29 May, 1780. 

DEAR SIR, 

Yesterday, at five o clock, P. M., I received yourExcellency s letter of the 15th, with the inclosed to 
Major-General Heath. As it was of importance he 
should have it as soon as may be, I immediately 
went with it to Roxbury, and delivered it to him. I 
told him I would assist him in inquiring for inform 
ation relative to the particulars mentioned in yourletter, and, if I should obtain any worth notice, I 
will communicate it to your Excellency .* 

It appears probable the enemy have got informa 
tion of what is intended; for they know, by a packet 
arrived at New York from England, that a squadron 
of men-of-war, with troops, had sailed from Brest for 
this part of America; and last Thursday a vessel, 
which arrived here on Saturday, saw a number of 
ships standing to the eastward, which the people judged were going to Halifax ; probably the same which, 
on that day, we received intelligence had some days 
before sailed from New York with two thousand troops 
on board. These repeated drafts, one would think, 
must so much weaken New York, as to make it impressible by a force not very large ; so that in such 
a divided state of their troops, both places may fall 
into our hands, if we spiritedly cooperate with ourallies ; which, so far as this State may be concerned, 
I doubt not will be the case, when their arrival is 
known, or rather, when your Excellency shall make 
the requisition. 

I am much obliged for the intelligence concerning 
the state of things at Charleston. Our direct intelligence is to the 27th of April, and that on the 22d, 
at night, an attack of the enemy was repelled, with 
a loss on their part of eight hundred, as appears by 
our last newspapers. What was their real loss, I 
think is uncertain. Fervently wishing their total defeat there, and a successful campaign on our part, I 
have the honor to be, with the most respectful re 
gards, Sir, your Excellency s 

Most obedient, humble servant, 

JAMES BOWDOIN.

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL PUTNAM. 

Pomfret, 29 May, 1780. 

DEAR SIR, 

I cannot forbear informing your Excellency, by the 
return of Major Humphreys to camp, of the state of 
my health, from the first of my illness to the present time. 

After I was prevented from coming on to the 
army, by a stroke of the paralytic kind, which deprived me, in a great measure, of the use of my 
right leg and arm, I retired to my plantation, and 
have been gradually growing better ever since. I 
have now so far gained the use of my limbs, especially of my leg, as to be able to walk with very 
little impediment, and to ride on horseback tolerably 
well. In other respects I am in perfect health, and 
enjoy the comforts and pleasures of life with as good 
a relish as most of my neighbours. 

Although I should not be able to resume a command in the army, I propose to myself the happiness 
of making a visit, and seeing my friends there some 
time in the course of the campaign. And, however 
incapable I may be of serving my country, to my 
latest hour my wishes and prayers will always be 
most ardent and sincere for its happiness and freedom. As a principal instrument in the hand of Pro 
vidence for effecting this, may Heaven long preserve 
your Excellency s most important and valuable life. 

Not being able to hold the pen in my own hand, 
I am obliged to make use of another to express with 
how much regard and esteem, I am, your Excellency s 
Most obedient and very humble servant, 

ISRAEL PUTNAM. 

P. S. I am making a great effort to use my hand 
to make the initials of my name, for the first time.

FROM COLONEL BRODHEAD. 

Fort Pitt, 30 May, 1780. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

Since my last, ten persons have been killed and 
wounded, taken by the Indians in Westmoreland county. Parties of regulars and militia have endeavoured 
to overtake them, but without success. 

The accounts I have received, relative to the British garrison at Detroit, differ widely, some making it 
to consist of only two hundred men, some three hundred, and others, upwards of four hundred. This has 
determined me to send Captain Brady, with five white 
men and two Delaware Indians, to Sandusky, to en 
deavour to take a British prisoner, which I hope he 
will effect. I have likewise offered other Delaware 
warriors fifty hard dollars worth of goods, for oneBritish soldier, and they have promised to bring himimmediately. Should an intelligent one be brought 
in, I intend to offer him some indulgence upon his 
giving me the most perfect intelligence in his power. 

I had lately called out eight hundred and twentyfive rank and file, and a proportionate number of officers, from the militia, to aid me upon an enterprise 
against the Shawanese towns ; but, upon finding the 
true state of what provisions could be drawn from 
the Commissaries, and that they were prohibited from 
making any further purchases, I was compelled to 
postpone the attempt until a sufficient quantity of 
provisions can be procured. The militia appear to be 
very anxious to aid me, and I sincerely wish it was 
in my power to indulge them. I expect a small sup 
ply from below the mountains, which, if it proves to 
be of good quality, will enable me to subsist the dependent posts until the 1st of September. 

The soldiers frequently desert^ and are often apprehended ; and I expect sundry charges will soon be 
exhibited against some of the civil Staff Officers in 
this district. I shall, therefore, be much obliged for 
a few more blank orders, to enable me to assemble 
General Courts-Martial for their respective trials. 

I cannot learn that the ordnance and stores, ordered from Philadelphia, have yet left Carlisle, nor do I 
know of what kind they are, nor what their number

or quality. I have the honor to be, with the most

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL HEATH. 

Roxbury, 31 May, 1780. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

Since I had the honor of writing you on the 
28th instant, I have been endeavouring to obtain in 
telligence of the situation of the enemy at Halifax, 
&c. I learn that their naval force, not long since, 
consisted of one ship of seventy-four guns, one of 
twenty, one sloop of war, and two or three privateers. 
General McLean, a vigilant officer, commands the 
land forces, which are said to consist of six regi 
ments, each about five hundred strong, four of which 
are at Halifax, the other two at different posts in 
the province. The militia of the town is said to be 
about eleven hundred. 

From a gentleman, of the strictest probity and 
warmest attachment to our cause, and who has madeupwards of forty voyages from Boston to Halifax, I 
learn that, when he was last there, which was before 
the commencement of hostilities, the enemy had a 
strong work on George s Island, at the entrance of 
the harbour; another about half a mile from the cen 
tre of the town, and about the same distance from 
George s Island ; a battery on the east side, about 
two miles below, or without George s Island ; a bat 
tery also at the town ; the ship-yard and Arsenal 
about a mile above the town, where there is another 
battery. The basin begins just above the ship-yard, 
and extends up about six miles northerly, from east 
to west. Between three and four miles above the 
Navy Yard was a block-house, at a place called the 
Narrows. The citadel is on a high hill, back of the 
town, at the distance of a quarter of a mile, and 
commands both the town and harbour. The basin is 
very spacious, capable, perhaps, to contain the whole 
navy of England. 

I have just called at the Honorable Mr. Bowdoin s. 
He has preserved a chart of the harbour of Halifax; has 
made several inquiries of the gentleman I mentioned 
in my last, who, I believe, without the least suspicion, 
answered every one of them. Mr. Bowdoin is now 
making some minutes explanatory of the chart and 
the information he has received from the gentleman. 
The chart and minutes he will forward by to-morrow s 
or the next post, to your Excellency. I am looking 
out for the best pilots, and believe shall find a num 
ber of very good ones. 

By the last accounts from Penobscot, there were 
appearances of an evacuation, or the removal of a 
part of the ordnance and troops to some other place. 
The garrison at Penobscot, at present, is by no means 
strong, at most not more than four hundred. Captain 
La Touche, of his most Christian Majesty s frigate the 
Hermione, in his late cruise, ran into Penobscot Bay, 
where he lay for some time, made several signals, 
and took a plan of the works, which he has forwarded to the Minister at Philadelphia. It is said the 
appearance of this frigate in the Bay has caused a 
great consternation and alarm. 

I have just established a correspondence with Ge 
neral Wadsworth, who commands the troops in the 
eastern parts of this State, and with Colonel Allen, 
at Machias, and have requested every piece of intelligence they may be able to obtain, either from Hali 
fax or Penobscot. 

The last night,, I received most alarming accounts 
from West Point, of the scantiness of provisions and 
rum at that post, A quantity of the latter is on the 
road to Springfield. Since I have been here, I have 
been endeavouring to promote the recruiting service 
all in my power; but the Court unfortunately stop 
ping the towns bounties, in the settlements with the 
soldiers, has almost totally prevented enlistments. 
The new Assembly convened this day. I apprehend 
they will go any lengths that are recommended, to 
complete their quota, even by drafts, if they cannot 
be otherwise obtained. I wish to know your Excel 
lency s pleasure, whether I shall urge it, arid how 
far. 

The issuing Commissary here informs me that there 
are upwards of nine hundred quintals of dry codfish 
in the stores, a considerable part of which will be 
in danger of spoiling in the course of the summer, if 
it is not issued. What pity it is that the army, in 
their present straits, cannot be relieved by it. 

A report prevails, to-day, that the Trumbull frigate 
and a French ship have re-taken the Iris, formerly 
the Hancock frigate, off Sandy Hook. I hope it will 
be confirmed. I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

WILLIAM HEATH. 
FROM JOSEPH REED. 

Philadelphia, June 5, 1780. 

DEAR SIR, 

Your kind and truly obliging favor, of the 28th 
ultimo, came safely to hand, and, the oftener I pe 
ruse it, the more fully sensible I am of the justice 
and importance of its contents. I do not know by 
what means the expected assistance from France has 
been procured; but it will certainly give a complex 
ion to the alliance in future, according to the recep 
tion it meets with here. I should be very apprehen 
sive, from the different state of improvement of the 
two countries, and perverseness of human nature, 
which often leads us to expect more than can be ob 
tained, and be chagrined at the disappointment, that, 
with all possible attention and care, difficulties will 
arise, and that it will greatly add to the burden laid 
upon you. But, if they should want necessaries, when 
the country abounds in them, we shall justly forfeit 
any pretensions to respect and friendship, and be 
come contemptible, not only to them, but to the 
world, and even to ourselves. Our difficulties lie 
with the rich, and not with the poor. While the warwas conducted with emissions, the aid of the former 
was not wanted; that of the latter was to be had, 
and may be had now, upon the same terms, that is, 
giving them a support for their labors; but to fight 
and starve, or work and starve, are equally impracti 
cable. 

In my opinion we have, in some degree, miscalculated the abilities of the country, and entirely the 
disposition of the people to bear taxes in the neces 
sary extent. The country, not immediately the seat 
of either army, is richer than when the war began; 
but the long disuse of taxes, and their natural unpalatableness, have embarrassed the business exceedingly; and Tories, grumbling Whigs, and party, have 
all thrown in their aid to increase the discontent. 
These circumstances, which it w r as impossible to fore 
see in their full extent, made a foreign loan a mat 
ter of great importance, and even of indispensable 
necessity; and, if any thing has been omitted to ob 
tain it, which we may yet retrieve, I should hope no 
time will be lost. 

The failure of the Eastern States to supply beef 
will be attended with some disagreeable effects here ; 
for all the money we had, or expected soon, has 
been furnished to procure this article, and, of course, 
our means of procuring flour proportionably diminished. The State made an effort, on this account, 
which no other has equalled, as they mortgaged anestate, belonging to the public, in the neighbourhood 
of this city, for the special purpose of supplying the 
army, leaving the taxes for the general use of the 
United States. But this money, though secure in 
every other event than that of our failing in the 
contest, and drawing an interest, has met with em 
barrassments and opposition, partly from interested 
and partly from other motives, which have very much 
delayed the supplies. We have, at length, got in 
motion, and, I hope, shall be able to get a supply of 
flour for the summer ; but the shock paper money 
has received, subjects all our resources to the ca 
price of interested or perverse individuals, more than 
is consistent with our safety or honor. 

The address of the Committee, accompanied with a 
letter from yourself, came at a seasonable moment, 
just as the House of Assembly was about to rise. 
They immediately passed a law for raising two men 
out of every company of militia, which I had en 
deavoured, but in vain, to effect last spring. This 
will produce about one thousand men from the whole 
State, about six hundred of which will go to fill 
up the ranks of the Continental army. The re 
mainder we must endeavour to throw upon the fron 
tiers, or some of our oldest and most established 
counties are in danger of becoming a frontier. In 
short, there is no pacifying them without a body of 
troops, though experience has long decided how in 
adequate a defensive war is for support against the 
Indians. 

The representation of the distress for want of meat, 
produced an immediate exertion, of which I hope the 
benefit must be felt by this time. It is true, many 
of the cattle are not fit for slaughter, but they are 
the best we have. It was thought best to continue 
this business, at least for some weeks, in order to 
have a stock in possession, and of consequence they 
will be continued for some time; proceeding to camp 
upon this principle, that, if you have none better, 
these must serve, and if you have, the season of the 
year will admit their being kept till they are better. 

We had proceeded thus far, and there seemed to 
be a very good disposition in all to advance the necessary measures, with as much expedition as delibe 
rative bodies usually do, or are capable of. The 
vesting extraordinary powers in the Executive was 
not so well relished, and it was too delicate a sub 
ject to be much pressed by me, especially as there 
appeared some reluctance on this point; and, it is 
probable, the House would have adjourned without 
touching upon it, had it not been so forcibly urged 
in your private letter. I was extremely embarrassed ; 
I did not see any chance of its being done, but by 
letting them know that it was deemed by you a 
matter not of mere importance, but of indispensable 
necessity. This was done in a manner the most 
guarded and confidential, and had the desired effect, 
as they have vested the Executive with the power 
to declare martial law, so far as they shall deem necessary? ftftd which gives us a power of doing what 
may be necessary, without attending to the ordinary 
forms of law. I have the pleasure to observe, the 
measure is generally satisfactory; and as we shall en 
deavour to exercise it with prudence and moderation, 
I hope it may be productive of the good effects ex 
pected from it. 

The loss of Charleston, with its garrison, and stores, 
which I think a very probable event, notwithstanding 
the sanguine hopes of some, and doubts of others, 
will, it must be presumed, rouse us from the insensi 
bility with which we have hitherto carried on the 
war since 1777. And yet the scene is so distant, 
and the danger apparently remote, that I am not 
certain of this effect. The arrival of a few vessels 
from Statia, or capture of as many, seems to be an 
event more interesting, than an advantage gained or 
lost by the enemy, however considerable. And ourcountry friends find their patriotism abate, as their 
interests are affected by duties or taxes. I am in 
clined to think some stroke of adverse fortune neces 
sary, and that lasting good may flow from it ; for, 
pretend what we may, the country is so much re 
moved from the distress of the war, and really has 
the three requisites of war, men, provisions, and iron, 
if not in abundance, in sufficiency for all our wants, 
our only difficulty is to draw them forth. And for 
this, two things are essentially necessary; namely, 
union among the States, generally and particularly. 
The parties in Congress have weakened the influ 
ence and lessened the weight of that body, and the 
internal divisions have had the like effect on the Go 
vernments ; so that every measure, however necessary 
for the general good, has been timid, feeble, and lan 
guid, each fearing to give his adversary some advan 
tage ; while the disaffected and mercenary have raised 
their heads, with an astonishing degree of insolence, 
to the great discouragement of the Whigs, especially 
in the middling and lower classes of life, who, having 
been distressed by their attachment to our cause, and 
their minds neither feeling, nor perhaps capable of 
feeling, what is called liberality of spirit towards an 
enemy, have been mortified to find themselves no 
way distinguished, but by their sufferings. It is clearthat the Royal cause, both in this State and Mary, 
land, derives great advantage from the division of 
the Whigs ; for, in the rage and discontent of party, 
auxiliaries are so acceptable, that we are not apt 
to scrutinize their motives and principles too narrow 
ly. Upon these considerations, I have ever thought 
it a most necessary duty to sacrifice, as far as I am 
capable, any smaller resentments, and, far from declining the paths of peace, to seek them. I have 
made more advances than one. The exposing my 
life to save that of my principal enemies, when they 
would otherwise have fallen a collective sacrifice to 
their own imprudence and to popular resentment, 
though an act of duty in my station, might have 
been evaded on many plausible pretexts. But it 
seems to be the allotment of Providence, that, in this 
respect, I am to be unhappy. 

Conceiving it a proper time to write, and make a 
great and general effort for our national safety and 
honor, a few days before I was favored with yoursentiments on this subject, waiving all sorts of punc 
tilio, I made a direct overture. I can only say, it 
was not accepted ; but it was of so explicit and unequivocal a nature, as to leave no farther ground, unless time and a change of circumstances should pro 
duce it. I am, however, happy to find, that I have 
met your opinion in this respect, and beg you to 
believe, not only that I was sincere on that occasion, 
but that, as the public good and your ease appearconnected in some degree with it, I shall embrace 
any favorable opportunity to renew it. 

I feel, exceedingly feel, for the peculiarity of yoursituation, my dear Sir, and also fear that your health 
may suffer in the conflict. But when I consider what 
just conceptions you have of the importance of the 
prize for which we contend, the progress already, and 
the abounding affection and confidence of the country, I cannot but believe you may draw great conso 
lation and support, that the present difficulties will 
lay a foundation for some system of solid supply, 
and a just consideration of the army, which has been 
too generally viewed through a very mistaken me 
dium. For myself, I shall only add, that the same 
motives which led me to leave domestic enjoyments 
and lucrative ease, in 1775, and partake your early 
exertions, now strengthened by more knowledge and 
warmer attachment, will induce me to strain every 
nerve, and run every risk, to promote the public service, as the most acceptable testimony I can give 
you of the truth of these professions. And if there 
is any particular case or occasion, which, from want 
of knowledge or information, I may be likely to 
overlook, I shall esteem it a particular favor to be 
honored with a few lines, to which I shall pay the 
most special and animated attention. 
I think it very happy, that Major Lee s corps is 
in the vicinity of this place; as, in case of emergen 
cy, they may be wanted to execute measures which, 
though necessary, are unpalatable, and often ill exe 
cuted, where the feelings of acquaintance and per 
sonal friendship operate against the public measures. 
They are in exceeding good quarters, on the best 
terms with the inhabitants, and, I presume, must be 
far too late to render any assistance to our friends 
in the south. 

Mrs. Heed, who is pretty well recovered, returns 
her respectful regards and thanks to Mrs. Washing 
ton and yourself for your polite attention, in which I 
beg leave to include mine; and am, with the most 
unfeigned respect and esteem, dear Sir, 

Your obliged and most obedient humble servant, 

JOSEPH REED.

FROM COLONEL ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 

8 June, 1780. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have seen the enemy. Those in view I calculate 
at about three thousand.* There may be, and pro 
bably are, enough others out of sight. They have 
sent all their horse to the other side, except about 
fifty or sixty. Their baggage, it is agreed on all 
hands, has also been sent across, and their wounded. 
It is not ascertained that any of their infantry have 
passed to the other side. There are four or five 
hundred on the opposite point, but it is uncertain 
whether they are those who went from this side, or 
those who wore on Statcn Island. I rather suppose 
the former. 

Different conjectures may be made. The present 
movement may be calculated to draw us down, and 
betray us into an action. They may have desisted 
from their intention of passing till night, for fear of 
our falling upon their rear. I believe this is the 
case, for, as they have but few boats, it would certainly be a delicate manoeuvre to cross in our face. 

We are taking measures to watch their motions 
to-night as closely as possible. An incessant, but 
very light skirmishing; very few boats, not more 
than enough to carry three or four hundred men 
at a time. It is likely more will come down this 
evening I have the honor to be 

Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

ALEXANDER HAMILTON.

FROM GOVERNOR JEFFERSON. 

Richmond, 11 June, 1780. 

SIR, 

Major Galvan, as recommended by your Excellency, 
was despatched to his station without delay, and has 
been furnished with every thing he desired, as far as 
we were able. The line of expresses formed between 
us, is such as will communicate intelligence from oneto the other in twenty-three hours. I have forwarded 
to him information of our disasters in the south, as 
they have come to me. 

Our intelligence from the southward is most la 
mentably defective. Though Charleston has been in 
the hands of the enemy a month, we hear nothing 
of their movements which can be relied on. Rumors 
are, that they are penetrating northward. To remedy 
this defect, I shall immediately establish a line of 
expresses from hence to the neighbourhood of their 
army, and send thither a sensible, judicious person, 
to give us information of their movements. This in 
telligence will, I hope, be conveyed to us at the rate 
of one hundred and twenty miles in the twenty-fourhours. They set out to their stations to-morrow. I 
wish it were possible, that a like speedy line of 
communication could be formed from hence to yourExcellency s head-quarters. Perfect and speedy in 
formation of what is passing in the south, might put 
it in your power, perhaps, to frame your measures 
by theirs. 

There is really nothing to oppose the progress of 
the enemy northward but the cautious principles of 
the military art. North Carolina is without arms. 
We do not abound. Those we have are freely imparted to them; but such is the state of their re 
sources, that they have not been able to move a 
single musket from this State to theirs. All the 
wagons we can collect have been furnished to the 
Baron de Kalb, and are assembled for the march of 
twenty-five hundred men, under General Stevens, of 
Culpepper, who will move on the 19th instant. I have 
written to Congress, to hasten supplies of arms and 
military stores for the Southern States, and, particu 
larly, to aid us with cartridge-paper and boxes, the 
want of which articles, small as they are, renders ourstores useless. The want of money cramps every 
effort. This will be supplied by the most unpalat 
able of all substitutes, force. Your Excellency will 
readily conceive that, after the loss of one army, oureyes are turned towards the other, and that we comfort ourselves, if any aids can be furnished by you, 
without defeating the operations more beneficial to 
the general Union, they will be furnished. At the 
same time, I am happy to find that the wishes of 
the people go no further, as far as I have an opportunity of learning their sentiments. Could arms be 
furnished, I think this State and North Carolina 
would embody from ten to fifteen thousand militia 
immediately, and more if necessary. 

I hope, ere long, to be able to give you a more 
certain statement of the enemy s as well as our situ 
ation, which I shall not fail to do. I inclose you a 
letter from Major Gal van, being the second I have 
forwarded to you. With sentiments of the most per 
fect esteem and respect, I have the honor to be, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

THOMAS JEFFERSON.

FROM GOVERNOR- CLINTON. 

Kingston, 13 June, 1780. 

DEAR SIR, 

Your Excellency s letter of the 10th instant, ad 
dressed to Lieutenant-Governor Cortlandt, w r as delivered to me yesterday evening, and I immediately for 
warded, by express, your letter to Brigadier-General 
James Clinton, and urged him to the utmost expedi 
tion in his march to West Point. I inclose yourExcellency a copy of a letter from my brother, of 
the 10th instant, giving the particular disposition of 
the regiments of his brigade, by which it appears, 
that Colonel Gansevoort s was employed in escorting 
a supply of provisions to Fort Schuyler. As this appeared to me to be a business of too much import 
ance to admit of delay, or be intrusted to the care 
of a weak party, I have therefore taken the liberty 
of advising him to continue this regiment on that 
service until it shall be accomplished, which, I hope, 
will meet your Excellency s approbation. 

I am apprehensive that the other three regiments 
(they having, previous to the receipt of your Excel 
lency s order, marched to the respective stations men 
tioned in my brother s letter) will not be able to 
reach West Point on as early a day as might have 
been expected. The militia, in the vicinity of the 
posts in the Highlands, were, before I left Poughkeepsie, put under orders to hold themselves in con 
stant readiness to take the field on the shortest no 
tice ; and, on the signals of alarm being given, those 
on the west side of the river are to repair to West 
Point, and those on the east side are to rendezvous 
at Fishkill, and there wait for further orders. Of this 
I apprised General Howe at the time. I now write 
to him on the subject; and, if it should be thought 
necessary by your Excellency, I will immediately 
order such part of them to West Point as your Ex 
cellency or General Howe may direct, until the arrival of General Clinton s brigade. 

Your Excellency s several letters of the 23d and 
28th ultimo, and 2d instant, were received and opened by Lieutenant-Go vernor Cortlandt, in my absence, 
and such of them as were proper to be commu 
nicated to the Legislature, with the letters from the 
Committee of Congress, of the 25th ultimo, were laid 
before them; and I am happy in being able to as 
sure your Excellency, that they give me reason to 
hope that they will yield a compliance with the re40* 
quisitions made of this State, on this important occa 
sion, except in the article of forage, of which this 
State is entirely exhausted. 

The moment I closed my last letter to General 
Sclmyler, which has been communicated to your Ex 
cellency, I embarked for Albany, with an intention 
to intercept the enemy, under Sir John Johnson, in 
their retreat from Tryon county, or to succour Fort 
Schuyler, if invested, which I then apprehended might 
have been the case. On my arrival at Albany, I soon 
had reason to believe that the report of a force having marched against that post was merely calculated 
to favor Sir John Johnson s incursion ; and, as the 
militia had collected, he had retired about six miles 
from Johnstown, and was preparing to return to Ca 
nada by a route more northward than that by which 
he entered the country. I therefore directed Colonel 
Van Schaick, who was at Fort Hunter, to march for 
ward and hang close upon and harass his rear, to 
afford time for me to gain his front with the militia, 
to the north of Albany, which I expected to be able 
to effect, by striking into Jessup s Patent from Fort 
Edward. But, before my letter reached Colonel Van 
Schaick, the militia in that quarter, being out of 
provisions, and finding Sir John retiring, were returning home, which was also the case with those who 
assembled, and I expected to find at Fort Edward. 

Under these circumstances, I found it necessary to 
alter my plan, to that of passing Lake George, and 
meeting the enemy on the borders of Lake Champlain, which (as the enemy appeared to be much 
fatigued by their long march, and it was to be presumed would move slow as soon as they were ad 
vanced such a distance as to conceive themselves out 
of danger) I conceived might still be practicable. I 
accordingly reassembled the militia, and, with the 
levies stationed at Fort Edward, and a detachment of 
Warner s regiment, crossed Lake George. But, though 
I had a force, superior to that of the enemy, advanced as far as Bulwagger s Bay, below Crown Point, 
the place at which the enemy embarked, within eight 
days after my leaving this place, I was so unfortu 
nate as to find (judging by the information of ourscouts, and by the appearance of the bushes and 
bark the enemy had prepared to hut themselves, but 
did not put up, and by other marks as well as the 
sailing of their vessels) we were about six hours too 
late. 

I would fain hope, however, that the attempt, though 
unsuccessful, may be attended with the good effect 
of deterring the enemy from a similar enterprise, as 
it will, at least, discover to them the danger which 
may attend it. I think it my duty to inform yourExcellency that, on my request, I was joined by a 
party of two hundred and forty of the militia of the 
Grants, under Colonel Warner and Major Allen, whose 
behaviour on this occasion, in every respect, was very 
agreeable to me. I beg your Excellency will pardon me in troubling you with this long detail, as I 
wish it only to be received as an apology for not 
succeeding in an attempt which I gave you reason to 
believe was practicable, and which undoubtedly might 
have been effected had I found matters in the train 
I had reason to expect. I have the honor to be, 
with the greatest respect and esteem, dear Sir, 
Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

GEORGE CLINTON.

FROM JOSEPH JONES ; IN CONGRESS. 

19 June, 1780. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have your favor of the 31st ultimo, in answer 
to my several letters ; and was then impressed with, 
and still feel great anxiety on account of, our public 
affairs. The present distress is to he ascribed, in 
great part, to the resolution not to issue any more 
bills of credit before a sufficiency of money is pro 
vided, and supplies procured, for the army. Had 
proper precaution been taken in these matters, and 
the new scheme of finance been ready for the public 
consideration, the determination not to increase the 
quantity of money, and the alteration introduced by 
the new system, would not have been so sensibly 
felt, or occasioned the distress, in the several depart 
ments, they have produced. From these, I think, we 
are nearly emerging, as the new money is coming 
into use in the several States, and will probably 
greatly relieve us. 

But, by these and several other proceedings, Con 
gress has been gradually surrendering, or throwing 
upon the several States, the exercise of powers they 
should have retained, and, to their utmost, have ex 
ercised themselves, until, at length, they have scarce 
a, powder left but such as concerns foreign transac 
tions ; for, as to the army, the Congress is at present 
little more than the medium through which the wants 
of the army are conveyed to the States. This body 
never had, or, at least, in few instances ever exer 
cised, powers adequate to the purposes of war ; and, 
such as they had, have been, from embarrassment 
and difficulties, frittered away to the States ; and it 
will be found, I fear, very difficult to recover them. 
A resolution passed, the other day, desiring the States 
to inform us what they had done upon certain requi 
sitions for some time past, that we might know what 
we had to rely on. This may probably serve as a 
basis for assuming powers, should the answers afford 
an opening. 

Other resolutions are now before us. By one of 
them, the States are desired to give express power 
for calling forth men, provisions, and money, for carrying on the war, for the common defence. Others 
go to the assumption of them immediately. The first, 
I have no doubt, will pass this body, but will, I ex 
pect, sleep with the States. The others, I believe, 
will die where they are ; for, so cautious are some 
of offending the States in this respect, a/ / gentleman, 
the other day, plainly told us, upon a proposition to 
order some armed vessels to search the/ vessels going 
out, to prevent the exportation of flour, though, if an 
embargo was laid in the Delaware, asj in this State, 
he consented to the measure, otherwise he never 
would agree to such exercise of power. 

The merchant bankers in this city are making 
generous exertions to procure and send forward to 
the army a supply of flour, and will afford us great 
help in that article. The Massachusetts Delegates 
read us letters, whereby it appears their State have 
raised four thousand men for the army, and are em 
bodying four thousand more, to be ready, if wanting. Gates, Weedon, and Morgan, are ordered to the 
Southern department. Five thousand militia are re 
quired from Virginia to join that army, and threethousand to be held in readiness from North Caro 
lina, four thousand, and two thousand to be held in 
readiness. Twenty-five hundred of the Virginia mili 
tia were to inarch yesterday. By our accounts, it 
would seem those States are somewhat roused from 
their slumber, but have rejected the scheme of finance 
of the 18th March last, which, I fear, will have a 
bad effect on the credit of the money of the other 
States that have agreed to the measure. 

Governor Jefferson has transmitted us a state of 
the Virginia troops, taken from the last returns, by 
which it appears we have, in the different corps, fourthousand and eleven men in service to the 30th Sep 
tember, and for the war, or longer period than the 
30th September next, including those captured in 
Charleston. This surprises me. But the fact appears 
to be so ; and where they are, or what is become of 
them, is strange. I cannot inform you whether ourLegislature have ordered a draft to fill up the defi 
ciencies, as we have no mail this week from the 
southward, it stopping at Annapolis, for want of a 
rider to bring it to this place, the late rider having quitted the business. AVith great esteem, I am, 
dear Sir, 

Your obedient, humble servant, 

JOSEPH JONES.

FROM JOSEPH REED. 

Philadelphia, 20 June, 1780. 

DEAR SIR, 

I have received your favor of the 16th instant, 
directing the march of the city light-horse, for which 
the necessary orders will be given, and they will 
proceed with all possible despatch. Upon the new 
plan of our militia, there are light-horse attached to 
the troops of every county. The short time since 
the plan has been adopted has not permitted a 
thorough execution; but, if your Excellency should 
be of opinion they would be specially useful, I shall 
endeavour to have them completed as soon as may 
be. The troop of the county of Philadelphia is al 
ready well mounted, armed, and in uniform. I do 
assure your Excellency every stimulus has been used 
to forward the recruits. According to information, 
they are chiefly selected, and only wait a proper 
equipment; but, as I found this was tedious in the 
country, I directed them to be sent hither, and they 
are now coming in. I am of opinion, if your Excel 
lency could spare a few officers, say five or six, pru 
dent and discreet, who could bear with the oddities 
and humors of the persons with whom they will 
have to do, it might forward the men; and, as it 
is proposed to set about a voluntary additional en 
listment, as soon as this is over, we are sanguineenough to believe some men might be had. For 
this purpose some clever sergeants would be of great 
service. 

The spirit, which your Excellency seems to wish, 
I think, is recovered beyond expectation. The loss 
of Charleston, like many other seeming misfortunes, 
may perhaps (heavy as it now appears) prove a real 
blessing to America, A measure has been set on 
foot here to establish a bank, which, from the unani 
mity with which it is espoused, seems likely to pro 
duce considerable advantages, and supplies to the 
army. It was at first constructed upon so narrow a 
scale as to meet with difficulties; but, being since 
enlarged, I hope will prove a more fruitful source of 
supply than the occasional expedients from time to 
time adopted. Whatever measure promotes the pub 
lic good, shall have my aid and concurrence, from 
whatever quarter it proceeds. 
The ladies of the place have also caught the happy 
contagion, and, in a few days, Mrs. Reed will have 
the honor of writing to you on that subject. It is 
expected she will have a sum equal to one hundred 
thousand pounds, to be laid out according to yourExcellency s direction (in the absence of Mrs. Washington) in such a way as may be thought most 
honorable and gratifying to the brave old soldiers 
who have borne so great a share of the burden of 
this war. I thought it best to mention it in this 
way to your Excellency, for your consideration, as it 
may tend to forward the benevolent scheme of the 
donors with despatch. I must observe, that the ladies 
have excepted such articles of necessity as clothing, 
&c., which the States are bound to provide. 

We have just heard that Mrs. Washington is upon 
the road to this city, so that we shall have the benefit of her advice and assistance here, and, if neces 
sary, refer afterwards to your Excellency. I am, with 
the greatest respect and regard, dear Sir, 

Your most obedient and very humble servant, 

JOSEPH REED, President,

FRANK EPPES TO GENERAL LEE.

Kemp s, 31 March, 1776. 
SIR, 

I congratulate you on your appointment and arrival, and shall 
immediately proceed to execute the commands I had the honor 
to receive this night. At present I can only say, that Lord 
Dunmore s intrenchment is near a quarter of a mile in length, 
running nearly in a straight course from cove to cove, including Tucker s Mills and bake-house, with about two acres of 
land, in which they keep their hospital and exercise the blacks, 
whose number is between two and three hundred. These, to 
gether with about forty regulars of the fourteenth regiment, the 
marines of the Liverpool, Otter, and sometimes the Roebuck, 
and the Tory volunteers of Norfolk, who may perhaps amount 
to near a hundred, compose Lord Dunmore s whole force, unless you include the sailors on board a fleet of seventy or eighty 
sail of small vessels, with a few large ones, whose numbers it 
is impossible to ascertain. 

The fleet are furnished with water from the distillery on oneside of the river, and Tucker s Mills on the other side; the 
former within two hundred yards of the Dunmore, and in con 
venient reach from the Otter; and the latter, included within 
the intrenchment, and under the command of the Liverpool and 
Otter, which have stationed themselves in the best manner for 
the protection of it. The ground near it is rather higher than 
the retrenchment, but has no shelter for near a half mile be 
fore you get to it, being an open old field. The depth of the 
ditch, through which the water runs, is above eight feet, the 
width uncertain. 

I cannot, as yet, learn the number of cannon his Lordship has 
mounted, nor how many men constantly reside within their lines. 
They are supplied with many conveniences from Portsmouth, 
and the Western Branch; and, if we had not continued at this 
post, the whole county of Princess Anne would have lain at 
their mercy, and the communication between Carolina arid the 
fleet have been opened, to the very great advantage of the lat 
ter. The scouting parties from this place have hitherto effect 
ually prevented on this side of the river, and if the 
same steps had been taken on the other side and on the West 
ern Branch, they would have been reduced to greater distress 
than they are at present. 

By an intrenchment, in the mouths of the cannon at the distillery, we might, perhaps, greatly annoy the enemy for a while, 
but there is no mode of preventing it on the other side of 
the river, without the possession of Tucker s Mills. In short, 
I do not think we can prevent them from watering with the 
force we have here. Besides the Liverpool, King Fisher, Otter, 
and Roebuck ships of war,, there are the Dunmore, the William, the Anna, ships of force, and a great number of armed 
tenders. If a raft could be privately constructed, we might do 
immense mischief to the crowd of vessels lying at Norfolk. 

I shall be able to give you a fuller account upon my re 
turn, which shall be with great expedition. There are many 
valuable effects belonging to the Tory prisoners in this county. 
I should be glad to receive some orders about them. In con 
sequence of a late act of Parliament, upon which the inclosed 
proclamation is founded, Lord Dunmore has seized upon all the 
vessels at Norfolk, whose owners are not on board, and con 
fiscated them to the King s use. There has been a very heavy 
firing yesterday and last night. I dare say above live hundred 
cannon in the Bay, or at sea. From the change of place, there 
seems to have been a smart pursuit. I sent out a party on 
horseback last night, who are not yet returned. 

I am, Sir, very respectfully, your most obedient servant, 

FRANK EFPES.

FROM GENERAL LEE TO GENERAL ROBERT HOWE, EDENTON, NORTH CAROLINA. 

Williamsburg, 5 April, 1776.
 
SIR, 

I had the pleasure of receiving yours the day before yes 
terday, and think myself very much flattered by the good opinion you have conceived of me. I wish you may never have 
reason to think you have formed it without foundation. I should 
have been extremely sorry had you put off your necessary 
jaunt to Carolina merely through attentions to me. Your presence there, at this time, must be of the greatest importance, 
and I fancy it will become every day more important. 

My own situation is extremely disagreeable from an uncertainty of the enemy s designs. I know not where to turn me, 
where to fix myself. I may be in the north, when, as Richard 
says, I should serve my sovereign in the west. I would wil 
lingly take a certain step, but, from the excessive prudence and 
economy of this Committee of Safety, am totally unprovided with 
the necessary materials. The distribution of their troops is like 
wise a masterpiece. I wonder they did not carry it still further, and post one or two men, by way of general security, in 
every individual gentleman s house. 

I beg, Sir, should Mr. Clinton land, and attempt to take 
post, that you will immediately inform me, by express, of his 
situation, circumstances, and force, as likewise of the state of 
your troops, regulars, militia, &c., of their numbers and quality, 
of their wants and deficiencies. Any assistance that we can afford yon, you may depend upon. I must apprise you that we 
have little or no cannon, and not a single tool for field works. 
How are you off in the article of intrenching tools? You can 
expect no arms. You will naturally ask what I mean by as 
sistance, with these exceptions. I mean, if the enemy make 
your Province their object, I will immediately march myself, 
with whatever troops can be spared. In the mean time, believe 
me, Sir, to be, with the greatest respect, 

Your most obedient and humble servant,

THE COMMITTEE OF SAFETY TO GENERAL LEE. 

Williamsburg, 10 April, 1776. 

The Committee of Safety, taking into consideration the state 
of this Colony, and supposing General Lee may wish to be 
fully advised of local circumstances, and with the steps which 
have been taken by the General Convention of this Colony, or 
the Committee of Safety under their appointment, respecting the 
army, have thought proper to represent, that the forces raised 
by the General Convention of Virginia, for the defence of this 
Colony, as well the two old regiments there raised as the seven 
battalions to be raised, were, by an ordinance of the Convention, put under the direction of the Committee ; and this Board 
was directed to provide for them arms, ammunition, tents, bed 
ding, clothing, provisions, and all necessaries, in such manner 
as the circumstances of this country would admit. The clothing is to be paid for by the soldiery ; all the rest to be furnished at the expense of the public. 

By a clause in this ordinance, founded on a hope that the 
whole nine battalions would be taken into Continental pay, it 
is ordained, " That the whole should be under the command 
of one Major-General, and two Brigadier-Generals, to be appointed by Congress, and the field and other officers to be appointed and commissioned by Convention," with a proviso, " That 
all appointments and commissions of Convention should become 
void, when Congress should commission the same officer, or 
appoint another in his stead." The Convention, also, considering the place of attack by the enemy uncertain, and knowing 
the whole coast from Norfolk to Alexandria on the Potomac 
equally exposed, were pleased to direct the stations of the troops 
as follows ; two regiments on the south side of James River, 
two between York and Rappahannoc Rivers, and two in the 
Northern Neck, with a proviso, " That on any emergency the 
Committee of Safety should have power to call them from those 
stations, but, so soon as the exigency ceased, they should be 
ordered back to their respective stations." 

In pursuance of this command of Convention, this Committee 
directed the rendezvous of the eight battalions (the ninth being raised for the sole defence of the Eastern Shore) at con 
venient places within the districts described, leaving it to the 
commanding officers of each battalion to station them at any 
place therein they should judge best for the service. And, in 
pursuance of the direction of Convention, this Committee madecontracts for victualling these battalions by the ration, at an 
agreed price, to be furnished at the particular stations, and varying in price according to the conveniency of each station. These 
contractors have accordingly laid in provisions, in proportion 
only to the number of troops allotted at such stations, and now 
serve all the troops. The Congress having as yet made no pro 
vision for such purposes. 

The Committee have also purchased clothing and necessaries 
to a very considerable amount, and stored them under the di 
rections of proper persons, as Commissaries of Stores at this 
place and at Fredericksburg, at the head of the Rappahannoc 
River, a place through which all stores from the northward 
must come, central with respect to our back country, whence a 
considerable quantity of linen is expected, and most convenient 
for supplying the two regiments in the Northern Neck, and oneon the south side of the Rappahannoc River. Out of these stores 
the whole eight battalions have been indiscriminately furnished 
with clothing and necessaries ; and even since it has been known 
that six of them have been taken upon the Continental esta 
blishment, the latter have also been paid out of our treasury? 
from necessity, to avoid any uneasiness through the want of a 
Continental fund here. 

This Committee, being advised that General Lee has been 
pleased to order the four northern battalions to this place, think 
it expedient to lay this short state of matters before him, (wishing to refer him to the ordinance of the Convention for his 
fuller information), with a view of learning from the General 
how far he expects this Board should be assisting in the departments heretofore assigned to this Committee by the Con 
vention, observing that all the contracts for victualling the troops 
must become void, so soon as the troops are finally removed 
from the particular stations. 

And we beg leave farther to observe, that the inhabitants 
of this Colony in general are badly armed, and that those in 
particular in and about the several stations, having spared their 
best arms to the soldiery intended for their immediate protec 
tion, will be more exposed than ever, and may be exceedingly 
alarmed, when the troops are called at a great distance from 
them, while the measures of the enemy, or their intended place 
of attack, are altogether unknown. This Committee beg General 
Lee to be assured, that they place entire confidence in his 
great military abilities, and sincerely congratulate the inhabit 
ants of this Colony on his acceptance of the chief command 
here, and will, as far as in their power, confine themselves to 
such a line of conduct as shall not interfere with his better 
judgment ; and therefore will most cheerfully cooperate with 
General Lee in every thing, in which he may think they can 
be of service; and to this end they wish to have a conference 
with General Lee upon the subject-matter of this representa 
tion, and upon all other occasions, when he shall judge it necessary.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMMITTEE OF SAFETY. 

Williamsburg, 10 April, 17 70. 

The Committee, taking under their most serious consideration 
a letter from Major-General Lee, urging the necessity of removing the inhabitants of Norfolk and Princess Anne counties from 
the neighbourhood of our enemy, together with several letters 
from the Secretary of State, lately intercepted, and other papers ; 
and having been repeatedly informed, upon oath, by every per 
son that has escaped from Lord Dunmore s ships and the fleet at 
Norfolk, that there is a constant intercourse kept up between the 
inhabitants on the Norfolk side, who furnish the enemy with pro 
visions, and give intelligence of all our measures, which conduct 
has likewise been experienced frequently and complained of by 
the foregoing, and many other pregnant proofs, with a full con 
viction of the inimical disposition of many of the inhabitants in 
the neighbourhood of our enemy; and, convinced that all others 
who may be well disposed, and really attached to the common 
cause, must be exposed to the depredations of the enemy ; 

Do unanimously Resolve and Order, That all the inhabitants 
of Norfolk and Princess Anne counties at present residing be 
tween the enemy and our posts at Great Bridge and Kemp s 
Landing, and in a direct line from Kemp s Landing to the ocean, 
be immediately removed to some interior parts of this Colony ; 
and that those who are unable to remove themselves, be assisted 
by the public. And, for the better effecting such removal, it is 
further ordered that all live stock of the said inhabitants be immediately taken possession of by our army, and removed to a 
place of safety for the use of the owners ; and such part thereof 
as the owners may be willing to part with, be purchased by the 
Commissaries for the use of the forces, except where it may 
happen to be the property of such as have already retired to, or 
may hereafter join, Lord Dunmore. 

This Committee, considering the intelligence contained in the 
aforementioned letters from the Secretary of State, and reflecting on the uniform policy of the British Court, and the measures 
lately adopted in North Carolina, are fully convinced that ourenemies are solely encouraged to make their wicked attempts 
upon such Colonies wherein they can expect the best assistance 
from the persons disaffected to the American cause ; and are of 
opinion that the most likely means of securing this Colony from 
such attempts, will be to remove all suspicious persons beyond 
the influence of the enemy. This Board do therefore order, that 
all persons within the counties of Norfolk and Princess Anne, 
who have heretofore repaired to Lord Dunmore s standard and 
taken the oath prescribed by him, who thereby may have a reli 
ance on them to aid his measures, do immediately remove them 
selves to some interior parts of this Colony, at least thirty miles 
from the enemy ; and, the better to enforce such removal, it is 
further ordered, that all the male slaves of such suspected per 
sons, above the age of thirteen, and also the like slaves of the 
persons within the limits aforedescribed, be immediately taken 
into the custody and safe-keeping of some officer at our posts in 
Norfolk and Princess Anne, to be conveyed to some place off 
navigation, and to be returned to the owners, after they shall 
have settled at some secure place, upon the further order of this 
Committee. 

Resolved, That a sum of money, not exceeding one thousand 
pounds, be advanced to Willis Reddick, James Murdaugh, and 
Andrew Meade ; and they are hereby empowered and requested 
to make proper provision for these necessary purposes, and, in 
general, to superintend this important business, and be assisting 
in the execution thereof, in the most humane manner the nature 
of the case will admit of. And it is earnestly recommended to 
all persons who can provide habitations for such persons so re 
moving, to give notice thereof in the Virginia Gazette as speed 
ily as possible.

GENERAL LEE TO GENERAL ARMSTRONG. 

Williamsburg, 10 April, 1776. 

It has ever been the opinion of General Lee, that instructions 
to an officer how to act, in a distant command, is impertinence 
and mere pedantry. He desires, therefore, Brigadier-General 
Armstrong to use his own judgment and discretion in his command, lie only requires that, immediately upon his arrival in 
South Carolina, he (General Armstrong) should make out returns 
of the strength, condition, and quality of the different corps, and 
in general of the force of the whole Province ; that he should 
likewise inform himself, not only of the strength of Georgia, but 
of the politics and disposition of the people, and transmit the 
substance of his information on these subjects to General Lee, 
directed to Brigadier-General Howe in North Carolina, who will 
forward them to head-quarters, wherever they happen to be. 

He hopes and recommends it to General Armstrong, that he 
will be jealous of ceding an inch of ground, as in slave countries 
so much depends on opinion, and the opinion -which the slaves 
will entertain of our superiority or inferiority will naturally keep 
pace with our maintaining or giving ground. For these reasons, 
Charleston must be defended with the utmost obstinacy. If the 
enemy appear on the coast of South Carolina, and show an 
intention of lodging themselves in that Province, the Brigadier is 
to send an express immediately to the Major- General, and he is 
to assure the inhabitants, as an encouragement to act with vigor, 
that a strong force shall be immediately marched to their assist 
ance. 



GENERAL LEE TO THE COMMITTEE OF SECRECY OF THE PRO 
VINCE OF NORTH CAROLINA. 

Williamsburg, 13 April, 1776. 
GENTLEMEN, 

I had yesterday the honor of yours of the 9th. The real 
ardor and public spirit of your Province, not only reflect great 
honor on its own character, but there is reason to think that 
your example will inspire others with that vigor and decision 
which are alone wanting to insure victory. Your resolution to 
raise a body of liglit-liorse is, in my opinion, most judicious. It 
is a species of troops without which an army is a defective and 
lame machine. I have proposed and urged it in this Province. 
They talk of adopting the measure, but nothing is as yet done. 
I could wish, Gentlemen, that your horses may be of the strongest sort, so that, on pressing occasions, a dragoon may be able 
to carry a foot soldier behind him. 

I am sorry you are so deficient in powder. I have wrote to 
Congress on the occasion, and hope soon to be able to supply 
you. As to arms, I believe it will be impossible to procure 
them, unless you have on the frontiers a sufficient number of 
rifles. For my own part, I like them even better for the batta 
lions than muskets, particularly if you can conciliate your men 
to the use of spears. I never had in my life any opinion of 
bayonets. My opinion may appear singular, but it is certain 
they never have been used, though we hear so frequently of marching with bayonets. For these reasons, I would propose that you 
should collect all the rifles possible. After having regulated the 
necessary business of this Province, I shall pay my respects, in 
person, to your Committee, and thank them, viva voce, for the 
good opinion they are pleased to express of me ; and am, Gentle 
men, your most obedient, humble servant, 

CHARLES LEE. 

P. S. It is of the utmost importance that you provide a suffi 
cient number of proper boats for the transportation of troops over 
your respective rivers. 



THOMAS BURKE, CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE OF SECRECY OF 
NORTH CAROLINA, TO GENERAL LEE. 

Halifax, 22 April, 1776. 
SIR, 

We think it our duty to inform you that the body of British 
troops, under the command of Cornwallis, supposed to consist of 
three thousand men, are to land at Little River, about thirty miles 
to the south of Cape Fear ; from thence to penetrate by the Lake 
Wiggaman into the interior parts of this Province, expecting a 
junction with the disaffected inhabitants, Highlanders and Regu 
lators, whose residence and influence are principally in that vi 
cinity. The Regulators and Highlanders, notwithstanding ourlate success against them, are by no means subdued. Upon the 
least encouragement of receiving support from Governor Martin 
and his expected friends, we doubt not they will again be in 
motion. 

An intestine enemy in our bosom, a large body of British 
troops expected upon our sea-coast, only two regular regiments 
yet embodied for the service of this Colony, our militia diffused 
through a large, extensive Province, and the great difficulty of 
drawing them to act together at a point, with a great scarcity of 
fire-arms, are circumstances which induce us to wish for yourpresence here immediately, and suggest the necessity of youraffording us assistance from the Province of Virginia with all 
possible expedition, as the troops from Britain are every hourexpected, and in all probability are now off this coast. Our mili 
tia are scarce recovered from the fatigue of their last campaign. 
You may, however, be assured that every thing may be expected 
from them, within their abilities, that the warmest attachment to 
the American cause and true spirit can inspire. Your presence 
would give them great confidence, and have a happy influence 
upon the whole military arrangements of this Colony. We have 
the honor to be, with great respect, Sir, 

Your most obedient, humble servant, 

THOMAS BURKE, Chairman. 



GENERAL LEE TO GENERAL MOORE. 

Suffolk, 23 April, 1776. 

SIR, 

I am at present occupied in clearing the country of the Tories. 
My perplexity with respect to the enemy s real design is, you 
may easily conceive, very considerable, since the overthrow of 
their plans by Colonel Caswell s victory. I cannot persuade my 
self that your Province will be their aim, but rather this or 
South Carolina. I am apt to think that their appearance at 
Cape Fear is rather a feint. However, I may be mistaken. In 
deed, I can alone act from surmise. 

If any further circumstances give you reason to believe that 
they really intend to make an impression in your Province, I 
beg you will inform me of it. You will likewise send me a 
minuie detail of your strength and your weakness, in what you 
are abundant, in what you are deficient. I will myself immedi 
ately join you, and bring with me what force you require, and I 
can procure. I am, Sir, 

Your most obedient, humble servant, 

CHARLES LEE. 



EDMUND PENDLETON, PRESIDENT OF THE COMMITTEE OF SAFETY, 
TO GENERAL LEE. 

Williamsburg, 5 May, 1776. 
SIR, 

I had the honor of laying your obliging favor of the 4th 
before the Committee of Safety, who are perfectly satisfied of 
your intention not to encroach on the civil authority, but to 
confine your operations to the proper line of military duty, of 
which you are so good a judge. On our parts, we beg leave 
to assure you, Sir, we shall be always ready to give you every 
necessary assistance in our power for accomplishing the great 
purpose we all have in view. When we reflect on the several 
reasons by you assigned for your proceedings at Portsmouth, 
we must approve of the whole of your conduct to those people ; 
it being one of the inevitable consequences of this kind of war, 
that legal modes of inquiry must yield to necessity, and what 
the public safety seems to require should be immediately done, 
even though some injury may arise to innocent individuals, to 
whom the community may render compensation when tranquillity 
is restored. 

On this last consideration, we request you will give directions 
to retain the molasses, salt, and other articles for the use of 
the public, and that, in the inventory thereof to be returned, 
each individual s property may be distinguished, as far as possible ; that, if in any future period they can satisfy the legis 
lature of their innocence (which, however improbable, is yet 
possible), the quantum of their loss may be ascertained. We 
are pleased that you confined the conflagration at present to 
the houses of a few of the most notorious offenders, since, al 
though the reasons you urge appear forcible for the destruction 
of the whole, it may give more general satisfaction to have the 
subject first discussed by the representatives of the people, to 
whom, in their approaching session, we will communicate yourfavor, and transmit to you their resolution thereupon. 
VOL. IT. 42 
"We are much obliged by the intelligence sent us respecting 
that arch-traitor, old Goodrich, who is so notorious an offender 
that we suppose there will be no difficulty in his conviction. 
We shall always have pleasure in keeping up a free and friendly 
correspondence with you ; and are, with great respect, Sir, yourmost obedient servants, 

EDMUND PENDLETON, 

For the Committee. 



GENERAL LEE TO DANIEL OF ST. THOMAS JENIFER, PRESIDENT 
OF THE COUNCIL OF SAFETY OF MARYLAND. 

Williamsburg, G May, 1776. 
DEAR SIR, 

I find that I am extremely censured, not only by your Board, 
but by a multitude of others, for my letter to Mr. Purviance, 
with respect to the seizure of Mr. Eden s person and papers. 
But I really think, when the circumstances are explained, that 
the censure will appear unjust, and that I was neither violent, 
assuming, nor precipitate. 

When the Secretary of State s letter to your Governor was 
put into my hands, I naturally concluded that, could we possess ourselves of all Mr. Eden s papers, the whole machinations 
of the Ministry might be discovered, that this discovery might 
enable us to prevent their effects, and perhaps defeat the whole 
plan. The possession of these papers could not be hoped for 
without previously securing his person, and, to accomplish this, 
the utmost secrecy and expedition were necessary. Now, Sir, 
as I imagined you had no troops at Annapolis to execute the 
purpose (but in this I find I was mistaken), and as I knew 
there were troops in readiness at Baltimore, and as there was 
no Continental General or other officer in Maryland, Mr. Purviance, Chairman of the Committee, on the spot where I had 
conceived troops alone to be stationed, occurred to me as the 
only person to whom I could with propriety and effect make 
application. Had I known, Sir, that a regiment or any troops 
were stationed at Annapolis, I should undoubtedly have addressed 
myself to you, as President of the Council of Safety. 

It is said, Sir, that Maryland was out of the district of my 
command ; that, consequently, to intrude myself into the busi 
ness and concerns of that Province was assuming and arrogant. 
I really conceive, Sir, that when the safety or very being of 
the whole community appears at stake, the part I have acted 
in this affair cannot with justice be esteemed arrogance. I did 
not presume authoritatively to order, but, as one servant of the 
public, earnestly to entreat and conjure another servant, who 
alone appeared to me to have the means in his hands, to take 
a certain step of the last importance to the public cause. I 
must repeat, Sir, that my reason for addressing myself to Mr. 
Purviance at Baltimore, proceeded entirely from my ignorance 
of there being any troops at Annapolis, and not (as I have 
been told has been thrown out) from any diffidence in yourvirtue and decision. I suppose the Committee of Safety here 
viewed it in the same light, for I read my letter to them, and 
it was approved of. 

In times like these, Sir, I conceive, that when we have re 
ceived sufficient evidences of any treasonable practices being 
carried on, and that when it appears to us that the imme 
diate seizure of a particular traitor s person may lead to discoveries on which the salvation of the State may depend, and 
when the utmost secrecy and expedition are necessary to the 
seizure of his person, it is the duty of a good citizen not to 
delay a single instant, if a single instant s delay may prevent 
the execution. This was the manner I thought it my duty to 
proceed in, in the case of Mr. "Wbrmeley. On the discovery of 
his correspondence with the enemy, I gave orders for the se 
curity of his person and papers, and then referred the affair to 
the proper tribunal, the Committee of Safety; the measure was 
so far from giving umbrage, or creating jealousy, that it met 
with their unanimous approbation. If this method is proscribed, 
at a juncture like the present, the great check on dangerous 
correspondence and conspiracies will be taken off. If councils 
are to be held previously to the seizure of any traitor s per 
son or papers, notwithstanding the strongest evidences against 
him, I am much mistaken if every traitor does not slip through 
your hands. 

I must now, Sir, conclude with assuring you, and the re 
spectable body over which you preside, that, if they suppose 
me capable of aiming or wishing to extend the military author 
ity, or trespass on the civil, they do me the most cruel in 
justice. Although I was bred in the army, I thank God the 
spirit and principles of the citizen were ever predominant; and 
I solemnly declare that, if I thought it possible I should ever 
be so far intoxicated by military command, as to harbour a wish 
injurious to the civil supremacy in all thing.-, I would now, 
whilst I retain my senses, beg leave to divest myself of my 
present office, and serve as a volunteer in the glorious cause 
in which I have embarked my person, fortune, and reputation. 
What I did in this affair, I did in the character of a common, zealous member of the community, not of an officer; what 
appeared irregular or offensive in the mode, I hope I have, 
explained to your satisfaction ; and I entreat, that it may be 
entirely attributed to a mistake, for which I am heartily con 
cerned, as it has prejudiced me in the opinions of men whoseesteem I am most ambitious of obtaining. 

I am, &c., 

CHARLES LEE. 



GENERAL LEE TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Williamsburg, 7 May, 1776. 

SIR, 

I find the part I have acted in the business of Mr. Eden 
has given great umbrage to the Council of Maryland. I take 
the liberty of inclosing to you a copy of my letter to that 
Board on the occasion, as I hope it will appear to the Con 
gress a fall explanation and justification of my conduct. I shall 
not trouble them any more on the subject. 

Five transports with troops are arrived at Cape Fear. I shall 
therefore set out on Thursday for Wilmington, by the way of 
Halifax. When we consider, Sir, the vast extent of the vulner 
able parts of this country, the numerous navigable intersecting 
waters, the multitude of slaves, that we have not more than 
five thousand regulars fit for duty in the Province, that of these 
five thousand not more than three are properly armed, that to 
arm them (defectively as they are) the Province has been drove 
to the necessity of disarming the minute-men ; I say, Sir, when 
these circumstances are considered, I shall appear, I hope, reason 
able in entreating the Congress to spare us, if possible, some 
battalions, and of those battalions which are best armed. If 
indeed our minute-men were properly furnished with muskets and 
ammunition, if our rivers were already secured in the manner 
I propose, I should think myself capable of baffling all their 
attempts with our present force ; but, situated as we are, my 
anxiety for the common safety obliges me to solicit a reinforce 
ment. 

A letter from one of your members informs me, that five 
thousand blankets and five thousand pair of shoes are on the 
road for the use of this army. They are much wanted. The 
number is. I believe, sufficient. We are, as I observed before, 
wretchedly in want of medicines, as well as of a director to 
our hospital. Dr. McClurg is a very able man, and univer 
sally esteemed qualified for the office. The pay of the regi 
mental Surgeons, established by Congress, is so low that it is, 
in this part of the world (where the common country practice 
of surgery is singularly lucrative) impossible to find capable 
men who will accept. But I am in hopes that the Convention will make such additions, out of the provincial purse, as 
to enable us to fill the commissions with proper and competent 
persons. 

Now I am on the subject of pay, Sir, I must beg leave to 
urge the necessity of considerably increasing that of the Engi 
neers. It is impossible that men qualified for this important 
office should be prevailed upon to serve on such miserable 
terms. You have no American Engineers. They must, of course, 
be foreigners, and foreigners expect, in their language de quoi 
manger ; that is, something which will enable them to eat and 
drink. Twenty dollars a month will not enable them to eat, 
drink, and wear linen, or indeed any kind of clothes. Besides, 
it must be considered that these gentlemen are obliged, by the 
nature of their duty, to make more journeys than other officers, 
that horses must be purchased and fed. that the expenses of 
travelling are, in these southern provinces, very high. For these 
reasons, and many others, the pay of Engineers ought to be, as 
it is in all other services, greater than that of other officers. 
Upon the whole, Sir, I really do not think that they ought or 
can do with less than forty dollars per month, and rations at 
least for their horses. On more moderate terms I am per 
suaded you cannot procure men equal to the task, as the corps 
is distinct, and not numerous. This necessary addition of pay 
will be an expense beneath the consideration of the Congress. 

Colonel Richard Henry Lee informs me, that it was not the 
intention of the Congress that Captain Innes s company should 
be reduced to make way for Arundel s, but that they should both 
be established. I think, Sir, it would be a useless expense. 
Captain Innes, who must, I am sure, be an excellent officer42 
in any other department, professed himself ignorant iu this 
branch ; his officers were equally ignorant. Arundel has got 
possession of the company, and, by his activity and knowledge, 
will, I am persuaded, make them fit for service. Indeed, toestablish an artillery company, Captain, subalterns, and non 
commissioned officers being entirely composed of novices, can an 
swer no end or purpose. It is my opinion, therefore, that, in 
stead of these two companies proposed, the addition of thirty 
or forty men to Captain Arundel s, and two subaltern officers, 
Avill not only be better, but that it promises more advantage 
to the service. 

Now I am on the subject of Captain Arundel, I beg leave 
to remind the Congress of what I mentioned with respect to 
his expenses on the road. There is one circumstance, of which 
I could wish to be ascertained. Is the expense of the defence 
of these rivers, that is, the construction of row-galleys, floatingbatteries, tenders, &c., to be brought to the account of the Con 
tinent or of the Province ? I wish to be ascertained on this 
head, because, if it is at the expense of the latter, I shall 
regularly propose to the Convention or Committee of Safety 
every scheme, which may be attended with expense, before it 
is entered upon. If the Quartermaster-General, or his depu 
ties, when they despatch any teams from Philadelphia with 
powder or other necessaries, were to purchase the horses through 
out for the Continental use, instead of hiring them, the saving 
would be considerable, for, in this country, the hire is intole 
rably dear, so great indeed, that I have ventured to order a 
number of teams to be purchased. 

I have just received a vague return of the forces of North 
Carolina, of their powder and cannon. It does not appear that 
they have, of effective regulars, properly armed, more than two 
thousand; of powder, more than two tons and a half; and, as 
to cannon, they are almost totally destitute. As the enemy s 
advanced guard, if I may so express myself, is actually arrived, 
I must, I cannot avoid detaching the strongest battalion we have 
to their assistance ; but I own I tremble, at the same time, at 
the thoughts of stripping this Province of any part of its in 
adequate force. I am puzzled to know how to direct my mo 
tions, from the uncertainty of the enemy s plan, but not dispirited, as I am confident that the Congress will afford me 
every relief in their power, and am not in the least diffident 
of the courage and zeal of the men and officers. I am, &c. 

CHARLES LEE. 
P. S. I have, as yet, heard nothing of Mr. Stabler, the En 
gineer. I ought, in fact, to have at least half a dozen, for we 
have a variety of posts to throw up, and there is not a man 
or officer in the army that knows the difference betwixt a 
chevaux-de-frise and a cabbage garden. I wish the Congress 
would indulge me with Mr. Smith, whom I know to be an 
able and active man. Massenbourg is a treasure. A little hurt 
in my hand obliges me to write by the pen of my secretary. 



GENERAL LEE TO EDMUND PENDLETON, PRESIDENT OP THE 
CONVENTION OF VIRGINIA. 

Williamsburg, 9 May, 1776. 
SIR, 

As I am obliged, by the arrival of the enemy, to repair to 
North Carolina, and am not less prompted by my zeal and affec 
tion for this Province, than obliged by my duty, to take every 
precaution for its safety before my departure ; on this principle, 
I beg leave to lay before the Convention the following measures, 
which I conceive to be necessary. 

1st. To devise some means for establishing a corps of caval 
ry ; without which, an army is so extremely defective in every 
part of the world, and in none more than in this, for reasons 
which it might be tedious to enumerate. 

2dly. Without delay to order some able pilots of every river 
to examine accurately the narrowest part of the channel of each 
river; what is the nature of the shoals which form these chan 
nels ; whether they are solid, firm sand, gravel, or rock ; what is 
the distance of the nearest part of the channel from either shore ; 
what is the nature of the shore, whether it is high or low ; for I 
am sanguine enough to hope, when these circumstances are ascertained, the navigation of most of the rivers may be shut up to 
the enemy, by means of batteries, either floating or fixed. 

Sdly. As these purposes cannot be effected without a large 
body of carpenters, smiths, and artificers of every sort, to esta 
blish some companies of them, subject to the military laws; for, 
without a coercive power, it is difficult, in this part of the world, 
to prevail on them to work. 

4thly. As I understand there are prodigious flocks of sheep 
and cattle on the islands near the Eastern Shore, and as my 
authority does not extend to whatever concerns property, that, 
you will order immediately all this stock to be transported to 
the continent; and, if this is impracticable, to kill them, as 
otherwise they must indisputably fall into the hands of the enemy. 

5thly. As the eastern counties are, from their great abundance of all the necessaries of life, so tempting objects to the 
incursions of the enemy, and as I understand there will be no 
difficulty in procuring good men, I would humbly propose to the 
Convention to augment Colonel Fleming s regiment to the same 
strength of numbers with the other battalions. 

I must now, Sir, beg leave to mention to the gentlemen of 
the Convention a very important matter of consideration ; no less 
than the preservation of the lives of your soldiers. The Continental allowance to Surgeons and Surgeons Mates of the regi 
ments is so miserably small, and at the same time the common 
country practice of surgeons is so very lucrative in this Province, 
that it is not possible to find men, qualified for the station, who 
will accept; and, as I cannot venture to propose to the Continental Congress the increase of the pay of the Surgeons of the 
whole army, merely because this increase is necessary in my 
division, I must submit it to the judgment of the Convention, 
whether such an addition as to bring up the pay of these gen 
tlemen to the original Provincial ordinance, will not be money 
well and necessarily expended. 

I am, Sir, with the greatest respect, yours, 

CHARLES LEE. 



GENERAL LEE TO EDMUND PENDLETON, PRESIDENT OF THE 
CONVENTION OF VIRGINIA. 

Wilmington, 1 June, 1776. 
Sill, 

The whole enemy s fleet have sailed from Cape Fear, the first 
division on Wednesday, the last yesterday ; but it is far from 
being ascertained whether they have steered their course to the 
northward or to the southward. The people here are all of 
opinion that Charleston is their object. For my own part, I do 
not see on what they ground this persuasion. However, as South 
Carolina is weaker in numbers than Virginia, I have ordered 
Muhlenberg s regiment, at a venture, to Charleston immediately ; 
as also a detachment of seven hundred men from this place. I 
have been also under the necessity of stripping this Province of 
sixteen hundred pounds of gunpowder, which I must replace from 
Virginia. 

As this Colony is now apparently no longer in danger, I shall 
send an express to stop your militia, as they may be wanted 
more in their own Province, and will now be an unnecessary 
expense. I shall myself set out for Charleston to-morrow, but at 
the same time confess, I know not whether I shall go to or from 
the enemy ; but if that Capital is really their object, their whole 
force will be collected in one point, their operations will be 
more regular, and, consequently, my presence, as Commander-inchief of the district, more requisite ; whereas, if Virginia is their 
object, it is possible and probable their operations may be merely 
predatory and piratical. If such are their intentions, I am 
confident that your own officers will have little or no occasion 
for the advice or assistance (such as they are) of, Sir, &c., 

CHARLES LEE. 

P. S. As I have not much time, and indeed there being no 
absolute necessity of troubling the Congress with any circum 
stances farther than expressed in this letter, I must entreat, Sir, 
that you will send a copy of it to the Congress. 



GENERAL LEE TO COLONEL THOMPSON, AT SULLIVAN S ISLAND. 

Charleston, 21 June, 1776. 
. SIR, 

It is a certain truth, that the enemy entertain a most fortunate 
apprehension of American riflemen. It is equally certain, that 
nothing can contribute to diminish this apprehension so infallibly, 
as a frequent ineffectual fire. It is with some concern, therefore, 
that I am informed that your men have been suffered to fire at 
a most preposterous distance. Upon this principle, I must entreat 
and insist that you consider it as a standing order, that not a 
man under your command is to fire at a greater distance than 
an hundred and fifty yards, at the utmost ; in short, that they 
never fire without almost a moral certainty of hitting their object. 
Distant firing has a double bad effect; it encourages the enemy, 



502 OPERATIONS IN VIRGINIA [1776. 

and adds to the pernicious persuasion of the American soldiers, 
namely, that they are no match for their antagonists at close 
fighting. To speak plainly, it is almost a sure method of making 
them cowards. 

Once more, I must request that a stop be put to this childish, 
vicious, and scandalous practice. I extend the rule to those who 
have the care of the field-pieces. Four hundred yards is the 
greatest distance they should be allowed to fire at. Transgression 
of this rule will be considered as the effect of flurry and want 
of courage. Those who are accused of transgressing will be pro 
ceeded against, as acting from these principles. I have, Sir, the 
greatest opinion of your good sense and spirit, and flatter myself 
that you will not only issue orders of restriction on this head, 
but that you will be attentive that they are vigorously put in 
execution ; and am, Sir, &c., 

CHARLES LEE. 

P. S. I am likewise informed that your men pass, without 
order or orders, to Long Island. Is this wise? Is it soldier 
like? Is it to show the enemy where our weakness is? 



GENERAL LEE TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Charleston, 2 July, 1776. 
SIR, 

I should have done myself the honor sooner of informing the 
Congress of the attack made by the enemy s squadron on Sulli 
van s Island, and their repulse, but conjectured that, by waiting 
a day or two, I might probably be furnished with the means of 
sending a more minute, full, and satisfactory account. My con 
jecture was right ; for, yesterday, five seamen made their escape, 
one of whom is a more intelligent fellow than commonly found 
amongst men of his level. Inclosed is a copy of their narrative. 
Some parts of it are, perhaps, too whimsical and trivial to merit 
the attention of Congress ; but I think it my duty to present it 
as it is, without adding or curtailing a circumstance. I think, 
Sir, I may venture to congratulate the Congress on the event. 
Not only the advantages must be considerable, but the affair re 
flects no small credit on the American arms. 



APPENDIX. AND SOUTH CAROLINA. 503 

On Friday, about eleven o clock, the Commodore, with his 
whole squadron, consisting of two line of battle ships and six fri 
gates (the rates of which are marked in the inclosed narrative) 
anchored at less than half musket-shot from the fort, and commenced one of the most furious and incessant fires I ever saw 
or heard. It was manifestly their plan to land at the same time 
their whole regulars at the east end of the Island, and of course 
invest the fort by land and sea. As the garrison was composed 
entirely of raw troops, both men and officers, as I knew their 
ammunition was short, and as the bridge by which we could 
reenforce or call off the troops from the Island was unfinished, 
you may easily conceive my anxiety. It was so great, that I 
was in suspense whether I should evacuate it or no. Fortu 
nately, whilst I was in this state of suspense, some ammunition arrived from the town ; and my Aid-de-camp, Mr. Boyd, returning 
from the Island with a flattering report of the garrison s spirits, 
I determined to support it at all hazards. 

On this principle, I thought it my duty to cross over to the 
Island, to encourage the garrison by my presence ; but I might 
have saved myself that trouble, for I found, on my arrival, they 
had no occasion for any sort of encouragement. I found them 
determined and cool, to the last degree. Their behaviour would, 
in fact, have done honor to the oldest troops. I beg leave, there 
fore, to recommend, in the strongest terms, to the Congress, the 
commanding officer, Colonel Moultrie, and his whole garrison, as 
brave soldiers and excellent citizens; nor must I omit, at the 
same time, mentioning Colonel Thompson, who, with the South 
Carolina rangers and a detachment of the North Carolina regu 
lars, repulsed the enemy in two several attempts to make a lodg 
ment at the other extremity of the Island. 

Our loss, considering the heat and duration of the fire, was in 
considerable. We had only ten men killed on the spot, and 
twenty-two wounded, seven of whom lost their limbs ; but, with 
their limbs, they did not lose their spirits, for they enthusiasti 
cally encouraged their comrades never to abandon the standard 
of liberty and their country. This, I do assure you, Sir, is not 
in the style of gasconading romance, usual after every successful 
action, but literally fact. I with pleasure mention the circum 
stance, as it augurs well to. the cause of freedom. At eleven the 
fire ceased, having continued just twelve hours, without the least 
intermission. 

What the enemy s intentions are now, it is impossible to 
divine. I am inclined to think they will (if they can repass the 
bar) bend their course to the Chesapeake or Hampton Bay. Per 
haps shame and rage may prompt their land forces to some 
attempt before their departure. On my part, I shall spare no 
pains to discover their intentions and to baffle their schemes. 

As Georgia is a district of the command with which you have 
honored me, I thought it prudent to request some of their mem 
bers to a conference with the President of this Province and 
myself. They accepted the invitation, and gave us great satisfac 
tion from their intelligence and good sense. Inclosed is the sub 
stance of their deliberation. 

The Province is certainly of the last importance to the common cause ; and the mode of protecting it, pointed out by these 
gentlemen, is, in my opinion, in all its parts, wise and necessary. 
They had conceived a notion that I had powers to augment theirestablishment. I assured them I had no such powers, but both 
Mr. Rutledge and myself gave it as our opinion that any ex 
penses, manifestly beyond their faculties, which they might incurin the common cause, would be repaid by the Congress ; and, in 
this persuasion, we ventured to encourage them to augment their 
cavalry, without loss of time, and make the proposed present of 
cattle to the Indians. Indeed, Sir, without a strong corps of 
cavalry, I do not see how it is possible to protect these Southern 
Colonies ; and with one thousand good cavalry, I think I could 
insure their protection. From the want of this species of troops, 
Charleston and its dependencies had certainly been lost, if the 
enemy had acted with the vigor and expedition we had reason to 
expect; but a most unaccountable languor and inertness on their 
part have saved us. 

If the scheme I proposed in Virginia had been approved and 
adopted, it would have been not only a security, but considerable 
economy. The forage was to have been the only expense. Now 
I am upon the subject, I cannot help mentioning, that I have 
been informed that the project has been considered by some gen 
tlemen as a sort of presumption in me in arrogating such a 
power; but I fancy the affair was not properly understood. I 
saw the immediate necessity of such a corps. I knew they could 
be raised immediately by these means, and at the same time I 
was given to understand, by several gentlemen of the Virginia 
Convention, that, should the Continental Congress disapprove of 
the expense (trifling as it was), there was little doubt of their 
Convention defraying it. But, in fact, the measure seemed necessary for the salvation of the Provinces, and not a day \vas to be 
lost, which I hope will fully justify my conduct; and I must 
beg leave to repeat my assertion, that, without cavalry, these 
Provinces cannot easily be defended. I wish some means could 
be devised of reducing East Florida to an American Province ; 
had I force sufficient, I should, with your permission, certainly 
attempt it. The advantages would be great and manifold. The 
augmentation of the Georgian cavalry I sincerely hope may be 
approved of by the Congress. Inclosed is the establishment and 
pay proposed for them. 

I think the terms not high. I shall now, Sir, conclude with 
.expressing the high satisfaction I have received from the zeal, 
activity, and public spirit of the gentlemen and inhabitants of this 
city and Province, from the President and Council down to the 
lowest order of the people ; and with assuring you, that I have 
not, in my military capacity, met with the least obstruction or 
difficulty; but that we have all worked, in concert and harmony, 
for the common good. I most earnestly request you will pay 
my respects to the Congress, and be persuaded, Sir, that I am, 
most entirely and devotedly, 

Your most obedient servant, 

CHARLES LEE. 

P. S. The Georgia troopers have, according to the establish 
ment of their Congress, fifty shillings sterling a man, and rations 
for themselves, but find arms, horses, and forage. The Captain s 
pay is ten pounds sterling per month ; the Lieutenants , six 
pounds ; the Quarter-master s, four pounds. 

Lord Dunmore has, I believe, at present with him only oneship of war. If any part of the Continental fleet should happen 
to visit Hampton Bay, at this juncture, it would defeat the whole 
scheme of the enemy s operations, at least for this campaign. 
But it is impossible to say how long his Lordship -may remain 
in this weak condition. 



GENERAL LEE TO MAJOR-GENERAL CLINTON. 

(Sent by a flag of truce.) 

Charleston, 3 July, 1776. 
SIR, 

A certain Walker was, by a most whimsical concurrence of 
YOL. n. 43 
wind and tide, hurried into the midst of our sentinels at the end 
of Sullivan s Island. He says he is master of a brig transport, 
and has the principal property in the vessel. As the man would 
probably be ruined by this odd accident, Mr. Rutledge, President, 
of the Province, and myself, would propose to you an exchange 
of this Walker for Ethan Allen ; or, if he is not at present in 
your fleet or army, for any two of the Connecticut privates who 
were taken prisoners with Allen. I confess honestly to you, Sir, 
that I am extremely desirous of redeeming Allen and his whole 
party. You, I am sure, are liberal enough to compassionate the 
sufferings of those who think, at least, they are engaged in a 
righteous cause. In this persuasion, I propose to you an ex 
change, man for man, of these people with the soldiers of the 
fourteenth, who were taken prisoners at the Great Bridge, in Yirgina. If, therefore, any of his party are at present in your cus 
tody, you will oblige me much in releasing them. I pledge my 
word and honor that an equal number of the fourteenth shall be 
sent from the place of their confinement to Lord Dunmore s 
camp, or wherever you think proper. 

I take the liberty to request you will accept of a small quan 
tity of fruit and vegetables, which, perhaps, in your situation, are 
not easily procured. This, I hope, you will consider as a testi 
mony of the regard I have for your personal qualities. The 
President joins with me in a high opinion of Mr. Clinton. 

I have, I am told, an intimate friend and comrade in yourcorps, Captain Primrose Kennedy, of the forty-fourth. I entreat 
you will assure him of my love and friendship, and send him a 
small portion of the fruit. Mr. Byrd, one of my Aids-de-camp, is 
the flag, who, I am confident, will be treated with all the respect 
due to his character. I am Sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

CHARLES LEE. 



GENERAL LEE TO ARCHIBALD BULLOCK, PRESIDENT OF GEORGIA. 

Charleston, 18 July, 1776. 
SIR, 

I feel most sensibly for the distressed situation of your Pro 
vince, and am determined to exert my utmost for its relief. I 
wish I had it in my power to spare you a larger force than, I 
am afraid, our present numbers will admit of; but, the instant 
we are assured the enemy will depart, I will order a battalion, 
or a number equal to a battalion, for Savannah. These, added 
to your own, will, I hope, be sufficient to protect the inhabitants 
from insult, and prevent your cattle from falling into the hands 
of these people, whose only crime is having been too long pa 
tient with administration. Two expeditions are now on foot; 
one, from this Province, against the lower Cherokees; another, 
against the Overhill Cherokees, from Virginia. I flatter myself 
that these two active operations will be a greater security to 
Georgia than could the largest defensive body. If the enemy 
stir southward, I shall myself march for your Province, with all 
the force I can muster; but I must regulate my motions by 
theirs. I most sincerely wish to your Province security and 
prosperity, and to yourself health and happiness ; and am, Sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

CHARLES LEE. 



GENERAL LEE TO JOHN RTJTLEDGE, GOVERNOR OF SOUTH CARO 
LINA. 

Charleston, 19 July, 1776. 
DEAR SIR, 

When I requested you to collect a number of boats for the 
transportation of troops to the Island, it was my intention to 
transport the greatest force I could possibly muster, to take the 
command in person, and endeavour to bring the enemy to a bat 
tle. Had we been victorious, there would have been an end of 
all their southern operations ; had we been defeated, it is true 
the loss would have been great, but not irreparable. Upon the 
whole, balancing the important consequences of victory, and the 
disadvantages of a defeat, I should have been justifiable in risking a general action ; but the number of boats collected would 
never have answered this purpose. They would contain, at the 
utmost, only twelve hundred men ; a body too small to be detached on such an errand. In fact, islands present such manifold 
advantages to the enemy over us, that we must never venture 
on them without an assurance or great probability of a complete 
victory ; because, if defeated, we have no possibility of retreat. 

As the post on Long Island, and all schemes of attack, are 
now ended, I may mention these things to explain the motives 
of my putting you to the trouble of collecting the boats ; the 
whole may be now undoubtedly returned. Captain tells 

me that, in this fleet of craft, there is one wooden boat, belonging to Major Caper?, which might, with little alteration, be con 
verted into an excellent galley. As we all agree a fleet of 
galleys may be of the greatest use, and that it should be esta 
blished without loss of time, I should think that every boat which, 
with little trouble, can be thrown into that form, ought to be 
purchased. I am, &c., 

CHARLES LEE. 

P. S. I wish you would turn your thoughts to the defence of 
Georgia, and what regiment can best be spared from your Pro 
vince for that purpose. 



GENERAL LEE TO EDMUND TENDLETON, PRESIDENT OF THE CON 
VENTION OF VIRGINIA. 

Charleston, 20 July, 1776. 

SIR, 

I think it my duty to apprise you that the enemy s fleet and 
army are now, in all human probability, on their departure from 
this coast ; their troops are all reembarked ; the Commodore s ship 
and the Solebay have repassed the bar ; the Experiment and five 
other ships alone remain on this side, but are preparing to pass 
the next tide. It is impossible to say where they will bend their 
course, but I am myself inclined to think Virginia will be the 
scene of their operations. The deserters, indeed, assert, that it is 
their intention to proceed to New York ; but it appears to me, 
from Lord George Germain s intercepted letter, that General 
Clinton is restricted to these southern Colonies. Perhaps they 
may try Georgia, the weakness of which Colony, and the expect 
ation of a powerful cooperation on the part of their Indian 
allies, may allure them; but, on the other hand, the distressed 
situation of their fleet and army, from the want of good water, 
fresh provisions, and vegetables, will make the temptation of the 
table which Lord Dunmore, I understand, has spread for them 
on Gwyn s Island, irresistible. Upon the whole, I must repeat 
that I am persuaded Virginia will be their object. I hope and 
make no doubt, Sir, that you will be prepared for their recep 
tion. 
I think it necessary, for the common service, to inform you 
that a corps of at least fifteen hundred men will be assembled 
on the Cherokee line in less than three weeks from the present 
date. This number is supposed to be adequate to the end pro 
posed; that is, the destruction of the crops of the Lower Nation, 
and of course striking a necessary terror into the minds of the 
other nations. I mention this, as I apprehend the expedition pro 
jected against the Overliill Cherokees, from your Province, may 
have some dependence on the measures of the Carolinas against 
the Lower Nation. But although, being ignorant of the geogra 
phy and circumstances of the country, I speak in the dark with 
regard to the relation which one expedition may have with the 
other, the informing you of the number of the Carolina corps, 
and the time they may be expected to enter the enemy s country, can be of no less service. As soon as I can be ascertained 
of the enemy s designs, I shall set out for the point of action, in 
hopes to render all the service in my power to the place at 
tacked, as well as the common cause. 

I am, Sir, with the greatest respect, 

CHARLES LEE. 



SIR HENRY CLINTON TO GENERAL LEE. 

Off Charleston Bar, 22 July, 1776. 
SIR, 

On my return to the fleet, I found a letter from you by a 
flag of truce, with some refreshments you were pleased to send 
me ; in return for which, I must beg your acceptance of a cask 
of porter and some English cheese. 

I have made inquiries concerning the person mentioned in 
your letter, who, it seems, has occasioned this correspondence be 
tween us, but can learn nothing further about him than that he 
is not a master of a vessel, as he has represented himself to 
you ; and you will have been already informed, by Mr. Byrd. 
that Ethan Allen, and those that were with him, are gone to 
the northward. I am, Sir, 

Your most humble servant, 

HENRY CLINTON. 

1776. 1776. GENERAL LEE TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Savannah, 21 August, 1776. 
SIR, 

Your letter, with the thanks of the Congress, reached me at 
Petersburg. The approbation of the freely chosen Delegates of a 
free and uncorrupt people, is certainly the highest honor that a 
man of any sentiment can be ambitious of; and I shall consider 
it as a fresh stimulus to excite my zeal and ardor in the glori 
ous cause in which I am engaged. May the God of Righteous 
ness prosper your arms in every part of the Empire, in propor 
tion to the justice with which they were taken up! Once more 
let me express the high satisfaction and happiness I feel in this 
honorable testimony ; and once more let me assure the United 
States of America, that they cannot meet with a servant, what 
ever may be his abilities, animated with a greater degree of 
ardor and enthusiasm for their safety, prosperity, and glory. 

The present state of this Province, its strength and weakness, 
I shall transmit to the Board of War, according to the directions 
I have received. Be persuaded. Sir, that I am, with the greatest respect, &c., 

CHARLES LEE. 



No. II. 

OPERATIONS OF THE NORTHERN ARMY IN OPPOSING THE EXPEDITION UNDER GENERAL BURGOYNE. 

GENERAL ST. CLATR TO GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Ticonderoga, 25 June, 1777. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I informed you yesterday, that an encampment of the enemy 
had been discovered at Gilliland s Creek. Last night two of their 
vessels came up to Crown Point, and this morning there are 
seven lying at that place. The rest of their fleet is probably but 
a little lower down, as we hear their morning guns distinctly at 
different places. They have also debarked some troops, and en 
camped upon Chimney Point. Whether they have landed at 
Crown Point, or not, my scout-boat did not discover, not daring 
to venture far enough down the lake, on account of the shipping; 
but I have sent out a scout on this side, which, I doubt not, will 
bring a just account of their situation. 

I cannot help repeating to you the disagreeable situation we 
are in ; nor can I see the least prospect of our being able to defend the post, unless the militia come in. And should the enemy 
protract their operations, or invest us, and content themselves 
with a simple blockade, we are infallibly ruined. 

I have thoughts of calling for the Berkshire militia, which are 
nearest to us, and will probably be the most alert to come to ourassistance, because they are in some measure covered by this 
post; but on that I shall consult the other General Officers. This, 
however, is clear to me, that we shall be obliged to abandon this 
side, and then they will soon force the other from us; nor do I 
see that a retreat will in any shape be practicable. Every thing, 
however, shall be done that is possible to frustrate the enemy s 
designs. But what can be expected from troops ill armed, naked, 
and unaccoutred ? I shall write you again as soon as the scout 
returns ; and am, dear General, 

Your most obedient, humble servant, 

ARTHUR ST. CLAIR. 



BROCKHOLST LIVINGSTON TO GOVERNOR LIVINGSTON.* 

Ticonderoga, 3 July, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

I wrote you on the 30th ultimo, advising you of the approach 
of the enemy. On the 1st instant the second division of their 
army arrived, in forty bateaux, about twenty men in each, and 
landed on the eastern shore of the Lake, opposite the Three-Mile 
Point. Yesterday they received a third reinforcement, in sixty 
bateaux. They have done little yet of any consequence, but con 
tinue playing their old game with the savages. Yesterday, in the 
afternoon, a party of these, with some Canadians and a few regu 
lars, in the whole about two hundred and fifty, under the command of Captain Frazer, of the forty-seventh, attacked our picket 
guard of fifty men, and drove them in ; then advanced, and for a 
short time kept up a scattering fire on the French lines. Ourtroops behaved with great coolness and resolution, and, after a 
few shots, made them retire to the woods. The loss the enemy 
sustained in this little brush is uncertain. We had one Lieu 
tenant and five privates killed, and a Lieutenant and seven men 
wounded. These skirmishes are of infinite service to our troops, 
who are in general raw and undisciplined. They serve as prepa 
ratives to an action of the last importance, which we have rea 
son hourly to expect. 

Two Hessians have deserted to us, both very intelligent fel 
lows. They agree that Burgoyne commands the army, and, under 
him, General Riedcsel the German forces. Carleton has staid 
behind as Governor of Quebec and General of the troops in Ca 
nada. They have brought all the Hessians with them ; in the 
whole, seven regiments and one battalion, besides four companies 
of dragoons. Their regiments consist in general of six hundred 
men. Their dragoons are not mounted, but come in expectation 
of getting horse at this place. Their supply of provisions is very 
short, from which it appears they mean a coup de main, and not 
a siege. 

We are daily receiving additions to our strength. Colonel 
Warner is expected to-day .with six hundred Green Mountain 
Boys. We also hourly look for General Schuyler, with a large 
body of militia from below. The spirits of our men were much 
raised yesterday with an account of a signal victory gained by 
General Washington over the enemy. We fired thirteen guns as 
a feu de joie on the occasion, just as we perceived a reenforcement of the enemy coming up. 

To-morrow we shall give them a salute of the same kind, being the anniversary of the ever-memorable 4th of July, 177G, on 
which day we broke off all connection with slavery, and became 
the free and independent States of America. 

In a letter of the 2Gth ultimo, I told you of my being a 
patient in the General Hospital. I have now the pleasure to in 
form you my complaint is removed, and my health perfectly 
restored. In the absence of General Schuyler, I have the honor 
of acting as Aid-de-camp to General St. Clair. You know his 
abilities too well to be informed of them by me. He is cool and 
determined, ever vigilant, and unruffled by every appearance of 
danger. I flatter myself with the hopes of announcing to you, in 
a few days, the welcome news of the total defeat of the enemy. 
I am, dear Sir, with every sentiment of esteem and affection, 
Yours, sincerely, 

BIIOCKHOLST LIVINGSTON. 



GENERAL ST. CLAIR TO GENERAL SCHUYLER. 

Dorset, 8 July, 1777, nine o clock. 

DEAR SIR, 

About an hour ago, I received your favor of yesterday. I 
wrote you from Ticonderoga the night before we left it, to 
inform you that I intended to march to Skenesborough by the 
way of Castleton, and from thence to Fort Edward ; but when I 
got to Castleton I found the enemy were in possession of Skenes 
borough, which obliged me to change my route. 

On the march to Castleton, we fell in with a party commanded 
by Captain Frazer, who had been collecting cattle in the country. 
These were immediately dispersed, and a few prisoners taken ; 
but, being reenforced by a strong detachment from Ticonderoga, 
they attacked, in the morning, the rear-guard of our army, who 
had imprudently stopped six miles short of the main body, and 
were, I believe, rather surprised ; notwithstanding which they madea very obstinate defence, and, I have good reason to think, killed 
and wounded a great number of the enemy. As they were at 
too great a distance for me to support them, I sent orders to 
Colonel Warner, who commanded the party, in case he found 
himself too hard pressed, to retreat to Rutland, and join me. He 
is not yet come in, though I have heard that he is coming in 
with about a hundred men; and a great part of the other regi 
ments, except Hall s, have already joined us. 

I am in great distress for provisions. If I can be supplied at 
Manchester, I shall proceed directly for Fort Edward, or Sara 
toga, as circumstances may direct; if not, I shall be obliged to 
go to Bennington. I account myself very happy in effecting this 
retreat, as the loss of the army, small as it is, would have been 
a blow that this part of the country would have felt severely, 
and that must inevitably liave happened in a very few days. 
Adieu, my dear General ; I hope to see you soon, or things in a 
better train. 

I am, Sir, your very humble servant, 

ARTHUR ST. CLAIR. 
1776. BROCKIIOLST LIVINGSTON TO GOVERNOR LIVINGSTON. 

Fort Edward, 17 July, 1777. 
DEAR SIR, 

My last was on the 12th. In that I acquainted you with the 
evacuation of Ticonderoga, and the consequences resulting there 
from. I have the pleasure now to inform you that General St. 
Clair has joined us with his army. General Nixon s brigade is 
also arrived. Our force now, in Continental troops, is two thou 
sand five hundred. The militia are about two thousand. With 
these is an army of six thousand regular disciplined troops to be 
opposed. The probability of success, under these circumstances, 
I leave you to judge of. A stand is to be made about threemiles below this, at a place called Moses Creek, there being some 
advantageous heights to fortify. For my own part, I trust more 
to the woods for security than any fortresses we can raise. The 
enemy scarcely ever attack us in our works. "When they do, they 
generally succeed. 

General Burgoyne, finding it almost impracticable to come by 
Wood Creek (the passage of which we had obstructed by felling 
trees into it), has returned to Ticonderoga, in order to come by 
the way of Fort George. For this purpose they are carrying their 
bateauxs from Lake Champlain into Lake George. We have 
been so fortunate as to get off all our stores from Fort George, 
which were very considerable ; and yesterday the garrison left it, 
after setting fire to the Fort, Hospital, Barracks, and other buildings. In removing our stores we left only two wagons, which 
were cut off by a scout of Indians. 

We have no news from the westward, since my last. General 
Johnson has called a meeting of Indians, with intent, no doubt, to 
persuade those who are our friends to remain neutral, and per 
mit him to pass through their country. General Burgoyne, on 
the back of his proclamation, has sent a summons to the people 
of the Grants to meet Governor Skene at Castleton, to be there 
acquainted with the terms on which they are to hold their pro 
perty ; and threatening with immediate death all who refuse their 
attendance. General Schuyler has sent them an address in an 
swer to this. Copies of both, and also of the proclamation, I will 
send you as soon as I can find time to make them out. They 
begin to dispense their protections in great numbers. Those who 
take them, and are discovered, we send immediately to jail. I 
shall be punctual in transmitting you every intelligence of conse 
quence, and shall be happy in hearing from you in return. 
I am your affectionate son, 

BROCKHOLST LIVINGSTON. 



BROCKHOLST LIVINGSTON TO GOVERNOR LIVINGSTON. 

Fort Edward, 21 July, 1777. 
DEAR SIR, 

Inclosed you will receive copies of Mr. Burgoyne s proclama 
tion, his summons to the people of the Grants, and General 
Schuyler s answer thereto. Few occurrences of moment have 
transpired since my last of the 17th. Yesterday we received a 
flag from Skenesborough, by which Mr. Burgoyne was so polite 
as to return General Poor s baggage, and send home a prisoner 
or two on parole. The flag brought a letter from Colonel Skeneto General Schuyler, desiring a personal conference with him on 
public affairs. The General, in answer, told him he could not 
open a correspondence in a public character with him while his 
superior officer commanded at Skenesborough ; that he should 
always be willing to receive flags from General Burgoyne, or the 
officer commanding any detachment of the army ; and that, if 
they were desirous of a conference, they should appoint an officerto hold it, and he would send one of equal rank on his side to 
meet him. 

An Indian scout of ours returned this morning, and brought 
with them five prisoners. The enemy, not knowing we had In 
dians in our service, were decoyed, thinking them their own. 
The prisoners were taken near Skenesborough. They inform 
that the enemy are cutting a road to Fort Anne to bring up 
their cannon, and mean an attack on this place. I fancy they 
will find the game gone, it being the General s intention to move 
to a place five miles below this. Our strength is considerably 
reduced since my last, a great part of the militia being dismissed 
to reap their harvests. They were a most disorderly set, and 
deserted by whole companies. 

Sir John has done little at the westward. Some of his sava 
ges scalped a Captain and killed a few men belonging to Gansevoort s regiment, at Fort Schuyler. I shall be happy in receiving

516 OPERATIONS OF [1777 

GENERAL SCHUYLER TO GENERAL LINCOLN. 

Saratoga, 31 July, 1777. 
DEAR SIR, 

Colonel Warner is on the Grants, with a small body of Continental troops and some militia, and expects to be reinforced in a 
day or two by General Stark, with a body of militia from New 
Hampshire. 

You will please to repair to Manchester, the place where the 
troops above mentioned are collected and collecting, and take the 
command of the whole. As General Burgoyne is advancing 
towards us, and as a movement of a body of troops from the 
Grants towards Skenesborough will doubtless much embarrass 
him, and will certainly oblige him to have a considerable force 
at that place, you will move towards it, if the troops you should 
find there, or those that may join, are in such numbers as that 
you can do it without risking too much. 

You will please to advise me, from time to time, of your situ 
ation and force, that I may be enabled to direct your future 
operations, according to what information I may get of the enemy s intentions. It is impossible to be more explicit in the present state of affairs. Events may arise, to which these orders 
could not possibly apply; you will, therefore, consider them as 
merely discretionary, and exercise your own judgment as contin 
gencies may arise. 

I am, dear Sir, with great esteem and regard, 

PHILIP SCHUYLER. 



GENERAL LINCOLN TO THE COUNCIL OF MASSACHUSETTS. 

Bcnnington, 10 August, 1777. 
GENTLEMEN, 

From a representation of the officers, and from my own observation, I find the men sent here from the county of Worcester, 
under the command of Colonel Gushing, left their homes in such 
haste, that they are by no means prepared to remain in camp 
any considerable time, and many of them had no opportunity to 
make that provision for their families left behind, which they 
would have done had they considered they were to have been 
long detained. General Schuyler hath repeatedly, in the most 
pressing terms, urged that all the troops in the Grants, excepting 
one small regiment, should join him. Colonel Cushing s regiment, 
excepting some who have deserted, are this day to march for 
Stillwater, which most of them cheerfully undertake, notwithstanding their peculiar situation. I hope that, as early as men can be 
raised for a time limited, these will be discharged. This, as they 
come out upon an alarm, they do expect, and I am sure it will 
give quiet, and I think, on the whole, much promote the general 
interest. 

The enemy have left the Grants. They collected their whole 
force at Fort Edward, and are moving down, and seem deter 
mined to possess themselves of Albany. I hope they will meet 
with a check before they reach it; I presume they will, if the 
militia expected arrive in time. There never was an opportunity 
when we could act with so great a probability of success against 
them as the present, for they have penetrated, and are penetrating far into the country, and have left a very naked and unco 
vered rear ; therefore, never a greater call for the exertions of 
the people. 

I am very sorry that I am obliged to inform your Honors, that, 
notwithstanding the evident pressing necessity for men at Stillwater to support our brethren there, a number of Colonel Cushing s regiment left it, on finding the enemy had quitted the 
Grants, and have returned or are returning home, contrary to 
the orders and advice of their officers. 

They pretend to say, in their own justification, that they came 
out on an alarm, for a particular purpose, namely, to oppose the 
enemy on the Grants ; and that, as Burgoyne has withdrawn his 
troops from that quarter, they are no longer held. Would it not 
be best, whenever they are ordered out, to limit the time of their 
service, and prevent, if possible, their entertaining an idea that 
they are bound to act in any one of the United States rather 
than another? 

I am, &c., 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 



GENERAL BURGOYNE TO LIEUTENANT-COLONEL BAUM. 

Near Saratoga, 14 August, 1777. 
SIR, 

The accounts you have given me are very satisfactory, and I 
VOL. n. 44 
1776. doubt not every proceeding under your direction will be the 
same. I beg the favor of you to report whether the route you 
have marched will be practicable with a large corps of cannon, 
without repair, or with what sort of repair. The desirable cir 
cumstance for your corps is, at present, to possess Bennington ; 
but should you find the enemy too strongly posted, and maintaining such a countenance as would make a coup de main hazard 
ous, I wish you to take such a post as you can maintain till you 
hear further from me ; and upon your reports and other circum 
stances, I will either support you in force or withdraw you. 

You will please to send to my camp, as soon as you can, wa 
gons and draught-cattle, and likewise such other cattle as are not 
necessary for your subsistence. Let the wagons and carts bring 
off what flour and wheat they can, that you do not retain for the 
same purpose. I will write to you in full to-morrow in regard to 
purchasing horses out of the hands of the savages. In the mean 
time, let them be assured that whatever you select from them, fit 
to mount the dragoons, shall be paid for at proper price. 

I am, &c., 

JOHN BURGOYNE. 



GENERAL ARNOLD TO GENERAL GATES. 

German Flats, 21 August, 1777. 
DEAR GENERAL, 

Your favor of the 19th instant was delivered to me last evening, and I am happy to hear that you are well and have joined 
the army. I beg leave to congratulate you on our late success 
over the enemy by the troops commanded by General Stark. I 
make no doubt it will have a happy effect. 

I leave this place this morning with twelve hundred Continental troops, officers included, and a handful of militia, for Fort 
Schuyler, which is still besieged by a number equal to ours. 
Nothing shall be omitted that can be done to raise the siege. 
You will hear of my being victorious, or no more ; and, as soon 
as the safety of this part of the country will permit, I will fly to 
your assistance. 

General Herkimer died yesterday. I will make your compli 
ments and return your thanks to the other gentlemen when I 
have the pleasure of seeing them. 
I am credibly informed that General St. Leger has sent to 
General Burgoyne for a reinforcement. I believe it will not be 
in his power to spare them, except they have marched before the 
late action, which may be worth inquiring into. 

I am, &c., 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 



GENERAL ARNOLD TO GENERAL GATES. 

Mohawk River, ten miles above Fort Dayton, 

five o clock, P.M., 23 August, 1777. 
DEAR GENERAL, 

I wrote to you the 2 1st instant from German Flats, that, from 
the best intelligence I could procure of the enemy s strength, it 
was much superior to ours. At the same time I inclosed you a 
copy of the resolutions of a Council of War, and requested you 
to send me a reinforcement of one thousand light troops. As 
the enemy had made their approaches within two hundred yards 
of the Fort, I was determined, at all events, to hazard a battle 
rather than to suffer the garrison to fall a sacrifice. This morning I marched from the German Flats for this place. The ex 
cessively bad roads, and necessary precautions in marching through 
a thicli wood, retarded us so much, that we have but this moment 
reached this place, where I have met with an express, with the 
inclosed letter from Colonel Gansevoort, acquainting me that the 
enemy had yesterday retired from Fort Schuyler with great precipitation. I am at a loss to judge of their real intentions, whe 
ther they have returned home, or retired with a view of engaging 
us on the road. I am inclined to the former, from the accounts 
of the deserters, and from their leaving their tents and a consi 
derable baggage, which our people have secured. 

I shall immediately detach about nine hundred men, and make 
a forced march to the Fort, in hopes of coming up with their 
rear, and securing their cannon and heavy baggage. My artil 
lery, tents, &c., &c., I shall leave here. The bateaux, with the 
provisions, follow me. As soon as the security of the post will 
permit, I will return with as many men as can be spared. As I 
came down in bateaux, I shall be able to make despatch. I have 
sent an order for the light troops, if you have sent any, to return 
immediately, and the militia to go home. 

I am, &c., 

BENEDICT ARNOLD. 
1776. GENERAL LINCOLN TO THE COUNCIL OF MASSACHUSETTS. 

Bennington, 25 August, 1777. 
GENTLEMEN, 

The evening before the last, I received a letter by express 
from General Gates, desiring me to meet at head-quarters, nearHalf Moon, yesterday morning, where General Clinton was also 
desired to attend, to confer upon a plan of our future operation. 
I met them, and returned here between two and three o clock 
this morning. 

The militia from the State of Massachusetts, and others, are to 
assemble in the Grants, where, probably, they will act for a time. 
It is General Gates s earnest desire that those of them who are 
to serve to the end of November may be forwarded here as soon 
as possible. To his request you will give me leave to subjoin my 
most serious solicitations, that every vigorous exertion to forward 
the troops with rapidity, in the power of the Council, may be 
adopted ; for, in a very few days, if they are not here, the operations of the main body of the northern army will l&gt;e delayed. 
I need not represent the many ill consequences, which may, and 
probably will take place, consequent thereon. 

The militia from the county of Worcester, called for by General Stark, are coming into camp. I am sorry they did hot, on 
the road, hear that I requested them to return and urge on the 
three months men ; for thos$ who come out on the alarms cannot 
remain long in camp, and while they are out, the counties they 
respectively belong to will find it difficult to raise their threemonths men. That consideration hath induced to suffer them to 
return. 

I hear that to-morrow I may expect five companies of the 
three months men. As soon as they arrive, I shall discharge the 
whole of Colonel Cushing s ; for the discontent among them is so 
general that they will be of very little service here if they re 
main. One company of them left the camp the day before yes 
terday ; some left us yesterday ; some, to day ; others, I hear, 
intend to leave us on the morrow. My situation at present is 
truly disagreeable ; for what can make a man feel more so than 
to be accountable for the conduct of troops who do not hold them 
selves under obligation to obey ? I expect matters will soon be 
in a better state. 

I am, &c., 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 
GENERAL ARNOLD TO GENERAL GATES. 

German Flats, 28 August, 1777. 
DEAR GENERAL, 

The 24th instant, in the evening, I reached Fort Schuyler, but 
too late, after so fatiguing a march, to pursue the enemy that 
evening. Early the next morning, a detachment of five hundred 
men followed them. Soon after, a heavy rain came on, which 
obliged them to return, excepting a small party, who went to 
the Oneida Lake, where they arrived just in time to see the 
last boats of the enemy going off. The 26th proved a rainy day, 
so that it was impossible for the troops to move until the evening, when I sent off Colonel Livingston s and Colonel Jackson s 
regiments. Yesterday, Bailey s and Wesson s left Fort Schuyler, 
and arrived here last evening. The greatest despatch is made in 
getting their boats over the Falls. 

You may depend on my joining you as soon as possible with 
my detachment, about twelve hundred men. Few Indians will 
be with me. The Oneidas and Tuscaroras, of all the Six Na 
tions, are our only friends. The Commissioners have frequently 
told them that they wished them to observe a strict neutrality, 
and that they would never ask them to take up arms. I found 
their head men determined to follow the advice of the Commis 
sioners ; and therefore I did not urge the young men to join me, 
though I am told by Mr. Deane that most of them may be in 
duced to do it. I have despatched a messenger to them, acquainting them that you wish to see them immediately ; and that, as 
you are a warrior, they might naturally judge of the subject on 
which you would speak to them. 

I have left Gansevoort s and Van Schaick s regiments, consisting of seven hundred men, at Fort Schuyler. One company of the 
latter garrisons Fort Dayton ; and a second, Fort Johnson. They 
are supplied with two months provisions, and a good store of 
ammunition. 

I believe there is nothing to be feared from the enemy in this 
quarter at present. I have made your compliments and doneyour message to Colonels Gansevoort and Willett. 

I am, &c., 

BENEDICT ARNOLD.

GENERAL BURGOYNE TO GENERAL GATES. 

Head-Quarters of the King s Army, 
upon the Hudson River, 30 August, 1777. 
SIR, 

Major-General Riedesel has requested me to transmit the in 
closed to Lieutenant-Colonel Baum, whom the fortune of war put 
into the hands of your troops at Bennington. 

Having never failed in my attentions towards prisoners, I can 
not entertain a doubt of your taking this opportunity to show me 
a return of civility ; and that you will permit the baggage and 
servants of such officers, your prisoners, as desire it, to pass to 
them unmolested. 

It is with great concern I find myself obliged to add to this 
application, a complaint of the bad treatment the Provincial sol 
diers in the king s service received after the affair at Bennington. 
I have reports, upon oath, that some were refused quarter, after 
having asked it. I am willing to believe that this was against 
the order and inclination of your officers ; but it is my part to 
require an explanation, and to warn you of the horrors of a re 
taliation, if such a practice is not, in the strongest manner, discountenanced and reprehended. 

Duty and principle, Sir, make me a public enemy to the Ame 
ricans who have taken arms ; but I seek to be a generous one ; 
nor have I the shadow of resentment against any individual, who 
does not induce it by acts derogatory to those maxims upon 
which all men of honor think alike. 

Persuaded that a gentleman of the station to whom this letter 
is addressed, will not be comprised in the exception I have 
made, 

I am, personally, Sir, &c., 

JOHN BURGOYNE. 



GENERAL FRASER TO GENERAL GATES. 

1 September, 1777. 
SIR, 

I have it in charge, from his Excellency Lieutenant-General 
Burgoyne, to desire that you would have the goodness to give 
directions for transmitting to me a return of the British officers 
and private men who were made prisoners at the skirmish nearBennington, specifying the wounded, the nature of their wounds, 
and the manner in which they are attended. If any aid of surgeons or medicines should be wanted, the Lieutenant-General 
wishes to forward it without delay. The manner in which we 
have treated such of your officers and men as have fallen into 
our hands, gives me reason to expect that every degree of care 
will be extended to those brave men whom the fate of war has 
put in your power. 

I send an open letter to the senior British officer now in yourhands, and desire the favor of you to forward it. I have the 
honor to be, Sir, 

Your most obedient, humble servant, 

SIMON FRASER. 



GENERAL GATES TO GENERAL FRASER. 

Head-Quarters, 2 September, 1777. 
SIR, 

Last night I was favored with your letter of yesterday s date. 
The return you request is by this conveyance transmitted to his 
Excellency General Burgoyne. Surgeons, medicines, and attend 
ance, with every comfort imaginable, have been amply supplied 
to the sick and wounded officers and soldiers, prisoners at Ben 
nington, as it is the wish of every generous mind, that the cala 
mities of war should lie as light as possible upon unhappy indi 
viduals who are wounded or taken. You will be satisfied these 
are my sentiments when you examine Ensign and Quarter-master 
Sanders, who were brought by one of my scouts, last year, to 
Ticonderoga. In Brigadier-General St. Leger s retreat from Fort 
Stanwix, and during the siege thereof, some British officers and 
soldiers have fallen into our hands. As soon as I know their 
names, they shall be sent to you in writing. Your letter, ad 
dressed to the senior British officer, is sent to Bennington. I 
have the honor to be, Sir, 

Your most obedient, humble servant, 

HORATIO GATES. 

1776. GENERAL LINCOLN TO GENERAL GATES. 

Bennington, 4 September, 1777. 
DEAR GENERAL, 

The person I sent to General Burgoyne is returned. He had 
an opportunity to confer with him, with Fraser and others, and 
was suffered to return into the country, under the character of a 
Recruiting Officer. He informs me that the flying camp is about 
three miles below Fort Miller, on the east side of the river, and 
consists of seventeen hundred men ; that the American troops are 
about half a mile above them, and he supposes there are about 
fifteen hundred of them. About one mile above, is the German 
camp ; then the British head-quarters, number unknown. At Fort 
Edward there are about three hundred men, commanded by a 
Major; about one hundred and fifty at Fort George; about five 
hundred at Ticonderoga. By every appearance, the enemy s designs are to move down the river. This is confirmed by every 
person who comes out. 

My informant gives it as his opinion, from the best evidence 
he could collect, that there are about six thousand European 
troops on the south of Lake Champlain. I hear, by another per 
son who left Fort Edward the 30th ultimo, that the enemy had 
sent one English regiment, and fifteen or sixteen light field-pieces, 
to Fort Anne ; and that, on the 2d instant, General Burgoyneintended to remove his heavy cannon to Stillwater. I hope you 
will take possession before him, as I know, in that case, you will 
seriously dispute title with him; and doubt not but you will con 
vince him that his claim is insupportable. 

I have sent to the officers, civil and military, and to a number 
of private gentlemen in the county of Berkshire, desiring their 
aid to the Commissary, by furnishing him with teams to forward 
on the flour here as fast as possible. I have received a quantity 
of ammunition from General Heath; have now a good supply, 
and have good reason to believe that I shall have a sufficiency 
of flour. Beef we have in plenty. I have the honor to be, dearGeneral, 

With the warmest sentiments of regard and esteem, &c., 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 


GENERAL LINCOLN TO GENERAL GATES. 

Pawlet, 11 September, 1777.
 
DEAR GENERAL, 

I am honored with your favor of the 10th instant. General 
Stark, by his last letter, informed me his troops should join yourHonor ; since which, I have heard of his march ; therefore have 
inclosed your letter to him. I should not have been short of 
ammunition, had the militia from the Massachusetts attended to 
the orders of the Court, and had the ball sent from Springfield 
and Albany been of a size suitable for the muskets. 

On our movement this way, the few enemy, who were at 
Skenesborough, left it, after burning a number of boats. We 
have in camp about two thousand men, and now a prospect of a 
supply of flour. On the return of the scouts, now out, I expect 
a good account of the enemy s situation ; shall not fail, immedi 
ately, by scouts and heavier detachments, to attempt giving that 
diversion to General Burgoyne which we contemplated my move 
ment here would effect. 

I am, &c., 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 



GENERAL LINCOLN TO COLONEL BROWN. 

Pawlet, 12 September, 1777 
SIR, 

You will please to take the command of five hundred men, and 
proceed, in the best route, to cross the Narrows, as soon as may 
be, to the landing at the north end of Lake George ; and, if you 
find any of our men prisoners there, you will relieve them, and 
destroy all such boats and stores belonging to the enemy as may 
fall within your power ; and if, upon inquiry, you find that you 
can attempt Ticonderoga, without risking too much, you will do 
it. As in all your movements you must be regulated by the in 
formation you receive of the situation of the enemy, which may 
be such as to render it impossible to execute these orders, you 
are, therefore, to consider them as discretionary ; and, if you find 
matters different from what hath been represented, and you can 
not prosecute the above plan, you will adopt such an one, as, in 
your opinion, will most annoy, divide, and distract the enemy. 
1776. You will give me, from time to time, the earliest information 
possible of your movements, and of the discoveries you shall 
make. I wish you success. 

And am, dear Sir, &e., 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 



GENERAL LINCOLN TO GENERAL GATES. 

Pawlet, 14 September, 1777. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I just now received your favor of yesterday s date. By a 
scout, who has been near Fort Edward, and from one of the 
inhabitants in that neighbourhood, I have a confirmation of the 
enemy s movements mentioned in your letter. I think it is not 
probable that their design is on your post. However, I will keep 
the most watchful eye over them, and, if possible, prevent a surprise. 

On being informed by almost every person who came in, as 
well as by the letter you inclosed to me from General Palmer, 
of the weak state of Ticonderoga, and also advised that a consi 
derable number of our men were prisoners in the enemy s hands,, 
and kept at Lake George Landing, under a very small guard, at 
which place the enemy had a large magazine of stores ; and sup 
posing a movement that way would perfectly coincide with the 
original design of my being" sent here, namely, if possible to di 
vide and distract the enemy, I was induced yesterday, with the 
advice of the officers, to send Colonel Brown, with five hundred 
men, to the landing at Lake George, to relieve the prisoners and 
destroy the stores there ; the same number of men under Colonel 
Johnson to Mount Independence; the latter to give a diversion 
to the enemy, while the former should execute his commission, 
and, if an opportunity should offer, without risking too much, to 
push for Mount Independence, while Colonel Brown would at 
tempt Ticonderoga, and, farther, to amuse and divide the enemy 
by attacking their outposts, &c. A like number of men were 
sent under Colonel Woodbridge to Skenesborough, thence to Fort 
Anne, and on to Fort Edward. 

I hope these movements will meet your approbation. I should 
have mentioned the design before, and not have put the plan in 
execution without your advice, could I have been sure the in 
formation would not have fallen into the hands of the enemy. I 
supposed that you intended to hint to me your apprehension of 
danger in this way, and that I must be cautious as to what I 
wrote, when, in the close of your favor of the 10th, you say, " I 
desire you will not fail frequently to acquaint me with yourmovements, and, as far as is prudent, with your designs." 
I am, &c., 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 



GENERAL GATES TO GENERAL LINCOLN. 

Camp, Heights above Behmus, 19 September, 1777. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

It is the opinion of all the Generals that I have consulted 
with, that, in the present position and circumstances of General 
Burgoyne s army, considered with his apparent views, your army 
ought to be posted at Stillwater, and that not one moment should 
be lost in your marching them thither. Upon your arrival there, 
you will take possession of the height upon the east side, and fix 
five or six hundred men thereupon. The rest you will encamp 
at the old station. General Burgoyne has not left the smallest 
article at any of the posts in the rear. This, I informed you of 
in my last. You will march by the shortest route to Stillwater. 
Provisions, &c., shall be provided for you there. 

I am, &c., 

HORATIO GATES. 



GENERAL LINCOLN TO COLONEL BROWN. 

Pawlet, 21 September, 1777. 

DEAR COLONEL, 

All your movements since you left this place have [been] very 
agreeable to me. I am greatly obliged to you for your exertions, 
and am glad to hear, that with spirit the officers and men under 
you have distinguished themselves. You are all entitled to the 
thanks of the public; mine you have most cordially. 

I had no idea, when I wrote to General Bayley, to which 
letter you refer, of your retreating while there was a probability 
of success ; neither do I now wish it. Colonel "Woodbridge will 
afford you all the assistance in his power. I had yesterday 
1776. General Gates s repeated orders to join him at Stillwater. I must 
do it myself with all the troops I can collect here. He had 
a skirmish, the night before last, with the enemy. He took two 
hundred and fifty prisoners and three field-pieces. General Warner and you must act your own judgments with respect to at 
tacking the enemy s lines, continuing the siege, or retiring. I 
am this moment going to set off; expect to see General Gates 
to-morrow. I shall leave General Bayley at Castleton, who will 
afford you every in supplies. 

I am, &c., 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 

P. S. While at Skenesborough, I could get no advice from you, 
and supposed our expresses were cut off. Indeed, I was con 
firmed in this opinion, after being informed that one of our boats 
was fired on by the Tories, and one man killed. The boat went, 
as afterwards I was told, into East Bay. I therefore took post 
for one night at Castleton. 



GENERAL LINCOLN TO THE COUNCIL OF MASSACHUSETTS. 

23 September, 1777. 
GENTLEMEN, 

I marched from Manchester to Pawlet, with the troops who 
had joined me, on Monday/ the 8th. On the 14th, a party of 
five hundred men, commanded by Colonel Brown, was ordered to 
cross the Narrows in South Bay, and march for the Landing at 
the north end of Lake George, to destroy the enemy s boats 
and stores, and relieve a number of our men, prisoners there ; 
and if, upon inquiry, he found an attempt upon Ticonderoga 
might be made without risking too much, he was to do it. A 
like number was sent to Mount Independence, under Colonel 
Johnson, in order to divert, at least, the enemy there, and take 
off their attention from our real object, and to attack it, if a 
favorable opportunity should offer. At the same time, another 
party of about five hundred was sent, under Colonel Woodbridge, 
to Skenesborough, who were to cover Colonel Brown, and march 
on towards Fort Edward, and give the enemy a diversion in that 
quarter. 

The success Colonel Brown hath met with, you learn by the 
inclosed, which is a copy of his letter to me. He hath acted 
with great spirit, and informs me that his officers and men have 
behaved with bravery.* General Warner is with Colonel Johnson, 
at the Mount, and hath the general direction of the three parties, 
lie informs me, that no opportunity hath offered by which he 
might attack the lines at Mount Independence with a probability 
of success. I feel myself very happy in having him there, for I 
have the greatest confidence in his prudence, fortitude, and zeal. 
General Bayley, who was Colonel Bayley in the last war, of the 
State of New Hampshire, now on the Grants, an experienced, 
good officer, is left at Castleton, in the neighbourhood of the enemy, and will forward supplies, and join the troops, if necessary. 

I moved, on Wednesday, the 17th, to Skenesborough, and 
marched that way about seven hundred men, with an intention to 
move towards the North River; but the day after, before the 
troops reached me there, I had information from General Gates, 
that the enemy had abandoned all their posts in their rear ; and 
proposed I should fall on the enemy s left flank. I immediately 
remarched the seven hundred men on their way back, near to 
Pawlet. The next day, by two expresses, I received General 
Gates s orders to take post at Stillwater; for the enemy had not 
only abandoned the posts in their rear, but had broken down all 
the bridges immediately on passing them, which evidenced General Burgoyne s intention to move forward, at all events. 

I left Pawlet the day before yesterday (Sunday), arrived here 
last night, and expect the troops in this evening or in the morn
* This letter Las not been found. The following extract from a 
letter written by Colonel Brown to General Gates, dated " North 
End of Lake George, September 18, 1777," and published in the 
newspapers of the time, gives the particulars of his success against 
the enemy. 

" With great fatigue, after marching all last night, I arrived at this 
place at break of day, and after the best disposition of the men I could 
make, immediately began the attack, and, in a few minutes, carried 
the place. I then, without loss of time, detached a considerable part 
of my men to the mill, where a great number of the enemy were 
posted, who also were made prisoners; a small number of whom having taken possession of a block-house in that vicinity, were with more 
difiiculty brought to submission ; but at the sight of the cannon they 
surrendered. 

" During these seasons of successes, Mount Defiance also fell into 

our hands. I have taken possession of the old French lines at Ticon
deroga. I have sent in a flag, demanding a surrender of Ticonderoga 
and Mount Independence in the strongest and most peremptory terms.

1776. ing, twelve or fourteen hundred. The number sent out is farshort of what I expected. There hath been in the Grants but 
about three thousand, including three small regiments of Continental troops, the rangers from the Grants and part of their mili 
tia, the militia from Berkshire, who came for twenty days only, 
with all the Massachusetts three months men. 

The prisoners taken at Ticonderoga may soon be expected at 
Boston, to which place General Gates hath ordered them. An 
attack on this post, from the enemy, is hourly expected.

GENERAL GATES TO GENERAL PUTNAM. 

Albany, 2 November, 1777. 
DEAR SIR, 

Governor Clinton will present you my letter to him of this 
date, which contains my unalterable sentiments of the measures 
which ought to be taken, should Sir Harry Clinton attempt to 
succour or reenforcc Sir William Howe. I will not again repeat 
them here, but only take the liberty earnestly to recommend the 
profoundest secrecy in whatever you determine to do ; for, depend 
upon it, that that consummate, artful woman, Mrs. Robinson, will 
do all in her power to be acquainted with your secrets. 

As to any attack upon New York, I utterly disapprove of it; 
for, while the enemy s ships of war can act in the North and 
East Rivers, the taking of that city would be doubtful, and, if 
I have had as yet no information of the event of Colonel Johnson s 
attack on the Mount. My loss of men, in these several actions, is 
not more than three or four killed, and five wounded. The enemy s 
loss is less. I find myself in possession of two hundred and ninetythree prisoners, namely; two Captains, nine subalterns, two Commis 
saries; non-commissioned officers and privates, one hundred and fortythree British, and one hundred and nineteen Canadians; eighteen arti 
ficers ; and retook more than one hundred of our men ; total, two 
hundred and ninety-three, exclusive of the prisoners retaken. The 
Avater- craft I have taken is one hundred and fifty bateaux, above 
the Falls ; in Lake Champlain, fifty, above the Falls, including several large gun-boats and an armed sloop ; arms equal to the number of 
prisoners ; some ammunition ; and many other things which I cannot 
as yet ascertain. I must not forget to mention a few cannon, which 
may be of great service to us." 
taken, could not be held ; and be assured, that all stores, of any 
value to us, are or will be afloat, before any large detachments 
leave that city, and I can see no good in taking an empty town, 
which we cannot hold. Of course it is not an object to divert 
the attention of the King s Generals from their more important 
designs. 

I am, &c., 

HORATIO GATES. 



THOMAS CHITTENDEN TO GENERAL GATES. 

In Council, Bennington, 22 November, 1777. 

DEAR GENERAL, 

I have the pleasure to inform your Honor of the success of 
our Green Mountain rangers, in harassing the enemy s rear on 
their retreat from Ticonderoga, in which Captain Ebenezer Allen, 
with fifty rangers, has taken forty-nine prisoners, upwards of onehundred horses, twelve yokes of oxen, four cows, and three of 
the enemy s boats, &c. &c. 

Major "Wait, who was sent to take possession of Mount Independence, found nothing of consequence, excepting several boats 
which the enemy had sunk, in which there were some provisions. 
All barracks, houses, and bridges were burnt ; cannon, to the 
number of forty, broken and spiked up. He was so fortunate as 
to take one French sutler, with some rum, wine, brandy, &c. 

Agreeably to your Honor s request for Colonel Warner to come 
to Albany, express was sent, and he is to set off for Albany this 
morning. I have the honor to be, by order of Council, 
Your Honor s most obedient, humble servant, 

THOMAS CHITTENDEN, President. 

N. B. I beg your Honor s directions how to dispose of the 
prisoners. 



GENERAL BURGOYNE TO GENERAL GATES. 

Cambridge, 11 February, 1778. 
SIR, 

I received the resolves of the Congress, of the 8th of January, 
with an astonishment that no occurrence ever before occasioned. 
1776. It would be misplaced to enter now into any reasoning upon the 
subject. 

I apply to you, Sir, as an individual whom I believe to have 
honor, humanity, and generosity. My Aid-de-camp has directions 
to communicate to you my letters to the Congress. I leave to 
your feelings to support that which regards my private situation, 
only begging leave to recall to your recollection the offer you 
made, in regard to my personal embarkation. In the full persua 
sion of the integrity of that proposal, I thought not of entering 
into reasonings and justifications in my public or private letters 
from Albany, in any such degree as the delicacy of a soldier s 
character required, after a series of the most critical situations, 
difficult attempts, and diversified ill success. To die in this country, is nothing ; but to leave my honor unvindicated in my own, 
is more than philosophy or fortitude can be expected to bear. 

I confide in you, to consider this entirely as a private letter, 
and am, 

With sincere regard, Sir, &c., 

JOHN BURGOYNE. 



GENERAL GATES TO GENERAL BURGOYNE. 

York, 2 March, 1778. 
SIR, 

I am exceedingly mortificfd that you did not accept of my offer 
at Albany, to go to England in a vessel, that the State of Mas 
sachusetts Bay would, at my request, have provided. General 
Glover, with whom you are acquainted, was, in that case, to have 
attended you in his own ship ; and I am persuaded you would 
have avoided many disagreements, had it pleased you to have 
accepted that offer. Your case I feel, as I ever shall that of the 
unfortunate brave. If courage, perseverance, and a faithful attach 
ment to your Prince could have prevailed, I might have been 
your prisoner. The chance of Avar has determined otherwise. 

The Congress now send the passports you desire ; and I am 
happy to acquaint you, that the Major and Lady Harriet Ackland 
arc in New York, and may possibly be in England as soon as, 
or very soon after you. With respect, I am, Sir, 
Your most obedient, humble servant, 

HORATIO GATES. 
GENERAL LINCOLN TO COLONEL JOHN LAURENS. 

Boston, 5 February, 1781. 
MY DEAR SIR, 

In compliance with your wish, that I would give you the out 
lines of the several movements I made in the Northern depart 
ment, in the year 1777, after General Gates reassumed the command, to my being wounded on the 8th of October, I offer the 
following short state of the matter. 

General Gates s arrival in camp at the Sprouts, about twelve 
miles above Albany, was announced to me in Bennington, on the 
19th of September, by his letter of that date to General Stark, 
in which he requests our ideas of a plan for the future opera 
tions of the campaign. We were fully of opinion, that a body of 
militia should be collected in the Grants, and move in the rearof General Burgoyne, as this measure would oblige him to make 
heavy detachments to secure the several posts necessary to cover 
his rear, on the doing of which the salvation of his army might 
depend. He would also be obliged to escort his provision-wagons, 
which would serve to weaken his main body, as General Gates 
would have little to fear in front. Besides, this movement would 
cover a large and valuable country, filled with provisions, and re 
strain the unfriendly. 

Immediately on General Gates receiving this letter, he ordered 
me to attend him at head-quarters. At that interview I explained 
to him fully the reasons on which our opinion was grounded. 
lie acceded to the propriety of the measure, and ordered me 
back to Bennington, to receive the Massachusetts militia, who had 
been ordered on, and to make the necessary arrangements to act 
in conjunction with him on a general plan. On the 2d of Sep 
tember, the Commissary reported that there was a deficiency of 
flour, which was an alnrming circumstance, as our division was 
to consist of militia, who cannot long be held, without proper 
attention is paid to their supplies. I immediately wrote to the 
officers, civil and military, in the county of Berkshire, requesting 
their attention to this matter, and their aid to forward the flourstored in that part of the country. They, and the people at 
large, stimulated by the most laudable motives, soon gave us, 
though the transportation was extremely difficult, the most am 
ple supply. From an apprehension that it might be too long 
delayed, I wrote to that county for a body of their militia, and 
45* 



534 OPERATIONS OF [1781. 

requested that they would come mounted, each bringing his sack 
of flour. 

On the 7th, having received some supplies, and good assurance 
that a sufficiency would be sent on, M T e moved to Manchester, 
with the troops which were collected, and gave orders for others 
to follow as they arrived. On the 8th, I reached Pawlet with 
part of the troops. Here we halted for the arrival of the remain 
der, and the stores, and to know the situation of the enemy, and 
because it was a strong post, both of our flanks being covered by 
mountains, in most places impassable, forming, at this place, al 
most the point of an acute angle, not unlike my ideas of the 
strength of Thermopylae. Thus far we could pass with wagons. 

On the loth, our little army being collected, which consisted of 
two thousand five hundred men, and the stores being arrived, to 
execute our general plan, which was to annoy, divide, and distract the enemy, Colonel Brown was sent with five hundred men 
across the Narrows (part of Lake Champlain, or, as it is some 
times called, South Bay), to the north end of Lake George, with 
instructions to destroy all the boats and stores there belonging to 
the enemy, and, if possible, to relieve our prisoners at that post. 
Colonel Johnson was ordered, with a like number of men, to 
Mount Independence, with instructions to attempt that post, to 
favor the designs of Colonel Brown. Colonel Woodbridge was 
ordered with five hundred men to Skenesborough, with instruc 
tions to proceed to Fort Anne, and from thence to attempt the 
enemy s post at the Mills, if it could be done without risking too 
much. Hereby he became a cover to Colonel Brown, and se 
cured his retreat, if nothing more could be effected. In order to 
give despatch to these enterprises, and ease to the troops, the 
horse, which I wrote for from Berkshire to come on with sacks, 
having arrived, they were divided among the three commands, and 
took on the flour. The beeves were kept on foot. A number of 
militia light-horse were ordered on, with their saddle-bags filled 
with spare cartridges. Thus the men moved very light, and with 
great despatch. 

On the 17th, after leaving four hundred men to cover the 
stores at Pawlet, I moved with six hundred towards Skenesbo 
rough, in order to join Colonel "Woodbridge, the more effectually 
to cover Colonel Brown ; at which post I intended Colonels 
Brown and Johnson should join me, in order to move in force 
into the rear of General Burgoync. 

Colonel Johnson arrived in time before Mount Independence, 
and remained there a number of days; but, finding the enemy too 
well covered to attempt an assault with a probability of success, 
he returned when ordered. The enemy having evacuated their 
posts in their rear, it became unnecessary for Colonel Woodbridge 
to proceed farther than Skenesborough. Colonel Brown s success 
you have fully represented in the following extracts from his re 
port to me. 

On the 19th, I received a letter from General Gates, approving the measures I had taken, and expressing his wish that I 
would take a different post, as General Burgoyne had totally 
neglected his rear. I then ordered the troops, who were on their 
march to Skenesborough, to return to Pawlet. On the 20th, I 
received his orders to take post at Stilhvater. This laid me under the necessity of giving orders to our troops, before Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, to return and join me at Stillwater, as soon as they should have succeeded, or all hopes of 
success should be cut off; and, after leaving a proper guard at 
Pawlet, to march the troops, not on command, to Stilhvater. I 
left them, on the 21st, to be marched by their proper officers, 
and reached head-quarters at Behmus s Heights, in the evening 
of the 22d. 

After my arrival in camp, the General gave me the right wing 
of the army, which consisted of Nixon s, Glover s, and Patterson s 
brigades, and the Massachusetts militia, as they arrived from the 
expedition northward. Thus matters remained, without any thing 
very particular, until the 7th of October. In the afternoon, the 
enemy moved with their right towards our left. The light troops 
were sent out to skirmish with them, to retard and observe their 
motions; for the General was apprehensive that they meant a 
feint on the left while they should attempt a real attack on ourright. The light troops were reenforced by Poor s and Learned s 
brigade on the left. As the action became serious, they were 
reenforced by militia and detachments from the right. Towards 
evening, General Gates ordered me to move with the right, and 
attack the enemy s left; but it became so dark before we could 
reach their line, that nothing happened there but some skirmishing between the advanced parties. Their right suffered greatly, 
and were driven within their lines ; and some of their outworks 
were carried by our people, and the day ended gloriously on ourside. 

I received orders to move by daylight, in the morning of the 
8th, with the right, and attempt the enemy s lines. We advanced 
three brigades, each brigade forming a column, and marching 
from its own encampment. At the same time, there was a move 
ment on the left. On the approach of our advanced corps, the 
enemy, after exchanging n few shots, left their lines, to be possessed by us, and took post on a height in the rear of their lines. 
Soon after this I received a wound in my leg, which prevented 
my remaining longer in the field ; and my long ill health prevented my remarking further particulars on the campaign, which 
ended witli so much advantage to America, and so justly to the 
honor of General Gates. 

I am, my dear Sir, &c., 

BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 



GENERAL PUTNAM TO GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Head-Quarters, Peekskill, 29 September, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

By order from General Washington, all the troops from this 
post, except about eleven hundred Continental and four hundred 
of the militia, are withdrawn. I have received intelligence, on 
which I fully depend, that the enemy had received a reenforcement at New York, last Thursday, of about three thousand British and foreign troops ; that General Clinton has called in 
guides, who belong about Croton River; has ordered hard bread 
baked; that the troops are called from Paulus Hook to King s 
Bridge, and the whole troops are now under marching orders. 

Under these circumstances, and from a variety of other consi 
derations, I think it highly probable the designs of the enemy 
are against the posts in the Highlands, or some part of the counties of Wcstchester or Dutchess. Should their attack be upon 
the posts in the Highlands, you cannot have the least expectation 
the posts can be maintained, with our present force, against the 
strength the enemy may, or probably will send. When you con 
sider the infinite importance of the post to the general interest 
of the country, and of this State in particular, I cannot entertain 
a, doubt of your immediate attention to the defence of it. Unless 
a greater force than at present is here, or appears probable to 
be here, is supplied for the defence of the post, you must be 
sensible I cannot be answerable for the defence of it. I there 
fore beg you to pay an attention to this important post, and 
afford me a reinforcement of the militia, that will enable me to 
maintain it. If it is possible for you to pay a personal attention 
to this object, I shall be happy in your counsel and assistance, 
and am, dear Sir, 

Your very humble servant, 

ISRAEL PUTNAM. 

P. S. I received your favor of the 28th instant, and shall ob 
serve the contents. The ships are drawn up in the river, and I 
believe nothing prevents them from paying us an immediate visit, 
but the contrary wind. 



GENERAL PUTNAM TO GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Peekskill, eight o clock in the evening, 4th October. 

DEAR SIR, 

This morning we had information from our guard-boats, that 
there were two ships of war, three tenders, and a large number 
of fiat-bottomed boats, coming up the river. They proceeded up 
as far as Tarry Town, where they landed their men. This evening they were followed by one large man-of-war, five topsail ves 
sels, and a large number of small craft. I have sent off parties 
to examine their route, and harass their march, if prudent. 

General Parsons has gone down to reconnoitre. He has not 
yet returned; but by information from several different quarters, 
we have reason to believe they intend for this post. They are 
now making up, as we hear, for Croton Bridge. You will please 
to give such orders to the militia, in consequence thereof, as you 
shall think proper. I have sent the barge to you with this, and 
most sincerely wish you would come down as soon as convenient. 
I should have wrote you before, but I thought this movement 
only to drive off some cattle, &c. I am, dear Sir, with great 
regard, 

Your most humble servant, 

ISRAEL PUTNAM. 
GENERAL PUTNAM TO GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Paper Mills, 6 October, 1777. 
DEAR GENERAL, 

I am this moment returned from Fort Independence, and find 
the [intelligence concerning a] party of the enemy, which were 
said to have landed last night at that Fort, is without foundation. 
By the inhabitants, who live just by Fort Independence, I am 
informed that the enemy have landed betwixt King s Ferry and 
Dunderberg. If that is the case, they mean to attack Fort Mont 
gomery by land, which when I am sure of, I shall immediately 
reenforce you.* 

I am, &c., 

ISRAEL PUTNAM. 



GENERAL PUTNAM TO GENERAL GATES. 

Fishkill, eleven o clock, A. M., 9 October, 1777. 
DEAR GENERAL, 

In my letter of yesterday, I acquainted you of the enemy s 
having possession of Fort Montgomery. Yesterday they pro 
ceeded up the river with their ships, galleys, flat-bottomed boats, 
&c., and landed a body at Fort Constitution, took possession of 
that post, and played round "the die raux-dc-f rise a little. I ex 
pect every moment to have information that they are advancing 
up. 

Governor Clinton is on the west side of the river, with about 
four hundred Continental troops, which I sent him yesterday, and 
is exerting himself in collecting the militia. If they attempt to 
land on that side, he will oppose and annoy them as much as 
possible. If this side should be their object, I shall, with the re 
mainder of the Continental troops and the Connecticut militia 
(which, I am happy to inform you, came in yesterday and the 
day before in great numbers, but, I am sorry to say, they 
already begin to run away), oppose them every way in my 
power. Certain it is, that they mean, at all events, to join Ge


* The assault on Fort Montgomery and Fort Clinton took place the 
same da} r , October Gth. See the purliculars in Washington s Writings, 
Vol. V. p. 471. 
ncral Burgoyne without delay. They are on a desperate point; 
and I dare say that their orders are positive to join the Northern 
army, at all risks. General Clinton commands them in person. 
He has two general officers with him, and, I believe, between 
five and six thousand men. If they should proceed by water, I 
shall do every thing in my power to arrive at Albany before 
them. Weighing the chcvaux-de-frise, I do not think is a matter 
of any moment to them. They can take a fair wind, and, with 
their flat-bottomed boats, which all have sails, go to Albany, or 
Half- Moon, with great expedition, and, I believe, without any 
opposition. Would it not be a matter of great importance to 
send, if you can possibly spare them, a detachment from yourarmy towards Albany, or some advantageous ground, to prevent 
them from getting between you and me ? For, if they should 
come on your rear, the situation of your army would be disagreeable. 

The loss of Fort Montgomery has, instead of depressing the 
spirits of the country, animated them. So many forts and strong 
holds have been given up without fighting, that they began to 
despair, and thought that our troops would not face the enemy. 
But now they begin to be convinced of the contrary ; for the few 
brave men, who were in that fort, defended it five hours against 
at least five thousand of the enemy, determined on carrying the 
post. The garrison, in the whole, did not amount to more than 
six hundred. Notwithstanding the great superiority of the enemy, 
our troops never surrendered the fort, but fought, from one re 
doubt to another, after the enemy had got into the fort; and, 
when they could do no more, they fought their way through, and 
most of them made their escape. Colonel Dubois, who had a 
wound with a bayonet in his neck, has mustered nearly two hundred of his men, who were with him in the action, many of 
whom have slight wounds with bayonets and swords, but are in 
high spirits, and, I hope, will effect something clever. 

I am, &c., 

ISRAEL PUTNAM. 

P. S. If there are any of the militia in your quarter that yet 
remain at home, pray let them be mustered. 


GENERAL PUTNAM TO GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Fishkill, ten o clock, P.M., 9 October. 1777. 
DEAR GOVERNOR, 

Upon your letter, and some intelligence I received from below, 
I am fully of opinion the enemy intended a desperate effort to 
relieve General Burgoyne. I had the advice of the General 
Officers here, and we were of opinion, that to keep our force col 
lected would be the best means of preserving our safety. As it 
is uncertain which side of the river the enemy will take, and 
having it in their power to make their election (in which we 
shall be unable to follow them), to throw our main force on the 
west side of the river would leave our principal stores a prey, 
and expose the resources of this and the Northern army to be 
cut off. 

I have thought it advisable to order Colonel Brinkerhoff s regi 
ment immediately to march and join you ; and, should the enemy 
succeed in weighing the chevaux-de-frise, and proceed up the 
river, I should think it advisable for you to proceed to Albany 
with despatch ; and, should the number of cannon you have incumbcr your march, you will convey as many of them as you 
shall think proper to some place of safety, and proceed on with 
the rest. The militia of Connecticut, I hear, are coming in. I 
shall do every thing in my power to oppose the enemy, and to 
give succour to you, trusting .that, through the smiles of Heaven, 
we shall yet be free. With great esteem and respect, 

I am, your obedient, humble servant, 

ISRAEL PUTNAM. 



GOVERNOR CLINTON TO GENERAL GATES. 

New Windsor, 9 October. 1777.
 
DEAR GENERAL, 

Immediately after our late misfortune at Fort Montgomery, I 
wrote the Legislature of this State the particulars, requesting 
them, without delay, to forward them to you. My hurry, at that 
time, and since, prevented my answering your favor of the 4th 
instant until now ; since which, the enemy have taken possession 
of Fort Constitution, and are, at this time, riot far below the clievaux-dc-frise. 
My guards fell in with, and took two spies from General Clin 
ton, going to Burgoyne. One of them confessed, that his orders 
were to make all possible despatch, and inform General Burgoynethat he had got Fort Montgomery, the key of America, and that 
he was prepared to weigh the chevaux-de-frise ; and that he, Burgoyne, might now proceed, as all obstacles in the river were re 
moved, lie further says, that Clinton is determined to push up 
the river to relieve Burgoyne from his present difficulty. The 
inclosed confession of Taylor will give you some idea of their 
past manoeuvres and future intentions. 

If I have been rightly informed, your army is now so nume 
rous that you can with safety order a part of it to establish a 
post at, or this side, Albany. In that case, if they move up, 
General Putnam, who is collecting a large body of the Connecti 
cut militia on the opposite shore, will be able to join them. I 
shall endeavour to keep between them and your army, with two 
Continental regiments and some militia; and I hope, by this 
means, to keep them from Albany. Indeed, I am sure it can 
be done, provided you establish a post on this side for us to 
retire to. I cannot, at present, ascertain the number lost at Fort 
Montgomery. My brother, General Clinton, who received a wound 
in his thigh, with a number of other officers, and two hundred of 
Dubois s regiment, made their escape after the enemy were in 
possession of the fort, and have come in safe. 

"We have just received intelligence that General Washington 
attacked the enemy, last Saturday, on Chestnut Hill, near Phila 
delphia, defeated, and drove them through Germantown. Night 
coming on, he withdrew, and renewed the attack early on Sunday 
morning, and had gained the victory.* We have as yet received 
no authenticated accounts of the action. 

Colonel Lamb, and most of his officers who were with me at 
the fort, also escaped. 

I am, dear Sir, &c., 

GEORGE CLINTON. 


GENERAL PUTNAM TO GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Continental Ferry, 15 October, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

The shipping, moving up the river, must fully convince us that 
their intentions are for Albany. It is, therefore, a matter of the 
utmost importance for us immediately to fix upon what manner 
we shall dispose of our troops. If we were convinced that General Gates was able to oppose them, I think we ought not to lose 
one moment, but march immediately down to King s Bridge. 

I wrote General Gates on Sunday, and begged of him to ac 
quaint me with his situation. Would it not, therefore, be prudent 
to keep our troops at Fishkill until I receive his answer? Yourimmediate opinion will oblige, dear Sir, 

Your very humble servant, 

ISRAEL PUTNAM. 

SIR, Since the General wrote the within, he has received 
yours ; and I am directed by him to acquaint your Excellency, 
that he agrees with you in opinion, that moving up the river will 
be the most practicable method to be taken. The General intends 
moving up immediately ; and I am, in haste, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

T. YATES, Adjutant. 



GENERAL PUTNAM TO GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Three miles above Fishkill, 1G October, 1777. 

DEAR GOVERNOR, 

I received your agreeable favor, and congratulate you on the 
glorious intelligence it contains of the capture of General Burgoyne.* I have halted my troops, who were on their march 
northward, and desirous of doing every thing to subserve our important cause, and bring our struggles to a happy and speedy 
issue. I should be glad of your opinion respecting my future 
movements whether I shall proceed to Albany, or remain to 
watch the motions of the enemy on the river, and protect the 
shore, or move immediately down to attack King s Bridge, leaving all the York militia in Dutchess county to guard the river. 
General Parsons, with about two thousand troops, is at Peekskill. 
My troops will halt upon the road where they are, till I receive 
your advice in the premises, which I request may be as speedy 
as possible ; also, that you would acquaint me whether you will 
probably be able to afford any assistance, in case it should be 
thought advisable to move down to the Bridge. With esteem 
and respect, I am, dear Sir, 

Your obedient, humble servant, 

ISRAEL PUTNAM. 

P. S. If you should advise going to the Bridge, I desire Colo 
nel Lamb would come down. 



GOVERNOR CLINTON TO GENERAL PUTNAM. 

Marbletown, seven miles from Kingston, 

17 October, 1777. 

SIR, 

I received your favor of the 16th. I am sorry to inform you, 
that by a letter from General Gates, of the 15th, the enemy had 
not surrendered. You do me the honor to ask my opinion re 
specting your future movements. It is needless and impossible 
for me to advise; because, having once settled our plan and 
afterwards deviated from it, the concerting any future measures 
might be productive of ruin to one of us, if deprived of those 
succours and that support, which form a part of the general plan 
of operations. My opinion of your attack at King s Bridge is, 
that it will be utterly inefficacious. 

For the rest, as your operations must be governed by circum 
stances, I can only inform you of facts. Kingston was burnt yes 
terday afternoon, because I had not troops to defend it. Two 
prisoners tell me that Albany is the enemy s object. If I ad 
vance much farther northward, it will be in the power of the 
enemy to ruin my little corps by landing above and below me, 
as I shall then have the Catskill Mountains to the west, and 
Hudson s River to the east. I expect every instant to hear that 
Rhinebeck is in flames. I have the honor to be, 

Your most obedient and humble servant, 

GEORGE CLINTON. 
P. S. I trust you must have received General Gates s letter 
of the 13th, of which he sent me a copy, in which he approves 
of the plan of removing our armies up the river on each side. 



GENERAL PUTNAM TO GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Head-Quarters, Red Hook, 20 October, 1777. 

SIR, 

By the inclosed copies, the originals of which were taken yesday, on their passage to New York, your Excellency will be able 
to form some judgment of the enemy s intentions, and what is 
best to be done, as far as circumstances will admit. Would it 
not answer a very valuable purpose to get the guns out of the 
row-galley that is scuttled in Esopus Creek, as they may be 
turned to the annoyance of the enemy, and prevent their getting 
possession of them? If your Excellency has no capital objection 
to the measure, I could wish that it might be carried into execu 
tion as soon as possible. 

I have this morning written to General Gates for some heavy 
cannon on travelling carriages, with fixed ammunition, and Continental troops, which if I receive, I expect to be able to oblige 
them to retire below the chevaux-de-frise. Whenever the cannon 
arrive, you shall be advised" previous to any operation, in order 
that we may act in conjunction as much as circumstances will 
permit. I am, with great regard, your Excellency s 

Most obedient and very humble servant,

whom I had the pleasure to dine to-day, that you were at Plea

head-quarters, with all convenient despatch, upon some interesting 
matters, as the enemy have evacuated Peekskill, Fort Montgomery, and all adjacent posts, and gone down the river with their 
whole fleet. With esteem and respect, I am, affectionately,

I am favored with yours of this date. I flattered myself I 
should have had the pleasure of seeing you ere now, as, when I 
left Kingston, it was my principal business ; and, though it was 
dark when I crossed the river, I reached Poughkeepsie that 
night, when in hopes to have overtaken you there, but was too 
late, as you had left that the preceding day. Ever since I have 
been here, I have been so unwell as not to dare venture out, 
considering the badness of the weather; but the moment the rain 
ceases, I will set out for your quarters. 

General Gates, in his letter of the 24th instant, gives me rea 
son to believe a large part of his army are on the move down 
each side of the river. Part of them had reached Hurley yes 
terday. He supposed the enemy yet to be up the river nearRed Hook, and intended to retake Fort Montgomery before they 
could get down to reenforce it. For this purpose he was for 
warding a considerable train of artillery, and asked an interview 
with me at Coeyman s, this side of Albany, yesterday. I could 
not attend then for the reasons above, but wrote him, informing 
him of the different situation of the enemy, which will, of course, 
alter his intended plan. At the same time I suggested it as my 
opinion, that the enemy would not now attempt any thing capi 
tal up the river this season, but detach their main force to 
strengthen Howe at Philadelphia, to which grand scene we undoubtedly ought to turn our chief attention, for on our successes 
there every thing worth regarding depends. 
Yours, sincerely, 

GEORGE CLINTON. 



GENERAL GATES TO GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Albany, 29 October, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

As I have not heard a syllable from you, or General Putnam, 
for a week past, I conclude you are in no want of any further 
assistance from me. Colonel Malcom promised to write as soon 
as he saw your Excellency. I have a sloop gone with a flag of 
truce to New York, on board of which is the widow Cortlandt 
Schuyler, her family, servants, &c., with Lieutenant Swords and 
his family. The sloop is commanded by Captain Van Buren. 
Colonel H. B. Livingston, who went in the bateau that carried 
Lord Viscount Petersham, Aid-de-camp to Lientenant-General 
Burgoyne, has my orders to see you upon his return from General Vaughan, to whom he carried a letter from me. Captain 
Van Buren will also make you his report as lie passes New 
Windsor. I am exceedingly impatient to hear from the south 
and the south-west. I am happy to tell you, that General Lin 
coln and General Arnold are both in a fair way of recovery. 
I am, 

Your Excellency s most affectionate, humble servant, 

HORATIO GATES. 



GOVERNOR CLINTON TO GENERAL GATES. 

Fishkill, ten o clock at night, 30 October, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

I arrived here about noon, when I met your favor of the 25th 
instant. My letter of the 20th, informing you of the enemy s 
fleet having fallen down below New Windsor, must have reached 
you before this. I have, therefore, only to add, that the enemy 
have demolished Fort Montgomery, and all the other posts in the 
Highlands, and moved down with their whole force towards New 
York ; and to ask how I am to dispose of the troops belonging 
to your department, which you have been so good as to place 
under my direction. As it is probable General Putnam may 
think it prudent to make an attempt against New York, I am 
the more anxious to have your directions in this respect, that I 
may govern myself accordingly. I am, with the highest esteem 
and respect, 

Your affectionate, humble servant, 

GEORGE CLINTON. 

P. S. Your troops had not reached New Windsor yet. The 
last I heard of them, they were at Kingston, since which, to this 
day, I believe the weather has prevented their moving. 



GENERAL GATES TO GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Albany, 2 November, 1777. 

SIR, 

Upon my return last night from Coeyman s, I had the pleasure 
to receive your Excellency s letter of the 30th of last month. If 
Sir Henry Clinton is directed to reenforce the army of Sir William Howe, which I believe to be the case, he will either land 
his troops at Amboy, and march by the lower road to Mount 
Holly, to support any designed attack upon Fort Mifflin, and the 
fortified pass of the Delaware River ; or he will land at Elizabethtown, and march by Brunswic and Princeton to Trenton, in or 
der to facilitate Sir William Howe s retreat across the Delaware, 
and through the Jerseys. In either attempt, I am clearly of opinion that all the troops I sent to your assistance, with all that 
can properly, from your neighbourhood, be added to them, should 
march without delay to Morristown, and for their further opera 
tions, be governed, in great measure, by the movements of the 
enemy. Of these, the Commanding Officer should procure the 
best intelligence. 

If Sir Henry Clinton marches towards Mount Holly, our army 
will, of course, move directly to Princeton, and hang upon his 
rear and right flank. If he marches towards Trenton, our army 
will march to Somerset Court-House, and be ready to move, as he 
moves, towards Trenton ; our General carefully acquainting General Washington with his own, and the enemy s motions, and re 
ceiving his directions for the cooperation of his army. 

The Governor of the Jerseys should, at the same time, be 
requested to order the militia of that State to second the motions 
of our army. If Colonel Morgan and his rifle regiment have 
marched, it would be right to send an express to stop them at 
Van Camp s, and order him to inarch from thence to Sussex 
Court-House and Morristown. 

The heavy brass artillery I sent down the river, should be sent 
up again by water, or so disposed as to be secured from any 
surprise. The light brass field-guns, which you mentioned in a 
former letter, should be sent with the troops to Morristown. I 
have the best reason to believe, that, with the troops I have 
here, I can secure every thing this way until June, and perhaps 
do more. 

If the public affairs of this State do not require your Excel 
lency s immediate attendance upon them, I wish you could be 
spared to command the army to be assembled at Morristown. 
But if your meeting the Legislature here cannot be dispensed 
with, I wish General Parsons might be ordered for that service, 
and now take the liberty to recommend it to General Putnam by 
this express. Nevertheless, I wish you would immediately cross 
the river to General Putnam, and show him this letter, and con 
fer with him upon this important movement of the troops. 

As I have sent General Putnam a very fine brigade from 
hence, with two excellent regiments of Connecticut militia, I 
think he will be able to spare one brigade of Continental troops 
from his side, with General Parsons. 

I utterly disapprove of any attempt upon New York, knowing 
that while the enemy s" ships of force occupy the East and North 
Rivers, and there is a tolerable garrison on the Isthmus, the 
taking the city would be very doubtful ; and, when taken, it 
would be found without any military stores of consequence ; for 
those, you may be assured, are afloat; and it is also so commanded from the water, that it cannot be held, until we are 
superior at sea. 

If you cannot wait upon General Putnam yourself, send him .a 
copy of this letter, and your sentiments thereupon, with my letter 
to him inclosed. I am, 

Your Excellency s most obedient, humble servant, 

HORATIO GATES. 


COLONEL HAMILTON TO GENERAL PUTNAM. 

Head-Quarters, New Windsor, 9 November, 1777. 

Sir, 

I cannot forbear confessing, that I am astonished and alarmed 
beyond measure, to find that all his Excellency s views have been 
hitherto frustrated, and that no single step of those I mentioned 
to you has been taken to afford him the aid he absolutely stands 
in need of, and by delaying which, the cause of America is put 
to the utmost conceivable hazard. 

I so fully explained to you the General s situation, that I could 
not entertain a doubt you would make it the first object of yourattention to reenforce him with that speed the exigency of affairs 
demanded ; but, I am sorry to say, he will have too much reason 
to think other objects, in comparison with that insignificant, have 
been uppermost. I speak freely and emphatically, because I 
tremble at the consequences of the delay that has happened. 
General Clinton s reinforcement is probably by this time with 
Mr. Howe. This will give him a decisive superiority over ourarmy. What may be the issue of such a state of things, I leave 
to the feelings of every friend to his country, capable of foreseeing consequences. My expressions may perhaps have more 
warmth than is altogether proper; but they proceed from the 
overflowing of my heart, in a matter where I conceive this Continent essentially interested. I wrote to you from Albany, and desired you would send a thousand Continental troops of those first 
proposed to be left with you. This, I understand, has not been 
done. How the noncompliance can be answered to General 
Washington, you can best determine. 

I now, Sir, in the most explicit terms, by his Excellency s 
authority, give it as a positive order from him, that all the Con 
tinental troops under your command may be immediately marched 
to King s Ferry, there to cross the river, and hasten to reenforce 
the army under him. 

The Massachusetts militia are to be detained instead of them, 
until the troops coming from the northward arrive. When they 
do, they will replace, as far as I am instructed, the troops you 
shall send away in consequence of this requisition. The General s idea of keeping troops this way does not extend farther than 
covering the country from any little irruptions of small parties, 
and carrying on the works necessary for the security of the 
river. As to attacking New York, that he thinks ought to be 
out of the question at present. If men could be spared from the 
other really necessary objects, he would have no objections to at 
tempting a diversion by way of New York, but nothing farther. 

As the times of the Massachusetts and New Hampshire militia 
will soon expire, it will be proper to call in time for a reenforcement from Connecticut. Governor Clinton will do all in his 
power, to promote objects in which the State lie commands in i&gt; 
so immediately concerned. Generals Glover s and Patterson s bri 
gades are on their way down. The number of Continental troops 
necessary for this post will be furnished out of them. 

I cannot but have the fullest confidence you will use yourutmost exertions to execute the business of this letter ; and I am, 
with great respect, Sir, 

Your most obedient, 

ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 



GENERAL PUTNAM TO GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Head-Quarters, King s Street, 10 November, 1777. 

DEAR SIR, 

The night before last I arrived at this place, and shall this 
day proceed down towards the Plains. Yesterday, General Parsons and myself were down at Eastchester, and within threemiles of King s Bridge. From every appearance, the enemy seem 
much frightened. They have called in all their outguards, and 
collected their main force at the Bridge. 

Deserters come in very fast ; and, from every account I am 
able to procure, their strength at the Bridge is about two thou 
sand five hundred. Inclosed you have a late paper, which, in 
my opinion, paints their distress in many particulars. When op 
portunity will permit, I shall be glad to see you down here. My 
compliments to your brother; and I am, dear Sir, 
Your very humble servant, 

ISRAEL PUTNAM. 



ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO GENERAL WASHINGTON. 

Manor of Livingston, 14 January, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

I was honored with your Excellency s favor of the 27th of 
December, and am greatly obliged by your favorable mention 
of my brother. In my recommendation of him, I was influenced 
more by my hope of rendering him further useful to his country, than by any partial desire of serving him, without having 
the most distant wish of engaging your Excellency in any promise 
that might lead to a preference, to which he is not justly entitled, 
since neither his interest nor honor renders his continuance in 
the army necessary, his fortune putting him above the first, and 
the reputation he has already acquired, together with your Ex 
cellency s approbation, fully satisfying the last. 

That I. may not, however, seem to have been without warrant 
in my recommendation of him, I take the liberty to inclose to 
your Excellency an extract of a letter to him, written under Ge 
neral Arnold s directions, by a gentleman of his family, he being 
unable to hold the pen himself. After a warm recommendation 
of his conduct, both in the camp and the field, and giving himand his regiment a full share of the honor of the battle of the 
19th of September (in which General Arnold, not being present, 
writes only from the report of those who w r ere), he adds, " On 
the 7th of October, the conduct of your corps fell more imme 
diately under the inspection of General Arnold. He thinks it but 
justice to you and them to observe, that great part of our suc 
cess on that day was owing to the gallant part they acted in 
storming the enemy s works, and the alertness and good order 
they observed in the pursuit." I did not, in my letter to yourExcellency, allude to the dispute between Colonels Cortlandt and 
Livingston, having never interested myself further therein than to 
endeavour to prevail with my brother to yield up that preference 
to which I conceived Colonel Cortlandt s seniority entitled him, 
though it may, in some measure, be superseded by the resolutions 
of Congress. 

But I ask your Excellency s pardon for permitting any thing 
of a private nature to trespass long upon that time, which you 
generously devote to the public, and will proceed to one of more 
general concern, in which also, as an individual, I am deeply in 
terested I mean the defence of this State, and the erection of 
works on Hudson s River. I have seen your Excellency s letter 
on that subject to Governor Clinton. I wish the delicate situation in which he stands would have permitted him to have been 
more explicit in his answer, which he has also communicated to 
me. This I conceive the general permission, which your Excel 
lency has given me, to write my sentiments fully, and the atten 
tion with which you have honored my letters, together with the 
losses, which, through mismanagement, I have already sustained, 
in some measure entitle me to be. 

The military arrangement in this department is far from being 
satisfactory. The offices of Commissary, Quarter-master, &c., are 
generally unsupplied with money ; public credit is stretched be 
yond all reasonable bounds ; certificates, which are the only cash 
of these several offices, have lost their credit, from the uncertainty 
and difficulty that attend their payment ; and force alone affords 
a scanty supply to the army. This renders it impossible to lay 
up magazines, opens a wide door for frauds, and is attended witli 
the most mischievous effects upon husbandry, and the tempers of 
the people. I learn, by a letter from Mr. Lee, the demands of 
the Southern army. No great quantity of cattle are raised in 
this State, except in the county of Westchester, from whence the 
enemy draw considerable supplies, though nothing would be easier 
than to cover it from their depredations, and to supply our army 
at Peekskill from it. Flour may be procured, when the Commis 
saries are properly supplied with money, and their whole atten 
tion turned to the business of their department. It would be 
happy for us, if those engaged in the civil departments of the 
army were bound by an oath not to engage in trade. 

But I am wandering from my subject. Your Excellency is 
fully impressed with the importance of fortifying Hudson s River. 
The want of men and money must make this work go on heavily, 
or, indeed, by leaving it unfinished, waste what shall be expended. 
Your Excellency will see the necessity of pressing Congress for 
supplies of both, more especially the last. I would submit it to 
your Excellency, whether it would not be more advisable to se 
lect a body of the ablest men out of the general regiments at 
Peekskill, to carry on the works, allowing them additional pay 
as a compensation for their labor and the wear of their clothes, 
than to work in the ordinary way. Might not the troops stationed 
at Albany, also, be drawn down to that post, or part of them, at 
least ? 

Your Excellency is not ignorant of the extent of General Put 
nam s capacity and diligence ; and, how well soever these may 
qualify him for the management of this work, a most important 
command, the prejudices to which his imprudent lenity to the disaffected, and a too great intercourse with the enemy, have given 
rise, have greatly injured his influence. How far the loss of Fort 
Montgomery, and the subsequent ravages of the enemy, are to be 
imputed to him, I will not venture to say, as this will necessarily 
be determined by a Court of Inquiry, whose determinations I 
would not anticipate. Unfortunately for him, the current of popu 
lar opinions, in this and the neighbouring States, and, as far as I 
can learn, in the troops under his command, runs strongly against 
him. For my own part, I respect his bravery and former services, and sincerely lament that his patriotism will not suffer himto take that repose, to which his advanced age and past service justly entitle him. Your Excellency sees the necessity of 
spirit and activity, in this department of our officers, who in a 
fertile genius can find resources against the multiplied wants of 
this situation. Cannon should be procured^ and the forges set at 
work in making a chain. Twelve or fourteen twelve-pounders 
may be obtained at Salisbury furnace. Carriages should be prepared. In short, Sir, unless we make use of the present moment, 
the well-affected will be unwilling to remain in this State next 
summer. 

Having drawn this out to a most unreasonable length, I must 
fear trespassing upon you, and defer some other matters upon 
which I propose writing to your Excellency. In the mean while, 
I must only flatter myself that your Excellency will not only ex 
cuse, but consider the freedom with which this is written as a 
new proof of the confidence I have ever found myself inclined to 
repose in your Excellency, and which you have so frequently 
encouraged as to persuade me that I run no other hazard in 
speaking freely of men and measures, than that of sometimes trying your Excellency s patience. We have various accounts of 
their being in great dread of an unwelcome visit at New York 
during this winter. I suppose their apprehensions will be some 
what allayed by the arrival of the seventy-first and three Hes 
sian regiments, which have lately got in from Philadelphia. I 
have the honor to be, with the greatest respect and esteem, 
Your Excellency s most obedient servant, 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



GENERAL WASHINGTON TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

Head- Quarters, Valley Forge, 12 March, 1778. 

DEAR SIR, 

I should have answered your letter of the 14th of January 
before this time, had I not been daily in hopes that I should 
be able to give you a satisfactory account of a change of men 
and measures in the North River department. It has not been 
an easy matter to find a just pretence for removing an officerfrom his command, where his misconduct rather appears to result 
from want of capacity, than from any real intention of doing 
wrong; and it is, therefore, as you observe, to be lamented, that 
he cannot see his own defects, and make an honorable retreat 
from a station in which he only exposes his own weakness. 

Proper measures are taking to carry on the inquiry into the 
loss of Fort Montgomery, agreeably to the directions of Congress ; 
and it is more than probable, from what I have heard, that the 
issue of that inquiry will afford just grounds for a removal of 
General P. But whether it does or not, the prejudices of all 
ranks in that quarter against him are so great, that he must, at 
all events, be prevented from returning. I hope to introduce a 
gentleman in his place, if the general course of the service will 
admit of it, who will be perfectly agreeable to the State and to 
the public. In the mean time, I trust that General Parsons will 
do every thing in his power to carry on the works, which, from 
his last accounts, are in more forwardness than I had expected. 

I wish that all the men in the upper part of the river had 
been drawn down to the Highlands, instead of being kept to 
carry on an expedition, in which I never was consulted, but 
which I saw from the beginning could never succeed, from a 
variety of reasons, which it would be needless to give to you, or 
any man acquainted with the state of the country through which 
it was to have passed. Those who were the most sanguine, I 
fancy, now see the impracticability of it. 

Peekskill and the neighbouring posts were, by a resolve of 
Congress, included in the Northern department, and the care of 
carrying on the works put under the direction of the officer commanding in that district. General Gates being, soon after the 
resolve, called to the Board of War, he had no opportunity of 
doing any thing towards it. Whether there will be any alteration 
in the extent of the command this campaign, I cannot tell. But, 
if it falls again into that department more immediately under my 
particular command, you may depend that all the attention due 
to posts so important shall be paid to them. 
I am, &c., 

GEORGE WASHINGTON.
