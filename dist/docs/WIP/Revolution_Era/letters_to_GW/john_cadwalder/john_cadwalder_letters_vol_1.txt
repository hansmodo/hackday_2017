SIR, 
</p><p>
The river was so full of ice that it was impossible 
to pass above Bristol, where I intended, and there 
fore concluded to make an attempt at Dunks's Ferry. 
As soon as it was dark, I sent down all the boats I 
could muster, and marched down about eight o clock. 
I embarked a few men to line the river, and prevent any person escaping to give intelligence to the 
enemy ; and these were followed by a part of the 
first battalion of militia, then two field-pieces, with 
which I went over to see if it was practicable to 
land them, and, upon examination, found it was impossible, the ice being very thick. Upon reporting 
this to the field-officers, they were all of opinion 
that it would not be proper to proceed without can 
non. During this time the third battalion was land 
ed. We concluded to withdraw the troops that had 
passed, but could not effect it till near four o clock 
this morning. The whole then were ordered to march 
for Bristol. 
</p><p>
I imagine the badness of the night must have prevented you from passing, as you intended.! Our 
men turned out cheerfully. We had about eighteen 
hundred rank and file, including artillery. It will be 
impossible for the enemy to pass the river till the 
ice will bear. Would it not be proper to attempt to cross below, and join <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a>, who was to 
go over from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> to-day, with five hundred 
men, which number, added to the four hundred Jersey militia which Colonel Griffin left there, would 
make a formidable body. This would cause a diver 
sion, that would favor any attempt you may design in 
future, and would expose their baggage and stores, 
if they attempt to cross. It is impossible, in our 
present situation, to cooperate with <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a>. 
The militia will be easier kept together by being in 
motion. We shall have some service from Colonel 
Hitchcock's brigade, whose time of enlistment will be 
up in a few days. We have procured a considerable 
number of shoes, stockings, and breeches for them. 
They are in good spirits, and enlist very fast, I am, 
Sir, with great respect, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servant,

SIR, 
</p><p>
As I did not hear from you this morning, and being  prepared to embark, I concluded you were still 
on this side, and therefore embarked, and landed 
about fifteen hundred men about two miles above 
Bristol. After a considerable number were landed, 
I had information from the Paymaster of Colonel Hitchcock's brigade, that you had crossed over from 
<a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>. This defeated the scheme of joining your 
army. We were much embarrassed which way to 
proceed. I thought it most prudent to retreat; but 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jor' rel='colleague'>Colonel Reed</a> was of opinion that we might safely 
proceed to Burlington, and recommended it warmly, 
lest it should have a bad effect on the militia, who 
were twice disappointed. The landing in open day 
light must have alarmed the enemy, and we might 
have been cut off by all their force collected to this 
place. We had intelligence, immediately afterward, 
that the enemy had left the Black Horse and Mount Holley. Upon this we determined to proceed to Burlington. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jor' rel='colleague'>Colonel Reed</a> and two other officers went on, from 
one point to another, till they came to Bordentown, 
where they found the coast clear. <a href='/results.php?tla=jor' rel='colleague'>Colonel Reed</a> and 
Colonel Coxe are now there, and we shall march, at 
four to-morrow morning, for that place. This information has induced me to proceed, though not quite 
conformable to your orders, which I received on the 
march this afternoon. If you should think proper to 
cross over, it may be easily effected at the place 
where we passed. A pursuit would keep up the panic. 
</p><p>
They went off with great precipitation, and pressed 
all the wagons in their reach. I am told many of 
them are gone to South Amboy. If we can drive 
them from West Jersey, the success will raise an 
army by next spring, and establish the credit of the 
Continental money to support it. I shall write to-morrow, I hope, from <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>. I am, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, very humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jhc" rel="me">JOHN CADWALADER</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I have two six-pounders, brass, and two 
three-pounders, iron.
