DEAR SIR ; 
</p><p>
I should have troubled you with a few lines if any 
thing had occurred to me that might, in the least, 
tend to promote the service. You receive such a multitude of letters, that I can hardly think myself excused in taking up so much of your time as to thank 
you for the civilities I received from you at camp. 
</p><p>
I shall be happy to hear that you have passed the 
winter undisturbed; and that you have been able to 
keep your army together. My fears about provisions 
and forage, I confess, still give me great pain. 
</p><p>
Recruiting in this and the next county below succeeds better than I expected. One half of the quota 
required of each county is, I am well informed, made up, and the remainder will soon be completed. The 
farmers are in great fear of a law to draft the militia; and they are exerting themselves to the utmost 
in assisting the recruiting officers. 
</p><p>
There is no person who more sincerely wishes success to the cause of America than I do ; and I should 
have esteemed it an honor to have been continued in 
the command I had in Pennsylvania, if the Government had been such a one as promised that freedom 
and happiness for which we are contending with 
Great Britain. I now no longer look upon myself asa resident of that State, and am at a loss to know 
what part I shall act in this. As soon as the campaign opens, I shall endeavour to make myself useful 
in some way or other. 
</p><p>
The importance of Billingsport to us, if we should 
be able to act offensively, has not, I dare say, escaped 
your notice. But I am apprehensive the enemy know too well its consequence to neglect to take possession 
of it before we dare to do it. Five or six hundred 
men might defend it against a storm ; but would it 
be possible to keep it till we could collect force 
enough to make an attempt by siege dangerous to 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>? The possession of this post may re 
quire such a variety of movements, that it appears to 
me a very considerable number of boats will be necessary. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to present my compliments to Mrs. 
<a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>. With the sincerest esteem and respect, 
I remain, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, and very humble servant,

MY DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I was on the Western Shore when your favor by 
Captain Lee reached my house ; and as I was daily 
expected home, General Dickinson did not forward it; 
by which means I cannot have the pleasure of seeing 
you so soon as I could wish. 
</p><p>
I always proposed spending the active part of the 
campaign in camp, but I did not conceive the enemy 
could possibly take the field till towards the 1st of 
June, owing to the difficulties of subsisting their 
horses before that time; and, therefore, I have not 
made the necessary preparation for setting off immediately, agreeably to your wishes. But, be assured, I 
shall exert myself, to the utmost, in getting some 
matters of importance to my private affairs settled ; 
after which, I shall lose no time in paying my compliments to you in camp. 
</p><p>
The wishes you kindly express, to see me engaged 
in the service, I esteem the greatest honor; but an 
appointment to any command, at this time, would probably create great complaints ; which, instead of occasioning, I wish to prevent. I have not the vanity 
to think my assistance at camp can be important to 
the service ; but, small as it may be, I conceive it my 
duty to offer it at this critical time ; reflecting, that 
if it is of no value to my country, it will cost it 
nothing. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to present my compliments to the gentlemen of your family; and believe me to be, with 
the greatest respect and esteem, your affectionate and 
most obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
The honorable command given me lately by Congress, would have been very agreeable, if I had not 
conceived the war to be near the close. You may remember, in the last conversation I had with your Excellency, I gave my reasons fully for declining any command in the army. 
</p><p>
It is no small mortification to me, that, by not entering early into the service, I lost the opportunity 
of sharing the honors which many officers have gained by serving under your command. 
</p><p>
The civilities I received from you, whilst I remained in your family at camp, will ever be remembered 
with gratitude ; and if our affairs should again take 
an unfortunate turn, be assured you have not a friend 
more ready than I shall be to share your dangers. 
</p><p>
I most sincerely wish you may live to see the 
liberties of your country established upon the broadest foundation ; which I know has ever been your only object, from the beginning of this contest. I 
am, clear Sir, with the greatest esteem, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>
