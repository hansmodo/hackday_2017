RELATING TO THE 



AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 



FROM ROBERT R. LI\TC!^GSTON. * 

Trenton, 22 June, 1780. 

Dear Sir, 
My anxiety for the supplies of the army has 
brought me to this place, in order that I might sa- 
tisfy myself as to the quantity on hand, and the 
means of forwarding them. General Knox has com- 
municated to me your Excellency's orders on this 
subject. Nothing short of them would, I am fully 
persuaded, be of' sufficient force to produce the de- 
sired effect; and the knowledge of them will, in a 
great measure, render the execution of them unneces- 
sary. Impressed with this idea, I have been long 
laboring to bring Congress to assume the power w^hich 
will enable them to call forth the resources of the 
States, but unhappily without effect. However, I hope| 
much from their pressing and reiterated demands. i 
What principally induced me to trouble your Excel- 
lency at this time, is an apprehension which I, in 
common with many other gentlemen, entertain of the 
propriety of leaving the command at West Point in 

* At this time a Deleijate in Congress from New York,

the hands of General Howe. Havmg no personal ac- 
quaintance with him, I can have no prejudices, but 
the gentlemen from the southward by no means speak 
so favorably of him as I could wish. But in this, 
I conceive, that as yet he has had no opportunity of 
acquiring a military character. But confidence, which 
is so necessary to inspire courage, especially in mili- 
tia, will, I fear, be wanting in him. If I might pre- 
sume so far, I should beg leave to submit it to your 
Excellency, whether this post might not be most safe- 
ly confided to General Arnold, whose courage is un- 
doubted, who is the favorite of our militia, and who 
wdll agree perfectly with our Governor. 

Your Excellency will not consider this as design- 
ed to convey the most distant reflection on General 
Howe, of whom I know nothing but by report, which 
may very possibly be ill grounded; but, if the most 
distant doubt remains, in a matter of so much mo- 
ment, I conceive it should be removed. I make no 
other apology for the liberty I take, than the motive 
that suggests it, which has before now induced your 
Excellency to pardon an interference in matters to 
which 1 was no more competent than the present. 
This hasty letter is written while the express waits, 
whom I am unwilling to detain longer than while I 
declare the respect and esteem with which I am, 
your Excellency's 

Most obedient and humble servant, 

Robert B. Livingston. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 3 

FROM DANIEL OF ST. THOMAS JENIFER AND JONATHAN 

BEALL. 

In General Assembly, Annapolis, 22 June, 1780. 

Sir, 

The extreme difficulty of embod^dng and marching 
the number of militia, required of this State by your 
Excellency and the Committee of Cooperation; the 
impracticability of marching them in due time, owing 
to the total want of camp equipage, arms, and ac- 
coutrements; the difficulty of procuring wagons and 
horses; the approaching harvest, and the importance 
and necessity of securing it, — have induced us to lay 
before your Excellency the following proposition. If 
it should meet with your approbation, and that of 
the Committee, we will stretch every nerve to carry 
it speedily into execution. 

We propose to exert our utmost endeavours to 
raise two thousand regulars, to serve during the war, 
fourteen hundred and sixty-nine of this number to 
complete our battalions, according to the late propos- 
ed augmentation. The residue we propose ta form 
into a regiment, to act in the place of the militia re- 
quired; and this State will furnish and fill up the 
regiment, to its full complement, to join the Conti- 
nental army, whenever we shall be called on to furnish 
aid of militia ; and we flatter ourselves that, as long 
as we furnish our quota of regulars, and this addi- 
tional battalion, we shall not be required to furnish 
militia, unless in cases of extreme exigency. 

This plan, if generally adopted, would put under 
your Excellency's direction and command a regular 
and efficient force, on which you could constantly de- 
pend. It would save a great expense to these States 
in carriage, provisions, arms, and accoutrements. It 



4 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

would conduce to reconcile the minds of the people 
to the heavy charges of the war, when assured they 
should be left at home, to cultivate their lands, and 
reap the fruits of their industry. It would certainly 
tend to increase our crops, and afford the means of 
maintaining a much greater regular army than can 
he supported under frequent calls of the militia. It 
would, in some degree, prevent those emigrations of 
our men westward, which is become a very serious 
and alarming consideration to these States in gene- 
ral, and to this in particular. 

If your Excellency, on a view of all circumstances, 
should think it more conducive to the public interest 
to order the fourteen hundred and sixty-nine recruits, 
destined to fill up our battalions, to join the army 
under your immediate command, they shall be sent 
forward with all the despatch in our power. 

If this proposal should meet with your Excellency's 
approbation, and that of the Committee, it will be 
necessary, we apprehend, to draw from our battalions, 
under the Baron de Kalb, a number of officers to 
command, form, and discipline these neAv recruits. 

If the two thousand two hundred and five militia 
should be thought absolutely necessary, and prefera- 
ble to the plan proposed, we will use our utmost en- 
deavours to forward them on; but we fear, however 
strong our inclination, it will not be in our power to 
send out that number by the time required. 

We have the honor to be, with the highest respect 
and attachment. Sir, your Excellency's 

Most obedient and most humble servants, 
Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer, 

President of tJie Senate. 
Jonathan Beall, 
SjyeaJcer of the House of Delegates. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 5 

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LORD STIRLING. 

23 June, 1780. 

Dear Sir, 

Just as I was setting out this morning to join 
your Excellency, I had intelligence that the enemy 
were out, and advancing to Springfield. I immedi- 
ately wrote to the Commanding Officers of the mili- 
tia, from Burlington to near Easton (and despatched 
messengers with the letters open) ; desired them to 
push doAvn for further orders ; and wrote General 
Greene what I had done, that he might, in case the 
enemy retired, send them counter orders. I then 
came through part of Morris county to Chatham, to 
see if I could be of any use in that quarter. I there 
met with General Wilkinson and Charles Stewart, 
who assured me that the enemy, after advancing to 
Springfield, and burning also every house there, 
had retired. The last I can find of them, their rear 
had passed the four-mile stone from Elizabethtown, on 
full trot. Some militia had got in their rear, and 
others attending their flanks, as regular as their 
flanking parties in their approach. They were early 
skirmished with ; they were checked for some time 
at Connecticut Farms ; the bridge at Springfield was 
nobly contended, for near forty minutes. The fork 
of the road, near Campbell's Mills, was so well dis- 
puted as to stop the further progress of the enemy's 
right column. 

In short, in every part, our troops. Continental and 
militia, have behaved gloriously, and have made the 
enemy pay dearly for their jaunt. General Wilkin- 
son informed me that General Greene had intelli- 
gence that all the enemy's flanking companies were 
to embark last night. I saw six British and Yagers 



6 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

prisoners at Chatham, who all agreed that General 
Knyphaiisen commanded this day. I suspect Sir 
Harry means to make some lively stroke above you. 
I met General Wayne near Chatham, where he in- 
tends to wait your Excellency's further orders. I 
shall be on to join your Excellency early in the 
morning; and am, most sincerely, 

Your Excellency's most humble servant, 

Stirling. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 
Near Bryant's Tavern, 11 o'clock, 23 June, 1780. 

Dear General, 

I informed your Excellency, this morning, that the 
enemy were on the advance, in force. I now ac- 
quaint you that they proceeded, with vigor, until 
they had gained Connecticut Farms ; they then were 
checked by Colonel Dayton's regiment. They have 
since advanced, in two formidable columns, on the 
Springfield and Vauxhall roads. After very obstinate 
resistance, they are now in possession of Springfield, 
with one column ; with the other, they are advanced 
near the bridge leading to Vauxhall where Angell's 
pickets lay. From present prospects, they are direct- 
ing their force against this pass, which I am deter- 
mined to dispute, so far as I am capable. They are 
pushing a column to our left, perhaps to gain the 
pass in our rear towards Chatham. If they pursue 
this object, we must abandon our present j)osition 
The militia turn, and are few ; and that few are so 
divided as to render little or no support. 

They advance with seven pieces of artillery in 
front, and appear not disposed to risk much. The

militia are collecting, and I hope to derive support 
from them. I am 
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 

Nathanael Greene. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Springfield, 7 o'clock, A. M., 24 June, 1780. 

Dear Sir, 

I make use of the first moment to acquaint your 
Excellency, that the whole force of the enemy, which 
has been in Jersey, went from Elizabethtown Point 
between twelve and one o'clock this morninc:. Whe- 
ther they crossed to Staten Island, or embarked on 
board their shipping, I am not yet sufficiently in- 
formed, although it is reported they have embarked 
and proceeded up Ilackensac River. To the latter I 
give but little credit. However, I shall take imme- 
diate measures to ascertain the truth, and discover 
their present position and designs, as far as is pos- 
sible. 

I shall do myself the honor to state to your Ex- 
cellency, as soon as I have leisure, the proceedings 
of yesterday; and, in the interim, I am. 

Your most obedient, humble servant, 

Nath-Inael Greene.'^ 

P. S. I have ordered General Wayne to join the 
army under your Excellency's immediate command, 
and beg to receive your directions respecting the re- 
mainder of the troops.

Washington's Writings, Vol. VII. p. 506. 



8 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM GOVERNOR GREENE, OF RHODE ISLAND. 

Providence, 25 June, 1780. 

Sir, 

I have the honor to inclose to you a resolve of 
the Council of War, of this date, in consequence of a 
letter from the Committee of Congress, of the 12th in- 
stant, inclosing yours of the 11th, wherein the Com- 
mittee most earnestly conjure us to send forward the 
troojDS of this State, without delay. The Council being 
apprehensive that the measure taken by the aforesaid 
resolve, might interfere with your Excellency's orders, 
and anxious to furnish you the most speedy reen- 
forcement of this State's quota, have requested me 
to write your Excellency on this subject^ that your 
j^leasure thereon might be known. 

The General Assembly have ordered six hundred 
and ten men to be raised, to complete this State's 
quota, and, for that purpose, have i^roportioned them 
to the several towns, to be raised and rendezvous at 
this place by the first day of July. Some are al- 
ready raised, and every exertion of Government will 
be made to complete this number, as well as to fur- 
nish the supplies required by the Committee. Your 
Excellency may be assured this State will make every 
exertion in their power to answer the expectations 
of the public. I am, with the utmost esteem, 

Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 

William Greene. 



FROM captain HENRY LEE. 



Paramus, 28 June, 1780. 

I wrote your Excellency this morning ; since which 



I 



THE AMERICAN KEVOLUTION. 9 

I have acquired more explicit knowledge of the ene- 
my's situation in Bergen woods. They certainly ma}' 
be expelled the country; perhaps they may be made 
prisoners. It would give peace to the inhabitants for 
twenty miles around, and very much assist agricul- 
ture. Scarce a night passes but ten or twelve horses 
are stolen. Another good consequence would result 
from this expedition ; we might collect two or three 
hundred bushels of forage. Our horses are in great 
want. I have fifty infantry now with me ; one hun- 
dred more will be necessary. If your Excellency ap- 
proves of the attempt, I wish to attempt it to-morrow 
night; therefore the necessary reenforcement ought 
to arrive at Paramus Meeting-IIouse by ten o'clock 
in the morning. I shall wait here for your Excel- 
lency's answer. 

Yours most respectfully, 

Henry Lee, Jr. 

N. B. If they cannot reach Paramus by ten, we 
must postpone till the next night. In this case, I 
wish them to halt to-morrow (till they hear from me) 
at My. Fell's. 



FROM COLONEL BRODHEAD. 

Fort Pitt, 2Q June, 1780. 

Dear General, 

I take the liberty to inclose the copy of a letter 
I have received from Colonel Bowman, and copies of 
three several letters from the Reverend Mr. Zeisber- 
ger. The accounts contained in them are somewhat 
alarming ; but I hope that my messages to the dif- 



10 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

ferent Indian nations will prevent the British from 
carrying their expedition into execution. 

Captain-Lieutenant Brady is just returned from 
Sandusky. He took two squaws prisoners, within a 
mile of their principal town. One of them made her 
escape after six daj^s' march ; the other he brought to 
Cuscusky, where he met seven warriors, who had 
taken a woman and child from Chartier's Creek. He 
fired upon the Captain of the party and killed him, 
and has brought in the white woman and the In- 
dian's scalp; but the squaw made her escape at the 
same time. When Captain Brady fired upon the In- 
dian party, he had but three white men, and only 
two rounds of powder left. He was without provi- 
sions for six days, but has brought his whole party 
safe to this place. His perseverance, zeal, and good 
conduct, certainly entitle him to promotion; and I 
beg leave to recommend him to your Excellency's 
notice. 

I have provisions, at the dependent posts, for four 
weeks to come ; and, by collecting all the cattle in 
the possession of the Commissaries, this garrison may 
be subsisted for the same term. But what I shall 
do for further supplies, I cannot devise, unless I send 
out foraging parties, and impress cattle; for the pub- 
lic has neither money nor credit here. 

The artillery is arrived, and the military stores are 
safely lodged. The company consists of three officers, 
and twenty-five non-commissioned officers and pri- 
vates. I have not had the honor of a line from your 
Excellency since that of the 14th of March; but I 
hope one may be on the road for me, before this 
reaches head-quarters. Captain Mclntyre will set out, 
a few days hence, towards the Indian country, with 
a small party of men, to take some prisoners or

scalps. Witli the most sincere respect and esteem, I 
have the honor to he, your Excellency's 

Most ohedient, and most humble servant, 

Daniel Brodhead. 



FROM GOVERNOR JEFFERSON. 

Riclimond, 2 July, 1780. 

Sir, 

I have received, from the Committee of Congress, 
at head-quarters, three letters calling for aids of men 
and provisions. I beg leave to refer you to my let- 
ter to them, of this date, on those subjects. I thought 
it necessary, however, to suggest to you the prepar- 
ing an arrangement of officers for the men; for, 
though they are to supply our battalions, yet, as our 
whole Line Officers, almost, are in captivity, I suppose 
some temporary provision must be made. We cheer- 
fully transfer to you every power which the Execu- 
tive might exercise on this occasion. As it is possible 
you may cast your eye on the unemployed officers 
now within the State, I write to General Muhlenberg 
to send you a return of them. I think the men will 
be rendezvoused within the present month. The bill, 
indeed, for raising them is not actually passed, but 
it is in its last stage, and no opposition to any es- 
sential parts of it. I will take care to notify you of 
its passage. 

I have, with great pain, perceived your situation; 
and the more so, as being situated between two fires. 
A division of sentiment has arisen, both in Congress 
and here, as to where the resources of this country 
should be sent. The removal of General Clinton to 
the northward must, of course, have great influence 



12 LETTERS TO AVASHINGTON. 

on the determination of this question ; and I have n 
doubt hut considerable aids may be drawn hence for 
your army, unless a larger one should be embodied 
in the south, than the force of the enemy there seems 
to call for. I have the honor to be, with every sen- 
timent of respect and esteem, 
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 

Thomas Jefferson. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL HEATH. 

Newport, 12 July, 1780. 

Dear General, 

I arrived here the last night, and this morning 
had the honor of congratulating Monsieur le Compte de Rochambeau, and Monsieur le Chevalier de Ternay, 
on their safe arrival in this harbour. The fleet con- 
sists of seven sail of the line ; — the Due de Bur- 
gogne, of eighty guns ; Le Neptune and Le Con- 
querant, of seventy-four; Le Jason, L'Eville, L' Ardent, 
and Le Provence, of sixty-four; Le Fantasque, hos- 
pital ship, of sixty-four, mounts forty guns; two fri- 
gates and two bombs, with about five thousand land 
forces and one thousand marines. 

The inhabitants appear disposed to treat our allies 
with much respect. The town is to be illuminated 
this evening, by a vote of the inhabitants. For my- 
self, I am charmed with the officers. I have promis- 
ed them every assistance in my power. Monsieur Rochambeau has desired me to publish an advertise- 
ment, inviting the inhabitants to bring small meats, 
vegetables, &c., to market, and that they shall receive 
hard money in payment. This the Count intended 
with a good view to our currency. I have told him 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 13 

it will have a different effect, and that even at a 
distance. I shall, therefore, only assure the farmers 
that they will receive a handsome price. I have the 
honor to be, with the greatest respect. 

Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

William Hex\.til 

P. S. Inclosed is copy of a resolve of the General 
Assembly of this State. I have ventured to grant a 
pardon to such deserters from Colonel Greene's regi- 
ment as return by the first of September next, and 
hope it will meet your Excellency's approbation, as 
some of the deserters are at a distance. 



FROM BRIG/VDIER-GENERAL STARK. 

Exeter, 13 July, 1780. 

Dear Gener.il, 
Very much fatigued, I arrived in New Hampshire 
in seven days from the time I left you, and am 
very happy to acquaint you that the people of New 
Hampshire behave with the greatest spirit. The six 
hundred men required, are, for the general part, on 
their march ; the nine hundred, I hope, wdll be ready 
to march by the middle of next week; and, by their 
present exertions, I cannot doubt but by that time 
they will be on the move. Some of them have al- 
ready marched. I have directed them, at first, to 
rendezvous at Springfield. The way of Claverac is 
certainly much out of the route to the present sta- 
tion of the army; but, nevertheless, if you have any 
particular reasons for their moving by Claverac, let 
me know, and your orders shall be punctually com- 
plied with. 

vol. in. 2 



14 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

I have conferred with the Committee. They tell 
me they have wrote, and are surprised their letters 
have not reached you. The State has collected, and 
are still collecting, cattle for the use of the army. 
Every one seems sanguinely determined to do some- 
thing of importance this campaign. As soon as the 
main hody has moved, I shall follow. Springfield 
will he my first stop. There I hope to hear from 
you ; but, if not, shall move agreeably to my instruc- 
tions. I am, dear Sir, with much respect and esteem, 
Your most obedient, humble servant, 

John Stark. 



FEOM GOVERNOR RODNEY, OF DELAWARE. 

Dover, 13 July, 1780. 

Sir, 

I heretofore informed you that the several matters, 
recommended by joiiv Excellency and the Committee 
of Cooperation, as well as those recommended by Con- 
gress, were laid before the General Assembly ; and, 
since they adjourned, I wrote to your Excellency 
how far they had complied with the several requisi- 
tions. But I find, by your letter of the oOtli ultimo, 
I have not been sufficiently explicit with respect to 
filling up the State regiment, to the number of five 
hundred and four, rank and file. I am sorry to in- 
form you that the Legislature have no otherwise 
complied therewith, than by appointing persons with- 
in the State to the recruiting service, owing, as I 
am informed by some of the members, to the regi- 
ment's being to the southward. 

I have appointed the officers, and issued orders for 
assembling the regiments, directed to be raised from 



p 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 15 

the militia of tMs State, and am in expectation that 
they will be at the place of rendezvous by the time 
assigned in your letter of the oOth ultimo. However, 
I am of opinion that the great bounties given for 
men to fill this, will effectually prevent our recruiting 
in future the State regiment, which, I am persuaded, 
is of much more importance. 

You will find, by the act for furnishing supplies of 
provisions, forage, &c., that the General Assembly 
have invested me with certain powers, for the more 
speedy obtaining the same, which powers, your Ex- 
cellency may be assured, I shall ^dgorously and 
steadily exert for the good of the service. I am. Sir, 
with every sentiment of esteem and respect, 
Your Excellency's most obedient^ humble servant, 

Cesar Rodney. 



FROM PRESIDENT REED. 

Philadelphia, 15 July, 1780, 

Dear Sir, 

I must acknowledge and thank you most cordially 
for your truly friendly and valuable letter of the 4th 
instant. I consider it as an inestimable mark of 
that esteem, of which, with a kind allowance for hu- 
man frailty, I trust I am not altogether unworthy, 
and which I shall be solicitous to improve and pre- 
serve, as adding dignity and value to my life. 

I am sensible of the delicacy of my station, and 
that, whether I go forward or stand still, I run infi- 
nite hazard. However, personal considerations are 
secondary; I am willing to run any personal risk, if 
the measure bids fair to serve the public interests. 



16 LETTEKS TO WASHINGTON. 

But there are political impossibilities, as insurmount- 
able, almost, as physical or moral, and which prescribe 
limits to power and influence equally impassable. 
The Turk, as despotic as he is, cannot lay a new tax 
upon his subjects ; nor can the King of France, arbi- 
trary as he is, violate the rank of his army. The 
powers, therefore, supposed to be vested in me, how- 
ever extensive, must, I take it, to be used with suc- 
cess, have a constant respect and attention to the 
feeling and general approbation of the people. I say 
supposed, because they are not vested in me singly, 
but in the Council, which is composed of five per- 
sons, some of whom have just pretensions, from their 
abilities, to very respectable characters. However they 
may be influenced by reason or argument, I neither 
wish, nor do possess, that influence which gains the 
opinion, without convincing the judgment. Their con- 
currence I must have in every case, and then the 
powers must be exercised under the restrictions I 
have mentioned. 

I entirely agree with you, my dear Sir, that, in 
general, the best way to preserve the confidence of 
the people, is to promote their true interest; but 
then a question arises, whether they ought not to see 
their interest, and the case to be such, as they will be 
disposed to see it, when proper evidence appears. If 
a General declines battle because his interest is to de- 
lay or retreat, he may venture, and ought to get over 
the false shame of appearing to decline action; for he 
is certain that time will do him justice, and there is 
no permanent rooted passion of the mind to combat 
his prospects. But, where property is to be invaded, 
force used, life, perhaps, endangered in the struggle 
(for w^e have had oflicers killed in execution of the 
clearest law), I conceive common prudence suggests, 



THE AMEKICAN REVOLUTION. 1 



l-r 



not merely a decisive, but also a cautious line. For 
I have found, by experience, that where you touch 
the property, be it of Whig or Tory, arguments, re- 
sulting from public good or public necessity, have 
very little weight. In the present instance, the de- 
mands for supplies are of such magnitude that the 
Whigs, both real and professional, must bear great 
part. There are but two modes of procuring them, 
persuasion and force ; the former must be accompa- 
nied with money, which we have not; for such has 
been the waste of public confidence, that every dol- 
lar we can furnish is anticipated, by the calls of Con- 
gress, long before it reaches our treasury. Force, 
then, must be used upon so great a proportion, that 
it may be said to be nearly all. But from whence 
is this force to come ? It must be the force of the 
country against the country. Experience enables me 
to say, that it is difficult to turn the force of the 
country against the Tories; for, in themselves, they 
are considerable in point of numbers and weight ; but 
the support they receive from degenerate Whigs, for 
the sake of discrediting the government, enables them, 
if not wholly to defeat, to weaken the best measures 
for the public welfare, lest their enemies should get 
some reputation. I could give you some surprising 
instances of this, if it was necessary, and that from 
men Avho figure highly as Whigs in profession. 

One mode they have taken is, to depreciate and 
discredit the State money, wliich they know is one 
of the principal means of enabling us to procure the 
supplies. It is an undoubted fact, that, after acknow- 
ledging its credit, and agreeing, under their hands, 
to take it in all payments, it is frequently refused 
but for goods ; and then they lay an additional price, 
though they have solemnly agreed to receive it as 
2* 



18 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

gold and silver. By arts and practices of this kind ; 
by thwarting every measure of government; refusing 
even communication with it; setting up schemes of 
individuals ; drawing off both the articles and the 
means of procuring them, — they not only mean to 
raise some reputation themselves (to which I have no 
objection), but the principal view is, to discredit us 
for not doing what they have prevented, and drive 
us to use violent methods, which, in addition to the 
heavy taxes, will disgust the people, and induce them 
to seek relief in a change of counsels. 

A general combination seems to be entered into 
among them, to exaggerate the resources and sup- 
plies of this State far beyond their real bounds ; and 
what I consider as the most unhappy is, that it is so 
agreeable that every ear catches the impression with 
greediness; and even minds that we cannot suppose 
interested in our disputes, receive the impression, and 
act under its influence. My situation, and acquaint- 
ance with the State, gives me a good opportunity to 
know, and I have taken care to inform myself x\f- 
ter making such a sacrifice of my own time and pros- 
pects, to the apparent ruin of my family, I cannot 
be suspected of sparing others unnecessarily. I can, 
therefore, with great truth declare, that the State does 
not possess those supplies which some give out; and 
it is obvious from the state of things, which cannot 
lie. In the first place, there are great numbers who 
will not cultivate or improve their lands as formerly, 
but only raise what is barely necessary for their own 
support, and, lately, to pay the taxes. All that sur- 
plus, which formed a great exportation, is not pro- 
duced. In the second place, we have four entire coun- 
ties, formerly productive of taxes and exports, which 
now draw their support from the interior country, and 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 19 

must have constant advances of money, aid of men, 
&c., to an amount far beyond what strangers or dis- 
tant observers can suppose. In the third place, the 
enormous debts of the Quarter-master's and Commis- 
sary's departments, and the depreciation of the money, 
have poisoned all the springs of industry. Finding, 
by experience, that they receive no value, not even a 
nominal one ; well knowing, that while a war is to 
be carried on, their property, if found, must go, they 
not only have not the usual spur to acquire it, but 
they are laid under the strongest temptations to have 
as little as may be subject to this risk. A most in- 
fallible proof of what I advance is, that even for spe- 
cie, so sought and coveted, articles cannot be procur- 
ed, even of country produce, but at thirty-three and 
a third advance on former prices. This, surely, is no 
argument of plenty. 

Our trade is supposed, by many, to be a source 
of wealth and strength ; but every day's experience 
shows the fallacy of this reasoning. A supply of a 
few necessary articles is indispensable, and for which 
the luxury of the country might be sent out. But 
what are our importations? Sugar, wines, spirits, and 
gewgaws of every kind, only calculated to gratify 
pride, intemperance and folly ; and for these the men 
and provisions of the country are sent forth in cjuan- 
tities and numbers that would give us great relief, 
if applied to the service of the country. When the 
enemy made their incursion into New Jersey, and the 
most alarming consequences were apprehended, we 
laid an embargo, which lasted only eight days; 
but it is difficult to describe the clamor this created, 
though, in the judgment of the most considerate, a 
measure important to the safety of the city itself 
The merchants sent a deputation to know our rea-

sons, and to expostulate with ns on tliis invasion of 
tlieir property, and restraint of their business. In 
short, there is no measure we pursue, which touches 
interest or pride, but a powerful opposition is imme- 
diately made ; and it has become such a fashion to 
find fliult with the State of Pennsylvania, that most 
of our young politicians set out with it as their first 
and capital lesson. 

Being influenced very much by your Excellency's 
opinion last winter, that we could not rely upon vo- 
luntary enlistment, but must have recourse to drafts 
to answer the demands of the campaign, I pressed 
the measure last March with all my might, but with- 
out success. Such are the circumstances, and such 
the disposition of the people, that the Assembly 
would not venture to pass the bill ; nor, if they had, 
do I now think it would have been carried into exe- 
cution; for no measure has been more generally re- 
probated. The cry is for voluntary enlistments; and 
the most confident assertions are made, that a sufii- 
cient number of men would have been procured, and 
on better terms. And now, such is the temper of 
the counties, that they absolutely refuse to march the 
drafts to the army, alleging the necessity of defend- 
ing themselves and friends against the savages. The 
whole amount of these drafts would be twelve hun- 
dred, of which we suppose about one thousand might 
be thrown into the line; that we could then make 
some addition of voluntary recruits, and pick up some 
deserters, so as to fill up the deficiency stated last 
winter, namely, fourteen hundred and twenty-five men. 

Except militia, I dare not flatter myself with any 
considerable additions. And when it is considered 
what heavy losses this State had in troops in 1770 ; 
the great proportion of our people who will not bear 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 21 

arms under any pretext ; the force to be kept on the 
frontiers; the drain which trade and privateers will 
unavoidably make ; and the number which have been 
enlisted during the war, and consequently kept con- 
stantly in the field, subject to all the casualties of 
disease, desertion, &c., — I cannot help thinking we 
are entitled to some degree of credit for what we 
have done, as well as what we may do. I have 
never sought after comparisons Avith other States, but 
have ever understood, that (Maryland excepted) this 
State always had a greater proportion of troops in 
the field than any State, unless we reckoned the ill- 
selected drafts that came in from some Eastern States, 
a proportion of which would not pass muster, and the 
rest went home as soon as they became soldiers. As 
to men enlisted for the war, this State has certainly 
ever had a great proportion, and would have retained 
a much greater, if the Land-Office in Virginia had 
not afforded both an asylum and a temptation for de- 
sertion. We now have very sufficient evidence, that 
great numbers of the deserters are at Kentucky, and 
its vicinities, where they are free from taxes, militia 
duties, and other burdens, and enjoy a sort of savage 
freedom, which is highly pleasing to some minds. 

With respect to militia, I hope we shall be able to 
produce the number required without much difficulty, 
now the harvest is got in; but a call three weeks 
sooner would have been very distressing, and, I fear, 
impracticable, from the great scarcity of laborers in 
the country ; that class of people being distressed by 
the war. I cannot say that I am very sanguine in 
my expectations of their being very useful, as they 
have not, in many instances, had that practice and 
familiarity with danger, which many other States have 
had. But the principal reason is, that the gentlemen 



22 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

having generally withdrawn themselves entirely, or 
into separate corps, these officers are not such as I 
could wish, though there are some, of whom we ex- 
pect respectable service. 

We have been using every exertion to procure a 
number of teams, as well voluntarily as by impress, 
and they are coming in daily ; but the Quarter-mas- 
ter's department is so deranged, that it is attended 
with considerable difficulty. I have frequently been 
obliged to interest myself to get them forage and 
provisions, as they are not officially known to the 
Continental officers. The Wagon-masters universally 
represent that they find their situation insupportably 
distressing ; that the number of teams in the country 
has decreased one third ; that, of these, from former 
service unpaid, the inadecjuate price, and real change 
of circumstances, a part can only be got, the rest 
hiding their horses and grain, and even destroying 
their wagons, that they may not be compelled to go. 

To impress requires a force to support it, and, from 
the nature of the service, a number of people to col- 
lect and keep the impressed articles. Most of the 
teams yet obtained are pressed. I hope we shall be 
able to make up the number of two hundred and 
fift}', and then we shall immediately set about the 
collection of horses, wherein, I presume, there will be 
less difficulty, because we know they are in the 
country, and cannot be concealed with the same 
ease as grain, wagons, &c. We have quartered the 
whole number of wagons and horses on the counties, 
as well as the Commissariat articles, but the ex- 
pectation of fully answering such a demand, amount- 
ing to one half and more (namely, one hundred and 
six millions of dollars) than all the money ever 
issued by Congress, cannot, I fear, be answered. I 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 23 

have not met with one person, in or ont of Congress, 
belonging or not belonging to the State, who does 
not pronounce the requisition, in its full extent, im- 
practicable. I hope we shall get one thousand horses 
at least, and that we shall be able to answer the re- 
quisition of February. If we can do more, we shall ; 
for, as I observed before, we have actually demanded 
the whole, have furnished all the Commissioners with 
blanks of various kinds of returns, and directed them 
to send us a weekly account of their progress. Our 
first instructions were for monthly returns ; but they 
were not complied with, owing, as we suppose, to a 
want of skill in making the returns, and to a want 
of time to ascertain what they could do. I do not 
know how it is conducted in other States, but at 
least three parts of my time and labor are employed 
in doing this duty of Quarter-master and Commissary, 
to the great neglect of my other duties. I have 
never, in any part of my life, gone through half the 
fatigue of business that I have done for these two 
months past; and it is very discouraging, that, with so 
unremitted attention to the public service, I find I am 
to be the subject of complaint. I do acknowledge, my 
dear Sir, that my health and spirits daily sink under 
it, and that I find I am every week less capable of 
business. 

While I see hundreds around me securing a com- 
fortable competence for themselves and families, en- 
joying occasional amusements, and even members of 
Congress themselves, and their officers, partaking of 
the satisfoction of cheerful society, I am sacrificing 
my youth, my profession, my whole time, and deny- 
ing myself all sorts of relaxation, that I may answer, 
at least in part, the expectations formed at this cri- 
sis. My conscience, and the knowledge those have 



24 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

who see my course of life, must acquit me of any 
neglect ; and if, after all this, I do not stand justified 
in the opinion of my country and friends, I think I 
have reason to conclude m3^self an unhappy and an in- 
jured character. I have seen some letters from camp, 
and one from Mr. Tilghman, that have hurt me a 
good deal, considering his connection with the State, 
and the station he holds in your family. In this let- 
ter, not wrote to a person of the most prudence or 
consideration, he pronounces our exertions scandalous. 
This letter is, doubtless, shown about town. 

You observe, my dear Sir, that our affairs are not 
in the train they ought to be. I am not sensible of 
any material defect, but this I can truly say, that 
they are in as good a train as our abilities and the 
circumstances of things will admit. This State (set- 
ting aside the opposition to the Government) is com- 
posed of very heterogeneous particles. It has been 
settled by people from all countries, and a great por- 
tion of them very incapable to judge of the nature 
and extent of the present controversy, which arising 
from apprehension more than a reality of oppression, 
now that they feel the heavy taxes and the burdens 
which are necessarily laid, they begin to reason from 
their feelings and grow extremely uneasy. They can- 
not anticipate the future happiness of their country 
in being exempt from foreign laws and jurisdiction, 
when they find they must work harder and pay 
more than they did. Comparisons of former taxe.s, 
burdens, &c., are now frequent; and it is my firm 
opinion, sanctioned by that of many gentlemen of 
more knowledge and experience, that the people of 
this State would, if too heavily pressed, more readily 
renew their connection with Great Britain, than any 
State now in the Union. Even the arguments and 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 25 

influence of Tories have great weight upon Whigs, 
when under the pressure of heavy taxes and burdens. 

They are tohi, you are not well governed, and 
you will find (as you have found) that the yoke of 
Great Britain is easy and her burden light, compar- 
ed with what you now endure. My best friends 
seem to have adopted a sentiment, which surprises me, 
and use arguments of this nature ; — " your enemies 
will serve the public effectually and gain credit, you 
must therefore exert yourself" My dear Sir, I wish 
every man to have credit and success, if he does 
serve the public, whether he is my friend or foe; and 
if he does it effectually, I am content he should have 
reputation. Let him make what use he pleases of it 
to my prejudice, I am conscious of having no object 
to stand in competition with the freedom of my coun- 
try. This was my first motive for going into public 
service ; it is still the governing principle of my life. 
Those, therefore, who really contribute to effect it, 
gratify me in the most essential point. But it does 
not appear to me that all the modes and measures 
taken lead to that point. The opposition in this 
State has no strength or consequence out of the 
city, that they acknowledge. Their separate schemes, 
therefore, serve only to embarrass ; whereas, did they, 
as they ought, join with the Government, there is 
no point, scarcely, \\ithin physical possibility, we 
could not attain. They cannot have popularity, be- 
cause the thirst of gain continually leads them into 
some scheme opposed to the public interests, which 
is discovered. A late instance has occurred in addi- 
tion to twenty others. 

The inhabitants of Bermuda have, to discourage 
privateering, associated to buy no prize goods. The 
consequence of which was, that those kinds of goods 

VOL. III. 3 



26 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

might be had next to nothing ; on which the princi- 
pal merchants in this city, Messrs. Morris, Nesbitt & 
Company, send a person, or at least employ one, who 
had been proscribed, and who is since under security 
for his good behaviour. He goes to that Island with- 
out permission, and then, in company, they purchase 
those prize goods the inhabitants of the Island had as- 
sociated, out of friendship to us, not to purchase, and 
import them under cover of British papers. We have 
seized the goods, and, upon inquiry, all these flicts 
turn out in proof We have never been able to get 
the least assistance from them to prevent taking de- 
serters on board their ships ; whereas a virtuous reso- 
lution to employ no Captain who received them, would 
do more good than all the laws, proclamations, and 
searches, that could ever be made. 

But I find myself insensibly drawn to a tedious 
length of letter, which my anxiety to remove any 
unfavorable impressions has hurried me into. I will, 
therefore, trespass but little longer. From what I 
have said, I hope you will not suspect my relaxing 
in the public service, while I have strength of body 
or mind. I must entreat you to do me the justice 
to believe I shall strain the cords as tight as they 
will bear. Those of Government are never tied again, 
if once broken; and governing too much is the way 
not to govern at alL I will use every species of 
influence, argument, and authority I possess, to pro- 
mote the views of the public at this juncture. I 
have done it for months past, as Congress are very 
sensible, from the letters laid before them, in conse- 
quence of a very unkind one from their Committee. 
Every motive that can interest or impel the heart of 
man, I must have on this occasion; and why should 
it be supposed that they will not have due opera- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 27 

tion? I am not so stupid as not to comprehend the 
force and necessity of corresponding fully with the 
exertions of our ally, nor so insensible of national 
reproach as not to feel for the honor of the country, 
if it should fail in a capital degree in its engage- 
ments. No one can more sincerely wish an end to 
the war than I do, or be more sensible that great 
exertions, at this period, may bring about this happy 
issue. Nor am I capable of mean and selfish pain, 
at seeing those who are my enemies more successful 
in serving the public than myself, if it should be so. 
If I know myself, my errors are of the head and 
temper, not of the heart. I rely, therefore, dear Sir, 
much on your friendship and candid construction, and 
shall take it as the greatest favor, if, in the same 
free and friendly manner you have now done, you 
will tell me what is amiss, and how I may rectify it. 

Mrs. Reed and myself are exceedingly gratified 
with the kind and obliging notice you have taken 
of this small proof of our regard, in giving your 
name to our new-born son, and shall be happy, in 
every occasion, to give more extensive and essential 
proofs. And as to your good lady, her company 
gave us so sincere a pleasure, that we could not but 
regret that it was so short. We hope she got safe 
home, as we have not heard from her since we left 
her, a few miles on the way. 

I am persuaded you are so busy that I hope you 
will not think of answering this long, tedious letter, 
which has been wrote by snatches, as I could steal 
a few minutes at one time or another. I shall there- 
fore now conclude, with mentioning that next week 
will take forward two thousand excellent shirts and 
as many overalls, for the State troops, with a large 
supply of refreshments of other kinds; that we have 



28 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON, 

sent off a person to Europe, some time since, to 
lay in a good supply of all kinds of clothing for 
officers and six thousand men, so that we need not 
depend on uncertain and precarious supplies. Mrs. 
Reed received your kind favor a few days ago, and 
is exerting herself to comply with your direction ; 
but there is, at present, a very great difficulty in 
procuring the articles, even for money, I am, with 
the greatest respect and most sincere regard, dear 
Sir, your obliged and

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL HEATH. 

Newport, 16 July, 1780, 

Dear General, 

Nothing of any considerable consequence has hap- 
pened since I had the honor last to write you. The 
French troops are landed, and encamped in a fine 
situation, to the south-east of the town, and extend 
nearly across the Island. The troops make a good 
appearance. The legion, under the command of the 
Duke de Lauzun (the officer who took Senegal the 
last year), is as fine a corps as ever I saw. It is 
about six hundred strong. The officers express, the 
highest satisfaction at the treatment they meet with. 
The markets are become very good, and great regu- 
larity is preserved. In short, in every respect, I may 
say, hitherto every thing appears agreeable and satis- 
factory. 

I have this moment received a letter from a gentle- 
man in Boston, advising that a vessel is just sent 
into that port, which was one of a fleet of thirty-six

sail from Ireland for New York. I have given inform- 
ation of it to the General and Admiral, and, I appre- 
hend, some of the fleet will go out on a cruise. The 
Hermione has been cruising for these three or four 
days. 1 have the honor to he, with the greatest re- 
spect. 

Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

FROM JOSEPH JONES, IN CONGRESS. 

PhLIadelpliia, 18 July, 1780. 

Dear Sir, 
A report from the Board of War, in consequence 
of a letter of General Gates's to Congress, referred 
to the Board, respecting the promotion of Colonel Da- 
niel Morgan to the office of Brigadier-General, now 
lies upon the table, at my request. The Board have 
stated his former services, his being first Colonel of 
our line, and the deficiency of that State at present 
in her quota of troops. If a promotion of General 
Officers is to take place, and to be made through the 
line of the army, Morgan has many before him ; but 
if the promotions are to be through the line of the 
State, that officer, it appears, stands first. General 
Gates has mentioned his intention of giving Morgan 
the command of a body of light infantry; but, as the 
State has given the command of the militia, lately 
sent to the southward, to Colonel Stevens, who was 
Morgan's junior officer in the Continental line, with 
the commission of Brigadier-General, he will command 
Colonel ^Morgan, and this. Gates thinks, will disgust 
him, and therefore, with great earnestness and warmth, 
presses his promotion. I shall thank you for your 
2=5= 



30 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

confidential communications upon tliis matter, as the 
report, I think, will not be pressed or taken up until 
the Virginia Delegates are fully informed, as it was 
upon my motion, to obtain time for information, it lies 
upon the table. Besides, as he left the army in dis- 
gust, under your immediate command, I did not like 
the present mode of his obtaining the promotion, with- 
out (that I know of) any alteration of circumstances, 
at the pressing instance of General Gates. 

Pray, my dear Sir, do you recollect the purport of 
a letter lately written to Colonel Harrison, Speaker 
of the House of Delegates, representing the deranged 
state of the French finances, their as well as Spain's 
declining navy, and the increasing strength of the 
British navy? I have heard of such a letter that 
gentleman received from you, and had shown to many 
of the members of our Assembly, and that it was 
like to prejudice rather than promote the service. I 
mention this in confidence, as the purport of the 
letter may have been misrepresented, and I have it 
not directly from one who saw it, or heard it read. 
Between ourselves, I fear that worthy man is no 
zealous friend of the alliance. I may be mistaken, 
but it is my present opinion. 

An account, transmitted to the Admiralty Board 
by General Torman, makes the British, on the New 
York station, nine line-of-battle ships, two or three 
fifties, and seventeen frigates, and other armed vessels. 
Should this intelligence be true, the French fleet, as 
we have been told, though we have not yet the par- 
ticulars of their strength, will be unequal to the 
undertaking. My letters from Virginia speak of our 
people as being roused. A bill had passed the Dele- 
gates, by a majority of three only, adopting the 
scheme of finance recommended by Congress. Thir- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 31 

teea of the Senate only were present ; the opmion 

of ten of these publicly known, five for, and five 

against the bill. It was conjectured the others were 

in favor of the measure. Every fifteenth militia-man 

is to be drafted to fill up the deficiency of our line. 

This bill was also before the Senate. I hope you find 

the recruits coming in fast. The news of the arrival 

of the fleet will accelerate them. With great respect, 

I am, 

Your affectionate, humble servant, 

Joseph Jones. 



PROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL jVLlXWELL. 

Camp Preakness, 20 July, 1780. 

Sir, 
I beg leave to trouble your Excellency on a sub- 
ject, in which I request your aid. I am sorry to 
inform you, that, contrary to my expectations, I have 
not found my command in the Jersey brigade, for 
some time past, so agreeable as I could wish. I 
would remind your Excellency, that nothing but the 
most pure and disinterested principles induced me to 
enter the service, and, I trust, I have so far your 
good opinion that no endeavours, to the best of my 
abilities, have been wanting to forward the interest 
of my country, which has been my constant study 
since the first commencement of this war. Thus cir- 
cumstanced, and to be uniform in my good wishes to 
a country I love, I would much rather choose to 
withdraw from a service I am fond of, than to re- 
main where my services could not be made agree- 
able to my wishes. I therefore request that my re- 
signation may be accepted. 



32 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

At tlie same time, I presume, it would not be im- 
proper to ask of Congress all further immunities and 
rewards for my services that other officers of my 
rank may to this time be entitled to. I wish your 
Excellency to obtain as speedy an answer from Con- 
gress on this subject as possible, and at the same 
time to assure that honorable body, that my most 
sanguine wishes and services shall ever await both 
them and my country; which shall be gratefully ac- 
knowledged by, Sir, 

Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 

William Maxwell. 



FKOM colonel BRODHEAD. 

Fort Pitt, 21 July, 1780. 

Dear General, 

A few days ago I received intelligence, that a par- 
ty, consisting of thirty odd Wyandot Indians, had 
crossed the Ohio River, five miles below Fort Mcin- 
tosh, and had hid thirteen small bark canoes upon 
our shore. I immediately ordered out two parties of 
militia, to go in search of them, and cover the har- 
vesters. At the same time I detached Captain Mcln- 
tyre, to form an ambuscade opposite to the enemy's 
craft. Five men, who were reaping in a field, dis- 
covered the Indians, and, presuming their party was 
small, went out to attack them; but four of them 
were immediately killed, and the other taken, before 
the militia could be collected. But Captain Mclntyre 
attacked them in their craft, and many of them 
were doubtless killed and wounded. Two canoes 
were sunk, and the prisoner retaken; but the water 
was too deep for our party to ascertain the number 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 33 

of killed. The Indians left all their craft, and in 
them two guns, six blankets, eleven tomahawks, 
eleven paint-bags, eight ear-wheels, a large brass ket- 
tle, and many other articles. The Indians informed 
the prisoner that fifteen Wyandots had marched to- 
wards Hannah's Town. 

Upon receiving this information, I immediately de- 
tached another party up the Alleghany River, with 
two Delaware Indians, to take their tracks, and make 
pursuit ; but, as this party is not yet returned, I can- 
not inform you of its success. It is with great con- 
cern I inform your Excellency, that there does not 
remain, in our magazines, provision to subsist the 
troops more than eight days, at full rations ; nor can 
I conceive how supplies can be procured in time to 
prevent their experiencing great want. I have pro- 
posed a fair plan to encourage the inhabitants to sell 
us provision, upon the credit of the United States, 
but have no great certainty of success. I have sub- 
mitted the plan to the Honorable Board of War, and 
hope it will meet with approbation. 

Should I be fortunate enough to obtain supplies in 
time, I intend to penetrate the Wyandot country, 
this fall, and distress them and their allies by every 
possible exertion; and I expect Colonel Clark, as he 
is reenforced, will pay the Shawanese a visit about 
the same time. I shoald be exceeding happy to wait 
upon your Excellency, at the close of the campaign, 
but I am grown so poor that I cannot bear the ex- 
pense of so long a journey, at the present extrava- 
gant rates. I have the honor to be, with the most 
exalted respect and esteem, your Excellency's 
Most obedient and most humble servant, 

Daniel Brodhead. 



34 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

Julij Tld. The party of fifteen Indians, mentioned 
above, crossed the Ohio River at Crow's Island, four 
miles above Fort Mcintosh, killed and scalped one 
man, and returned. A party from hence, and another 
from Fort Mcintosh, are in pursuit of them. A party 
of men, just arrived from Wheeling, found two of the 
Wyandot Indians, who were killed by Captain Mcln-

in their scalps. 

FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL WAYNE. 

New Bridge, 9 o'clock, P. M., 21 July, 1780. , 

Dear General, 
Being convinced that our field-pieces were too light 
to make the wished impression on the block-house by 
Bull's Ferry, from an experience of more than an 
hour (at no greater distance than from fifty to se- 
venty yards), during which time both officers and 
men evinced a degree of bravery seldom equalled, 
but never excelled ; and seeing the enemy in mo- 
tion on York Island, and their shipping under way, 
together with certain accounts of the embarking of a 
very large body of troops from Valentine's Hill, it 
was unanimously determined, in a Council of War on 
the field, to withdraw the artilleiy, and fall back by 
easy degrees to this place, to prevent the disagreea- 
ble consequences of being shut up in Bergen Neck. 
We accordingly moved off, after burning the flats and 
boats lying at the landing, and driving the cattle 
from that country, which was part of our plan. Our 
loss is from fifty to sixty killed and wounded, whom 
we carried off, without the least molestation. I will 
have the honor of transmitting to your Excellency 
the particulars to-morrow. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 35 

I think it my duty to mention, that the enemy 
are in full motion on the North River, chief part of 
their troops embarked. As they have completed their 
foraging in East and Westchester, may not good po- 
licy induce them to take j)0st between the Liberty 
Pole and this place, in order to render that essential 
article very difficult for your Excellency to procure, 
in case of a siege ? I will shift my ground about 
two in the morning, and fall back towards the camp. 
Interim, I am your Excellency's 

INIost obedient, humble servant, 

Anthony Wayne. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL HEATH. 

NeAvport, 10 o'clock, P. M., 21 July, 1780. 

Dear General, 

This afternoon, fifteen or sixteen British ships of 
war have made their appearance off this harbour, 
to the eastward of Block Island. More than half of 
them, I think, are ships of the line. From appear- 
ances, at sun-setting, they intended to come to, under 
Block Island. 

Admiral Graves has probably joined Admiral Ar- 
buthnot, and their design is to block up the fleet of 
Monsieur le Chevalier de Ternay, and, if possible, in- 
tercept the expected second division of the French 
fleet. I thought it my duty to give immediate no- 
tice to your Excellency, and beg leave to submit the 
expediency of some small cruisers being immediately 
sent from the Delaware, to cruise for the French 
fleet, and direct them to a place of safety. I have 
written to the Council and Navy Board, at Boston, 
and proposed the same, in case the fleet should take

the eastern coast. I liave mentioned this to his 
Excellency, General Rochambeau, who was so much 
pleased with it, that he requested I would write, for 
that he should leave it wholly with me. 

This night is spent in mounting a number of guns 
at advantageous posts at the entrance of the harbour, 
to make a cross-fire with the ships, &c. There are 
with the army a number of good engineers, and an 
exceedingly fine corps of artillery, with a numerous 
train of field-artillery, and some battering cannon. 

I had ordered Colonel Greene's regiment to march 
immediately for the main army, but, under present 
appearances, I think it best to detain them a few 
days. I have ordered them to take post at Butts's 
Hill, at the north end of the Island, to secure the 
communication. This has given much satisfaction to 
General Rochambeau, and I hope will meet with your 
Excellency's approbation. I have the honor to be, 
with the greatest respect. 

Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

WiLLLiJi Heath. 



FROM COUNT DE ROCHAMBEAU. 

Newport, Ehode Island, 22 July, 1780. 

Sir, 
The enemy are doing what they ought to do. 
Graves, immediately after having joined Arbuthnot, 
comes to cruise before us with nine or ten ships of 
the line, five frigates, and four other small vessels. 
He moors at present at Block Island, with the object 
of opposing our designs, and intercepting the se- 
cond division from France. Our despatch-boat, charged 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 37 

with letters, and escorted by three frigates, has been 
obliged to return yesterday, chased by all the ene- 
my's fleet. I see that it "will be good to have cruis- 
ers at the Capes of Delaware and Chesapeake, to ad- 
vertise our second convoy, as soon as it shall appear, 
to debark at the south, or at Boston ; the former will 
be best. I pray my General to transmit this to the 
Chevalier de la Luzerne, that he may act in conse- 
quence. 

We are going to try to convey our letters to France 
in a vessel from one of the ports in the State of 
Massachusetts. I wait here that part of the Bour- 
bonne which have fortunately debarked at Boston. 
We have more than six hundred sick, besides one 
hundred whom the Bourbonne left at Boston. The 
fleet has more than one thousand sailors, and has not 
here wherewith to change them, as Graves did at 
New York. A good month's refreshment will reesta- 
blish the greatest part. 

I am, with respect, &c. &c., 

Le Compte de Rochambeau. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL WAYNE. 

Totowa, 22 July, 1780. 

Dear General, 
In pursuance of the plan, which your Excellency 
was pleased to adopt, the first and second Pennsyl- 
vania brigades, with four pieces of artillery belonging 
to Colonel Proctor's regiment, and Colonel Moylan's 
dragoons, took up their line of march on the 20th, at 
three o'clock, P. M., and arrived, a little in the rear 
of New Bridge, at nine in the evening. We moved 

VOL. IIL 4 



38 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

again at one in the morning, in order to occupy the 
ground in the vicinity of Fort Lee and the Lmding 
opposite King's Bridge, by the dawn of the day; and, 
agreeabty to the inclosed order, we advanced towards 
Bull's Ferry, — General Irvine, with part of his bri- 
gade, along the summit of the mountain, and the 
first brigade, under Colonel Humpton, with the artil- 
lery and Colonel Moylan's horse, on the common 
road. About ten o'clock, part of the first brigade 
had reached that place. Colonel Moylan, with the 
horse, and a detachment of infantry, remained at the 
fork of the road leading to Paulus Hook and Bergen, 
to receive the enemy, if they attempted any thing 
from that quarter. 

On reconnoitring the refugee post, near Bull's 
Ferry, we found it to consist of a block-house, sur- 
rounded by an abatis and stockade to the perpendicu- 
lar rocks next to the North River, with a kind of 
ditch, or parapet, serving as a covered way. By this 
time we could discover the enemy in motion on 
York Island, which began to open a prospect of our 
plan taking full effect. General Irvine was directed 
to halt in a position from which he could move to 
any point where the enemy should attempt to land, 
either in the vicinity of this post or Fort Lee, where 
the sixth and seventh regiments were previously con- 
cealed, with orders to wait the landing of the enemy, 
and then, at the point of the bayonet, to dispute the 
pass in the gorge of the mountain, at every expense 
of blood, until supported by General Irvine, and the 
remainder of the troops. 

The first regiment was posted in a hollow way, on 
the north side of the block-house, and the tenth in 
another hollow on the south, with orders to keep up a 
constant fire into the portholes, to favor the advance 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 39 

of the artillery, which was covered by the second 
regiment. When the field-pieces arrived at the me- 
dium distance of sixty yards, they commenced a con- 
stant fire, which was returned by the enemy, and 
continued without intermission from eleven until after 
twelve o'clock. By that time we had expresses that 
the enemy were embarking their troops from Volun- 
tine's Hill, at Phillips's Landing. We also saw many 
vessels and boats moving up with troops from New 
York, which made it necessary to relinquish a lesser 
for a much greater object; that is, drawing the enemy 
over towards the posts already mentioned, and decid- 
ing the fortune of the day in the defiles, through 
which they must pass before they could gain posses- 
sion of the strong grounds. 

In the interim we found that our artillery had 
made but little impression, although well and gal- 
lantly served, the metal not being of sufiicient weight 
to traverse the logs of the block-house ; but, when the 
troops understood that they were to be drawn ofi", 
such was the enthusiastic bravery of all ranks of offi- 
cers and men, that the first regiment, no longer ca- 
pable of restraint, rather than leave a post in the 
rear, rushed with impetuosity over the ahatis, and ad- 
vanced to the stockades, from wliich they were with 
difficulty withdrawn, although they had no means of 
forcing an entry. The contagion spread to the se- 
cond; but, by very great efforts of the officers of 
both regiments, they were at last restrained, not 
without the loss of some gallant officers wounded 
and some brave men killed. Happy it was that the 
ground would not admit of the further advance of 
the tenth regiment, and that the situation of General 
Irvine's brigade prevented them from experiencing a 
loss proportioned to those immediately engaged (as 



40 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

the same gallant spirit pervaded the whole), which 
might he a means of frustrating our main object, 
by incumbering us with too many wounded. 

The artillery was, therefore, drawn off, and for- 
warded towards the wished-for point of action. The 
killed and wounded Avere all moved away, except 
three, that lay dead under the stockades. During this 
period. Colonel Moylan's horse drove the cattle, &c., 
from Bergen up towards the Liberty Pole, wliilst 
a detachment of infantry destroyed the sloops and 
wood-boats at the landing, in which were taken a 
Captain and mate, with two sailors. Some others 
were killed whilst attempting to escape by swim- 
ming. Having thus effected part of our plan, we 
pushed forward to oppose the troops from Valentine's 
Hill that we expected to land at the nearest point 
to New Bridge. If effected, we were determined to 
drive them back, or to cut our way through; but 
in this project we were disappointed; the enemy 
thought proper to remain in a less hostile position 
than that of the Jersey shore. We therefore passed 
the New Bridge, and, by easy degrees, returned to 
this place about an hour ago. 

Inclosed is a copy of the orders of the 20th, to- 
gether with a return of the killed and wounded, 
sixty-four in number, among whom are Lieutenants 
Hammond and Crawford, of the first, and Lieutenant 
Dehart of the second, all very worthy officers; the 
latter, mortally wounded. 

I cannot attempt to discriminate between officers, 
regiments, or corps, who, with equal opportunity, 
would have acted with equal fortitude. Should my 
conduct, and that of the troops under my command, 
meet your Excellency's approbation, it will much 
alleviate the pain I experience in not having it in

my power to carry tlie whole of the plan into exe- 
cution, which was only prevented by the most mali- 
cious fortune. I have the honor to be, with sincere 
esteem, your Excellency's 

Most obedient and very humble servant, 

Anthony Wayne. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL HEATH. 

Newport, 25 July, 1780. 

Dear General, 

Nothing of consequence has transpired since I had 
the honor last to write to you. The British fleet con- 
tinue off the harbour, sometimes at anchor, at other 
times cruising. Yesterday afternoon I counted twelve 
sail, principally large ships, at anchor, and four sail 
of frigates and sloops of war, cruising ; the former 
to the east of Block Island, the latter between that 
place and Point Judith. Their intention, undoubted- 
ly, is to block up the squadron under the command 
of Monsieur de Ternay, intercept the expected second 
division of our allies, cut ofi* all supplies by water, 
and impede the operations of the campaign; and, I 
fear, without the arrival of a further naval force, they 
have laid an embargo on the squadron now here. 

The Marquis de Lafayette arrived here the last 
evening. Universal joy was diffused throughout the 
camp. I have the honor to be, with the greatest re- 
spect, 

Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

William Heath. 

P. S. The troops, which put into Boston, arrived 

here last night, by the way of Providence. Inclosed

is a return of the platform plank, at this place, be- 
longing to the public. 

Upon the appearance of the British fleet, standing 
in for this place, I ordered Colonel Greene's regiment, 
and the recruits for the Rhode Island line, who were 
under orders to march to the army, to take post at 
Howland's and Bristol Ferry, Butts's Hill, and the 
dock where our flat-bottomed boats lie. This gave 
great satisfaction to Count Rochambeau, who, under 
present appearances, is very earnest to have them 
remain a few days longer, for the security of the 
ferry, flat-bottomed boats, &c. The Marquis is of the 
same opinion. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL HEATH. 

Newport, 9 o'clock, P M., 25 July, 1780. 

Dear General, 
This afternoon the intelligence, contained in the 
inclosed, came to hand; upon which General Rocham- 
beau immediately made a requisition for two thou- 
sand militia. I have called upon Governor Greene 
for fifteen hundred men, and on Brigadier Godfrey, 
of the brigade in the county of Bristol, Massachu- 
setts, for eight hundred. General Rochambeau says 
that in six days he shall be safe, without the assist- 
ance of the militia. I have written to the Council of 
Boston, that, if their militia for reenforcing the army 
for three months are detached, and not marched, those 
from the counties of Suffolk, Plymouth, Barnstable, 
and Bristol, may march to Tiverton, which will not 
be greatly out of their way to the place of their 
destination ; and, should Sir Henry Clinton be coming 
this way, they may answer a good purpose. It will 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 43 

also be less burdensome to the militia, who, after so 
great drafts as have been lately made, will tliink an 
additional one, in the midst of harvest, almost insur- 
mountable. 

If Sir Henry should not come this way, there shall 
be no needless detention of any of the levies. The 
Marquis de Lafayette is in sentiment with me in this 
particular. I hope it will not be disagreeable to your 
Excellency. It cannot, at any rate, make a detention 
of more than five or six days. It is with pain that 
I call on the militia to turn out; but General Ro- 
chambeau is so pressing in his application, that he 
cannot be denied. Indeed, if Sir Henry, Clinton has 
a land force to spare from New York, adequate to 
the enterprise, I think he never had a more inviting 
object than the present situation and circumstances 
of things offer him here. I have the honor to be, 
with the greatest respect. 

Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

WiLLiAJi Heath. 

P. S. The article of bread will be obtained, I fear, 
with much difficulty, for the troops that will assem- 
ble here. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL HEATH. 

Newport, 26 July, 1780. 

Dear General, 
By a variety of intelligence, from various quarters 
(all which agree) the enemy intend to make an at- 
tempt on the fleet and army of our great and good 
ally at this place. I have called for the neighbour- 
ing militia of Massachusetts, and the whole of this 



44 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

State. I have also requested the Council of Massa- 
chusetts to send all the three months' militia this 
way, except those of the counties of Hampshire and 
Berkshire. Whilst these are collecting, with the ad- 
vice of the Marquis, I shall call on Governor Trum- 
bull to send one thousand militia from the nearest 
towns of Connecticut, to rendezvous at Greenwich. I 
have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, 
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

William Heath. 

P. S. The fleet off the harbour, from their first 
appearance, have kept nearly the same station, to the 
eastward of Block Island. 



FROM THE CHEVALIER DE LA LUZERNE. 

(Translation.) 

Philadelphia, 30 July, 1780. 

Sir, 

I inclose to your Excellency a letter for M. de Ternay, in which you will see what measures I have 
taken to fulfil the intentions, which you imparted to 
me on the 27th instant. I beg you will seal this 
packet, and send it to his address by the first oppor- 
tunity. 

Congress have put under your orders the frigates, 
in directing them to come into the Delaware. You 
will be able to judge, after your arrangements with 
the Chevalier de Ternay, whether these vessels, or 
one of them, may not accomplish the commission de- 
sired Their cruise may then be useful to the com- 
merce of the United States. I know not whether M. 
de Ternay will communicate to them any signals, by

danger. Your Excellency may he ahle, should you 
think it necessary, to suggest it to him. 

I have the honor to he, &c.,

FROM ]VL1J0R-GENER.\L HEATH. 

Newport, 31 July, 1780. 

Dear General, 

In consequence of intelligence, received yesterday 
morning from the westward, that the fleet of trans- 
ports, which were lately in the Sound, and supposed 
to be coming this way, had sailed towards New York, 
General Count de Rochamheau expressed his pleasure 
that the militia, which had arrived and were on their 
march for his support, except those detached for 
three months, should return home, I immediately 
communicated it to them. 

Nothing could have exceeded the spirit which has 
been shown by the militia on this occasion. The hint 
given by the Count, that he had come to their sup- 
port, but at that moment stood in need of theirs, in- 
stantly fired every breast, and old and young, of all 
denominations, were determined to rush into the field 
to his aid. The Count expresses the highest pleasure 
and satisfaction, as do all the officers on this occa- 
sion. The Count wishes to detain the three months' 
men a few days, to secure the pass at Ilowland's 
Ferry. I have the honor to be, with the greatest 
respect. 

Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

William Heath. 



40 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Verplanck's Point, 3 August, 1780. 

Sir, 

Tlie more I have tliouglit upon the subject of ex- 
plaining the reasons and causes of our movements to 
the army, and through them to the country, the more 
I am confirmed in my opinion of the propriety and 
necessity for it. 

Your Excellency "will consider this is a great move- 
ment^ and has been very rapid; the march of the 
army has been very fatiguing ; the teams of the 
country have been impressed, and every kind of pro- 
perty laid hold on, to pave the way to a certain 
plan of operations. If it is all relinquished, without 
any explanation, the natural reflections that will arise 
upon the occasion will be, why has the army been 
thus harassed without an object; why have the people 
been dragged from their homes, with their teams, and 
the public subjected to a most enormous expense ; 
and why has the property of the people been laid 
hold on by the hand of power, when there appears 
nothing to warrant these extraordinary measures ? 

AVithout some explanations we shall not do justice 
to ourselves, nor will your Excellency to your own 
military character. The enterprise was great, the ob- 
ject noble, and the end for which it was undertaken 
appears to have been partly answered, if not fully 
so. To explain the reasons for the movement will 
give the army a high opinion of the confidence you 
have in their spirit and enterprise, and perfectly re- 
concile them to all the past fatigues, and to those 
which may follow, in regaining our former position. 
It will strike the enemy with the boldness of the de- 
sign; it will be pleasing to the French army, as a 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 47 

measure calculated to give the most speedy relief; 
it will reconcile the country to all the inconveniences 
they have felt, and prepare their minds for future 
exertions of a similar nature, in full confidence that 
the object is worthy the preparation. 

Though I am no advocate, in common, for giving 
reasons, either to the army or the community, for our 
movements, yet there are cases when substantial ad- 
vantages can be drawn from it; and when the peo- 
ple's curiosity can be gratified and the public be 
benefited at the same time, I think it will be justi- 
fiable to adopt the measure. It is unnecessary to 
gasconade highly upon the occasion; but I think we 
may, with great reason, suppose the enemy's return 
to be in consequence of our movements, and that 
gives us the reputation of having saved our allies 
from an injury, and subjected the enemy to the mor- 
tification of having been obliged to relinquish their 
project. 

If the explanation takes place, there will be no in- 
convenience in our recrossing the river. Without it, 
I think there will; for, both the army and the coun- 
try will think all is given up, and there will be no 
preparations proportionable to the business in con- 
templation. Your Excellency may remember that 
Sir Henry Clinton explained his movement up to 
Stony Point last campaign, after General Wayne took 
that place. He had not half the reasons for that 
explanation as you have for this. 

I wish your Excellency to determine upon your 
further operations, as soon as possible, as boards and 
teams are impressing, collecting, and coming to camp, 
as fast as possible. If the teams are not likely to 
be wanted immediately, they had better be discharg- 
ed without loss of time, as it will save a great ex-

pense, and free the people from no small inconve- 
niences. 

Colonel Hay has sent down a considerable quan- 
tity of hoards to King's Ferry, and more are coming. 
Mr. Clarke, of Danhury, writes me that he has got 
an account of one hundred thousand feet, which may 
be had, but not without great inconvenience to the 
inhabitants, as they were got to rebuild the houses 
burnt by the enemy last campaign. There is a great 
number of impressed teams at King's Ferr}^, on the 
other side, which I wish to dismiss, if there is not 
an immediate necessity for them. I am, with great 
respect. 
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 

Nathanael Greene. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Camp, Verplanck's Point, 5 August, 1780. 

Sir, 
The time for wdiich I engaged to act in the Quar- 
ter-master's department, at the request of the Com- 
mittee of Congress for Cooperation, is almost expir- 
ed; and as I cannot exercise the office any longer, 
consistent with my own safety, I am to request 
your Excellency will take measures for relieving 
me, as soon as possible, from the disagreeable pre- 
dicament I am in. In the mean time I shall be 
exceedingly obliged to your Excellency for the sense 
you entertain of my conduct and services since I 
have been in the department, as you alone are the 
best judge of the propriety of one and the merit of 
the other. The business is truly disagreeable and 
distressing, and has been so for a long time ; notr 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 49 

withstanding, if it had been possible for me to have 
got through it this campaign, consistently with my 
own safety and the public good, upon the plan which 
Congress proposed, I would readily have done it. But, 
from the knowledge I have of the department, I 
know it is utterly impossible to follow the system, 
and answer the demands of the service; and to at- 
tempt it, at this critical season, will most assuredly 
defeat our plan of operations, and bring the army 
into the greatest distress. 

It would be a folly for me to attempt to combat 
the prejudices of public bodies, with hopes of success. 
Time alone can convince them that their measures 
are destructive of their true interest, as well as highly 
injurious to some of their most faithful servants. 

I am sensible my conduct has been viewed by 
many in a very improper light; and I am persuaded 
many think the business can be done with more 
method, and at a less expense, than it has been. I 
wish it may be the case ; but am much mistaken if 
the nature of the business is capable of more system, 
or will admit of less expense, if the plan of the war 
continues on its present scale, and the army on its 
present footing. 

I have endeavoured, to the utmost of my power, to 
enter into the spirit and intention of your Excel- 
lency's measures; and if my conduct has not been 
satisfactory to Government and to yourself, it has 
been owing to a want of abilities, and not inclination. 
I am, with great respect, 

Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 

Nathanael Greene.

50 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL ARNOLD. 

Head Quarters, Robinson's House, 
6 August, 1780. 

Dear Sir, 

On my arrival at this post, I found every thing 
thrown into great confusion, by the troops removing 
from hence, and the militia coming in. Colonel Mal- 
com had ordered returns to be made of the militia, 
provisions, and stores of every kind, which I expect 
this morning, and wiU transmit a copy to your Ex- 
cellency. I believe a sufficient number of militia 
have arrived to replace those of this State, who will 
leave this to-morrow or next day. I am sorry to 
observe, that there is not one tent for the militia 
(which are absolutely necessary at the redoubts), and 
the barracks Avill not contain more than seven hun- 
dred, unless they are crowded, so as to injure their 
health ; and many of them are daily falling sick. 
This will be delivered your Excellency by Doctor 
Ledyard, who waits on you to obtain a supply of 
medicines and stores for the sick, who are numerous, 
and without fresh provisions or any necessaries ; and 
I am assured by him and Doctor Burnet, that there 
are not hospital stores in the department sufficient 
to last the sick one fortnight, nor is there any pros- 
pect of obtaining a supply, unless by an application 
to Congress or Governor Clinton. 

The quantity of salted meat at this post, I am in- 
formed, is small. It appears to me that the whole 
ought to be reserved, and the troops fed on fresh 
provisions. I know not from what quarter we are 
to expect a S]ipply. I have wrote Colonel Blain on 
the subject, but believe an order from your Excel- 
lency to him will be necessary. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 51 

I shall pay the strictest attention to my orders, 
but cannot flatter myself with effecting as much with 
raw militia as would be done with an equal number 
of disciplined troops ; and I am very apprehensive 
that the troops, by being exposed, will become sickly, 
and desertions follow in consequence. I have the 
honor to be, with great respect and esteem, 

Your Excellency's obedient, humble servant, 

Benedict Arnold. 



FROM JOSEPH JONES, IN CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, [7?] August, 1780. 

Dear Sir, 

Your letter to Colonel Harrison turns out as I ex- 
pected before I received your full information. If the 
whole had been read and attended to, it was impos- 
sible to put any other construction on your manner 
of treating the subject than to convince your cor- 
respondent of the absolute necessity of great exer- 
tions this campaign, while we had a promising pros- 
pect before us, lest, by remissness and delay, we 
should find our ally, as well as ourselves, embar- 
rassed with greater difficulties than at present ; and 
I very sincerely wish, should this summer pass away 
without some signal advantage gained on our part, 
we may not find your conjectures verified in the 
event. 

I have my hopes we shall yet be able to do some- 
fhing important upon the arrival of the French reen- 
forcement, as I presume their fleet will then com- 
mand the water, without which, I confess, I have no 
sanguine expectations. With the command of the 
water, the enterprise may be successful. Mr. Bing- 



52 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

ham has received a letter from Martinique, informing 
him the combined fleets fell to leeward on the 5th of 
July, supposed for Jamaica ; thirty-three or thirty-six 
ships of the line, and tAvelve thousand troops. They 
expected a reenforcement of a few thousand troops 
more. If this account be true, it is probable Jamaica 
will fall, and that we may have them along our 
coast. 

You are desired, by some late resolutions, to turn 
your thoughts towards the recovery of South Caro- 
lina and Georgia, as soon as the operations of the 
campaign in this quarter have been executed. Gates's 
and De Kalb's letters represent the distresses of the 
Southern department in a very gloomy light, as to 
provisions and equipments. The Virginia recruits, 
when raised, are ordered to join that army. If this 
interfere with your plans, you should let us know it, 
as they will not be ready to march until the begin- 
ning of next month. The law passed by the Legisla- 
ture will probably bring into the field about three 
thousand. A Colonel or Major Pinckney, of South Ca- 
rolina, writes Colonel Motte, a Delegate of that State, 
that the enemy are not more than twenty-five hun- 
dred strong at their posts in the country, exclu- 
sive of horse, of which they have a large corps, and 
about eight hundred or one thousand men in Charles- 
ton. Of our twenty-five hundred mihtia, not above 
fifteen hundred had reached Hillsborough, in North 
Carolina. But Mr. Jameson, of the Virginia Privy 
Council, writes us that many of the deserters had 
been taken up and sent forward to Hillsborough, 
had about twelve hundred militia under him. 
Baylor's and Bland's dragoons nearly equipped, so 
that if they can get provisions sufficient and forage, 
which, by this time, it is probable they are furnished

with, tliey will be in condition to face the enemy, 
and I hope drive them into the town. 

We have been greatly perplexed the last week 
with General Greene's refusal to act in the office of 
Quartermaster-General, unless the new system was 
totally repealed, and he was allowed to conduct it, 
under your direction, in such manner as he thought 
most conducive to the public service. Besides, Con- 
gress were to request Pettit and Cox to resume their 
offices.'-' If General Greene thought the new system 
wanted amendment, and had pointed out the defect, 
Congress would have considered the matter, and, I 
doubt not, would have made the necessarv alteration. 
But the manner of these demands, made in such 
peremptory terms, at the moment of action, when the 
campaign was opened, the enemy in the field, and 
our ally waiting for cooperation, has lessened Gene- 
ral Greene not only in the opinion of Congress, but 
I think, of the public ; and I question whether it will 
terminate with the acceptance of his refusal only. 

On Saturday Colonel Pickering was appointed to 
the office of Quartermaster-General, with the rank 
of Colonel, and the pay and rations of a Brigadier- 
General, and to hold his place at the Board of War 
without pay or right to act, while in the office of 
Quartermaster-General. This gentleman's integrity, 
ability, and attention to business will, I hope, not 
only prevent the evils to be apprehended from a 
change in so important a department at this time, 
but will, I hope, be able to reform some of the 
abuses crept into that business, and lessen the amaz- 
ing expenditures of the department. He must, if he

accepts, have a disagreeable office in the present state 
of our finance ; but we must support him all we can. 
The promotion I lately mentioned has not taken 
place, though if we take up the business I suppose 
it will be done ; as M. is the oldest Colonel, and 
Gates is the only Major-General belonging to Virgi- 
nia, and the State has a right to two. But I see no 
occasion of stirring in it at present, as, if taken up, 
it must be on the general principle of promotion, 
and then not only Virginia, but Maryland, and other 
States, will expect to partake of the same privilege 
of bringing forward their officers, when, I believe, 
there are few States whose lines are so full as to 
justify the promotions. I am, &c.,

FROM THE CHEVALIER DE TERNAY. 

8 August, 1780. 



o 



Sir, 
I have received the letter which your Excellency 
has done me the honor to write. It would be very 
difficult for me to fix a point for my junction with 
the squadron, which was to follow me when I left 
the ports of France. I am absolutely ignorant of 
its force, and the part of America where it ought to 
make the land. I only know, that the intention of 
the Kjng was to confide to me a force superior to 
that of the enemy. He was not ignorant then that 
Graves was destined to follow me with a strong 
squadron, and that, after his juncture with Arbuthnot, 
he would be superior to that he confided to me. 
Monsieur le Marquis de Lafayette will have told your 
Excellency all I told him, in private, and in pre- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 55 

sence of the Count de Rochambeau, upon this sub- 
ject. 

I see no difficulty in causing the merchant vessels 
of the second division to enter the Delaware, if the 
officer who commands it has taken measures, as I 
did, to make the coast of Chesapeake Bay; but I 
see much difficulty in making the ships of war enter 
and come out of that river, with respect to its mouth. 
As the point for the junction of the two squadrons, 
I regard Boston as preferable in all respects, since 
the enemy could not maintain the entrance of the 
Bay, in the month of September, without exposing 
themselves to the same inconveniences which made 
them lose, within two years, a vessel of Avar in these 
parts. I write accordingly to the Chevalier de la 
Luzerne, under your cover, that if the second divi- 
sion arrives in the Chesapeake Bay, it might, at the 
option of General Washington and of the Count de 
Rochambeau, make the Evansport vessels enter into 
the Delaware, and that the vessels of Avar might 
afterAvards proceed to Boston, taking under their con- 
voy the few ships Avhich are in that river, loaded 
Avith flour for Rhode Island. But I observe ahvays 
to your Excellenc}^, that the point of this division 
making the land is absolutely unknoAvn to me; that 
I do not judge that it is equal in force to that of 
Graves; that if the officer, who commands, has taken 
measures to arrive at Boston, I shall learn the ac- 
count with the greatest pleasure. 

The English squadron is anchored between Block 
Island and Long Island, nearest the land. I am, with 
sincere respect and attachment. Sir, 

Your most humble and most obedient servant. 

The Chea^alier de Ternay. 



56 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL ARNOLD. 

Head Quarters, Robinson's House, 
8 August, 1780. 

Dear Sir, 

Colonel Stewart^ Commissary-General of Issues, has 
made a demand on the Commissary at this post for 
thirty hogsheads of rum. As there are only fifty odd 
in the magazine, I have desired him to send only 
fifteen, which will be a present supply for the army; 
the remainder will he necessary for the use of the 
garrison. The Commissary informs me that he ex- 
pects no more ; and as large supplies are coming on 
from Philadelphia, I think the army cannot want. 

I wish your Excellency would be kind enough to 
order Mr. Erskine to send me a map of the country 
from this place to New York, particularly on the east 
side of the river, which would be very useful to me. 
The ofiicers in general, from the State of Massachu- 
sett's Bay, have never been in the service before, and 
are extremely ignorant of their duty, which throws 
every thing into confusion ; and, in case of an attack 
on the post, from their inexperience I believe little 
dependence can be placed on them. The troops are 
good, and well armed. Would it not be better. Sir, 
to continue a part or the whole of the New York 
brigade at this post, whose ofiicers (particularly Colo- 
nel Malcom) are well acquainted with the duty, and 
can be depended on, and the troops have, in general, 
bad arms and few bayonets ? 

I am convinced, that the Massachusetts or Hamp- 
shire troops will be better in the field, from this cir- 
cumstance in their arms. 

Major Villefranche has surveyed the works at West 
Point, and informs me that there is a vast deal to do 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 57 

to complete them ; that large quantities of materials, 
such as timber, plank, boards, stone, &c., -will be want- 
ed. Part of the materials are at different places near 
this post ; but I do not find that there are any teams 
or forage in the department, and, at present^ there is 
no prospect of any being furnished. 

I am sorry to trouble your Excellency with so 
long a list of grievances; and am, very respectfully, 
your Excellency's 

Most obedient and obliged humble servant, 

Benedict Arnold. 



FROM THE CHEVALIER DE TERNAY. 

10 August, 1780. 

Sir, 

I have received the letter, wliich your Excellency 
has done me the honor to write, the 6th of this 
month, on the subject of the American frigates which 
may join the squadron of the Ejng of France. 

When I shall be equal in force to the enemy, or 
perhaps superior, and when there shall be any mari- 
time operation corresponding with that which you 
have premeditated, and which Monsieur the Marquis 
de Lafayette has imparted to me, those frigates will 
certainly be very useful to me ; but, till then, I think 
they might be employed most usefully in a cruise 
to intercept the vessels which go from Charleston to 
New York. I believe that Admiral Arbuthnot has, 
in this place here, all his strong frigates. 

I propose to your Excellency to have escorted, by 
those frigates, to the ports of Boston, a vessel loaded 
with flour by Monsieur Holker for the squadron of 
the King of France, and which is at present in the 



58 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

Delaware. It would be necessary, in this case, that 
they take their route a little large, that they may 
not fall too near this place, the frigates of Arhuthnot 
beins: able to extend their cruises to the Shoals of 
Nantucket. This Admiral sent me, yesterday morn- 
ing, a [flag], in order to transmit me some letters 
from French prisoners, at this very moment at New 
York. He is anchored at the easternmost point of 
Long Island. I had sent a vessel, some hours before, 
to propose to him an exchange. 

If you do not want the sloop Saratoga, and this 
vessel is a good sailer, your Excellency could de- 
spatch her to St. Domingo. The Marquis de Lafay- 
ette Avould send, by this opportunity, the letter which 
I had transmitted to him for the Count de Guichen, 
and which ought to be translated into ciphers by 
the Chevalier de la Luzerne. I require, conformably 
to the orders of the King, a reenforcement of some 
ships from this French Commander. If these arrive 
by the end of September, I could transport your 
army to Long Island the beginning of October, and 
finally decide the fate of America this year. I send 
to the Chevalier de la Luzerne the signals of recog- 
nizance which have been previously addressed to me 
by the Council of Admiralty at Boston, and which I 
have adopted. It is necessary that there should be 
uniformity in those on the whole coast, to avoid con- 
fusion. I am, with respect and sincere attachment. 
Sir, 

Your most humble and most obedient servant. 

The Chevalier de Ternay. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 59 

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LINCOLN. 

Boston, 11 August, 1780. 

My dear General, 

I was yesterday lionored with your Excellency's 
favor of the 26th ultimo, covering a letter from Sir 
Henry Clinton to me. I cannot but hope you have 
a little misapprehended him, and that it was not his 
intention to make my exchange depend absolutely on 
the exchange of the southern army. Did I fully be- 
lieve this to be his meaning, I should suppose no 
advantages would result from my meeting Major- 
General Phillips, while there are any reasons exist- 
ing in your Excellency's mind, which would make it 
improper, at this time, to go into a general exchange ; 
but, as I flatter myself he meant only to involve in 
my exchange that of General Phillips and General 
Riedesel, I think my meeting General Phillips will 
accelerate my exchange. I therefore will do myself 
the pleasure of waiting on your Excellency, on the 
10th of September, and hope then to have the honor 
of your instructions on the business I may have to 
transact. 

I propose to meet General Phillips at Elizabeth- 
town, on the 12th of next month. If your Excellen- 
cy's permission is necessary, for him to meet me at 
that place, I wish it might be sent to him. I have 
inclosed my letter to General Clinton, under a flying 
seal, which, if agreeable to your Excellency, I wish 
to have forwarded. I have the honor to be, my dear 
General, with the highest respect, your Excellency's 
Most obedient and most humble servant, 

Benjamin Lincoln. 



60 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM COLONEL PICKERING. 

PhiladelpUa, 11 August, 1780. 

Sir, 
You will doubtless, ere this reaches you, have been 
informed that Congress have been pleased to appoint 
me Quartermaster-General. This was so totally un- 
expected, that it will take me some days yet, before 
I can get ready to proceed to camp. In the mean 
time, I shall make some necessary arrangements for 
conducting the business of the department in this 
State, and the other States southward of it. The 
gentlemen concerned in the department with the ar- 
my, will, I hope, cheerfully continue to exercise the 
duties of their respective offices until my arrival in 
camp, which shall be as speedily as possible. I have 
the honor to be, with the greatest respect. 

Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

Timothy Pickering. 



from JAMES BOWDOIN. 

Boston, 17 August, 1780. 

Dear Sir, 
Yesterday arrived the frigate Alliance, forty days 
from L' Orient. She has on board two thousand stand 
of arms, a number of cannon, and a quantity of pow- 
der, for the United States. Your Excellency will 
give such orders concerning them as you think pro- 
per ; but, with respect to the arms, if there be not 
an absolute necessity for all of them, the Council 
would be glad you would allow one thousand of them, 
with bayonets, to be retained by this State, in lieu 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 61 

of the like number ue have lately furnished you 
with, as we have none in our magazines. 

Doctor Lee came passenger in the Alliance. He 
tells me the ships and troops that were intended to 
reenforce the French armament at Newport, remained 
at Brest when the last post came from thence, just 
before he sailed ; and there were then cruising thirty- 
two sail of British capital ships before that harbour, 
where were only twelve sail of the line of French 
ships ; but that there were at Cadiz thirty-six sail, 
French and Spanish, which it was supposed would 
proceed to Brest to remove the British and join the 
French ships there. He was surprised to hear that 
Admiral Graves was in this part of America, as they 
apprehended, in France, he had gone with his squa- 
dron in another direction. 

The Doctor says a great mob, of fifty or sixty 
thousand men, had appeared in London, and were 
masters of it three or four days, but had no valua- 
ble political object in view. They committed many 
robberies, destroyed many houses, particularly Lord 
Mansfield's, and pulled down every jail in London. 
They were finally quelled by the guards and militia, 
who killed three or four hundred of them. The Mi- 
nistry had intercepted several letters from Lord George 
Gordon, calculated to excite disturbances in Scotland, 
in consequence of which he had been committed to 
the Tower. 

The E-ussians and Dutch had agreed to insist, that 
none of their ships should be searched by British 
cruisers, and that they would be carriers for any na- 
tion whatsoever, which should think proper to employ 
them. There is no other intelligence of importance. 

I have obtained, from a person who came from 
Halifiix about a month ago, a sketch of the fortifica-

tions tliere, which I inclose for your further informa- 
tion. It would give us great satisfaction, if your Ex- 
cellency could inform us there is any probability of 
the allied forces being able to attempt any thing 
■with effect this campaign. I have the honor to be, 
with the sincerest esteem, Sir, 
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 

James Bowdoin. 



FROM COLONEL BRODHEAD. 

Fort Pitt, 18 August, 1780. 

Dear General, 

The Lieutenant of Monongalia county informs me, 
that ten men were killed on Friday last, above the 
forks of Cheat. They were quite off their guard 
when the Indians attacked them, and made no re- 
sistance. The troops are suffering for want of bread, 
the waters being too low to grind the grain; and I 
am informed that the pack-horse men have left the 
service for want of pay, &c. 

I take the liberty to inclose the proceedings of the 
General Court-Martial on the trials of Captain Tho- 
mas Beall, Peter Davis, and David Gamble, and shall 
be happy to receive your directions respecting them. 
The General Court-Martial has addressed a letter to 
your Excellency, which is inclosed with the proceed- 
ings. I have lately received two letters from the 
Delaware towns, copies of which I likewise take the 
liberty to inclose. It appears by the contents, that 
the Delawares and the Wyandots, and their nu- 
merous allies, might be speedily involved in a war 
against each other, provided we were possessed of 
the means to reward the Delawares for bringing in 
Wyandot scalps and prisoners. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 63 

The forts, in the new countiy, were taken by about 
two hundred white men and seven hundred Indians. 
Encouraged by their success, it is highly probable 
they will attempt carrying these garrisons, which, in 
their present circumstances, to superior numbers must 
inevitably fall a prey, unless timely supplies can be 
obtained. But the best exertions in my power shall 
not be wanting to prevent so fatal an event. I have 
the honor to be, with the utmost respect and esteem. 
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 

Daniel Brodhead. 



FROM COLONEL BRODHEAD. 

Fort Pitt, 21 August, 1780. 

Dear General, 

By Captain Duplantier, who is just arrived from 
the Delaware toAvns, I am informed that the British 
at Detroit treat the French inhabitants with great 
severity, and that they wish for nothing more than 
the approach of a body of troops from this place. 
The Captain adds, that Colonel Clark, with a body of 
about one thousand men, has actually destroyed the 
Shawanese town at Chellacoffy, and was in pursuit 
of the Indians when the runner, who brought the 
account, came from thence. 

I have just received a letter from the Reverend 
Mr. Heckewelder, and another from Captain John 
Killbuck, copies of which I take the liberty to in- 
close. Had I provisions, I should be happy to march 
against some of the hostile Indian towns. But, un- 
fortunately, I have not more than a day's allowance 
of bread, and a very little beef, and I cannot yet see 
a fair prospect of obtaining adequate supplies until

money can be furnished to pay for them. With the 
most exalted respect and esteem, &c. &c., 

Daniel Brodhead. 



FROM GOVERNOR RUTLEDGE, OF SOUTH CAROLINA. 

Philadelphia, 27 August, 1780. 

Dear Sir, 

I fully intended, for several weeks past, to pay 
my respects in person to your Excellency, but am 
obliged to deny myself that pleasure, having been 
detained here much longer than I expected, and 
beino- anxious to return to Carolina. 

Though I have no doubt that the matter committed 
to your Excellency, by a resolve of Congress of the 
5th instant, has already engaged your attention, and 
that you will order the most proper plan for effect- 
ino' so desirable a measure to be carried into execu- 
tion, as soon as the more immediate object of the 
present campaign will admit, yet I cannot forbear re- 
presenting, that the state of South Carolina and 
Georicia is such as demonstrates the absolute neces- 
sity of expelling the enemy from those countries, as 
speedily as possible ; and that this cannot be done 
without a considerable naval force, and a large num- 
ber of regular troops. I therefore flatter myself that, 
as soon as the intended operations against New York 
shall be terminated, either successfully (as I hope 
they will be) or by the season's not admitting a con- 
tinuance of them, or if an attack on that city should 
not be deemed expedient, your Excellency will send 
such a force to the southward. 

Congress have requested the Minister of France to 
use his influence to cause the plan of operations 



THE AMEKICAN REVOLUTION. 65 

which you may form, or the measures which you may 
recommend to be undertaken by the forces of their 
most Christian and Catholic Majesties, in consequence 
of the resolve above mentioned, to be carried into 
effect. He is heartily disposed and has promised to 
do so. Should your Excellency require aid from the 
French forces in the West Indies, I have good rea- 
sons to believe it will be afforded, unless the Com- 
manders there are expressly limited to acting in the 
islands, which I cannot conceive they are. In that 
case, I am persuaded that your application to the 
Court of France would obtain a revocation of such 
orders, and that his most Christian Majesty would 
grant any lesser forces which you may require, either 
from his kingdom or his islands. 

Thinking that it is thus in your power, and con- 
vinced that it is your earnest wish, to restore peace 
and safety to the two southernmost States, I hope 
those blessings will be speedily obtained. A con- 
sideration of the difficulty and delay attending the 
collecting any considerable quantity of provisions, will, 
I am sure, induce your Excellency to give timely 
notice of what measures you wish to have established 
in the Carolinas. I shall take the liberty of trans- 
mitting to your Excellency, from time to time, any 
intelligence which may appear material, and shall be 
happy to hear from you, that the prospect of cou> 
plete relief to my distressed country is not far dis- 
tant. I have the honor to be. 

With the greatest respect, &c., 

John Rutledge.

66 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GATES. 

Hillsborough, 30 August, 1(80. 

Sir, 

My public letter to Congress has surely been trans- 
mitted to your Excellency. Since then, I have been 
able to collect authentic returns of the killed, wound- 
ed, and missing of the officers of the Maryland line, 
Delaware regiment, artillerists, and those of the legion 
under Colonel Armand. They are inclosed. The mi- 
litia broke so early in the day, and scattered in so 
many directions upon their retreat, that very few 
have fallen into the hands of the enemy. 

By the firmness and bravery of the Continental 
troops, the victory is for from bloodless on the part 
of the foe J they having upwards of five hundred 
men, with officers in proportion, killed and wounded. 
I do not think Lord Cornwallis will be able to reap 
any advantage of consequence from his victory, as 
this State seems animated to reinstate and support 
the army. Virginia, I am confident, will not be less 
patriotic. By the joint exertions of these two States, 
there is good reason to hope that, should the events 
of the campaign be prosperous to your Excellency, 
all South Carolina might be again recovered. Lord 
Cornwallis remained with his army at Camden, when 
I received the last accounts from thence. I am can- 
toning ours at Salisbury, Guilford, Hillsborough, and 
Cross Creek. The Marylanders and artillerists, with 
the general hospital, will be here ; the cavalry near 
Cross Creek, and the militia to the westward. This is 
absolutely necessary, as we have no magazine of pro- 
visions, and are only supplied from hand to mouth. 
Two days after the action of the 16th, fortune seem- 



THE AMERICAN EEVOLUTION. 67 

ed determined to continue to distress us; for Colonel 
Sumpter, having marched near forty miles up the 
river Wateree, halted with the wagons and prisoners 
he had taken the 15th; by some indiscretion the 
men were surprised, cut off from their arms, the 
whole routed, and the wagons and prisoners retaken. 

What encouragement the numerous disaffected in 
this State may give Lord Cornwallis to advance fur- 
ther into the country, I cannot yet say. Colonel 
Sumpter, since his surprise and defeat upon the west 
side of the Wateree, has reinstated and increased his 
corps to upwards of one thousand men. I have 
directed him to continue to harass the enemy upon 
that side. Lord Cornwallis will therefore be cautious 
how he makes any considerable movement to the 
eastward, while this corps remains in force upon his 
left flank, and the main body is, in a manner, can- 
toned in his front. Anxious for the public good, I 
shall continue my unwearied endeavours to stop the 
progress of the enemy, to reinstate our affairs, to re- 
commence an offensive war, and recover all our losses 
in the Southern States. But, if being unfortunate is 
solely reason sufficient for removing me from com- 
mand, I shall most cheerfully submit to the orders 
of Congress, and resign an office few Generals would 
be anxious to possess, and where the utmost skill 
and fortitude are subject to be baffled by the difficul- 
ties which must for a time surround the Chief in 
command here. That your Excellency may meet 
with no such difficulties; that your road to fame and 
fortune may be smooth and easy, is the sincere wish 
of. Sir, 

Your Excellency's most obedient, &c., 

Horatio Gates. 

P. S. Your commands, in respect to the Virginia 
line, shall be exactly and faithfully obeyed. 



68 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 



PETITION FROM BEZA WOODWARD AND OTHERS. 

August 30, 1780. 

To his Excellency George Washington^ Commander-in- 
chief of the forces of the United States^ in North 
America, humbly showeth 

The petition of the principal inhabitants on Connect- 
icut River, on both sides, and northward of Charles- 
town, met in Convention, at Dresden, on the New 
Hampshire Grants, August 30th, A. D. 1780; — 

That the union of Canada with the United States 
is, in our opinion, of the greatest importance to them, 
for the following reasons, namely; — 

There is but one seaport in that country which we 
shall ever have need to defend; yet good water-car- 
riage for near two thousand miles, stretching itself, in 
a circular manner, round the thirteen United States, 
through an excellent country of land, great part of 
which is inhabited by savages, whose fur and skin 
trade produces to our enemies an annual profit which 
is immense. 

The annual produce of wheat in that country, for 
exportation, is very great, by which the British ar- 
mies in America receive essential advantage. The 
capture of that country will be a leading step to- 
wards securing to the United States the profits of the 
fish, oil, &c., procured at and near the Gulf of St. 
Lawrence, which would be a greatly beneficial acquisi- 
tion. While they hold possession of Canada, our fron- 
tiers must be very extensive, and the savages at their 
command; and, we had almost said, the enemy de- 
stroy and take yearly from the frontiers bordering on 
Canada as much in value as the cost of reducing 
and holding that country. We are sure the defence 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 69 

of our frontiers costs more. The securing tliat coun- 
try in our interest will be the only effectual means 
to enable us to secure those of Ohio and Mississippi, 
both on account of obtaining in that way the interest 
of the savages in our favor, and as the conveyance 
for the enemy (while they hold possession of Canada) 
of men, ammunition, and provisions to those parts, is 
not only as easy, but more expeditious and safe, than 
by the Gulf of Mexico ; and, in our opinion, those 
countries cannot otherwise be effectually secured. 

By obtaining Canada, we add to our force thirty 
thousand fighting men, and destroy the efficacy of 
the bill passed in the British Parliament, in the year 
1774, for extending the Province of Quebec, which 
includes the Province of Maine, and great part of 
New Hampshire, these Grants, &c. ; the establishment 
of which is, without doubt, the main olyect of the 
enemy in taking and holding possessions at Penob- 
scot, and within the extent of which the United States 
have not a single fortress to cover their claim in op- 
position to that of the British. In short, that bill is 
so extensive, that, should it be established, the United 
States would have little or nothing left worth con- 
tending for; and we see not how it can be effectually 
destroyed but by an union of Canada with them. The 
body of inhabitants in that country are desirous of 
such union; and unless it can be brought about speed- 
ily, by sending a force into Canada, they will be un- 
der necessity to take an active part against us, which 
they have hitherto avoided. 

The whole force of Britain now in arms in Canada, 
at all their posts, from Quebec to Detroit, including 
one thousand five hundred Tories and Indians (who 
are continually roving and destroying our frontiers), 
does not exceed five thousand men. One thousand 



70 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

are stationed in tlie district of Montreal, and six hun- 
dred of the rovers have that district for their head- 
quarters. The communication from the settlements 
on this river to St. Charles, on Chamhlee River, is 
easj; the road already opened more than half the 
way; the rest may be opened at very little expense, 
and the Avhole will be very good ; the distance about 
one hundred miles. A good Commander, with a few 
Continental troops, in addition to such volunteers as 
may be raised on these Grants and in tlie New Eng- 
land States, with a suitable quantity of arms and 
ammunition to furnish those Canadians who are now 
eager for such an expedition, and will at once join 
us on the arrival of an army there, will easily take 
possession of and keep the district of Montreal ; and, 
that being secured, the country above, even to and 
beyond the western Lakes, must soon submit to the 
United States. 

Your petitioners are confident that fifteen hundred 
men from these Grants will turn out, if called upon, 
to assist in taking possession of that country. They 
can and will cheerfully furnish five hundred horses, 
one hundred teams, and ten thousand bushels of 
wheat, and more if necessary ; also such other grain 
as may be wanted, on the credit of the Continent, 
from the district of country betwixt the heights on 
the two sides of Connecticut River, and north of the 
Massachusetts Bay, the inhabitants of which (more 
than five thousand families) are now chiefly obliged 
to hold the sword in one hand and tools for hus- 
bandry in the other, and probably must continue so 
to do till that country is reduced, unless we have a 
large Continental force continually supported here, to 
defend us from their ravages, as our frontier is very 
extensive. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 71 

We therefore humbly pray, that your Excellency 
will be pleased to recommend to Congress, that, by 
the middle of September next, or as soon as possible, 
a party, under a suitable Commander, be sent on the 
said enterprise, and a recommendation to the people 
in this country and the New England States for 
volunteers to join their force in the expedition ; and 
that ^ve make ready necessary provisions, wdiich we 
shall cheerfully comply with, to the utmost of our 
power. 

And, as in duty bound, shall ever pray. 
Per order of the Convention, 

Beza Woodward, Clerh. 



FROM JOHN NIXON AND GEORGE CLYIMER. 

Philadelphia, August, 1780. 

Sir, 

A letter from your Excellency to Messrs. Meredith 
and Barclay, at Trenton, has been by those gentle- 
men handed to us, as best able to give the necessar}'' 
information respecting some of those subjects of in- 
quiry on wMch it turns. We perceive from it, that 
considerable dependence is placed upon the Pennsjd- 
vania Bank for keeping the army supplied with pro- 
visions ; but how far this dependence should justly 
go, your Excellency will be best able to judge when 
we shall have laid before you a state of its affiiirs. 

The groundwork was a deposit of money arising 
from subscription. This subscription is about eleven 
hundred thousand pounds, Continental currency, of 
which we are now in the receipt of two payments, 
of ten per cent. each. But what we principally rest- 
ed on, was that convenience the trading people would 



72 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

find in lodging their money in the Bank, taking our 
notes payable on demand, by which, as the notes 
might be expected to have a free and continued cir- 
culation, we should have the command of a vast fund 
for our purchases. From these two sources of supply 
we have, as yet, drawn but about four hundred thou- 
sand pounds, with a well-grounded confidence, how- 
ever, that the production of the latter will be pro- 
portionably greater the longer it remains open. Part 
of this amount, agreeably to the prudential rules of 
similar institutions, it was necessary to reserve in 
our hands ; with the remainder we should haA^e pro- 
ceeded in the purchases of flour, had any been at 
market (which, since the harvest, has not been the 
case), but for the attention we thought ourselves 
obliged to show to the requisition for tents from the 
Committee of Congress with the army, who informed 
us they were of still more indispensable necessity 
than flour. Of these, Mr. Francis, the factor of the 
Bank, has purchased materials for five or six hundred, 
which he has directed to be made up, and will for- 
ward to the army. We shall, however, in consequence 
of your Excellency's letter, desist from further pur- 
chases in this article, and resume our original de- 
sign, as flour can be obtained ; but as to the daily or 
weekly quantities, we shall be able to supply, we 
can have no certain answer. 

On the whole our sentiments are, that it will be 
proper to consider the Bank rather as coming in aid 
of the ordinary means of supply, than as being in 
itself equal to any great effect without them; and 
that it will not, by any means, supersede the neces- 
sity of any one of them. But, though we cannot 
venture to say what degree of support this establish- 
ment may receive from the public, we can assure 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 73 

your Excellency, that there is the best disposition in 
all those who have the conduct of it, to extend its 
means, and make it as extensively useful as possible. 

We are, &c., &c..

FROM governor JEFFERSON. 

Richmond, 3 September, 1780. 

Sir, 

As I know the anxieties you must have felt since 
the late misfortune to the south, and our later ac- 
counts have not been quite so unfavorable as the 
first, I take the liberty of inclosing you a state of 
this unlucky affair, extracted from letters from Gene- 
ral Gates, General Stevens, and Governor Nash, and 
taken, as to some circumstances, from an officer who 
was in the action. 

Another army is collecting. This amounted, on 
the 23d ultimo, to between four and five thousand 
men, consisting of about five hundred Maryland regu- 
lars, a few of Harrison's artillery, and Porterfield's 
corps, Armand's legion, such of the fugitive militia as 
had been reclaimed, and about three thousand North 
Carolina militia, newly embodied. We are told they 
will increase these to eight thousand. Our new re- 
cruits will rendezvous in this State between the 10th 
and 25th instant. We are calling out two thousand 
militia, who I think, however, will not be got to Hills- 
borough till the 25th of October. About three hun- 
dred and fifty regulars marched from Chesterfield a 
week ago. Fifty march to-morrow, and there will be 
one hundred or one hundred and fifty more from that 
post, when they can be cleared of the hospital. This

74 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

is as good a view as I can give you of the force we 
are endeavouring to collect. But they are unarmed. 
Almost the whole small arms seem to have been lost 
in the late rout. There are here, on their way south- 
ward, three thousand stand of arms, sent by Congress, 
and we have a few still remaining in our magazine. 
I have written pressingly, as the subject well de- 
serves, to Congress, to send us, immediately, supplies, 
and to think of forming a magazine here, that, in 
case of another disaster, we may not be left without 
all means of opposition. 

I inclosed to your Excellency, some time ago, a re- 
solution of Assembly, instructing us to send a quan- 
tity of tobacco to New York for the relief of our offi- 
cers there, and asking the favor of you to obtain 
permission. Having received no answer, I fear my 
letter or your answer has miscarried. I therefore now 
take the liberty of repeating my ajDplication to you. 
I have the honor to be, with the most profound re- 
spect and esteem, &c., &c.

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GATES. 

Hillsborougli. 3 September, 1780. 

Sir, 

I had, the day before yesterday, the honor of re- 
ceiving your Excellency's letter, dated the 8th of 
August, from Orangetown. It gave me infinite satis- 
faction to find you had baffled Sir Harry Clinton's 
designs, and was, to all appearance, in so prosperous 
a situation. Heaven grant you the greatest honor 
and success ! 

As to the situation of affairs here, since my last 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 75 

letter to your Excellency of the SOtli ultimo, I can 
only say no considerable alteration has taken place, 
the enemy remaining still, and the disaffected doing 
nothing of consequence to disturb us. Fourteen hun- 
dred of the second draft of the militia of this State 
are marched to cover Salisburj'^, and the country from 
thence to Charlotte, where Colonel Sumpter has a com- 
mand, which occasionally acts upon the west side of 
the Wateree, and has hitherto given such a jealousy 
to the British in Camden as to keep them at home. 
Three hundred Virginia riflemen, under Colonel Camp- 
bell, and militia from the back counties, are marching 
to the east bank of the Yadkin, at the ford ; and 
General Stevens, with what have not run home, of 
the other Virginia militia, is at Guilford Court- 
House. The ]\Iaryland division and the artillery are 
here, to be refitted ; the former will be put into one 
strong regiment, with a good light infantry company, 
under Colonel Williams. The rest of the officers will 
be sent immediately to Maryland, for the purpose 
directed by your Excellency in your letter to the 
Baron de Kalb, of the 27th June, which came to my 
hands only yesterday, from Richmond, in Virginia. 
General Muhlenberg acquaints me that near five hun- 
dred regulars are upon their march from Petersburg 
to this place ; these, with the INIarylanders above- 
mentioned, will make us stronger in Continental 
troops than I was before the action. The cavalry, 
under the Colonels White and Washington and Ma- 
jor Nelson, are not quite equipped, so as to be able 
to march to Bock Fish, in the neighbourhood of 
Cross Creek, as I directed ; but I hope they will 
soon be in a condition to obey my orders. 

Colonel Dubuysson, Aid-de-camp to the Baron de 



76 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

Kalb, a most amiable young officer, will soon wait 
upon your Excellency; he was wounded and taken, 
but Lord Cornwallis has permitted him to go to Phil- 
adelphia, on i^arole. All the Baron's baggage and 
papers are saved ; they are delivered to Colonel Du- 
buysson, who will be responsible for them. Too much 
honor cannot be paid by Congress to the memory of 
the Baron de Kalb ; he was every thing an excellent 
officer should be, and, in the cause of the United 
States, has sacrificed his life. 

If I can yet render good service to the United 
States, it will be necessary it should be seen that I 
have the support of Congress and your Excellency ; 
otherwise some men may think they please my supe- 
riors by blaming me, and thus recommend themselves 
to favor. But you, Sir, will be too generous to lend 
an ear to such men, if such there be, and will show 
your greatness of soul rather by protecting, than 
slighting, the unfortunate. If, on the contrary, I am 
not supported, and countenance is given to every one 
who will speak disrespectfully of me, it will be bet- 
ter for Congress to remove me at once from a com- 
mand where I shall be unable to render them any 
good service. This, Sir, I submit to your candor 
and honor, and shall cheerfully await the decision of 
my superiors. With the warmest wishes for your 
prosperity, and the sincerest sentiments of esteem 
and regard, I am, Sir, 

Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 

Horatio Gates. 

P. S. Inclosed are two letters of Lord Bawdon, 
found at the house of Rugely, thirteen miles from 
Camden, to whom they are directed ; which will show

FROM COLONEL BRODHEAD. 

Fort Pitt, 5 September, 1780. 

Dear General, 

Yesterday, the Indians killed two men, of the fron- 
tier inhabitants, on Robeson's Run, in this county 
(Yougliiogania), and fired at two soldiers who were 
taking some stores in a canoe from hence to Fort 
Henry. One of them is wounded, but neither of 
them fell into the hands of the enemy. I would have 
sent a party to pursue the Indians, but I have no 
provisions left, nor do I see any prospect of an ade- 
quate supply, as the drought still continues, and we 
have neither money nor credit to make purchases. 

Colonel Clark has lately destroyed two of the Sha- 
wanese towns, and Idlled six men and one woman, 
and is returned to the Falls. If a sufficient quantity 
of provisions can be obtained, I will yet visit the 
Wyandots by the 1st of November; and I believe 
the country will be unanimous in joining me upon 
an expedition. 

I have the honor to be, &c. &c., 

Daniel Brodhe^ad.

78 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 



FROM JOSEPH JONES, IN CONGRESS. 

Pbiladelpbia, 6 September, 1780. 

Dear Sir, 

I have received j^our favor of tlie loth ultimo, 
upon the subject of a report respecting a certain 
gentleman, and thank you for the freedom and can- 
did manner of your communications. The resentment, 
discovered against the gentleman alluded to, began 
to subside before your letter came to hand ; and 
though for some time it was occasionally mentioned 
in conversation, it has lately died away, and will, I 
expect, not be revived. The report of the Committee 
not only accepted his resignation, but went further; 
and, I believe, had it been then determined, the gen- 
tleman would have been informed his services in the 
line of the army would have been dispensed with, 
that he might have leisure to attend to the settle- 
ment of his accounts. Had this step been taken, it 
is probable a resignation would have ensued, and 
perhaps a public discussion in the papers, which 
would have produced no good; and, upon the whole, 
I am well pleased the matter was carried no flirther 
than it has been. 

But, unacquainted as I am with antecedent circum- 
stances, and judging from what was before me, my 
opinion was, the gentleman was justly reprehensible 
for the manner of his conduct as a servant of the 
public emplo^^ed in an important office, or as a citi- 
zen embarked in the common cause of America. The 
amazing sums of money gone into that department, 
under his superintendence, about eighty millions, and, 
it is said, about thirty millions unpaid, the whole of 
which is unaccounted for, has excited uneasiness not 
only in tliis body, but the people at large, Avho call 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 79 

out for a settlement of the public accounts ; and al- 
though repeated endeavours have been used to bring 
the officers in this great department of the army to 
account, none have been rendered, nor any likelihood 
of bringing them to a settlement. The embezzlement 
and waste of public property, in these departments, 
have greatly contributed to enhance our debt and 
depreciate the currency; and these abuses demand 
inquiry and punishment. But I see no fair prospect 
of obtaining satisfaction for past transgressions, and 
shall be happy to find we shall be able to avoid the 
like practices in future. A reform, or an attempt to 
reform, seemed absolutely necessary for the satisfac- 
tion of the public ; and, although the new system was 
pronounced a physical impossibility in execution, oth- 
ers, who have served long in the army, and were of 
the Committee that made the alterations, entertained 
a contrary opinion; and they affirm the gentleman 
now in office, if he can be supported with money, 
can fully carry the new system into execution. 

In short, I have seen some, and been told of so 
many abuses in the Quarter-master's, Commissary's, 
and Medical departments, in the course of the last 
two years, that I candidly confess I feel a degree 
of resentment against the conduct of many in those 
departments, bordering on prejudice so nearly, that I 
have resolved to condemn no person, even in opinion, 
without sure proof of delinquency, lest I should in- 
jure the character of some honest man in the gene- 
ral censure, which, unhappily, is but too prevalent. 

What I feared for some time is at length but too 
evident, that our designs against New York must 
wait for more favorable circumstances to attempt 
carrying them into execution. Perhaps something 
may, in the course of the winter, be done at the 



80 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

south, should we be in a situation to recover oui 
losses there, and be in time provided with a well- 
appointed regular army, and magazine of provisions 
laid up. It is to be hoped we shall, in the spring, 
before the enemy can be reenforced and obtain sup- 
plies, be in condition to act offensively against New 
York. Your letters of the 20th of last month, and 
of the 27th, to the States, are before a Committee, 
and will, in a day or two, be reported upon, as to 
flour and meat. The great objects of drawing forth, 
in time, a competent regular army, and laying up 
magazines, will soon come in, and I hope soon go 
through Congress, that the several States may pro- 
ceed to make the necessary provisions. I shall leave 
this place on Thursday for Virginia, and mean to at- 
tend our next session of Assembly, in hopes of pro- 
moting a cession, on the part of the State, of their 
claim to the lands north-west of the Ohio, to the 
United States, which will be recommended to all the 
States having unappropriated western territory, for 
the purpose of completing the Confederation. I shall 
be glad to hear from you while there, upon any mat- 
ters that may occur and you shall think proper to 
communicate. 

With great esteem, I am, &c., 

Joseph Jones. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL ARNOLD. 

Dobbs's Feny, 11 September, 1780. 

Dear Sir, 
Yesterday, I had the honor to receive your Excel- 
lency's letter of the 7th, and am very happy to hear 
such favorable accounts from the southward. I hope 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 81 

our affairs in that quarter will soon wear a more 
pleasing aspect than ever. 

Colonel Sheldon complains to me that his horses 
are much worn down ; and the inhabitants of West- 
chester complain, that the country is not sufficiently 
guarded against the enemy. I have, therefore, sent 
Colonel Hay fifty men from West Point, as more eli- 
gible than taking them from the lines. Mr. Stephens 
informs me that there are one hundred hogsheads of 
rum at Springfield, but that teams cannot be procur- 
ed to bring it on. 

I came here this morning, in order to establish 
signals, to be observed in case the enemy came up 
the river ; to give some directions respecting the 
guard-boats ; and to have a beacon fixed upon the 
mountain, about five miles south of King's Ferry, 
which will be necessary to alarm the country. The 
one fixed there formerly has been destroyed. 

There are some cannon at West Point, which are 
of little service, except for signal-guns. " I propose 
sending two of them to Colonel Gouvion, for that 
purpose, if agreeable to your Excellency. A supply 
of cattle, for some, days, had arrived at West Point 
before I left it. I am informed that considerable 
numbers have been crossed at King's Ferry. I am 
in hopes the army will be better supplied in future. 
I have the honor to be, &c., 

Benedict Arnold.* 



* The 11th of September was the day, which had been agreed upon 
between Arnold and Andre for an interview at Dobbs's Ferry, to ma- 
ture the treasonable project of delivering "West Point into the possession 
of the enemy. Arnold went down the river in his barge, for that ob- 
ject, but, by some accident, the interview was defeated. Washington's 
head-quarters were but a few miles from Dobbs's Ferry, in Bergen 
county. New Jersey. As Arnold's passage down the river, and return to 
West Point, could not escape observation, he wrote the above letter, as- 



82 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 



FllOM MAJOR-GENERAL ARNOLD. ^ 

Head-Quarters, Robinson's House, 
12 September, 1780. 

Dear Sir, 

Last night, I had the honor to receive your Excel- 
lency's favor of yesterday, inclosing a copy of a 
Council of War, held the 6th. I will endeavour, 
agreeably to your Excellency's request, to transmit 
my opinion on the matters submitted, by the time 
required. I sincerely wish the situation of our affairs 
would admit ni}'- giving it with more decision than I 
am able to do at present. 

The order, contained in the postscript of your Excel- 
lency's letter of the 7th, to send the eight bargemen 
of Colonel Putnam's regiment to join their regiment, 
I conceive to be on a supposition of their being idle 
at West Point. I beg leave to observe, that they are 
now employed as my bargemen ; that all the militia 
oarsmen had, previous to the receipt of the order, 
been drafted, and sent to different commands, at 
King's Ferry and elsewhere, so that it is out of my 
power to procure a proper crew for my barge ; for 
which reasons I have thought proper to detain them 
until I receive your Excellency's further orders on 
the subject. 

I take the liberty of inclosing extracts of a letter 
from Colonel Hay, of the 9th, respecting flour, &c. 
I sincerely wish he may succeed in his endeavours to 
procure flour (of which I am very doubtful) in the 
quantities he has requested, as I believe the requisi- 

signing plausible reasons, for the purpose of remo%-ing any suspicions 
that might arise as to his real designs. Sj^arks's Life and Treason of 
Arnold, p. 181.

tion larger than (when all others are answered) the 
State can comply Avith. 

About thirty bateau-men, mentioned in Colonel 
Hay's letter, w^ere sent down w^ith Captain Denny to 
King's Ferry. As, in case of an evacuation of these 
posts. Colonel Livingston's garrison, with the troops 
sent down, will be sufficient to man the bateaux, I 
think it will be best to order the bateau-men to be 
sent to Fishkill. Your Excellency's general orders of 
the 28th and 30th ultimo, from the Adjutant-General, 
were received last evening, and published in my or- 
ders of this day. 

I have the honor to be, &c., 

Benedict Arnold. 



FROM COLONEL SHELDON. 

Lower Salem, 12 September, 1780. 

Dear General, 
In your favor of the 10th instant, you desired to 
know, through what channel I received ISIr. Ander- 
son's letter. It was by a flag that came to our lines, 
and forw^arded to me by Lieutenant-Colonel Jameson. 
It came to me sealed. The person, so often mention- 
ed, has returned from New York, where he was de- 
tained ten days before he could obtain permission to 
return. He was not suffered to leave his quarters, un- 
less escorted by some person appointed by the Com- 
manding Officer for that purpose; by which means 
he had no opportunity of gaining any intelligence of 
consequence. He will be at your quarters within a 
few days. His name is Elijah Hunter. General Par- 
sons had not arrived at North Castle yesterday at 



84 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

twelve o'clock. I am to inform you that I have been 
in arrest two or three days, on a complaint exhibited 
to head-quarters by a villain by the name of Darius 
Stoddard, for defrauding the public, together with 
sundry other charges. 

I have the honor to be, &c., 

Elisha Sheldon. 



FROM COLONEL BRODHEAD. 

Fort Pitt, 14 September, 1780. 

Dear General, 

I am honored with your favor of the 4th of July, 
and cannot avoid feeling most sensibly the neglect 
or want of resources, to enable your Excellency, and 
those wdio have the honor of commanding under you, 
to act offensively against the enemy. I am happy, 
however, to find that our good allies afford us aid, 
and have a happy presage that, with the smiles of 
divine Providence, your Excellency will be enabled 
to drive the enemy out of our country. 

The French inhabitants at Detroit are much in our 
interest, and wish most heartily to see an American 
force approaching. I really believe that twelve hun- 
dred well-appointed men would carry that place with- 
out great difficulty, and I wish for nothing more, 
when circumstances will admit, than the honor of 
making the attempt. The whole garrison, with ser- 
geants to lead them, came to my quarters, a few 
days ago, to represent that they had not received 
any bread for five days together. Their conduct was 
civil and respectful, and, upon being told that every 
possible exertion was making to prevent their further 
suffering, they retired in good order to their quarters. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 85 

I make use of every fair mefhod, and sometimes a 
little compulsion, to obtain a temporary supply. But, 
with my best endeavours, I am very apprehensive 
Tve shall be great sufferers before your requisitions 
are complied with. Both Gamble and Davis, who 
were under sentence of death, and who well deserved 
their fate, have been suffered to make their escape 
out of the guard-house, although they were ironed 
on hands and feet. I ordered the ofhcers, who com- 
manded the guards, under arrest for neglect of duty. 
One of them is tried and acquitted; the other re- 
mains to be tried. Colonel Gibson was appointed 
President of the General Court-Martial, ordered by 
your Excellency, and the same court remains until 
it is your pleasure to dissolve it. 

I have the honor to be, &c., 

Daniel Bkodhead. 

P. S. I have taken the liberty to inclose an ex- 
tract from a letter I lately received from the Rev- 
erend Mr. Ileckewelder. Two Indians, who were sent 
from the ^Moravian towns, with messages to Sandusky, 
report that almost all the Wyandot party, consisting 
of thirty old warriors, were killed and wounded by 
the party sent to attack them. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL ARNOLD. 

14 September, 1780. 

Sir, 
In answer to your Excellency's questions, proposed 
to the Council of General Officers on the 6th instant, 
I beg leave to observe that, from the uncertainty of 
VOL. in. 8 



86 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

the arrival of the second division of the French fleet, 
as well as of their force, and from the fluctuating 
situation of our affairs, which may be totally changed 
in a short time, by a variety of circumstances which 
may happen, it appears to me extremely difficult to 
determine, with any degree of precision, the line of 
conduct proper to be observed. 

If the second division of the French fleet may be 
soon expected, and their force, of which I am ignor- 
ant, will give us a decided superiority over the ene- 
my as well by land as sea, I am of opinion every 
necessary preparation and disposition should be made 
to attack New York, provided w^e have a sufficiency 
of ammunition and military stores, and there is a 
prospect of the army (when collected) being supplied 
with provision (the former I much doubt). But if 
there is not good reason to suppose the second divi- 
sion of the French fleet, Avith a force superior to that 
of the enemy, will arrive in the course of a month, 
I am of opinion no offensive operations can, with 
prudence, be undertaken this fall against New York j 
in which case, it is possible the enemy will detail a 
part of their force in New York to join those in 
South Carolina, or to cooperate with those in Virgi- 
nia or Maryland. 

I am, therefore, of opinion, that the Pennsylvania 
line, which I suppose to amount to twenty-five hun- 
dred or three thousand men, should hold themselves 
in readiness to march; and if the same division of 
the French fleet does not arrive by the 1st of Octo- 
ber, that then the Pennsylvania line should march to 
the relief of the Southern States, who, with the aid 
of so formidable a regular force here, if they do their 
duty, will be able to repel the enemy in that quar- 
ter; and, if the French fleet should arrive too late to 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 87 

operate against New York, South Carolina may be an 
object worthy their attention. 

Without a decided superiority by sea, I am of opi- 
nion no offensive operations against the enemy can, 
with prudence, be undertaken this fall; and, it is to 
be hoped, that the States, by this time, are convinc- 
ed of the necessity of immediately raising an army 
during the war, and that they will, without loss of 
time, take future measures for that purpose. I should 
suppose the Pennsylvania line might be replaced by 
some of the troops at Rhode Island, before the time 
is expired for which the militia are called out. 
I have the honor to be, &c., 

Benedict Aknold. 



FROM JOHN MATHEWS, IN CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 15 September, 1780. 

My dear Sir, 
I had the pleasure of receiving your favor of the 
9th instant, by Doctor Craik, two days ago. There 
is a new arrangement for the Medical department, 
now before Congress, and nearly completed, by which 
there will be a very great reduction of ofi&cers. By 
the new system, there will be fifteen principal offi- 
cers to be elected by Congress, which, I apprehend, 
will be but too much influenced by that spirit which 
has given a well-grounded alarm to the gentlemen 
concerned. Evidently to evince how far such a dis- 
position has already operated, the new Quartermaster- 
General is allowed to hold his commission at the 
Board of War, in direct violation of a law of Con- 
gress, and which has been uniformly practised upon, 
except in a few instances of no importance. But to 



88 LETTEKS TO WASHINGTON. 

suffer a man to hold two commissions, of the first 
consequence under the United States, savors so strong- 
ly of an outrageous partiality, that I shall he sur- 
prised at nothing that may hereafter happen. 

I have the pleasure of heing acquainted with most 
of the gentlemen mentioned hy your Excellency, and 
know their worth, and no endeavours shall he want- 
ing, on my part, to promote their reestablishment ; 
hut I fear it will not he in my power to do them 
much service, for I find there is a decided party 
formed against the Committee that were at camp, 
which I have reason seriously to dread will be pro- 
ductive of no good to our public affairs. I owe much 
to the public, but still I owe something to myself. 
I can never tamely suffer a set of miscreants to tri- 
umph over me with impunit}^ Regardless of our 
characters, as members of their own body, I find we 
are to be considered as Quarter-masters, &c., and lia- 
ble to equal insults, without the least pretensions to 
call such conduct in question. But I can assure 
them they will find me of a temper by no means 
calculated to answer their newfimgled dogmas. 

Although I had heard a good deal, and seen some- 
thing, of the rancor of these demagogues, yet I never 
imagined it had risen to that height I w^as made to 
feel it had done, on my resuming my seat in Con- 
gress. I took the first opportunity of going very 
largely into the state of our afiairs, in order to found 
some propositions which I made ; but, without allow- 
ing them to be worthy of a commitment, much less 
of their consideration, they were, in the lump, reject- 
ed. However, I have this consolation, to reflect they 
were approved by those, whose disinterestedness and 
judgment I have the best opinion of Such an in- 
sult I never saw offered to any member of Congress 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 89 

before. It shows such a determined and premeditated 
prejudice, as must inevitably lay me under the neces- 
sity of doing what I would wish most earnestly to 
avoid. 

I beg your pardon, Sir, for detaining you so long 
on a subject relative to myself. But as my plan, 
above mentioned, was for the establishment of a per- 
manent army and the means of supporting the war, 
I thought it a subject you were so much interested 
in, that it would not be unacceptable to you to know 
the result of my endeavours, and how little prospect 
I have of being farther useful to this end; for, I 
suppose, any future propositions of mine will be im- 
mediately exploded, "as too strongly tinctured with 
those army princiiJles which I had imbibed whilst with 
them." I cannot but think it hard that a man, who 
wishes to be useful, should be thus unjustly precluded 
from being so. However, I know the rectitude of 
my intentions, and can, at all times, retire to my 
own bosom for my justification; and whilst that mo- 
nitor supports me, I shall continue to act my part, 
regardless of every contentious spirit. 

Your Excellency's letter of the 20th ultimo has 
now been twenty-four days in the hands of a Com- 
mittee. I have repeatedly called for a report from 
them; but, by what I can find, little or nothing has 
been yet done upon it. This does not at all surprise 
me ; and, I dare say, by the time the Committee and 
Congress have done with it, the time will arrive when 
the army ought to be in the field. This ruinous de- 
lay I wanted to prevent, by Congress taking up my 
propositions in the first instance ; but, by their not 
doing it, I may readily conclude it militated too 
much against the plan they have in contemplation, 
and therefore further conclude it will not be such a

one as will, in its operation, be effectual. This may 
look like arrogating too much to myself; but the 
event -will prove whether I am right or not. 
I have the honor to be, &c.,

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL ARNOLD. 
Head- Quarters, Eobinson's House, 16 September, 1780. 

Dear Sir, 
Last evening, I was honored with your Excellen- 
cy's favor of the 14th. I have given orders for the 
guard requested, as also to the Quarter-master to 
furnish forasre at Mr. Birdsall's for the number of 
horses mentioned in your Excellency's letter. 

My answers to the questions proposed by your 
Excellency to the Council of War I will do myself 
the honor to deliver in person. 

I am, &c., 

Benedict Arnold.*

Dear General, 
I have this moment received intelligence, that the

Arnold joined the enemy on the 25th of September, and this is the 
last letter written by him to Washington before that event. Many

frontier. Major Lanctot lias wrote me in French, and 
I take the liberty to inclose a copy of the transla- 
tion. The Delaware runners add, that a party of 
twenty Indian warriors have been discovered, about 
six days ago, marching towards these settlements, 
and that a large party of Senecas may soon be ex- 
pected down the Alleghany River. 

Last week seven persons were killed and taken by 
the savages, in an interior settlement on Ten Mile 
Creek. As no supply of goods has yet been sent 
for the Delaware Indians, agreeably to treaty, I con- 
ceive they will be compelled to make terms with the 
British, or perish; and next spring we shall have a 
general Indian war. 

If I had a sufficient number of men, and a supply 
of provisions, I should be happy to meet the enemy, 
before they reach the posts or settlements ; but I see 
no method, but force, to obtain it, and the mills can- 
not grind for want of water. 

Should this intelligence prove true (and I have no 
reason to doubt it), I will do all I can to oppose the 
designs of the enemy; but my regular force is very 
small, and the inhabitants will be in the greatest 
dread imaginable. Indeed, I expect they think more 
of flight than resistance. 

I have the honor to be, &c., 

Daniel Brodhead. 

P. S. The Delaware messengers say, that Captain 
Mclntyre's party killed eighteen or nineteen of the 
Wyandots that were crossing the Ohio, as mentioned 
in a former letter. 



92 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 



FROM J.-UVIES DmVNE, IN CONGRESS. 

PliUadelpbia, 19 September, 1780. 

]\Iy dear General, 

I am to acknowledge the honor of your Excel- 
lency's favor of the 9th instant, on the subject of 
the Hospital department. Your solicitude that gen- 
tlemen of distinguished merit should be employed, is 
a continued proof of your attention to the public 
good; and those you particularize will not fail of be- 
ing supported. 

We are deeply engaged on the subjects of your 
Excellency's several letters. Considerable progress is 
made in that which is the principal, the raising a 
permanent army. Congress unite in sentiment, that 
it is essential; that it is the surest and the only 
means of producing an honorable peace. To render 
it practicable and certain, is the difficulty. There is, 
in my mind, no question but that it will be submit- 
ted for your opinion before it becomes conclusive. 

I wish it was in my power to communicate agree- 
able events, to counterbalance our southern misfor- 
tunes. The weight of them daily diminishes, by a 
comparison of facts with the hasty information of the 
Commanding Officer of the detachment. The loss, 
however, of artillery and baggage, and, above all, of 
small arms, must be severely felt; and the precipi- 
tate flight of the militia expose us to insult, after 
every alleviation. Of one comfort we cannot be de- 
prived ; our regular troops have acquired unfading- 
glory. 

I find, with great satisfaction, that the Legislature 
of New York have fallen in with the view of the 
eastern Convention, and particularly to strengthen the 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 93 

hands of Congress, and enable tliem to enforce their 
decisions. We can never manage the public interests 
with success, till this disposition becomes general; 
nor can any thing else, under the Divine blessing, 
be necessary to give us a decided superiority over 
our enemies. We have now obtained military know- 
ledge in an eminent degree ; we have internal re- 
sources, and reputation abroad ; we have a great and 
respectable all}^ Of what, then, are we destitute, but 
vigor and confidence in government, and public spirit 
in individuals ? 

I shall be happy to be honored with a line, after 
your interview at Hartford, if your leisure admits. I 
hope it will prove some relaxation from the severe 
and anxious cares, which have fallen to your share 
too long, and with too much w^eight. Permit me to 
add, that I am, with every sentiment of the most 
affectionate attachment, &c. 

James Du.\ne. 



FROM GOVERNOE, JEFFERSON. 

Richmond, 23 September, 1780. 

Sir, 
I yesterday forwarded to you a letter from Colonel 
Wood, informing you of his situation. That post has 
been, for some time past, pretty regularly supplied, 
and I hope will continue so to be for some time to 
come. A person, whose punctuality can be relied on, 
offers to contract for victualling it. If we can agree 
on terms, and the Assembly will strengthen our 
"hands sufficiently, we think to adopt that method, as 
the only one to be relied on with certainty. I have 
heard it hinted that Colonel Wood thinks of quitting 



94 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

that post. I should be exceedingly sorry, indeed, 
were he to do it. He has given, to those under his 
charge, the most perfect satisfaction, and, at the same 
time, used all the cautions which the nature of his 
charge has required. It is principally owing to his 
prudence and good temper, that the late difficulties 
have been passed over, almost without a murmur. 
Any influence which your Excellency shall think 
proper to use for retaining him in his present situa- 
tion, will promote the public good, and have great 
tendency to keep up a desirable harmony with the 
officers of that corps. 

Our new levies are rendezvousing very generally. 
Colonel Harrison was uneasy at having none of them 
assigned to his corps of artillery, who have very 
much distinguished themselves in the late unfortunate 
action, and are reduced almost to nothing. We hap- 
pened to have about one hundred drafts raised in 
the last year, and never called out and sent on duty 
by their County Lieutenants, whom we have collected 
and are collecting. We think to deliver these to 
Colonel Harrison; they are to serve eighteen months 
from the time of rendezvous. 

The numbers of regulars and militia, ordered from 
this State into the southern service, are about seven 
thousand. I trust we may count, that five thousand 
five hundred will actually proceed; but we have 
arms for three thousand only. If, therefore, we do 
not speedily receive a supply from Congress, we must 
countermand a proper number of these troops. Be- 
sides this supply, there should certainly be a maga- 
zine laid in here, to provide against a general loss 
as well as daily waste. When we deliver out those 
now in our magazine, we shall have sent seven thou- 
sand stand of our own into the southern service, in 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 95 

the course of this summer. We are still more desti- 
tute of clothing, tents, and wagons for our troops. 
The southern army suffers for provision, which we 
could plentifully supply Avere it possible to find 
means of transportation. Despairing of this, we di- 
rected very considerable quantities, collected on the 
navigable waters, to be sent northwardly by the Quar- 
ter-master; this he is noAv doing, slowly however. 

Unapprised of what may be proposed by our allies 
to be done with their fleet in the course of the en- 
suing winter, I would beg leave to intimate to you, 
that if it should appear eligible to them that it 
should winter in Chesapeake Bay, they may be well 
supplied with provision, taking their measures in due 
time beforehand. The waters communicating with 
that Bay furnish easy, and, in that case, safe trans- 
portation, and their money will call forth what is 
denied to ours. I am, with all possible esteem and 
respect, your Excellency's 

Most obedient and humble servant, 

Thomas Jeffersox. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LINCOLN. 

Camp, 25 September, 1780. 

My dear General, 

I take this early opportunity to inform your Ex- 
cellency, that, in the late interview, no exchanges 
took place, and that I see little prospect that any 
will be effected while the idea remains that officers 
only are to be the subject of it. 

In the course of conversation with General Phillips 
(for nothing more took place between us relative to 
a general exchange of prisoners, as I early informed 



96 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

liim that I was not authorized to go into that mat- 
ter), I found that he supposed the reason why we 
declined the exchange of privates, was, that we Avere 
unwilling to throw into their hands, in the middle of 
a campaign, such a reenforcement as they would re- 
ceive by an exchange of all the privates. To obviate 
this difficulty he mentioned, that the exchange of 
privates might be postponed to some future day, say 
the first of December, sooner or later, as should be 
agreed on, but so as not to act this campaign. This, 
I hope, will remove the objections which have exist- 
ed against a general exchange of privates. I think 
policy, justice, and humanity, point to the propriety 
of exchanging them, if not immediately, yet at the 
close of the campaign. Yo.ur Excellency will permit 
me to offer the reasons on which I ground this 
opinion. 

The men now prisoners of war (excuse the person- 
ality of my situation) are those who, from an attach- 
ment to the liberties of America, engaged in her 
cause from a reliance that they should not only find 
every support from their fellow-citizens, in the im- 
portant contest, but that they should enjoy all the 
immunities and blessings peculiar to the soldier, in 
the power of the people to grant. That an exchange, 
when made a prisoner, is one of the rights of a sol- 
dier, none, I think, will deny, and that he may claim 
a release, when just and reasonable terms can be had. 

The long and distressing captivity which many of 
the prisoners have endured ; the severe sufferings to 
which many of them are now reduced, from naked- 
ness and hunger, their constant attendants, and the 
want of almost every convenience and necessary of 
life, the miseries of which are augmented and embit- 
tered by the narrow limits of a loathsome jail, and 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 97 

their having no assurance that their sufferings will 
soon have an end, — call for redress. 

The prisoners, pained with regret, are become sore; 
their minds are soured, and their friends and connec- 
tions think them neglected by the public. This may 
prevent the recruiting our battalions, and cause a 
disrelish for the service. Every thing of the kind, I 
think, should be avoided ; and this was never more 
necessary than at the present day, when it seems to 
be the general voice, that our only safety and the 
freedom of America (under the Supreme Arbiter) de- 
pend on an army raised for the war. If we should 
refuse to exchange the privates, on the proposals 
made, of man for man, it must, I think, operate pow- 
erfully on the minds of those who otherwise might 
engage in the service, when they reflect hoAV uncer- 
tain are the events of war, and that it may be their 
lot to become the prisoners, and be destined to a 
miserable, perhaps to an endless, captivity. And, 
when the enemy shall have published their declara- 
tion of our refusal to accede to an equal and fair ex- 
change, we may find it a matter of much difficulty 
to justify ourselves to the Avorld at large, who will 
naturally enough suspect us of injustice in not fulfil- 
ling our public engagements, as they will accuse us 
of wanting humanity in neglecting those very men 
who have stepped forth to assert our rights. 

The daily decreasing of the number of the Conven- 
tion troops, by deserting to the enemy, for which we 
have no compensation, and the great expense to which 
we are exposed for the support of them, and of our 
officers and men, prisoners of war with the enemy, 
must have their weight in urging to the propriety 
of an exchange. 

To the foregoing reasons (in my humble opinion 

VOL. III. 9 



98 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

sufficient in themselves) permit me, my dear General, 
to annex an apprehension for our unfortunate prison- 
ers now in New York. The enemy, supposing them- 
selves authorized hy our refusal of an exchange, mr.y, 
under the pretence of economizing provisions, provid- 
ing for their own safety, or some other plausible rea- 
son, have our prisoners removed to some distant, and 
consequently disagreeable, situation, where they may 
be subjected to less expense, &c. Should an event 
of this kind take place, retaliation is hardly in our 
power, as all parts of the Continent are equally 
agreeable to the British. 

I hope, Sir, on a review of the matter, as the ob- 
jection of reenforcing the enemy this campaign is 
removed, a general exchange will be adopted, by 
which many of your officers and men, now suffering 
under the most miserable captivity, will be released, 
and once more have the honor of fighting, under your 
Excellency's particular command, in support of that 
independence of America, which induced them to quit 
the sweets of a domestic life for the toils of a camp, 
which no one will reenter with more cheerfulness, 
than he. 

Who has the honor to be, &c., 

Benjamin Lincoln. 



FROM GOA^ERNOR JEFFERSON. 

Richmond, 26 September, 1780. 

Sir, 
The inclosed copy of a letter from Lord Cornwallis 
to Colonel Balfour, was sent me by Governor Rut- 
ledge;'-' lest you should not have seen it, I do my-

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 99 

self the pleasure of transmitting it, with a letter 
from General Harrington to General Gates, giving 
information of some late movements of the enemy. 

I was honored, yesterday, with your favor of the 
5th instant, on the subject of prisoners, and particu- 
larly of Lieutenant-Governor Hamilton. You are not 
unapprised of the influence of this officer with the 
Indians, his activity and embittered zeal against us. 
You also, perhaps, know how precarious is our tenure 
of the Illinois country, and how critical is the situa- 
tion of the new counties on the Ohio. These circum- 
stances determined us to retain Governor Hamilton 
and Major Hay within our power, when we delivered 
up the other prisoners. On a late representation from 
the people of Kentucky, by a person sent here from 
that country, and expressions of what they had rea- 
son to apprehend from these two prisoners, in the 
event of their liberation, we assured them they 
would not be parted with, though we were giving 
up our other prisoners. 

Lieutenant-Colonel Dubuysson, Aid to Baron de 
Kalb, lately came here on his parole, with an offer 
from Lord Rawdon, to exchange him for Hamilton. 
Colonel Towles is now here, with a like proposition 
as to himself, from General Phillips, very strongly 
urged by the General. These, and other overtures, 
do not lessen our opinion of the importance of re- 
taining him ; and they have been, and will uniformly 
be, rejected. Should the settlement, indeed, of a car- 
tel, become impracticable, without the consent of the 
States to submit their separate prisoners to its ob- 
ligation, we will give up these two prisoners, as we 
would any thing, rather than be an obstacle to a 
general good ; but no other circumstances would, I 
believe, extract them from us. These two gentle- 



100 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

men, with a Lieutenant-Colonel Elligood, are the only 
sepai'ate prisoners we have retained, and the last 
only on his own request, and not because we set 
any store by him. There is, indeed, a Lieutenant- 
Governor Rocheblawe, of Kaskaskia, who has broken 
his parole, and gone to New York, whom we must 
shortly trouble your Excellency to demand for us, as 
soon as w^e can forward to you the proper documents. 
Since the forty prisoners sent to Winchester, as men- 
tioned in my letter of the 9tli ultimo, about one hun- 
dred and fifty more have been sent thither, some of 
them taken by us at sea, others sent on by General 
Gates. 

The exposed and weak state of our western settle- 
ments, and the dangers to which they are subject 
from the northern Lidians, acting under the influence 
of the British post at Detroit, render it necessary for 
us to keep from five to eight hundred men on duty, 
for their defence. This is a great and perpetual ex- 
pense. Could that post be reduced, and retained, it 
would cover all the States to the south-east of it. 
We have long meditated the attempt, under the di- 
rection of Colonel Clark ; but the expense would be 
so great, that whenever we have wished to take it 
up, this circumstance has obliged us to decline it 
Two diiferent estimates make it amount to two mil- 
lions of pounds, present money. We could furnish the 
men, provisions, and, I believe, every necessary ex- 
cept powder, had we the money, or could the de- 
mands from us be so far supplied from other quar- 
ters as to leave it in our power to apply such a 
sum to that purpose ; and, when once done, it would 
save annual expenditures to a great amount. When 
I speak of furnishing the men, I mean that they 
should be militia, such being the popularity of Colo- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 101 

nel Clark, and the confidence of the western people 
in him, that he could raise the requisite number at 
any time. 

We therefore beg leave to refer this matter to 
yourself, to determine whether such an enterprise 
would not be for the general good ; and, if you 
think it would, to authorize it at the general ex- 
pense. This is become the more reasonable, if, as I 
am informed, the ratification of the Confederation has 
been rested on our cession of a part of our western 
claims, a cession which (speaking my private opinion 
only) I verily believe will be agreed to, if the quan- 
tity demanded be not unreasonably great. Should 
this proposition be approved, it should be immedi- 
ately made known to us, as the season is now 
coming on at which some of the preparations must 
be made. The time of execution, I think, should be 
at the breaking up of the ice in the Wabash, and 
before the Lakes open. The interval, I am told, is 
considerable. I have the honor to be, &c., 

Thomas Jefferson.

Sir 

This will be delivered to you by John Paulding 
one of the young men that took Major Andre, and 
who nobly refused any sum of money that he should 
demand. The other two young men, that were in 
company with him, are not yet found; as soon as 
they arrive, they shall be sent on. 

I have just seen Kennicutt. He thinks it will be 
impossible for him to go below again. He begs your

instruction and assistance. Almost all his furniture, 
clothes, and money are below. Some of the plunder- 
ers from above have stole his horse, which makes him 
very poor. He has gone doAvn between the lines to 
try to get out some of his things, and to give notice 
to some people that have assisted him in his business. 

I should take it as a particular favor, if you would 
use your influence with Governor Clinton to have 
some Board appointed to inquire into and determine 
the horrid practice of plundering that is carried on 
in this part of the country. I have no doubt but 
that the plunderers, above and below, are connected. 
If some proper Board could be appointed, or the 
Commanding Officer on the lines vested with proper 
authority from Governor Clinton, many petty villains, 
near the lines, may be detected, I make no doubt, 
who hold a correspondence with Delancy's cow-boys. 

I am very sorry that I wrote to General Arnold. 
I did not think of a British ship being up the river, 
and expected that, if he was the man he has since 
turned out to be, he would come down to the troops 
in this quarter, in which case I should have secured 
him. I mentioned my intention to Major Tallmadge, 
and some others of the Field-Officers, all of whom 
were clearly of opinion that it would be right, until 
I could hear from your Excellency. 

The Queen's rangers, I am informed, marched from 
Oyster Bay, last Saturday, for King's Bridge ; the 
17th, on Sunday; and some others are ordered to hold 
themselves in readiness. Two British officers went 
on board the Vulture just above Tarrytown. They 
were out in the country, clothed in mean, ragged, 
country clothes, and, at the river side, changed them 
for fine laced regimentals. Some gentleman came out 
from King's Bridge, about a fortnight ago, with a 



THE AMERICAN EEVOLUTION. 103 

handkerchief full of gold, changed his clothes for an 
old nankeen jackcoat, and pushed up the North Pd- 
ver. 

I am, &c. John Jmieson. 



FROM JOSEPH JONES. 

Virginia, 2 October, 1780. 

Dear Sir, 

The Medical department was under the considera- 
tion of a Committee before I left Congress, and ^Yill, 
it is probable, undergo a change that may curtail the 
number of the present appointments. Should this be 
tlie case, and the new arrangement take place before 
I return (which at present is my intention to do 
before Christmas), I shall recommend to the support 
of tlie Virginia Delegates the gentlemen you have 
been pleased to mention, whose long services and well- 
known characters entitle them to be among the first 
officers in the establishment. 

If I am not mistaken, the spirit of party is much 
abated in Congress. Some instances of the old preju- 
dices and partialities that disgraced and must ever 
disgrace their counsels, I think I have discovered; 
but they are few, and I entertained hopes that the 
flame Avas nearly extinguished. And, although some 
restless tempers, as some there are and ever will be 
in public assemblies of men, may attempt to revive 
those disputes which were carried to such height be- 
tween the contending factions, as to neglect the more 
important concerns of the public, there are, I trust, 
a sufficient number of mild spirits who will oppose 
and repress such dishonorable attempts, and confine 
themselves to the discussion alone of such matters as 
justice and the general welfare require. I am cer- 



104 



LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 



tain the important objects now before Congress are 
sufficient to engage their attention and employ their 
time, without perplexing themselves by a revival of 
old and expiring controversies. 

It was with reluctance I left Philadelphia before 
the report upon your letter respecting the army and 
magazines was complete, and the arrangements of the 
civil offices of Congress were digested; but an appre- 
hension that the Assembly was to meet the first 
Monday in October, as usual, and a desire of spend- 
ing a short time with my family before I Avent to 
Richmond, determined me to set out so as to reach 
home about the middle of September. I now find I 
might have staid a fortnight longer, as the session 
does not commence until the tliird Monday in this 
month. 

Congress having taken some steps towards com- 
pleting the Federal Union, which I anxiously wish to 
accomplish, induced me to be here early in the ses- 
sion, that the sense of this State upon that interest- 
ing question might be taken; that, if the proposition 
was approved, it might be divulged to other States 
without delay ; and Virginia, being more interesi '. 
than any other in a cession of unappropriated terri- 
tory, the example would not fail to have weight, and 
be followed by others. We are already too large for 
the energy of republican government ; and, I fear, 
shall still be so, if the Assembly shall relinquish their 
claim to the north-west of the Ohio to the Continent. 
I wished, too, to be able to be present the beginning 
of the session, to urge the filling up our battalions 
immediately, and providing magazines in time, as the 
ensuing winter to the south and the approaching 
spring to the north, if our ally shall command the 
water, might afford us favorable opportunities of act- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 105 

ing to advantage. But, alas ! instead of the French 
commanding the water, we have the mortification to 
hear Rodney, with twelve ships of the line and four 
frigates, has arrived at the Hook. Where, for God's 
sake, is Count de Guichen, with his great and formi- 
dable fleet ? Surely, not inactive. 

Adieu. Yours, &c., 

Joseph Jones. 



FROM LIEUTENANT-COLONEL LAURENS. 

Philadelphia, 4 October, 1780. 

With the triumph of a republican, and the more 
tender emotions of one who sincerely loves his Gene-

vidential escape.'-' I congratulate my country, whose 
safety is so intimately united with j'^ours, and who 
may regard this miraculous rescue of her champion 
as an assurance that Heaven approves her choice of 
a defender, and is propitious to her cause. In flict, 
all the ascendency that could be given by virtue, 
genius, and valor, would only have furnished a de- 
plorable example of unfortunate merit, if, by the 
Divine interposition, you had not prevailed over the 
most impenetrable perfidy that has yet disgraced 
mankind. This happy event must inspire every vir- 
tuous citizen of America with new confidence, and 
transfix her enemies with awful terror. Andre has, 
I suppose, paid the forfeit which public justice de- 
manded ; example will derive new force from his 
conspicuous character. Arnold must undergo a pun-

I am waiting in anxious expectation of an answer 
from Captain Wallop, a man of great interest and 
credit among the British, who was indulged with a 
limited parole to negotiate my exchange by compo- 
sition. Sir Henry Clinton's late sanguine expectation 
of success may have suspended business of this kind, 
and produced some delay j but I still derive great 
hopes from that quarter. I need not inform your

you, in person, of the veneration and attachment of 
your faithful Aid.

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Camp, 5 October, 1780. 

Sir, 

A new disposition of the army going to be made, 
and an ofiicer appointed to the command of West 
Point and the district on the east side of the North 
River, I take the liberty just to intimate my incli- 
nations for the appointment. Your Excellency will 
judge of the propriety, and determine as the honor 
of the army and the good of the service may re- 
quire. 

I hope there is nothing indelicate or improper in 
the application. I am prompted to the measure from 
the feelings incident to the human heart, as well as 
encouraged in the hope that it would meet your ap- 
probation, from the flattering manner in which you 
have been pleased to speak of my conduct upon dif-

ferent occasions, I shall make use of no arguments, 
being persuaded my pretensions and inclinations Avill 
have their full operation, and that notliing short of 
the public good and military prosperity will contra- 
vene my wishes. 

My first object is the freedom and happiness of 
my country. With these, your Excellency's reputa- 
tion and glory are inseparably connected ; and as it 
has been my constant wish, so it shall be my future 
endeavour, to promote the establishment of both. 

I am, &c. 

Nathanael Geeene. 



FROM GOVERNOR NASH, OF NORTH CAROLINA. 

Newbern, 6 October, 1780. 

Sir, 

Confiding that your Excellency was constantly made 
acquainted with whatever related to the military af- 
fairs of this and the neighbouring State of South 
Carolina, I thought it unnecessary to increase your 
trouble by opening a direct correspondence with you 
myself, as Governor of this State. But, Sir, the dis- 
tresses of this country, and the dangers wo are now 
exposed to, in consequence of the defeat of our army 
under General Gates, in August last, oblige me, in 
point of duty, to address myself to your Excellency, 
who, I know, has an equal concern for the safety of 
every part of the United .States. 

I am to acquaint you, Sir, that, for want of an 
early knowledge of the requisition of Congress for 
specific supplies, added to the bad crops of grain 
made in this State, for two years past, the army un- 
der Baron de Kalb, and our militia in the beginning 
of the present campaign, suffered the greatest hard- 



108 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

ships, and were subsisted with the greatest diflficulty. 
This difficulty, however, at length was overcome by 
our army's having made their march good to Pedee 
River, about the beginning of August. Here, Sir, 
they fortunately recovered from the enemy one of the 
most fertile and plentiful settlements in the Southern 
States, and obliged them, in turn, to take post in the 
barren, wretched country of Camden, where they were 
very soon reduced to strait allowance. South Caro- 
lina, in the mean time, encouraged by this successful 
advance of our army, was revolting from its late 
masters, in all quarters and in great numbers. The 
militia of the two States had had nine several skir- 
mishes with the enemy, and had been successful in 
every one. In short, the enemy's destruction was in- 
evitable, had not the General determined, unfortunate- 
ly for us, to risk the fate of the campaign, and with 
it the two Carolinas, on the event of a single battle. 
I think I am justified in saying, he put all to risk, 
as I have mentioned, because no previous effectual 
measures were taken to save the baggage ; nor do I 
learn that any place was assigned for the army to re- 
treat to, in case of misfortune, which, in my opinion, 
might have been reasonably expected. Our men, by 
hard marches and bad living, were sickly and weak; 
and much the greater part of the army were militia, 
who had never been in action. On the other hand, 
the enemy, whose numbers, by the by, were unknown, 
were fresh, and had the sure advantage of engaging 
us when and where they pleased ; of course they 
chose their ground and time to good effect. The ac- 
tion no sooner commenced than, as might have been 
dreaded, the centre and left Aving of the line, com- 
posed of militia, and a great part of these, riflemen, 
got into confusion, and fled away. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 109 

At this point of time, had the regulars been order- 
ed to retreat to Rugely's Mills, five miles in their 
rear, possibly all might have been saved. One hun- 
dred men there, I am told, would have defended the 
pass against the whole British force. But it was not 
done, and the enemy, having nothing to oppose them 
on our left, of course turned it ; and the General 
might well suppose, as it seems he did, that they 
were all cut off. However, by the superior bravery 
of those excellent troops, they at length extricated 
themselves from their difficulties, and, after making 
great havoc among the enemy, came off in tolerably 
good order, and with less loss than could have been 
expected. 

But, Sir, the loss of these brave men was not our 
greatest loss. We had expended upwards of twenty- 
five millions of dollars on this army. We had drain- 
ed every source, and exhausted every fund, in pur- 
chasing tents, wagons, horses, arms, ammunition, pro- 
visions, spirits, sugar, coffee, camp equipage of every 
kind, in short, every thing appertaining to an army; 
and in a single half hour, all is completely lost, and 
the army, in a manner, annihilated. For the militia 
fled chiefly to their respective homes, spreading ter- 
ror wherever they went; and the regulars, of course, 
continued retreating on after their General, until they 
at length eventually collected at Hillsborough, two 
hundred and forty miles from the place of action, 
where the General arrived the third day after the 
action, leaving all the country behind open to the 
incursion and ravages of the enemy. At this place. 
Sir, the regular troops now remain, inactive and use- 
less for want of tents, clothes, and other necessaries, 
whilst the enemy are making the most alarming ad- 
vances into the richest and strongest part of this 

VOL. III. 10

LETTERS TO WASHINGTON, 



State. My last letter from General DaYidson, who, 
for the present, commands the militia to the west- 
ward, dated the 26th ultimo, says, this day, at eleven 
o'clock, the enemy marched in force into Charlotte, 
his army retreating, and meaning to take post on the 
north side of the Yadkin. And Sir, I am to remark 
to you, that from the Yadkin, to within about twen- 
ty miles of Hillsborough, the inhabitants are chiefly 
disaffected to our government; so that^ if our militia 
shall not be able to hold their post on the Yadkin, 
a river fordable anywhere, their further retreat will 
not only be difficult and precarious, but the enemy's 
army wiU inevitably swell and grow more formidable ; 
and, in such a case, what have we to expect, but 
that General Gates will retreat with the shattered re- 
mains of his regular army over the Roanoke, which 
he is now within about thirty miles of ? 

This, Sir, is a true picture of our present deranged 
and feeble condition, the effects of the unfortunate 
affair of the 16th of August. I have acquainted 
Congress with our defenceless state, and of the fatal 
consequences, to the United States, of losing North 
Carolina. I have told them, in plain terms, that our 
funds are exhausted ; that our militia are without 
tents, badly armed, and dispirited, for want of regular 
troops to form a proper basis of defence ; that the 
unsettled state we are in will render precarious any 
dependence on us for a sufficient supply of provi- 
sions ; and have urged them, in the strongest terms 
I am capable of, to afford some timely aid. And, 
Sir, I also beg leave earnestly to call your Excellen- 
cy's attention towards the effectual defence of this 
part of the United States. I know, Sir, both you 
and Congress know the importance of these Southern 
States, and I acknowledge you had made what seem- 



THE AMEKICAN REVOLUTION. HI 

ed a very sufficient provision, not only for our de- 
fence, but for the recovery of, at least, the upper 
parts of South Carolina. But, Sir, unfortunately for 
us, we have lost all advantage from the former aid, 
and the force of our militia is also weakened and re- 
duced by the entire loss of our field equipage, and 
our incapacity to repair the loss. To give your Ex- 
cellency some idea of the cruelties practised by the 
enemy over those who fall into their power, I inclose 
to you a copy of Lord Cornwallis's orders to an offi- 
cer commanding at a separate post. If you desire 
of me. Sir, a continuation of intelligence from this 
part of America, I shall be happy, during my con- 
tinuance in office, in obeying your orders; 

And am, &c., 

Abner Nash. 



FROM GOVERNOR LIVINGSTON. 

Trenton, 7 October, 1780. 

Dear Sm, 

I most heartily congratulate your Excellency on 
the timely discovery of General Arnold's treasonable 
plot to captivate 3'our person, and deliver up West 
Point to the enemy; of which the loss of the former, 
had his infernal machinations succeeded, would have 
been more regretted by America than of the latter. 
The remarkable interposition of Providence to frus- 
trate the diabolical conspiracy, will inspire every vir- 
tuous American with sincere gratitude to the Great 
Arbiter of all events; and I hope not a true Whig 
among us will ever forget the memorable era, when 
we were, by the peculiar guardianship of Heaven, 
rescued from the very brink of destruction. 

I have the honor to be, &c., 

William Livingston. 



112 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL ST. CLAIR. 

West Point, 7 October, 1780. 

Sir, 

I received your Excellency's letter of yesterday, 
and am very glad that you have ordered up the 
troops which are to compose the garrison, as it is 
very necessary they should be here, that things may 
be got into some kind of order before the winter. 
At present, they are very much deranged. The lay- 
ing in a proper stock of fire-wood is a very heavy, 
but a very essential business, and the militia, which 
have been employed in cutting it, I am told, have 
done little more than supply the post at Fishkill, 
and are very little ahead. I expect a report of the 
quantity to-day from Colonel Hughes, to whom I 
have recommended to allot them a moderate task per 
day, as the best means to make them most useful. 

The magazine of provisions is very nearly exhaust- 
ed; thirty barrels only of salted meat on hand, ex- 
clusive of what is in the works (about five days' for 
the troops posted in them), and no cattle, and the 
men have been some days reduced to three quarters 
of a pound of flour. I expect, however, two hundred 
barrels of that article to-day, and have written to 
Colonel Hay (to be laid before the Legislature of 
this State), very pressingiy, to have an immediate 
and ample supply of provisions thrown in, as it may 
not be possible to do it some time hence, from the 
state the river is frequently in, about the beginning 
of winter. 

I directed Colonel Livingston to collect and send 
up here all the boats that were not necessary below, 
provided they had not been ordered there by your 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 113 

Excellency for some particular purpose.* His answer 
is, that they were ordered there for transporting the 
cannon, in case it became necessary to evacuate the 
posts he commands. They will therefore remain there 
unless I have your directions to the contrary j hut I 
must beg leave to suggest to your Excellency that, 
after the intention of the enemy becomes apparent 
with respect to them, it will most probably be too 
late to evacuate them with any probability of saving 
the cannon and stores. If they be evacuated before 
their intention is discovered, it will be in their power 
to occupy them, after they may have failed in an 
attempt upon this place. I find some heavy brass 
field-artillery here, which is not, I suppose, intended 
for garrison use, and had better be removed. Some 
repairs have been making upon the carriages, but 
that might as well be done anywhere else. The 
Pennsvlvania brisjade shall march as soon as the 
other troops arrive. 

The times of the militia begin to expire on the 
14th, and wiU all be expired on the 24th. I have 
not heard from Major Tallmadge, nor have any ac- 
counts from New York by any other way. 

I am, &c., 

Arthur St. Clair. 



FROM JAMES DUANE, IN CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 10 October, 1780. 

Dear General, 
Yesterday I had the honor of your Excellency's 
very friendly letter of the 4th instant, for which be 
pleased to accept my warmest thanks.

I'oint.

114 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

Before this reaches j^our hands, you will have re- 
ceived the new arrangement of the army. Submitted, 
as it is, to your opinion, it is only to be considered 
as an essay, open to such alterations as you may 
suggest. The idea of a majority of Congress was 
clear, that it would be too hazardous to risk the de- 
fence of America on the practicability of drawing an 
army for the war into the field by the first of Janu- 
ary. The alternative, therefore, as you will find it 
guarded, was thought necessary, though all admitted 
a permanent force to be most desirable. I saw and 
explained the danger of an alternative, however cau- 
tiously expressed. The States may think they do 
enough if they comply with either of the injunctions; 
and while men who make arms a profession have a 
prospect of being annually retained for high pre- 
miums, they will hardly tie themselves at once for 
the war. 

In the original proposition there was another alter- 
native, — for the war, or for three f/ears ; besides that 
which gives your Excellency so much and such just 
apprehension. This last was rejected by a majority, 
perhaps unfortunately, as, in tlie opinion of many, it 
strengthened the reasons for the annual supply by 
drafts. I do not think it too late to correct this er- 
ror, if pointed out with the force that every thing 
falls from your pen. The manner of reduction is, 
I am confident, liable to great objection, and I have 
no doubt but you will suggest a rule, or principle, 
or any thing you may think better, which will avoid 
the difficulty you suggest, and meet with approba- 
tion ; for I do not conceive that a single member 
will be tenacious of the provision on this article. In- 
deed, I am persuaded that your Excellency's repre- 
sentations, on this and every subject, will have as 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 115 

much influence as you can wish; and that, on this 
particular occasion, nothing hut a clear conviction of 
impracticahility will induce Congress to overrule your 
opinion. 

A false estimate of the power and perseverance of 
our enemies was friendly to the present revolution, 
and inspired that confidence of success, in all ranks 
of people, which was necessary to unite them in so 
arduous a cause. You cannot forget the opinions 
which were current on this floor, at the first and 
second Congresses, and how firmly they established 
this error. We seem to part with it with reluctance; 
it still hangs heavy upon us, and has produced the 
indecision, the expedients, and the dehility of which 
you complain. I hope misfortunes and distresses will, 
at length, rouse us to just sentiments and vigorous 
exertions, and, with your Excellency, I pray God, 
that the fatal delusion which has marked our con- 
duct, may end here. 

When the enemy turn their eyes to the southward, 
they see too much imbecility not to be encouraged 
to attempt to extend their conquest, and improve 
advantages which they have derived, in no small 
degree, from our own temerity and misconduct. I 
believe we shall not want men to oppose them, Vir- 
ginia having made efforts, the expensiveness of which 
is incredible, and North Carohna being equally dis- 
posed to act vigorously, though not so capable to 
raise their quota, for a fixed and certain period. I 
wish we may have it in our power to provide the 
necessary supplies. Your Excellency too Avell knows 
and feels our difficulties and embarrassments, and that 
they are only to be surmounted by great exertions. 
I flatter myself that you do me no more than justice 
in believing that duty and inclination equally demand 



116 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

my assiduous endeavours to correct our past errors, 
and draw forth our resources. 

I am much obliged to your Excellency for your 
account of the interview at Hartford; and beg you 
to believe, that no man can be with greater affection 
and personal attachment than I am, &c., 

James Duane. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

West Point, 16 October, 1780. 

Sir, 

Your Excellency's letter of the 14th, appointing 
me to the command of the Southern army, was de- 
livered me last evening. 

I beg your Excellency to be persuaded that I am 
fully sensible of the honor you do me, and will en- 
deavour to manifest my gratitude by a conduct that 
will not disgrace the appointment. I only lament 
that my abilities are not more competent to the 
duties that will be required of me, and that it will 
not be in my power, on that account, to be as ex- 
tensively useful as my inclination leads me to wish. 
But, as far as zeal and attention can supply the de- 
fect, I flatter myself my country will have little 
cause to complain. I foresee the command will be 
accompanied with innumerable embarrassments. But 
the generous support which I expect from the par- 
tiality of the southern gentlemen, as well as the aid 
and assistance I hope to derive from your Excel- 
lency's advice and extensive influence, affords me 
some consolation in contemplating the difficulties. 

I will prepare myself for the command as soon as 
I can. But, as I have been five years and upwards 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 117 

in service, during all which time I have paid no at- 
tention to the settlement of my domestic concerns 
(and many divisions of interest, and partition of land- 
ed property, between me and my brothers, have taken 
place in the time, and now lie unfinished), if it was 
possible, I should be glad to spend a few days at 
home, before I set out to the southward, especially 
as it is altogether uncertain how long my command 
may continue, or what deaths or accidents may hap- 
pen, during my absence, to defeat the business. I 
beg your Excellency's opinion upon the matter, by 
which I will regulate my conduct. However, it will 
not be possible for me to leave this place for several 
days, if I put my baggage in the least order, or my 
business in a proper train for such a long journey. 
Nor is my health in a condition to set out imme- 
diately, having had a considerable fever upon me for 
several days. 

General Heath arrived last evening, and will take 
the command this morning. I shall make him fully 
acquainted with all the dispositions I have made, and 
steps taken, which concern the post and its depend- 
encies j and will give him my opinion what further 
is necessary to be done, to carry into execution your 
Excellency's instructions for putting the garrison in 
a proper state of defence, and prepare it for the ap- 
proaching winter. 

General McDougall is also here, and I have the 
pleasure to inform you that he and I perfectly agree 
in sentiment in what concerns the garrison and its 
dependencies. I am, &c. 

Nath-INael Greene.

LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 



FROM JOHN MATHEWS, IN CONGRESS. 

Philadelpliia, 17 October, 1780. 

My dear Sir, 

At the time I wrote to you respecting that part 
of the system for the army that had been agreed on 
by Congress, I had despaired of its being submitted 
to your opinion. I had moved for it, but my propo- 
sition was rejected, on a principle that the whole 
should go together. We have received your Excel- 
lency's sentiments on this very important subject, 
such as I evidently foresaw would be the result of 
your serious consideration. Your observations are in- 
controvertible ; and, unless Congress are so bigoted to 
the idol they have set up, and are determined to re- 
ject every principle that can have the least tendency 
to invalidate the foundation on wliicli it is erected, 
they must ultimately adopt the plan you propose. 
No other, I am convinced, can ever answer our pur- 
poses. 

But even in this case, a most tremendous inconve- 
nience arises ; for here is the month of October better 
than half spent, and probably before Congress come to 
a final determination, November will be arrived, and 
then there remains only two months for prosecuting 
this great work. The time is certainly too short for 
its completion. I consequently dread the arrival of 
the first day of January. Had Congress put this 
business in the train that was proposed early in Sep- 
tember, so much precious time would have been 
saved as, in all probability, would have given success 
to the plan. However, w^e must now use our best 
endeavours to put things on as good a footing as the 
nature of the case will admit of Your Excellency's 
letter of the lltli instant is committed to the same 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 119 

Committee who brought in the former report, together 
with that report; but nothing is as yet clone in it. 

My plan, respecting the annual recruits, was only 
meant to render the system as useful as possible ; 
for, if an alternative must be admitted into it, we 
should endeavour to derive every possible advantage 
from it. I therefore thought it best to have the 
power to detain the men, and take our chance for 
its success, rather than that they should, at all events, 
be at liberty to disband themselves at a certain day. 

Your Excellency's appointment of General Greene 
to the command of the Southern army has given 
general satisfaction. To the five Southern States I 
know it has given the highest satisfaction. 
I have the honor to be, &c., 

John Mathews. 



FROxAI COLONEL BRODHEAD. 

Fort Pitt, 17 October, 1780. 

Dear General, 

Your favor of the 14th of August I had the honor 
to receive on the 7th instant, and am very thankful 
for the contents. You must, ere now, be convinced 
that Colonel Bowman's apprehensions were founded on 
certain intelligence, of an expedition intended against 
the forts on Kentucky. I have sent out parties to 
take cattle and grain from the inhabitants, and expect 
to obtain a considerable supply of flour, as the mills 
begin to have water sufficient to manufacture it; but 
the inhabitants disappoint us of getting beef, by driv- 
ing their cattle into the mountains. And we have, at 
present, neither bread nor meat, but expect a small 
supply immediately. Captain Brady is on command. 



120 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

and Captain Mclntyre lias leave of absence to Phila- 
delphia ; as soon as they return, I will express your 
Excellency's thanks for their conduct. 

In full confidence that a sufficient supply of provi- 
sion would, sooner or later, be furnished for the 
troops in this district, as Avell as for such number of 
militia as policy or the exigencies of aftairs might 
render it necessary to call into action, T, with a view 
to cut off the Wyandots and other Indian towns that 
were very troublesome to our settlements, called fur 
a draft from the militia, at three different times, and 
was as often disappointed in obtaining provisions ; 
which, with the unsettled state of the boundary line 
between Pennsylvania and Virginia, has greatly dis- 
couraged the inhabitants, and, I apprehend, given a 
handle to the disaffected. I take the libert}^ to inclose 
copies of letters, lately received from Colonels Butler 
and McCleary, purporting some of the above facts. 

The Delaware Chiefs, w^ith upwards of thirty war- 
riors, are come to aid me upon an expedition ; but, 
as I have neither bread nor meat to give them, they 
will soon discover that it is not in my power to act 
offensively. They appear much dejected on account 
of the total want of goods, which they were promised 
in exchange for their peltry. 

Unless supplies of beef, &c. are procuring below 
the mountains, which I know nothing of, the troops 
here will experience great hardship before spring, 
and desertions will be very frequent. I have fre- 
quently represented to the Honorable Board of War 
the hardships of the troops, and am now informed by 
their Secretary that compulsion is tolerated by the 
Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania for a 
temporary supply. I continue my inquiries respecting 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 121 

the strength of Detroit, and my intelligence is of a 
piece with that formerly communicated. 

I have the honor to be. &c., &c., 

Daniel Brodhead. 



FROM GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Albany, 10 o'clock, P. M., 18 October, 1780. 

Sir, 

I wrote your Excellency from Poughkeepsie on 
Saturday last, and communicated to you the accounts 
which I had then received from this quarter. The 
next day I set out for this place, and arrived here 
on Monday. Upon my arrival, I found the main 
body of the enemy, which appeared in the northward, 
had returned by the way of Lake George ; and that 
part of the country seemed again to be in a state of 
tranquillity. Yesterday morning, however, I was in- 
formed that a party had made its appearance at Ball- 
ston, and destroyed some buildings there ; and, about 
noon, received accounts that the enemy were at Scho- 
harie, and it is now confirmed that they have de- 
stroyed the whole of that valuable settlement. Their 
numbers of one division are computed at about six 
hundred, and the accounts of the other division are 
uncertain. They have artillery with them. Major 
Woolsey, w'ho commands two hundred of the levies, 
made a sally from one of the small forts there, and 
took two regulars and killed five savages. By what 
route they came, or mean to return, I have not been 
able to ascertain. Yesterday morning I ordered Ge- 
neral Van Rensselaer, with some troops, to Schenec- 
tady, with directions, as soon as he could make the 

VOL. III. 11

LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 



proper discoveries, and if his force should appear com- 
petent, to march and endeavour to intercept them. 

By a letter from General Schuyler at Saratoga, I 
am informed that the enemy j^esterday burnt the 
settlement of AVhite Creek, in Charlotte county; and 
the smoke was discoverable from the heights, near 
his house. 

The post at Fort Edward, after the removal of tlie 
stores, is evacuated, the levies, who were stationed 
there, having insisted that their time of service is 
expired ; and Colonel Livingston, the commanding offi- 
cer, with the other officers, are now on their return. 
I have ordered out the whole of the militia from this 
part of the State. A considerable part are already 
in the field, and I shall leave this immediately for 
Schenectady, in order to make the necessary arrange- 
ment. 

From this state of matters, your Excellency will 
perceive the necessity of sending a force, if it can 
possibly be spared, for the defence of this part of the 
country. No dependence can be placed on the mili- 
tia remaining from home, and the three months' levies 
will soon be dismissed ; so that, without some farther 
protection, Schenectady and this place will be our 
frontier. I received no intelligence from the Grants, 
either whether the enemy have done any mischief 
there, or vvdiether their militia is turning for our as- 
sistance. 



am, &c., 



George Clinton. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 123 

FROM JIAJOR-GENERAL GREES'E. 

West Point, 19 October, 1780. 

Sir, 

Your Excellency's favor of the ISth came to hand 
this afternoon. I had given over the thoughts of go- 
ing home, even if I obtained your permission, before 
I received your pleasure upon the subject. My af- 
fairs require it ; but I am fully convinced that the 
time it Avill take, and the state of the Southern de- 
partment, will not admit of the indulgence. When I 
marched from Toppan, I wrote to Mrs. Greene to 
come to camp, and expect her here every hour. 
Should I set out before her arrival, the disappoint- 
ment of not seeing me, added to the shock of my 
going to the southward, I am very apprehensive will 
have some disagreeable effect upon her health, espe- 
cially as her apprehensions have been all alive re- 
specting my going to the southward, before there was 
the least probability of it. 

My baggage sets out in the morning, if Colonel 
Hughes does not disappoint me about the horses; 
and my stay shall not be more than a day longer, 
whether INIrs. Greene arrives or not. Your Excellen- 
cy cannot be more anxious to have me come on, than 
I am to comply with your orders, especially since 
the two last articles of intelligence, the sailing of the 
troops at New York, and the advance of Lord Corn- 
wallis into the State of North Carolina. 

I am, &c., 

Nathanael Greene. 



124 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM GOVERNOR JEFFERSON. 

Richmond, 22 October, 1780. 

Sir, 

I have tills morning received certain information 
of the arrival of a hostile fleet, of about sixty sail, in 
our Bay. The debarkation of some light-horse, in the 
neighbourhood of Portsmouth, seems to indicate that 
as the first scene of their action. We are endea- 
vouring to collect as large a body to oppose them as 
we can arm. Tliis will be lamentably inadequate, if 
the enemy be in any force. It is mortifying to sup- 
pose it possible that a people, able and zealous to 
contend with the enemy, should be reduced to fold 
their arms for want of the means of defence ; yet no 
resources, that we know of, ensure us against this 
event. 

It has become necessary to divert, to this new ob- 
ject, a considerable part of the aids we had destined 
for General Gates. We are still, however, sensible 
of the necessity of supporting him, and have left that 
part of our country, most convenient to him, uncalled 
on at present, that they may reenforce him as soon 
as arms can be received. We have called to the 
command of our forces Generals Weedon and Muhlen- 
berg, of the line, and Nelson and Stephens of the 
militia. You will be pleased to make to these such 
additions as you think necessary. As to aids of 
men, I ask for none, knowing that if the late detach- 
ments of the enemy should have left it safe for you 
to spare aids of that kind, you will not await my 
application. Of the troops Ave shall be able to col- 
lect, there is not a single man who ever saw the 
face of an enemy. Whether the Convention troops

will be removed is not jet determined ; this must 
depend on the force of the enemy and the aspect of 
their movements. I have the honor to be, 
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 

THOM2VS Jefferson. 



FROM GOVERNOR LIVINGSTON. 

Trenton, 23 October, 1780. 

Dear Sir, 

I am just honored with your Excellency's favor of 
the 18th instant, which shall be laid before the Le- 
gislature without loss of time. I hope your Excel- 
lency's reasonings upon the subject of our embarrass- 
ments may have the weight they justly deserve, and 
happily prevent our longer continuing under those 
delusions which have hitherto made the independence 
of America a contested point. I have often been 
chagrined at the propagation of the mischievous doc- 
trine, that the enemy had given over all idea of 
conquest. I am confident they never had more san- 
guine expectations of it than at present ; and, per- 
haps, never entertained the idea upon better grounds. 

I do not, by this observation, mean to insinuate 
that I am in the least apprehensive of the probabi- 
lity, and scarcely of the possibility, of such an event, 
in case the States make such exertions as the situa- 
tion of our affiiirs requires ; but on the supposition 
that we continue to prosecute the war agreeably to 
the system hitherto pursued. For, as such conduct 
on our part will undoubtedly induce them to protract 
the dispute, and as the war, by that means, will soon 
become the measuring of the length of our respective 
purses, instead of that of our swords, I am convinced, 
11* 



126 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

from the state of our commerce, and the number of 
our intestine enemies, that the final establishment of 
our liberty principally depends upon such exertions, 
as will compel them to a speedy peace. 
I have the honor to be, &c., 

William Livingston. 



FROM BARON STEUBEN. 

Philadelphia, 23 October, 1780. 

To His Excellency General Washington. 

It is with the greatest satisfaction I acquaint you 
that the plan of arrangement for the army, which 
your Excellency sent to Congress, has been agreed 
upon yesterday, without any alteration. The grant- 
ing the half-pay for life, to the reduced officers, has 
met with some opposition; but the proposition has 
not only passed, but it was moved and resolved, im- 
mediately after, to extend these advantages to all the 
officers in the service. 

In the minutes which Colonel Hamilton has de- 
livered me, by your Excellency's order, I find that 
the four regiments of cavalry, or rather legions, were 
thus fixed ; — 

Four troops of mounted dragoons, sixty men 
each, 240 

Four companies dismounted, or chasseurs, six- 
ty men each, 240 



Total, 480 

General Sullivan and Colonel Bland have told me 
that this is altered in your Excellency's letter; and 
that there are to be 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 127 

Four troops of mounted dragoons, sixty men 

each, ....... 240 

Two companies of chasseurs, sixty men each, 120 



Total, 360 

Your Excellency "will allow me to make here a 
short observation on the subdivision of this cavalry, 
without altering the totality of the foot or horsemen. 
Cavalry, especially when two deep, is not very ter- 
rible in their attacks in front, and least so when 
against infantry. The attacks of the cavalry, when 
they intend to overthrow or break a line, are gene- 
rally made by troops or squadrons, or in column, or 
in echiqidcr (checkerwise). The deeper they are, the 
surer they are to break through. If, then, instead of 
four, a regiment was divided into six troops, the ob- 
ject would be better answered. 

There is another reason, which has determined the 
King of Prussia to divide his light-horse, or hussars, 
into six companies, forming three squadrons. The 
cavalry, after an attack, is generally in disorder ; they 
must then be rallied by the sound of the trumpet. 
When they are divided into three squadrons, the 
right, left, and centre only indicate how the men are 
to rally, which is not so easy when they are divided 
into four troops. When three squadrons are in order 
of battle, the signals, whether the right, left, or cen- 
tre squadron is to charge, still meet with difficulty 
when the cavalry is divided into four squadrons or 
troops ; and this is the reason why, in several Euro- 
pean services, an odd number has been adopted for 
the manoeuvres of the light-horse. 

Besides, our regiments of cavalry will have, I be- 
lieve, as those of infantry, three Field-Officers. Each 
of them will then command a squadron, which will 



128 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

consist of two companies. Wherefore I propose that 
each regiment of cavahy may be divided into three 
squadrons, each squadron into two companies, each of 
which shall consist of forty men, which will make 
eighty men for a squadron. The companies of chas- 
seurs ouo-ht to be likewise three in number, each 
company to consist of fifty men, rank and file, at- 
tached, on all occasions, to the first, second, and third 
squadron of the regiment. And, as it often happens 
that the squadrons are separated from one another, 
each company of chasseurs ought to be always 
attached to its squadron, as well to support it in its 
manoeuvres as to guard it in its quarters. As, by this 
subdivision, the totality will not suffer a great altera- 
tion, I believe it will not alter the general plan. I 
will, therefore, mention it to no one besides your Ex- 
cellency; and I think it is in joiiv power to order 
this subdivision, if you think proper. 

I am not very happy in the arrangement of my 
department. The plan relative thereto, which your 
Excellency has delivered to the Committee which was 
at camp, after having been a little altered by that 
Committee, was sent to Congress. Congress referred 
it to the Board of War, who, after having altered it, 
sent it back to Congress, who thought proper to refer 
it to a Committee of three, who made new alterations. 
Now it has been so much altered, that it does not at 
all resemble itself No intimation was ofl&cially given 
me of it, and I read it in a printed copy, which fell 
accidentally into my hands. I have the honor to 
transmit one to your Excellency. 

The monthly addition of from five to eight dollars 
to the pay of officers of such merit as those whom 
your Excellency has chosen for the Inspectorship, ap- 
pears to me so very mean, that I will not take upon 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 129 

myself to make them such a proposition. When the 
ancient Majors of brigade, who, in the first institution, 
were taken from the line of Lieutenants or Ensigns, 
had an addition to their pay of twenty-four dollars per 
month, how can nine dollars now be proposed to a 
Colonel for discharging so important and so painful a 
function? I am now endeavouring to find how much 
the Muster-master's department has cost the States. 
I am sure that the addition I ask for the Oflicers of 
Inspectorship will not amount to an eighth part of it. 
Several resolutions, in this arrangement, are contra- 
dictory to one another, and others are not sufficiently 
clear. I am therefore determined to present a Memo- 
rial to Congress, in order to have the Inspectors' de- 
partment established on the footing proposed by your 
Excellency, without any alteration. If Congress de- 
sire that I should continue in this office, I flatter 
myself they will have a regard to my representation. 

I am, &c.. 

Baron Steuben. 

from governor jefferson. 

Riclimond, 26 October, 1780. 

Sir, 

The Executive of this State think it expedient and 
necessary, that, under our present circumstances, the 
prisoners of war, under the Convention of Saratoga, be 
removed from their present situation. 

Many circumstances have led to this necessity. It 
will be utterly impracticable, as long as they remain 
with us, to prevent the hostile army, now in this 
State, from being reenforced by numerous desertions 
from this corps; and this expectation may be one 
among the probable causes of this movement of the 
enemy. Should, moreover, a rescue of them be at- 



130 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

tempted, the extensive disaffection which has been 
lately discovered, and almost total want of arms in the 
hands of our good people, render the success of such 
an enterprise by no means desperate. The fear of 
this, and of the dangerous convulsions to which such 
an attempt would expose us, diverts the attention of a 
very considerable part of our militia from an opposition 
to the invading enemy. An order has, therefore, been 
this day issued to Colonel Wood to take immediate 
measures for their removal, and every aid has been, 
and will be given him, for transporting, guarding, and 
subsisting them on the road, which our powers can 
accomplish. Notice hereof is sent, by the present con- 
veyance, to his Excellency Governor Lee, on whose 
part I doubt not necessary preparations for their re- 
ception will be made. I have the honor to be, with 
the greatest esteem and respect, your Excellency's 
Most obedient and most humble servant, 

Thomas Jefferson. 



FROM GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Poughkeepsie, 30 October, 1780. 

Dear Sir, 

My last letter was dated at Albany, and communi- 
cated the disagreeable intelligence of the destruction 
of Schoharie, and part of Ballstown, about tw^elve 
miles north-east of Schenectady ; since which I have 
not been able to write to your Excellency. 

As I then proposed, I immediately left Albany, in 
order to take the necessary measures for checking 
the further incursions of the enemy. On my arrival 
at Schenectady, I was advised that the different par- 
ties of the enemy at Schoharie and Ballstown, had 
left those places ; the former moving towards the 



THE AMERICAN KEVOLUTION. 131 

Mohawk River, and the latter shaping their course 
towards Sacondaga. General Van. Rensselaer, who had 
arrived at Schenectady before me, and with orders to 
act according to emergencies, on receiving this intel- 
ligence immediately moved up the river, in hopes of 
being able to gain their front ; but this proved im- 
practicable, as their route was much shorter, and their 
troops more inured to marching. They reached the 
river at the confluence of the Schoharie Kill, about 
six miles ahead of him, and, in that fertile country, 
recommenced their devastations by burning the houses, 
and with marks of the greatest barbarity, destroying 
every thing in their way. 

Under these circumstances I was exceedingly per- 
plexed. The militia, under General Van Rensselaer, 
were inferior in number to that of the enemy; the 
few I had with me were too far in the rear to sus- 
tain them ; and not much could be expected from the 
militia of the country through which the enemy pass- 
ed, their whole attention being engaged in the pre- 
servation of their families ; and the levies were ne- 
cessarily very much dispersed at the different posts, 
to cover the frontier settlements against the incur- 
sions of small parties. General Van Rensselaer, how- 
ever, continued to move on, and, being soon after 
joined by Colonel Dubois, with between three hun- 
dred and four hundred levies, and sixty of the Onei- 
da Indians, pursued the enemy with vigor. He came 
up with them at Fox's Mills, about twenty-six miles 
from where the enemy first struck the river, about 
sunset, and attacked them. After a considerable re- 
sistance they gave wa}^, and fled with precipitation, 
leaving behind them their baggage, provisions, and a 
brass three-pounder, with its ammunition. 

The night came on too soon for us to avail our- 



132 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

selves of all tlie advantages wliich we had reason to 
promise ourselves from this action. The enemy took 
advantage of passing the river at a ford, a little 
above the place of action, Avhere they again collect- 
ed, and renewed their march up the river with great 
celerity ; and it became necessary for our troops, who 
had marched upwards of thirty miles without halting, 
to retire from the ground to refresh themselves. The 
pursuit was, however, renewed early in the morning, 
and the enemy so closely pushed, as to prevent their 
doing any further mischief The morning after the 
action, I arrived with the militia under my immedi- 
ate command, but they were so beat out with fatigue, 
having marched at least fifty miles in less than twen- 
ty-four hours, as to be unable to proceed any further. 
I therefore left them, and put myself at the head of 
the advanced troops, and continued the pursuit to 
within about fifteen miles of Oneida -, and, if we could 
possibly have procured provisions to have continued 
the pursuit a day or two longer, there is little doubt 
that we might have succeeded so far as to have scat- 
tered their main body, and made many prisoners. 
But there were no supplies but such as I was obliged 
to take from the inhabitants on our route, and these 
were inadequate, and the collection of them attended 
with delay ; nor were the pack-horses, M'ith the small 
quantities procured in this disagreeable manner, able 
to overtake us, in so rapid a march through a perfect 
wilderness. I was therefore obliged, though reluctant- 
ly, to return, most of the troops having been near 
two days utterly destitute, and unable to proceed. 

Sir John, Brant, and Butler, immediately after the 
action at Fox's Mills, left their troops, and with a 
party of Indians, on horseback, struck across the 
country, and went towards Oneida, taking their

wounded witli tliem. We discovered wliere they join- 
ed their main body again, near the waters of the 
Susquehanna, about six miles on this side, where we 
quitted the pursuit. Brant was wounded through 
the foot. The enemy's force under Sir John, from 
the best account I have been able to collect, amount- 
ed to seven hundred and fifty picked troops, from the 
tenth and thirty-fourth British regiments, Hessian 
Yagers, Sir John's corps, Butler's rangers, and Brant's 
corps of Indians and Tories, and the party that ap- 
peared at Ballstown, of about two hundred, chiefly 
British; and, by some accounts, it appears they in- 
tended to form a junction at Johnstown. 

In the different skirmishes, a considerable number 
of the enemy were killed ; the exact amount I am 
not able to ascertain. We have taken about forty 
prisoners, recovered most of those they had taken 
from us at Schoharie and other places, with the ne- 
groes, cattle, and plunder. Our principal loss is Co- 
lonel Brown, of the Bay levies. He, by false intel- 
ligence, was led into the fire of the whole body of 
the enemy, and fell, with thirty-nine of his and the 
militia and levies of this State; and two were made 
prisoners. 

The accounts I formerly transmitted your Excel- 
lency, respecting the enemy to the northward, are, as 
far as I have since been able to learn, nearly true. 
The little post and garrison of Fort Ann, appears to 
me to have been surrendered through treachery or 
cowardice. Captain Chipman, commanding ofiicer at 
Fort George, having, on the first alarm, sent out his 
whole garrison (supposing the enemy to consist of 
only about thirty Indians and Tories) except four- 
teen men, obtained a very honorable capitulation be- 
fore he could be induced to surrender. 

VOL. III. 12 



134 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

The injuries we have sustained, by these different 
incursions of the enemy, will be most severely felt. 
They have destroyed, on a moderate computation, two 
hundred dwellings and one hundred and fifty thousand 
bushel's of wheat, with a proportion of other grain 
and forage. 

The enemy to the northward continue in the neigh- 
bourhood of Crown Point ; and the inhabitants, in con- 
sequence of their apprehension of danger, are remov- 
ing from the northern parts of the State. Colonel 
Gansevoort, by the advice of General Ten Broeck, 
marched to cover that part of the country, and Colo- 
nel Wiessenfels has since marched to Schenectady, 
where his regiment will continue to escort a sufficient 
supply of provisions to Fort Schuyler, a very incon- 
siderable part of which is as yet provided; and unless 
particular attention is paid to this business, as the 
season for w^ater transportation in the course of a 
month will be over, and it will be impossible to for- 
ward supplies by land, the post must, in the course 
of the winter, be abandoned. The levies incorporated 
into this regiment, whose times expire about the 
middle of December, were immediately to march to 
Fort Herkimer, to keep open the communication of 
Fort Schuyler with the country. This regiment, with 
the others of this State, are so exceedingly destitute 
in point of clothing, notwithstanding every attempt 
of the State to supply them, that I could have 
wished some other regiment, better provided against 
the severe climate, had been ordered to garrison on 
that post, especially as I find, from this consideration, 
and because the troops of this State conceive it an 
hardship constantly to perform that duty, it is be- 
come extremely disagreeable to them. 

I forgot to mention, that, when we arrived at Fort 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 135 

Herkimer, a letter was despatclied to Major Hughs, 
commanding at Fort Schuyler, giving him an account 
of the force and route of the enemy, and of their 
boats lying at Onondaga Lake, that he might, if he 
found it consistent "with the safety of his garrison, 
send out a small party to annoy the enemy on their 
march. By his letter to Colonel Malcom, I find he 
despatclied a party of sixty men for this purpose, 
with orders to use the utmost precaution against sur- 
prise, or any thing that might prevent their returning 
to the Fort. Since my return from Albany a report 
prevails, that this party were ambushed by the ene- 
my, and defeated ; but from Major Hughs's cautious 
orders, and as I have no official accounts, I do not 
credit it. 

I have the honor to be, &c., 

George Clinton. 

P. S. The enemy brought with them two brass 
mortars for four-and-three-quarter shells, which they 
concealed on their route from Schoharie. From some 
discoveries, we are in hopes of finding them. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL MCPOUGALL. 

FishkiU, 30 October, 1780. 

Sir, 
Your Excellency would long ere now have heard 
from me, but I delayed writing till I could give you 
some information of importance. Before General St. 
Clair relieved me, I had intimations, from some mem- 
bers of the Legislature, that they wished to see me 
before they broke up, which was agreeable to my in- 



136 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

tention. When he arrivecl;, I immediately went there, 
and spent a week with them till they adjourned, 
which, I am persuaded, was not ill spent. I gave 
them a particular detail of our public affairs, so far 
as I was capable, and alarmed them with our condi- 
tion. It had its proper effect. They have passed 
very decisive laws for filling up their regiments for 
the war ; but express their desire to Congress, that 
one of the five may be incorporated into four. They 
have also passed tax laws to the utmost ability of 
the State. The Commissioners, appointed to meet the 
Convention at Hartford, are men of enlarged minds, 
fully informed of our civil defects and inertness, as 
well as the feeble state of the army. They are in- 
structed and empowered to agree on the necessity of 
a Continental Executive, with powers similar to those 
mentioned in the inclosure, number One. 

In short. Sir, a great majority of the Legislature 
have a proper spirit for the times, and, so far as our 
safety depends on their exertions, we have nothing 
to fear. To remove all doubts of the intention of the 
Legislature in electing me a member of Congress, 
they were jo^^ased to express it in a letter, copy 
of which I take the liberty to inclose you. It ap- 
pears by it, that they consider my civil capacity but 
a secondary one to my military, and in this relation 
to the army I wish to be considered by the Com- 
mander-in-chief; and I beg that no unmilitary delicacy 
may be observed to me, while in the field, from my 
connection with the civil. Whether I am acting in 
the civil or military line, I have but one object, and 
that is, to promote the best interest of this distressed 
country. 

I was honored with your favor of the 24th instant, 
which anticipates the application I purposed to make, 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 137 

when I should be ready to go to Congress, and the 
campaign judged at an end. I now wait only for 
means to bring me out of Philadelphia, when it shall 
be thought proper for me to take the field. I own 
I fear, and have much reason to fear, I shall not be 
able, in Congress, to answer the virtuous expectations 
of the army and my fellow-citizens j but shall endea- 
vour to do my duty. 

I have the honor to be, &c. &c., 

Alexander McDougall. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Philadelphia, 31 October, 1780. 

Sir, 
On my arrival at this place, I laid your Excel- 
lency's letter before Congress, and addressed them 
on the business of the Southern department. I am 
happy to inform you that my appointment is per- 
fectly agreeable to their views and wishes. But I 
am sorry to acquaint you that, from the best account 
I can get of the state and condition of the troops in 
that quarter, nothing is to be expected from them, 
unless large supplies can be forwarded from the 
northward. They are altogether without clothing and 
blankets, and totally unfit for any kind of service. 
To carry them into the field, in this condition, will 
only fill the hospitals, and sacrifice the lives of a 
great many valuable men. Arms are not less want- 
ing than clothing, and wagons as much as either. 
Men, I believe, may be had, if it was in our power 
to equip them for the field. But how we shall do 
this, is difficult for me to imagine. Congress can 
furnish no money, and the Board of War neither 

12 * 



138 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

clothing nor other necessaries. Indeed, the prospect 
is dismal and truly distressing. 

I beg your Excellency to urge, unceasingly, the 
necessity of forwarding supplies for the Southern 
army, as it will he impossible to carry on a Avinter 
campaign without clothing. I have laid before Con- 
gress an estimate of our wants; but there is not the 
shadow of a prospect of their being furnished, unless 
constant attention is paid to the business. And I 
am apprehensive, as soon as I am gone, and no one 
left to urge our wants, they will soon be forgotten. 

The late success of the militia against Colonel Fer- 
guson, I am in hopes will be attended with good 
consequences. It will give a severe check to the 
Tories, and spirit and confidence to the Whigs. A 
report prevails this day that Lord Cornwallis has re- 
treated precipitately from Charlotte towards Camden. 

The detachment of the enemy, that sailed lately 
from New York, are landed at Portsmouth, in Vir- 
ginia ; and it is said the shipping are pushing up 
the rivers. The troops have taken possession of the 
great bridge, by which, I am told, they command all 
the lower counties. 

How to employ our little force, if we are attacked 
both in Virginia and North Carolina at the same 
time, is difficult to determine. My first object will 
be to equip a flying army, to consist of about eight 
hundred horse, and one thousand infantry. This force, 
with the occasional aid of the militia, will serve to 
confine the enemy in their limits, and render it diffi- 
cult for them to subsist in the interior country. I 
see but little prospect of getting a force to contend 
with the enemy upon equal grounds, and therefore 
must make the most of a kind of partisan war, until 
we can levy and equip a larger force. Such was the 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 139 

difficulty of getting provisions and providing the 
means of transportation, that General Gates writes, in 
his last letter, that the army was in the utmost dan- 
ger of disbanding. 

Congress have invested me with the same powers 
they gave to General Gates, and annexed IMaryland 
and Delaware to the Southern department. The ar- 
rangement of the army has taken place, and, I hope, 
upon a footing which will render it more respectable 
than it has been, provided the business of finance 
can be got into some regular order. But that is our 
weak side ; and I wish our distresses may be painted 
in their true colors to the Minister of France, as he 
intimated to Baron Steuben that your Excellency did 
not appear to be apprehensive of any difficulty from 
the state of our affairs. 

I have made application to the merchants of this 
city for clothing for the Southern army; but they 
excused themselves, as having engaged more already 
than they can perform. I intend to try to put sub- 
scriptions on foot in Maryland and Virginia for the 
purpose of supplying clothing. Whether it will pro- 
duce any good or not, time only can determine. At 
any rate I shall have the satisfaction of having done 
all in my power; and if there is not public spirit 
enough in the people to defend their liberties, they 
w^ll deserve to be slaves. 

General Knox promised to send forward a company 
of artillery, if your Excellency approved thereof I 
wish they may come forward, without loss of time. 
This State have promised to lend me one thousand 
stand of arms, upon a promise of their being re- 
placed, which I beg your Excellency to give an or- 
der for, as this was the only footing they could be 
obtained upon. I have the honor to be, &c., 

Nathanael Greene. 



140 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Philadelphia, 3 November, 1780. 

Sir, 

Lieutenant-Colonel John Laurens is very anxious 
to join the Southern army, as soon as he gets ex- 
changed. His knowledge of the Southern States, and 
of the customs and manners of the people, will ren- 
der his services very necessary in that quarter."'' 

Congress have passed a resolution authorizing me 
to make exchanges. I could wish to know your Ex- 
cellency's intentions in this business, as it is my wish 
to regulate my conduct agreeably to your views. 

The arms w'e are likely to get from the Board of 
War and this State fall far short of my expectations. 
The whole will not exceed fifteen hundred. I must 
beg your Excellency, therefore, to forward us three 
or four thousand from the Eastern States, as it is 
impossible to get them here. We are not less defi- 
cient in cartouch-boxes than arms. 

I am apprehensive the difficulty of forming a large 
body of cavalry in Virginia, will be much greater 
than I imagined. I wish, therefore, if it was possi- 
ble, the Duke de Lauzun's legion might be detached 
to serve with the Southern army, provided it can be 
done consistently with the views of Count Rochambeau. 
The British might receive a deadly blow in Virginia, 
if Count Bochambeau and Admiral Ternay w^ould 
suddenly embark their troops, and land in Virginia. 
The enemy's fleet there is much inferior to that of

Charleston. He did not join the Southern army at this time. On 
the 23d of December he was appointed a special Minister to France, 
for the purpose of soliciting aids from the French Court. On this 
mission he was absent less than seven months. See Diplomatic Cor- 
respondence of the Revolution, Vol. IX. p. 195.

the French ; and the land force of the former greatly 
inferior to the latter, when joined by the troops levy- 
ing in Virginia, and the militia of the country. But 
this will be thought too hazardous, perhaps. 

I am, &c., &c.,

FROM GOVERNOR JEFFERSON. 

Richmond, 3 November, 1780. 

Sir, 
Since I had the honor of writing to your Excel- 
lency on the 25th ultimo, the enemy have withdrawn 
their force from the north side of James River, and 
have taken post at Portsmouth, which, we learn, they 
are fortifying. Their highest post is Suffolk, where 
there is a very narroAv and defensible pass, between 
Nansemond River and the Dismal Swamp, which co- 
vers the country below from being entered by us. 
More accurate information of their forces than we at 
first had, gives us reason to suppose them to be from 
twenty-five hundred to three thousand, of which be- 
tween sixty and seventy are cavalry. They are com- 
manded by General Leslie, and were convoyed by 
the Romulus, of forty guns, the Blonde of thirty-two, 
the Delight sloop of sixteen, a twenty-gun ship of 
John Goodrich's, and two row galleys, commanded by 
Commodore Gayton. We are not yet assured that 
they have landed their whole force. Indeed, they 
give out, themselves, that, after drawing the force of 
this State to Suffolk, they mean to go to Baltimore. 
Their movements here had induced me to think they 
came in expectation of meeting with Lord Cornwallis

them without a concerted object, and that they were 
waiting further orders. Information of thi^ morning 
says, that, on being informed of Lord Cornwallis's 
retreat, and a public paper produced to them wherein 
were printed the several despatches, which brought 
this intelligence from General Gates, they unladed a 
vessel and sent her off to Charleston immediately. 
The fete of this army of theirs hangs on a very slen- 
der naval force indeed. 

The want of barracks at Fort Frederic, as repre- 
sented by Colonel Wood, the difl&culty of getting 
wagons sufficient to move the whole Convention 
troops at once, and the state of unreadiness in which 
the regiment of guards is, have induced us to think 
that it will be better to remove those troops in two 
divisions ; and, as the whole danger of desertion to 
the enemy, and of correspondence with the disaffected 
in our southern counties, is from the British only 
(for, from the Germans, we have no apprehensions on 
either head), we have advised Colonel Wood to move 
on the British in the first division, and to leave the 
Germans, in their present situation, to form a second 
division, and to be moved so soon as barracks may 
be erected at Fort Frederic. By these means the 
British may march immediately, under the guard of 
Colonel Crockett's battalion, while Colonel Taylor's 
regiment of guards remain with the Germans. I 
cannot suppose that this will be deemed such a se- 
paration as is provided against by the Convention, 
nor that their officers will wish to have the whole 
troops crowded together into barracks, which probably 
are not sufficient for half of them. Should thev, how- 
ever, insist on their being kept together, I suppose 
it would be the opinion that the second division 
should follow^ the first as closely as possible, and that

their being exposed to a want of covering would, in 
that case, justly be imputable to themselves only. 
The delay of the second division will lessen the dis- 
tress for provisions, which may, perhaps, take place 
on their first going to the new post, before matters 
have got into a regular train. 

I have the honor to be, &c., &c., 

Thomas Jefferson. 

P. S. By a letter from Colonel Wood, received 
since writing the above, I am informed the British 
Conventioners are eight hundred and four, rank and 
file. He does not mention the present number of 
the Germans ; in May last, they were fifteen hundred 
and three, including officers. 



FROM GOVERNOR JEFFERSON. 

Richmond, 10 November, 1780. 

Sir, 
I inclose to your Excellency a copy of an inter- 
cepted letter from Major-General Leslie to Lord Corn- 
wallis. It was taken on a person endeavouring to 
pass through the country from Portsmouth towards 
Carolina. When he was apprehended, and a proposal 
made to search him, he readily consented to be 
searched; but, at the same time, was observed to put 
his hand into his pocket and carry something towards 
his mouth, as if it were a quid of tobacco. It was 
examined and found to be a letter, of which the in- 
closed is a copy, written on silk paper, rolled up in 
gold-beater's skin, and nicely tied at each end, so as 
not to be larger than a goose-cpill. As this is the 



144 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

first authentic disclosure of their purpose in coming 
here, and may serve to found, with somewhat more 
of certainty, conjectures of their future movements, 
while their disappointment in not meeting with Lord 
Cornwallis may occasion new plans at New York, I 
thought it worthy of communication to your Excel- 
lency/'' 

Some deserters were yesterday taken, said to be 
of the British Convention troops, wdio had found 
means to get to the enem}'" at Portsmouth, and were 
seventy or eighty miles on their way back to the 
barracks when they were taken. They were passing 
under the guise of deserters from Portsmouth. 
I have the honor to be, &c., &c., 

Thomas Jefferson. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SULLIVAN, IN CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 12 November, 1780. 

Dear General, 
You will, I doubt not, forgive m}^ neglect in not 
v/riting you, when I assure you that I have had 
nothing to communicate which could give you plea- 
sure, or avoid giving you pain ; and, that I w^as un-

which have flowed from party spirit, from inattention.

and from other sources, would fill a volume in folio. 
We are now struggling to extricate ourselves from 
those difficulties into which our folly or our preju- 
dices have throAvn us. Perhaps we may succeed. 
Some advances have been made toward a reforma- 
tion ; many more will shortly be attempted. 

The army is arranged, I hope, agreeably to your 
Excellency's wish. The officers have half-pay for 
life ; the States are called upon for men and specific 
supplies ; loans are demanded ; the several depart- 
ments are arranging ; the expensive Naval and other 
Boards will be demolished, economy introduced, and, 
I trust, specie will relieve paper bills from the task 
of deceiving mankind, and yield to every man his 
just demand. Party spirit, though not annihilated, is 
compelled to hide its head ; and jealousy of the army, 
which has long obstructed salutary measures, dare not 
appear in public. I know it is late for a reforma- 
tion to commence, but I hope not too late. I lament 
exceedingly the distresses of our army, and will 
cheerfully contribute every thing in my power to re- 
lieve them, or so lighten that burden which I know 
your Excellency must feel, provided I could have the 
honor of a line from you, pointing out the evils, and 
the mode you would have adopted for redress. 

I feel, very sensibly for the Southern States, and 
fear either a conquest by force, or a defection, which 
will bring about a base submission. We are informed 
that Clinton is about to embark, with great part of 
his army, for Virginia. Should this event take place, 
I fear the loss of the four Southern States will be 
the consequence. 

To prevent this, I beg leave to submit to your 
Excellency's consideration, whether it would not be 
prudent to order the French fleet to Boston, where 

VOL. III. 13 



146 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

they may lie in safety, and call the French army to 
head-quarters. Will not this cause Sir Henry to 
tremble for New York, and diminish the force, if not 
totally prevent, the blow meditated against the South- 
ern States ? These are only hints, which arise from 
my zeal to save the Southern States, and which, 
however unmilitary and injudicious they may appear, 
I flatter myself your Excellency will readily pardon. 
I have the honor to be, &c., 

John Sullivan. 



FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Light Camp, 13 November, 1780. 

My dear General, 

In revolving in my mind the chances of discovery 
by moonlight, and, on the other hand, the inconve- 
niences of staying longer than you wish under our 
tents, I have thought if there was any position which 
might enable us to take advantage of the first hours 
of the night. How far the sending of the Pennsyl- 
vanians towards Aquakanac, and going ourselves to 
the Hackensac position, may awaken the enemy, I 
cannot pretend to say. The most difficult affair in 
this, would be the article of the boats. Colonel Smith 
will go to-morrow morning to West Point, unless any 
intelligence received at head-quarters had made it 
useful that the enterprise be attempted soon, in which 
case he would go and reconnoitre the place. Suppose 
he was to bring from West Point Colonel Gouvion, 
who has often examined the place with the eye of 
an engineer. These ideas, my dear General, have 
rather started into my mind than become fixed, anu 
I thought I would communicate them. 

Most afi'ectionately and respectfully yours, 

Lafayette. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 147 

P. S. The Marquis de Laval Montmorency, one 
of the most illustrious families in France, is on liis 
way to the camp. The Chevalier de Chastellux, a 
relation and friend of mine, Major-General in the 
French army, is also coming. I every day expect 
my brother-in-law, and his friend, Count de Charlus, 
only son to the Marquis de Castries, who enjoys a 
o-reat consideration in France, and has won the battle 
of Closter Camp. The duke of Lauzun has also 
written to me that he would come soon. These five 
gentlemen may, by their eminence at home, be con- 
sidered as the first people in the French army. This 
little history I give you before their arrival, in con- 
sequence of what you have desired from me at the 
beginning. 

I write some letters to the Commanding Officers at 
Fishkill, West Point, and King's Ferry, so that the 
gentlemen may be directed to come by the best road 
to my quarters, from which I will present them to 
you. I think the letters ought to be sent as soon 
as possible. 

As General Heath commands in all these parts, I 
think, upon recollection, that I had better write to 
him alone. You might also send him a line on the 
subject. 



FROM COUNT DE ROCHAJMBEAU. 

Newport, 14 November, 1780. 

Sir, 

The Marquis de Lafayette has wrote to the Viscount 

de Noailles, his brother-in-law, and shows the greatest 

desire to see him. I find his demand so just, that^ 

though I have given leave to several of our Colonels 



148 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

to go and wait on your Excellency, I have added 
likewise the Viscount de Noailles, and the Marquis 
de Damas. If your Excellency does not find a mo- 
ment to come and see this part of your army, I am 
afraid that the whole of it will desert, so great is 
their desire to see their General. I beg you will be 
persuaded of the extreme desire I would have to re- 
ceive you here, if you can find an opportunity. The 
Chevalier de Ternay has sent back to-day Mr. Roger, 
Arbuthnot's Lieutenant, who was here for the second 
time as a flag of truce. He had kept him three 
weeks, pretty closely confined in his vessel, to weak- 
en a little his desire of making us a third visit. He 
sends likewise a flag to New York, to carry some 
ladies. I am, with respect. Sir, &c., 

Le Compte de Rochambeau. 



FROM GOVERNOR HANCOCK. 

Boston, 17 November, 1780, 

Sir, 

I should very frequently have done myself the 
honor of writing to your Excellency, since the close 
of our correspondence on my leaving Congress, could 
I have prevailed upon myself to have drawn your 
attention from your weighty concerns ; and am con- 
fident my silence will not be attributed to any other 
cause. 

I am now called upon, by the free sufi'rages of my 
fellow-citizens, to take an active part in a sphere of 
public life quite unexpected to me ; which call, upon 
the principles I first advanced, I could not withstand. 
One inducement, among many others, that led to a 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 149 

cheerful compliance with this call, was, that it would 
afford me an agreeable opportunity of convincing you 
that no effort of mine should be wanting to promote 
your Excellency's views, with respect to a permanent 
army ; as my particular station would lead to a cor- 
respondence on public concerns, to which I shall al- 
ways be attentive, and shall be happy, on every oc- 
casion, to be informed of the situation of the army, 
and all occurrences, and to expedite the measures 
adopted by this Commonwealth for the accommoda- 
tion of the army. 

I am now more particularly led to address you, in 
consequence of a resolution of our Assembly, which 
I have the honor to inclose you, respecting the arms 
and accoutrements retained in camp by your order, 
which belonged to the soldiers of this Commonwealth, 
and at the expiration of their time were lodged in 
camp for the benefit of the United States, and no 
compensation made them. These soldiers are con- 
stantly making their application to the Assembly for 
a recompense for the loss of their arms and accoutre- 
ments, alleging, they were ordered to leave them in 
camp; and the Assembly are at a loss in what man- 
ner to proceed without some further knowledge of 
the circumstances. In order that they may conduct 
with propriety (as the United States must be charge- 
able with the amount), they have passed the inclosed 
resolve, requesting me to make application to your 
Excellency, to order a return to be made of all the 
arms and accoutrements that have been taken from 
the men belonging to this Commonwealth, specifying 
the names of the persons from whom such guns were 
taken or detained, and the regiment, company, and 
town, to which such men belong, in order that pay- 
ment may be made to those who have benefited the 



150 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

public by leaving their arms and accoutrements, and 
have hitherto received no compensation. 

I am, therefore, to request that your Excellency 
will be pleased to give the necessary orders for the 
returns to be made, that the persons interested may, 
as speedily as possible, meet a compensation. 
I have the honor to be, &c., 

John Hancock. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Richmond, 19 November, 1780. 

Sir, 

I am happy in the opportunity of answering your 
Excellency, that I am received and treated with all 
the marks of respect and attention that I can wish. 
Your letters have been of singular service ; and I am 
exceedingly obliged to you for the warm manner in 
which you recommended me to the notice of your 
friends ; among whom, Mr. Carey has been very po- 
lite and obliging. 

Your weight and influence, both with Congress and 
this State, in support of the southern operations, will 
be exceedingly important and necessary to my success. 
I must request, therefore, in the most earnest manner, 
that your Excellency continue to animate both those 
bodies, with your opinion and recommendations, to 
such measures, and such exertions, as will be neces- 
sary to give due support to the Southern army, 
without which, I am very apprehensive, the languor 
that is too apt to seize all public bodies will lull 
them into a state of false security, and the affairs in 
the Southern department will and must go to ruin. 
It has been my opinion for a long time; that personal 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 151 

influence must supply tlie defects of civil constitution; 
but I have never been so fully convinced of it as on 
this journey. I believe the vievs^s and wishes of the 
great body of the people are entirely with us. But 
remove the personal influence of a few, and they are a 
lifeless and inanimate mass, without direction, or spirit 
to employ the means they possess, for their own se- 
curity. 

I cannnot contemplate my own situation without 
the greatest degree of anxiety. I am far removed 
from almost all my friends and connections, and have 
to prosecute a war in a country, in the best state 
attended with almost insurmountable difficulties, but 
doubly so now, from the state of our finances and 
the loss of public credit. How I shall be able to 
support myself, under all these embarrassments, God 
only knows ! My only consolation is, that if I fail, I 
hope it will not be accompanied with an}'- peculiar 
marks of personal disgrace. Censure and reproach ever 
follow the unfortunate. This I expect, if I don't suc- 
ceed ; and it is only in the degree, not in the entire 
freedom, that I console myself The ruin of my fa- 
mily is what hangs most heavy upon my mind. My 
fortune is small, and misfortune or disgrace to me 
must be ruin to them. 

I beg your Excellency will do me the honor to 
forward the inclosed letter to Mrs. Greene, by the 
first safe conveyance, who is rendered exceedingly 
unhappy at my going to the southward. 

Mr. Custis arrived in town yesterday, and says 
Mrs. Washington is to set out for the army this day. 
I have the honor to be, &c., 

Nathanael Greene. 

P. S. Colonel Scammell, perhaps, will be promoted 



152 LETTERS TO AVASHINGTON. 

to the rank of Brigadier ; at least, it has been talked 
of. Should this take place, a new Adjutant-General 
will be necessary J and I beg leave to suggest the 
propriety of giving this appointment to Colonel Ha- 
milton. His services may not be less important to 
your Excellency in your family business, if he only 
employs a deputy extraordinary ; and I am persuaded 
the appointment will be received wdth great gratitude, 
as I am confident it is his wish, by what he said to 
me before I left camp. 



FROM COLONEL HAMILTON. 

22 November, 1780. 

Dear Sir, 
Some time last fall, when I spoke to your Excel- 
lency about going to the southward, I explained to 
you candidly my feelings with respect to military 
reputation, and how much it was my object to act a 
conspicuous part in some enterprise that might per- 
haps raise my character as a soldier above medio- 
crity. You were so good as to say you would be 
glad to furnish me with an occasion. When the ex- 
pedition to Staten Island was on foot, a favorable 
one seemed to offer. There was a battalion without 
a Eield-OfiBcer, the command of which I thought, as 
it was accidental, might be given to me without in- 
convenience. I made an application for it through 
the Marquis, who informed me of your refusal, on two 
principles ; one, that giving me a whole battalion 
might be a subject of dissatisfaction ; the other, that, 
if an accident should happen to me in the present 
state of your family, you would be embarrassed for 
the necessary assistance. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 153 

The project yoii now have in contemphxtion, affords 
another opportnnity. I have a variety of reasons 
that press me to desire ardently to have it in my 
power to improve it. I take the liberty to observe 
that the command may now be proportioned to my 
rank, and that the second objection ceases to operate, 
as, during the period of establishing our winter-quar- 
ters, there will be a suspension of material business; 
besides which, my peculiar situation will, in any case, 
call me away from the army in a few days, and Mr. 
Harrison may be expected back early next month. 

My command may consist of an hundred and fifty 
or two hundred men, composed of fifty men of Major 
Gibbs's corps, fifty from Colonel Meigs's regiment, 
and fifty or an hundred more from the light in- 
fantry; Major Gibbs to be my Major. The hundred 
men from here may move on Friday morning towards 
, which will strengthen the appearances for 
Staten Island, to form a junction on the other side 
of the Passaic. 

I suggest this mode to avoid the complaints that 
might arise from composing my party wholly of the 
light infantry, which might give umbrage to the offi- 
cers of that corps, who, on this plan, can have no 
just subject for it. 

The primary idea may be, if circumstances per- 
mit, to attempt, with my detachment, Bayard's Hill. 
Should we arrive early enough to undertake it, I 
should prefer it to any thing else, both for the bril- 
liancy of the attempt, in itself, and the decisive con- 
sequences of which its success would be productive. 
If we arrive too late to make this eligible (as there 
is reason to apprehend), my corps may form the van 
of one of the other attacks; and Bayard's Hill will 
be a pretext for my being employed in the affair, on 



154 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

a supposition of my knowing the ground; which is 
partly true. 

I flatter myself, also, that my military character 
stands so well in the army as to reconcile the offi- 
cers in general to the measure. All circumstances 
considered, I venture to say, any exception which 
might be taken would he unreasonable. 

I take this method of making the request, to avoid 
the embarrassment of a personal explanation. I shall 
only add, that, however much I have the matter at 
heart, I wish your Excellency entirely to consult your 
own inclination, and not, from a disposition to oblige 
me, to do any thing that may be disagreeable to you. 
It will, nevertheless, make me peculiarly happy if 
your wishes correspond with mine. I have the honor 
to be, very sincerely and respectfully. 

Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

Alexander Haimilton. 



FROM GOVERNOR JEFFERSON. 

Eichmond, 26 November, 1780. 

Sir, 
I have been honored by your Excellency's letter 
of the 8th instant. Having found it impracticable to 
move suddenly the whole Convention troops, British 
and Germans, and it being represented that there 
could not immediately be covering provided for them 
all at Fort Frederic, we concluded to march off the 
British first, from whom was the principal danger of 
desertion, and to permit the Germans, who show little 
disposition to join the enemy, to remain in their pre- 
sent quarters, till something further be done. The 



THE AMERICAN EEVOLUTION. 155 

British accordingly marched on the 20th instant ; 
they cross the Bhie Ridge at the Rock-Fish Gap, 
and proceed along that valley. 

I am to apprise your Excellency, that the officers 
of every rank, both British and German, hut particu- 
larly the former, have purchased, -within this State, 
some of the finest horses in it. You will be pleased 
to determine whether it will be proper that they 
carry them within their lines. I believe the Conven- 
tion of Saratoga entitles them to keep the horses 
they then had ; but I presume none of the line, be- 
low the rank of Field-Officers, had a horse. 

Considering that the British will be now at Fort 
Frederic, and the Germans in Albemarle, Alexandria 
seems to be the most central point to which there is 
navigation. Would it not, therefore be better that the 
flag-vessel, solicited by General Phillips, should go to 
that place ? It is about equally distant from the two 
posts. The roads to Albemarle are good. I know 
not how those are which lead to Fort Frederic. 

Your letter, referring me to General Greene for 
the mode of constructing light, portable boats, unfor- 
tunately did not come to hand till he had left us. 
We had before determined to have something done 
in that way; and, as they are still unexecuted, we 
should be greatly obliged by any draughts or hints 
which could be given by any body, within the roach 
of your Excellenc}^ 

I received advice that, on the 22d instant, the 
enemy's fleet got all under way, and were standing 
towards the Capes. As it still remained undecided 
wdiether they would leave the Bay or turn up it, I 
waited the next stage of information, that you might 
so far be enabled to judge of their destination. This 
I hourly expected, but it did not come till this even- 



156 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

ing, when, I am informed, they all got out to sea 
in the night of the 22cl. What course they steered 
afterwards, is not known. I must do their General 
and Commodore the justice to say, that, in every case, 
to which their influence or attention could reach, as 
far as I have been well informed, their conduct Avas 
such as does them the greatest honor. In the few 
instances of unnecessary and wanton devastation 
which took place, they punished the aggressors. 

I have the honor to be, &c., 

Thomas Jefferson. 



FROM JOSIAH QUINCY. 

Braintree, 27 NoTember, 1780. 

I am happy to hear, by my worthy friend Dr. Cros- 
by, that my last letter to your Excellency, with the 
papers inclosed, was not only fxvorably received, but 
revived the remembrance of one w^hom you are so 
good as to rank among the number of your friends. 
Would to God my abilities were equal to my inclina- 
tions ! For, then, I would endeavour to render myself 
worthy of that honor by some eminent public ser- 
vices in defence of my injured country. But alas ! 
threescore years and ten are past with me. All, 
therefore, that remains in my power is, to pray for 
the continuance of that Divine protection, whicli has 
hitherto so remarkably preserved your invaluable life 
from the secret machinations of perfidious friends and 
the open violence of declared enemies, till the harvest 
of your indefatigable labors shall ultimatel}^ issue to 
your immortal honor in the salvation of your country. 

Our new-formed Supreme Legislative has postpon- 
ed all other business to filling up our quota of troops 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 157 

during the continuance of the war. It is devoutly to 
be wished that the ways and means to he devised 
for this purpose may he effectual, and equal to the 
importance of the object. But, for my own part, I 
am utterly unable/ to discover where they may be found. 
Our new paper money, issued by recommendation 
of Congress, no sooner began to circulate, than two 
dollars of it were given for a hard one. To restore 
the credit of paper, by making it a lawful tender, by 
regulating acts, or by taxes, are political manoeuvres 
that have already proved abortive, and for this ob- 
vious reason, — that, in the same proportion as ideal 
money is forced into currency, it must, from the na- 
ture of every thing fraudulent, be forced out of 
credit. I have said, "from the nature of every thing 
fraudulent" because I am firmly of the opinion, and 
think it entirely defensible, that there never was a 
paper pound, a paper dollar, or a paper promise of 
any kind, that ever yet obtained a general currency, 
but by force or fraud, generally by both. 

That the army has been grossly cheated; that cre- 
ditors have been infamously defrauded; that the 
widow and fatherless have been oppressively wronged 
and beggared; that the gray hairs of the aged and 
the innocent, for want of their just dues, have gone 
down with sorrow to their graves, in consequence of 
our disgraceful depreciated paper currency, — may now 
be affirmed, without hazard of refutation ; and, I wish 
it could be said, with truth, that the war has not 
thereby been protracted. May it not, therefore, be 
safely concluded that no kind of paper currency is 
adequate to the purpose of collecting and combining 
the forces of these United States for their common 
defence ? 

That our resources are equal to the exigencies of 

VOL. III. 14 



158 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

the whole, I have not the least doubt; but we have 
wandered so far out of the right road, that I fear it 
is become extremely difficult to find it again. To 
speak without a figure, fictitious wealth, that repre- 
sents nothing but taxes, to be made a medium of 
trade or measure of commerce, an adequate reward 
for public services, and an equivalent for specie bor- 
rowed, either on public or private contract, before 
ever such fictitious wealth had an existence, — is cer- 
tainly going out of the road of truth and justice. 
By consequence, the further we go, the more difficult 
it will be to return. But return we must, and that 
speedily, to the exercise of both ; otherwise, it re- 
quires no great sagacity to foresee that our ruin is 
inevitable. 

Should your Excellency ask how it is to be done, 
my answer is short and easy; — by reversing our pub- 
lic conduct, in almost every instance since the war be- 
gan. Permit me to mention one. Instead of a C s 

become despicable, for want of power sufficient to do 
rigid, or odious by exercising an assumed power he- 
yond rigJit, had both the civil and military department 
been united in one and the same person during the 
war, and under the limitation as well as sanction of 
law ; — had this measure, I say, been adopted at 
first, it is more than probable our alliance with 
France would not only have commenced sooner, but 
it would have been no sooner ratified and confirmed, 
than the war would have been ended. Other in- 
stances might be given, though, perhaps, not of equal 
importance. 

But I find, whilst I am reprehending my superiors 
for going out of the right road, I am insensibly led 
out of it myself Be so good, therefore, as to ex- 
cuse my intemperate zeal; and believe me to be, &c.,

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 159 

FR05I THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Paramus, 28 November, 1780. 

My DEAR General, 

We arrived last night at this place, and were much 
favored by the weather in our recognizing of the 
Island, where, I confess, my feelings were different 
from what I had experienced when looking at these 
forts with a hopeful eye. I saw the fatal sentry, al- 
luded to by Colonel Gouvion, on an upper battery of 
Jeflfery's Hook. I also saw a small vessel playing 
off this Hook J but quite a trifling thing, without 
guns, and but two men on board. Nothing else on 
the river but the usual guards of Spiten Devil. 

As you have been pleased to consult me on the 
choice of an Adjutant-General, I will repeat, here, my 
dear General, that, though I have a claim upon Ge- 
neral Hand, in every other point of view, his zeal, 
obedience, and love of discipline, have given me a 
very good opinion of him. Colonel Smith has been 
by me wholly employed in that line, and I can as- 
sure you that he will perfectly answer your pur- 
pose. 

Unless, however, you were to cast your eye on a 
man who, I think, would suit better than any other 
in the world. Hamilton is, I confess, the officer whom 
I should like to see in that station. With equal ad- 
vantages, his services deserve from you the preference 
to any other. His knowledge of your opinions and 
intentions on military arrangements ; his love of disci- 
pline ; the superiority he would have over all the others, 
principally when both armies shall operate together; 
and his uncommon abilities, — are calculated to render 
him perfectly agreeable to you. His utility would 
be increased by this preferment ; and on other points 



IGO LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

he could render important services. An Adjutant-Ge- 
neral ought always to be with the Commander-in- 
chief. Hamilton should, therefore, remain in your 
family ; and his great industry in business would ren- 
der him perfectly serviceable under all circumstances. 
On every public or private account, my dear Gene- 
ral, I would advise you to take him. 

I shall, on my arrival at Philadelphia, write you 
how those matters are going, upon which I build my 
private schemes. But I heartily wish that some ac- 
count or other from Europe may enable you to act, 
this winter, on maritime operations. I hate the idea 
of being from you for so long a time ; but I think I 
ought not to stay idle. At all events I must return 
when your army takes the field. 

I flatter myself with the hope of meeting Mrs. 
Washington on the road. Adieu, my dear General. 
Most affectionately and respectfully yours, 

Lafayette. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL STARK. 

West Point, 30 November, 1780. 

Dear Sir, 

The impaired state of my health and the situation 
of my family, together with the unsettled state of 
my accounts with New Hampshire, render my pre- 
sence there, the ensuing winter, very necessary. I 
have never, as yet, settled my depreciation, nor re- 
ceived any cash, on that head, from them. I should 
be very glad to do it this winter, without which 
it will be in a manner impossible for me to subsist 
in the army. 

The brigade that I have had the honor to com- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 161 

mand; are now ordered to join their respective States' 
troops; therefore it is not probable that it will be in 
my power to render my country any essential ser- 
vice until the opening of another campaign. 

The many favors I have received, and the known 
zeal you have shown for your ojQ&cers, together with 
your care of their interest, strongly invite me to 
ask the favor of absence until the spring. That 
this request may be granted, is the ardent desire of 
Your Excellency's obedient servant, 

John Stark. 



FROM THE CHEVALIER DE LA LUZERNE. 

(Translation.) 

Philadelphia, 5 December, 1780. 

Sir, 

I flattered myself that the clothing, destined for 
the army under the command of your Excellency, 
had at length arrived in the river, in the vessel of 
Paul Jones, or in one of those coming under his 
convoy; but I regret that you have not yet had 
that satisfaction. A passenger, who arrived in one of 
this convoy, told me that when this little squadron, 
which left France on the 8th of October, should ar- 
rive, they would bring but little clothing, being in 
great part laden with arms and ammunition; but he 
added that the Serapis is destined to bring the 
remainder of the clothing, and that we may hope 
to see the vessel arrive soon in our ports. I am 
anxious to have an opportunity of giving your Ex- 
cellency notice of the arrival of these articles. 

I have received certain intelligence that an expe- 
dition, composed of four thousand troops, convoyed 
14* 



162 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

by eight vessels of war, departed on the 16th of Oc- 
tober from the Havana to attempt an expedition 
against Pensacola. But it is thought that the ter- 
rible tempests, which they may have experienced on 
the passage, may have retarded the fleet. 

Another expedition was to depart in the month of 
December, to attack St. Augustine. It was to be 
composed of ten thousand men, regulars and militia, 
and twelve vessels of war. I wish, sincerely, that the 
operation may meet with success, and thus make an 
advantageous diversion in favor of the United States 
in that quarter. 

The Chevalier de Chastellux and the officers who 
had the honor of visiting you at head-quarters, desire 
me to present their respects to you. They hope to 
have the honor of seeing you again on their return. 

I am, &c., 

Luzerne. 



FROM COLONEL BRODHEAD. 

Fort Pitt, 7 December, 1780. 

Dear General, 

I am honored with your favor of the loth of Oc- 
tober, and should have appointed the time and place 
for the immediate execution of Gamble, but both he 
and Davis had effected their escape, as I informed 
your Excellency in a former letter. The officers, who 
commanded the guards at the times they respectively 
escaped, were arrested, tried, and acquitted ; and, 
therefore, I thought it unnecessary to trouble you 
with the proceedings respecting them. 

I was applied to, to endeavour to intercede with 
your Excellency, to remit the sentence of Captain 
Beal ; but I thought it too just, to say any thing 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 163 

about it. The proceedings respecting Gosset were 
packed up, in a mistake. The Court-Martial sen- 
tentenced him to be whipped; and, as your Excel- 
lency had authorized me to determine upon all pro- 
ceedings which did not affect life, or the dismission 
of an officer, I did not intend to have troubled you 
Avith the proceedings respecting him. 

I have, for a long time past, had two parties in 
the country, commanded by Field-Officers, to im- 
press cattle, and yet the troops are frequently with- 
out meat for several days together. Indeed, I am so 
well convinced that there is not half meat enough 
on this side the mountain for the supply of the 
troops, that I have thought it advisable to risk the 
sending a party of hunters to kiU buffalo, at Little 
Kanhawa, and laying the meat, until we shall be able 
to send for it, which, I expect, will be in the spring. 

The Delaware Chiefs have declared war against the 
Senecas; and Captain John Montour was immediately 
sent, with two Delawares and one white man, to 
bring a prisoner from their towns. At French Creek 
(Venango) he fell in with a party of eight Senecas, 
who, a few days before, had taken a woman and two 
children from Westmoreland county. He shot one of 
the Indians upon a raft in the creek, and the rest 
ran away; but, after a few minutes, one of them re- 
turned, under cover of some timber, and asked Mon- 
tour who he was. He told them that he and his men 
were Delawares ; that they were sent by their Chiefs ; 
and that they might thank God the water prevented 
getting at them ; when the Seneca expressed some 
mark of contempt, and followed his own party. This 
relation may be depended on. Captain Montour, with 
a party of Delawares, is now in pursuit of another 



164 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

party of Indians, supposed to be Delawares, or Mun- 
cies, who were discovered by a Delaware runner, on 
their way towards these settlements. 

I do all in my power to encourage partisan strokes. 
But, w^as I at liberty to give rewards, I have neither 
money nor goods to do it with. I can venture to 
say that I could, at any time, for a small quantity 
of goods, engage a very considerable number of De- 
laware Indians to go with me upon an expedition ; 
and I believe that a considerable quantity would 
enable me to set the Indians at war against one 
another, so as to divert them from our frontiers. 

Many of the inhabitants are uneasy to see any no- 
tice taken of the Delaware Indians, and once attempt- 
ed to destroy a great number of them, who were 
under our protection, but were prevented by a guard 
of regular troops. I have hitherto made use of every 
address in my power to keep as many of them from 
joining the enemy as it was possible for me to do, 
in obedience to your Excellency's instructions ; and I 
shall be very thankful for your further commands 
respecting them. 

I am sensible that there are a great number of 
disaffected inhabitants on this side the mountain, that 
wish for nothing more than a fair opportunity to 
submit to the British Government, and, therefore, 
would be glad to have the regular troops withdrawn. 

I have received the General Orders respecting the 
new arrangement of the army, and shall remit the 
arrangement of my regiment to General Wayne by 
this conveyance. I am a stranger to the intention of 
most of my brother officers; but, for my part, I am 
inclined to assist, to the end, in a work so nobly be- 
gun. I beg leave to return your Excellency my 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 165 

■warmest thanks for your continual care of the troops 
which I have the honor to command. 

I have the honor to be, &c., 

Daniel Brodhead. 

P. S. A half Indian, of the name of Bawhee, 
brouo-ht me a draft of the works at Detroit, which 
I take the liberty to inclose. He dropped some 
hints of his being in British pay, and I confined him 
in irons, but know not how to punish him without 
bringing more trouble upon the inhabitants. 



FROM MAJOR-GEXER-iL GREENE. 

Camp Charlotte, 7 December, 1780. 

Sir, 

I arrived at this place on the 2d of this instant ; 
General Gates having marched from this some days 
before me, with a part of the troops under his com- 
mand, the rest being on their march to Hillsborough. 
General Smallwood was below this, about fifteen miles, 
towards the Waxhaws, where he had been for a con- 
siderable time, before General Gates marched from 
Hillsborough. On my arrival, I sent for him, but he 
was gone towards Camden, in pursuit of a party of 
Tories, and did not arrive in camp till the night be- 
fore last. Immediately I called a Council, respecting 
the practicability of holding a Council of Inquiry 
upon General Gates's conduct, during his command 
in this department. The questions stated to the 
Council, and the answers of the members, are inclosed 
in the papers from number One to Five. 

I wrote your Excellency, at Richmond, that I should 



166 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

leave the Baron de Steuben to take command in 
Virginia, which I accordingly did, and to endeavour, 
if possible, to make an arrangement of that line. 
Since which I have not heard from him, nor whether 
the enemy have left Chesapeake Ba}'-, or not. As I 
passed through Petersburg, an express arrived from 
below, with intelligence that the enemy had returned; 
but, having heard nothing further of the matter, con- 
clude the report must have been premature. 

To give your Excellency an idea of the state and 
condition of this army, if it deserves the name of 
one, I inclose you an extract of a letter, WTote by 
General Gates to the Board of War, number Six. 
Nothing can be more w^retched and distressing than 
the condition of the troops, starving with cold and 
hunger, without tents and camp equipage. Those of 
the Virginia line are, literally, naked; and a great 
part totally unfit for any kind of duty, and must re- 
main so until clothing can be had from the north- 
ward. I have written to Governor Jefferson not to 
send forward any more until they are well clothed, 
and properly equipped. 

As I expected, so I find, the great bodies of mili- 
tia that have been in the field, and the manner in 
which they came out, being all on horseback, have 
laid waste all the country, in such a manner that I 
am really afraid it will be impossible to subsist the 
few troops we have ; and, if we can be subsisted at 
all, it must be by moving to the provisions, for they 
have no way of bringing it to the army. I have de- 
sired the Board of War of this State not to call out 
any more militia, until w^e can be better satisfied 
about the means of subsistence for the regular troops 
and the militia from Virginia. 

Lord Cornwallis lies, with his principal force, at a 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 167 

place called Weymsborough, about half way between 
Camden and Ninety Six ; at both of which places the 
enemy have a post, and are strongly fortified. At 
Camden, they have seven redoubts ; at Ninety Six, 
not more than three, but they are very strong. Part, 
if not the whole, of the embarkation mentioned in 
your Excellency's letter of the 8th ultimo, as taking 
place at New York, have arrived at Charleston, and, 
it is said, Lord Cornwallis is preparing for some 
movement. 

I have parties exploring the Dan, Yadkin, and Ca- 
tawba Rivers, and am not w^ithout hopes we shall be 
able to assist the army by water transportation. It 
is next to impossible to get a sufficiency of wagons 
to draw provisions and forage the very great dis- 
tance we are obliged to fetch it to feed the army. 
The inhabitants of this country live too remote from 
one another to be animated into great exertions ; and 
the people appear, notwithstanding their danger, very 
intent upon their own private affairs. 

Inclosed, numbers Seven and Eight, are the reports 
of General Sumpter's last' action, and Lieutenant-Co- 
lonel Washington's stratagem, by which he took Co- 
lonel Rugley and his party. 

I find, when the Baron Steuben comes forward, 
there will be a difficulty between him and General 
Smallwood. The latter declares he never will submit 
to the commands of the former, and insists upon 
having his commission dated back to as early a pe- 
riod as he had a right to promotion. When that was, 
I know not, as I know of no principles of promotion, 
from Brigadier to Major-General, except their senior- 
ity or special merit. What is best to be done in the 
affair? Before I order the Baron to come forward, I 
wish your Excellency's advice in the matter. I fear 



168 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

our army is always to be convulsed by extraordinary 
claims, and special appointments. They are exceed- 
ing good men. It is a pity a dispute should arise 
between them, so injurious to the service as it must 
be. 

My ideas respecting the power given by Congress, 
for exchanging prisoners of war in this department, 
perfectly correspond with your Excellency's. I had 
no idea that it extended to the Convention troops, 
and, by my inquiry, only meant to learn your ad- 
\iee, so that my conduct might correspond with your 
views. 

All the prisoners, taken by Colonel Campbell and 
others, have been dismissed, paroled, and enlisted in 
the militia service for three months, except about one 
hundred and thirty. Thus we have lost, by the folly, 
not to say any thing worse, of those who had them 
in charge, upwards of six hundred men. I am told 
Lord Cornwallis has lately made a proposition to 
General Smallwood for exchanging all the prisoners 
in North and South Carolina. If it is upon terms 
that are just and equal, I shall avail myself of it. 
For a great number of prisoners is a heavy weight 
upon our hands. I am too little informed of the re- 
sources still left in this country, and of the enemy's 
designs, to tell what disposition to make, or how to 
dispose of the little force we have in the field. I 
shall do the best I can, and keep your Excellency 
constantly advised of my situation. 

General Gates sets out to-morrow for the north- 
ward. Many officers think very favorably of his 
conduct, and that, whenever an inquiry takes place, 
he will honorably acquit myself 

I am, &c., 

Nathanael Greene. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 169 



FROM JAMES DUANE, IN CONGRESS. 

(Confidential.) 

Philadelplila, 9 December, 1780. 

INIy dear General, 

I should not so long have restrained the expres- 
sions of a heart flowing A^'ith the most affectionate 
and respectful attachment, if care had not been taken 
to communicate our intelligence officially. In the 
mean time, I have never found it so necessary to de- 
vote my attention to the public business. Amidst 
pressing distresses, it will give your Excellency plea- 
sure to be assured that Congress have deliberated 
with unanimity, and decided w4th firmness, and that 
every thing, within their powder, is nearly accomplish- 
ed for vigorous efforts in the course of the next year. 
If the States will draw forth their resources ; if our 
ally will seriously cooperate, by assuming a naval 
superiority in the American seas ; if we are season- 
ably furnished with the clothing, arms, and ammuni- 
tion which we have reason to expect ; and obtain the 
aid of money, which we have once more attempted to 
borrow ; — if these circumstances in any tolerable de- 
gree combine, your Excellency will at last see a pros- 
pect, under the Divine blessing, of finishing the war 
with glory. 

But it is obvious that we have many difficulties 
to encounter. Government, instead of possessing the 
confidence and the dignity necessary to enforce its 
counsels, is surrounded bv clamorous creditors and 
insidious speculators; and, what is worse, the intem- 
perance of our friends conspires with the malice of 
our enemies to render it odious. Congress may err; 
they are not exempt from State and personal preju- 
dices ; they are liable to be deceived. But nothing is 

VOL. III. 15 



170 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

more certain than that, in the common cause, their 
intentions are pure, their zeal, their cares, their pains 
unbounded; and the time will come when, if their 
measures are not admired, they will be approved. In- 
deed, Sir, an honest and disinterested patriot requires 
uncommon fortitude to render himself responsible, in 
an hour of such intolerable licentiousness. Those 
who placed their happiness in reputation retire from a 
theatre, where, while they are tortured by public dis- 
tresses, they are in danger of disgrace. The intrigues 
of speculators are more and more alarming. Our pa- 
per money lately suffered a convulsion, without any 
apparent cause, which threatened its total dissolution. 
Not contented with the infinite evils which they 
have entailed on their country, they have practised 
their arts on the Cabinet of France, and with such 
success, that one of our Ministers received a formal in- 
timation that the Chevalier de la Luzerne would be 
instructed to remonstrate against the act of the 18th 
of J\Iarch, as a violation of public faith, and an injury 
to the trading part of that nation, which ought to be 
repaired. Mr. Adams has acquired applause by a 
memorial to Count de Vergennes on this subject, full 
of good sense and dignity. The necessity and the 
justice of that memorable system are vindicated by 
reasons and facts which force conviction. The capital 
figure which the French factors made in drawing on 
the depreciation, and their avarice in striving to exact 
specie for the nominal sums of the bills, when it is 
notorious that they raised the price of their commo- 
dities in proportion to the current exchange, are ex- 
posed ; and it is demonstrated, that, instead of suffer- 
ing, they greatly profited by that national calamity. 
Nor is the proper inference neglected, that a Govern- 
ment capable, in a free country, of executing a plan 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 171 

SO disgusting to the self-interested, must possess un- 
limited confidence, and be established on the firmest 
basis. I am persuaded that this seasonable represent- 
ation will remove ever}^ prejudice, and prevent the 
effects of an attempt big with ruin. 

Another great difiiculty which embarrasses us, is 
the absolute dependence which we are compelled to 
place on the exertions of the States individually. A 
failure in one may draw upon us insupportable dis- 
tress. If the supplies of provisions should be punc- 
tually furnished, the transportation alone is an ex- 
pense of such magnitude that I never think of it 
but with anxiety, especially when we consider how 
deeply pecuniary taxes are anticipated, by certificates 
in the hands of the farmers. There is a remedy; 
but whether we have a sufficient degree of public 
spirit to apply it, can only be known by experiment. 
Why should not the opulent contribute the whole or 
a large proportion of their plate ? Why should not 
the farmer break in upon his capital, if his annual 
produce is incompetent ? Nothing is clearer than 
that this would be the truest economy, as a founda- 
tion would be laid to terminate the war by a great 
and decisive effort. These are resources in the power 
of every Legislature; and I shall think them inexcus- 
able, if, seeing the necessity to be so urgent, they 
shrink from the burden. A duty on imports, ex- 
ports, and prizes, will be strongly recommended by 
Congress ; and, if approved by the States, it must 
produce a considerable revenue. 

We have made an estimate of the national expense 
for a year from next January. Except the Quarter- 
master's branch, it is tolerably accurate. I should be 
happy if our means to defray it were certain and 
adequate ; but tliis is not to be relied on, unless we 



172 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

are effectually roused by a sense of our common dan- 
ger, and the necessity of concluding, with glory and 
expedition, a war of devastation. Every liberal hand 
must be opened; every patriotic heart must be ani- 
mated ; every public and private effort must be ex- 
erted to strengthen and support our army, to give 
weight to our national counsels, and secure them obe- 
dience at home and reputation abroad. Without the 
first, the courage, perseverance, and military accom- 
plishments of our General must be frustrated ; with- 
out the last, it would be madness to hope for credit, 
alliance, or respect from foreign powers. 

After a studied contempt of the power of our 
enemy, which has marked the progress of our con- 
test, too great a dependence on foreign succour claims 
a rank in our political errors. I speak of the public 
opinion, exempting Congress, as I ought, from a share 
in this folly. Charmed with a revolution so friendly 
to the rights of human nature, and so humbling to 
the insolence of Britain, the people were too apt to 
imagine that the coffers of Europe would be emptied 
into our lap without reserve. But, to say nothing 
of the Dutch, experience has shown that the Spa- 
niards, on whom w^e principally relied, are not to be 
moved by disinterested considerations. That Cabinet 
does not imitate the French in liberality. They view 
the contiguity of those States to the source of their 
treasures, and their rising greatness, with a sufficient 
degree of jealousy. They are cautious of our alliance, 
unless they can acquire solid advantages. They are 
courted by England, and tempted by offers which, 
though they cannot accept without sacrificing their 
honor, their flimily compact, and the esteem of the 
northern powers, they yet seem to countenance, as a 
means to lead us to concessions, of which we cannot 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 173 

tliink without reluctance. On no other principle is 
Cumbeiiand's residence at Madrid, or the dilatoriness 
which has accompanied the treaty, to be reconciled. 
With respect to a loan, if their inclination was ever 
so prompt, it appears to me either that their funds 
are not productive, or that their economy is even 
w^orse than our own. They might, however, interpose 
their responsibility, as they have already done for 
the bills which we have drawn and for the clothing 
W'hich they have supplied; and it would afford us 
essential relief These hints will open another field 
of embarrassment, the extent of which your Excel- 
lency will fully perceive. 

I shall only add to the catalogue, that we have 
advice that Sir Henry Clinton has written to his 
Court for a strong reenforcement, or leave to retire 
from his command ; that he has received an approba- 
tion of his conduct in flattering terms, and a promise 
of support; and that orders are accordingly issued for 
raising a regiment of cavalry and nine of infantry. 

But, while we are called upon to examine our own 
circumstances with candor, lest we should be deceiv- 
ed by a false estimate, our enemies, it is evident, do 
not repose on a bed of roses. They continue to be 
disturbed by the spirit of independence w^hich per- 
vades Ireland. The Commons of that kingdom lately 
hesitated to agree to a duty, amounting to a prohi- 
bition on raw sugars from England. Yelverton, their 
patriot, declared that the Irish trade should, in all 
respects, be upon a perfect equality with the British. 
He rejected the idea of a disparity between the sis- 
ter kingdoms with contempt, and threatened the cour- 
tiers that, if they persisted in their opposition, he 
would put himself at the head of the associators, and 
establish the freedom of commerce by arms. This is 



174 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON, 

an argument whicli carries conviction. Strange that 
in Ireland it should be consistent with loyalty, and 
in America be branded with the appellation of rebel- 
lion, and under that absurd idea serve to color over 
every species of inhumanity and vengeance. 

In the West Indies, from the late destructive hur- 
ricane, and on the ocean, by a train of capital losses, 
the enemy have suffered most severely, and in the 
tenderest point, their trade, the source of their wealth 
and credit. Their internal dissensions, which, instead 
of being extinguished, are only smothered by the 
vigor which the temerity of Gordon threw into the 
scale of their Government, is a malady which hangs 
heavy upon their Administration. The Convention of 
the neutral maritime powers, which has aimed a fatal 
blow at the sovereignty of the British flag, and the 
imminent danger of their being involved in a war 
with Russia, Denmark, Sweden, and Holland, if they 
persist in a claim so odious, and of drawing down 
the resentment of their own subjects and universal 
contempt, if they relinquish it ; the late insult, offered 
them by Portugal, in shutting their ports against 
their ships of war and prizes ; the impracticability of 
their raising more troops in Germany; the favorable 
light in which our independence is viewed through- 
out Europe, and the evident satisfaction it gives even 
the princes, on whom they most relied, to see the 
British dominion, commerce, and naval strength cir- 
cumscribed; their disappointment in not being able, 
by the most disgraceful sacrifices, to detach Spain 
from the war; their failure in Avays and means the 
present year; the immensity of their national debt 
and current expenditures; — all these circumstances, 
combined with the necessity of renewing their pre- 
parations to oppose the belligerent powers at the 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 175 

very moment they looked for submission from Ame- 
rica, are more than sufficient to form a contrast be- 
tween us and our enemies, by no means to our dis- 
advantage ; nor does it seem presumptuous to think 
that, if we endeavour to deserve the blessing, peace, 
liberty, and independence must, before long, crown 
our wishes. 

I have drawn this letter to an immoderate leno-th. 
Ascribe it to a desire of possessing you of my own 
view of our public affairs, as far as I am at liberty. 

I will only add that the visit of the French noble- 
men has given pleasure. The Chevalier, particularly, 
recommends himself by his agreeable manners and 
literary accomplishments. Be pleased to pay my 
most respectful compliments to Mrs. Washington. I 
was greatly mortified at her passing through this 
town without my knowledge, as I wished to have 
done myself the honor of attending her to Trenton. 

I have the honor to be, &c., 

James Duane. 

P. S. Your Excellency has remarked that the 
communications, with which you honored me on the 
arrangement of the army, hospitals, &c., have had 
their effect. 



FROM GOVERNOR JEFFERSON. 

Richmond, 13 December, 1780. 

Sir, 

I had the honor of writing to your Excellency on 
the subject of an expedition contemplated by this 
State against the British post at Detroit, and of re- 
ceiving your answer of October 10th. Since the date 



176 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

of my letter tlie face of things lias so far changed, 
as to leave it no longer optional in us to attempt or 
to decline the expedition, but compels us to decide 
iu the affirmative, and to begin our preparations im- 
mediately. 

The army the enemy at present have in the south, 
the reenforcements still expected there, and their de- 
termination to direct their future exertions to that 
quarter, are not unknown to you. The regular force 
proposed, on our part, to counteract those exertions, 
is such, either from the real or supposed inability of 
this State, as by no means to allow a hope that it 
may be effectual. It is therefore to be expected that 
the scene of war • will be either within our country, 
or very nearly advanced to it, and {hat our princi- 
pal dependence is to be on militia; for which reason 
it becomes incumbent to keep as great a proportion 
of our people as possible free to act in that quarter. 

In the mean time a combination is forming in the 
westward, which, if not diverted, will call thither a 
principal and most valuable part of our militia. From 
intelligence received, we have reason to expect that 
a confederacy of British and Indians, to the amount 
of two thousand men, is formed for the purpose of 
spreading destruction and dismay through the whole 
extent of our frontier, in the ensuing spring. Should 
this take place, we shall certainly lose in the south 
all aids of militia from beyond the Blue Ridge, besides 
the inhabitants who must fall a sacrifice in the course 
of the savage irruptions. There seems to be but one 
method of preventing this, which is, to give the west- 
ern enemy employment in their own country. The re- 
gular force Colonel Clark already has, Avith a proper 
draft from the militia beyond the Alleghany, and 
that of three or four of our most northern counties,

will be adequate to the reduction of Fort Detroit, 
in the opinion of Colonel Clark; and he assigns the 
most probable reasons for that opinion. We have, 
therefore, determined to undertake, and to commit it 
to his direction. Whether the enterprise shall be at 
Continental or State expense, we will leave to be de- 
cided by Congress hereafter, in whose justice we can 
confide, as to the determination. In the mean time, 
we only ask the loan of such necessaries as, being 
already at Fort Pitt, will save time and an immense 
expense of transportation. These are, four field-pieces, 
six-pounders ; three thousand balls suited to them ; 
one mortar ; three thousand shells suited to it ; two 
howitzers; grape-shot; necessary implements and fur- 
niture for the above; one thousand spades; two hun- 
dred pickaxes; one travelling forge; some boats ready 
made, should we not have enough prepared in time ; 
some ship-carpenter's tools. 

These articles shall be either identically or speci- 
fically returned, should we prove successful. It is 
not improbable they may be where Congress would 
choose to keep them. I am therefore to solicit your 
Excellency's order to the Commandant at Fort Pitt, 
for the above articles, which shall not be called for 
until every thing is in readiness, after which there 
can be no danger of their being wanted for the post 
at which they are. Indeed there are few of the ar- 
ticles essential for the defence of the post. 

I hope 3"our Excellency will think yourself justi- 
fied in lending us this aid, without awaiting the effect 
of an application elsewhere, as such a delay would 
render the undertaking abortive, by postponing it to 
the breaking up of the ice on the Lake. Independ- 
ently of the favorable effect which a successful enter- 
prise against Detroit must produce to the United 



178 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

States in general, by keeping in quiet the frontier 
of the northern ones, and leaving our western militia 
at leisure to aid those of the south, we think the 
like friendly office performed by us to the States, 
whenever desired, and almost to the absolute exhaus- 
tion of our own magazines, give well-founded hopes 
that we may be accommodated on this occasion. The 
supplies of military stores which have been furnished 
by us to Fort Pitt itself, to the Northern army, and, 
most of all, to the Southern, are not altogether un- 
known to you. I am the more urgent for an imme- 
diate order, because Colonel Clark awaits here your 
Excellency's answer by the expresses, though his pre- 
sence in the western country, to make preparations 
for the expedition, if you enable us to undertake it, 
is so very necessary. 

To the above, I must add a request to you, to 
send for us to Pittsburg persons proper to work the 
mortars and howitzers, as Colonel Clark has none 
such, nor is there one in this State. They shall be 
in the pay of this State from the time they leave 
you. Any money necessary for their journey shall 
be repaid at Pittsburg, on their arrival there, or shall 
be paid here on demand. They should be at Pitts- 
burg, without fail, by the 1st of March. 

At the desire of the General Assembly, I take the 
li*berty of transmitting to you the inclosed resolution ; 
and have the honor to be, with the most perfect 
esteem and regard, your Excellency's 

Most obedient and humble servant, 

Thomas Jefferson. 



THE AMERICAN EEVOLUTION. 179 

FROM GOVERNOR NASH. 

Newbern, 14 December, 1780. 

Sir, 

I have just had the honor to receive your Excel- 
lency's favor of the 6th ultimo. Your favors by JNIa- 
jor-General Greene I did myself the honor to answer 
some time ago, and expressed how much the South- 
ern States were indebted to you for your attention 
shown to their interests, and the appointment of the 
General to the command here ; and have no doubt he 
will effect every advantage for us that we may enable 
him to do. At the same time I must observe, that 
the provision hitherto made by the Assembly of this 
State, in particular for the support of an army, is so 
inadequate, and the steps taken with regard to the 
currency and other matters of the greatest conse- 
quence, so void of policy, that I fear much distress 
must yet be endured before we shall become suffi- 
ciently wise for our own interests. The resolutions 
of Congress for filling up our Continental battalions, 
I have repeatedly, and in the most pressing manner, 
recommended to their attention; and have had the 
mortification, as yet, to find nothing effectual done. 
I hope your Excellency's letter to me on this sub- 
ject, which I shall have the honor of laying before 
them in a few days, will move the Assembly to do 
something suitable to their rank as a sovereign State, 
and indeed absolutely necessary to their political ex- 
istence. Of all their acts, respecting the great object 
of defence, I shall not fail to acquaint your Excel- 
lency as soon as I am afforded an opportunity. 

Since the affair of Ferguson's defeat, which did the 
highest honor to the militia concerned in it, I hear 
the noted Colonel Tarleton has been defeated by an- 



180 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

other party of militia, under the command of General 
Sumpter. The Board of War writes me, that in this 
action the British lost ninety men killed, and seventy 
taken prisoners ; and that Tarleton himself was wound- 
ed, in two places, through the body, and his thigh 
broken. I have had the same accounts from gentle- 
men in different parts of the country; but, having it 
not from camp, I dare not give it as fact, though I 
much believe it. 

I have not heard a word of the enemy landed in 
Virginia since they left that country. Immediately 
on their departure, I sent express to General Small- 
wood, to put him on his guard. The enemy have 
not been entirely free of trouble off Charleston, and 
on the coast in that quarter. During this summer, 
they have suffered very considerably by our priva- 
teers, particularly by open row-boats. These boats, 
with forty or fifty men on board, take almost every 
thing that comes in their wa}'. Two, who went in 
company, returned here this w^eek, after a cruise of 
about twenty days, in which time they took and sent 
in twelve valuable prizes, besides burning, I think, 
four. They also did another important service ; they 
landed in Georgia and took off a Mr. Young, the 
richest man and greatest Tory in that country, ex- 
cept the Governor. They also brought off a consi- 
derable number of his negroes. This Mr. Young is 
now a prisoner here. The action is exclaimed against 
by some moderate men. However, as it is exactly in 
the line of retaliation, I shall not fail to encourage 
it, unless I should be overruled. 

There has been, lately, a second transportation of 
Charleston citizens to St. Augustine. Among these 
is Mr. ]Middleton, the younger. Even the ladies do 
not escape their vengeance. Mrs. Kinloch and Mrs. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 181 

Ben. Huger have written to me of their distresses. 
For the offence of permitting Mr, Pendleton, who es- 
caped from Charleston, to stay a night in their house, 
they have been taken from their plantation at Wac- 
camaw, and carried prisoners to Charleston, where 
they are now confined, and reduced from a state of 
the greatest affluence to want; and, to embitter the 
condition of Mrs. Huger (the lady of Major Huger, 
who fell in the siege of Charleston), she has lost two 
of her small children since she was separated from 
them, probably for want of care. But what I have 
mentioned are trifles, compared to their daily enormi- 
ties. 

I shall, on all occasions, think myself highly ho- 
nored in hearing from your Excellency ; and shall not 
Ml, from time to time, giving you such intelligence 
as I shall think it necessary for our Commander-in- 
chief to know. 

And I have the honor to be, &c., 

Abner Nash. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LINCOLN. 

Boston, 25 December, 1<80. 

My dear General, 
I was, in the evening of the 23d, honored with 
your Excellency's favor of the 11th. No measure 
has been left untried to save the question for filling 
up our battalions for the war; but every attempt of 
its abettors for that purpose (and many there were 
in the Assembly) proved abortive. The following 
short anecdote will point your Excellency to some, 
and, I think, the principal reasons on which the 
question was lost. A venerable gray-headed old gen- 
tleman, who has lost two sons in the war, rose in 

VOL. in. 16 



182 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

the Assembly, and observed that the army must be 
filled up, and by our own children, who were afraid 
of becoming slaves, which they supposed might be 
the case if they engaged for the war. "We have," 
continued the old gentleman, " sons now grown up, 
who will readily engage for three years, and, by the 
time their services shall expire, others, now young, 
will be ready to take their places." These ideas so 
fully possessed the minds of the country members, 
that they supposed every attempt to fill up the army 
for the war would be ineffectual, serve only to waste 
the time, and probably prevent its being done, even 
for three years. 

Though I am myself convinced that the measure is 
wrong, and that we had better have tried to have 
raised part of the number in the fi^rst place, and 
those for the war, yet I have the pleasing satisfac- 
tion to be fully convinced that those who were of a 
different opinion acted from the purest motives, and 
the fullest conviction that it was the most elioible. 
Notwithstanding the vote passed to raise the men 
for three years, or for the war, yet I have great 
hopes, from the encouragement given to them to en- 
gage for the war, in addition to the sum to be given 
for a three years' enlistment, and. from the disposi- 
tion I find in the seaports in favor of the former 
measure, that great exertions will be made by them 
and others to carry it into execution. Indeed, this 
town has already secured about one third of its men 
for this term, and expect thus to secure the re- 
mainder. 

The Assembly meets next week ; and, if there is 
the most distant prospect that, on a revival of the 
question, it will share a different fate from its last, 
I am positive it will be renewed. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 183 

By looking back into the state of onr finances, 
and forward to the expenses which will necessarily 
be incurred the next campaign, it is found that part 
of them must be provided for by direct borrowing. 
This, I think, will have a very happy effect ; for, be- 
fore we can be again trusted, we must rescind some 
former resolutions, which have not given all that pro- 
tection and support to creditors which, perhaps, the 
Legislative body intended they should give ; and 
adopt an enlarged system of politics, pregnant with 
the highest justice, the most permanent security to 
individuals. This will give dignity to Government, 
array the Legislature with confidence, and clothe the 
Executive with strength and vigor ; for a govern- 
ment whose resolutions are equal will as certainly 
find support, as that men regard, and steadily pur- 
sue, their own happiness. 

I am much surprised to hear that there is so scan- 
ty an allowance of clothing in camp, as we have had, 
for so long a time, not only a good supply on hand 
in Europe and the West Indies, but, as I have the 
greatest reason to believe, a sufficiency of clothes 
within this State, brought in by our privateers, to 
clothe our army at any time within these five months 
past, five times over. Our finances, I know, are in a 
miserable situation; but I cannot believe that those 
of the several States are in so ruinous a condition 
as to prevent the purchase of so necessary an arti- 
cle. 

Though it always gives me pain to offer a senti- 
ment, which may in the least cast a censure upon 
Congress, for I know they are embarrassed, and are 
not supported as the best good of the public evi- 
dently dictates, yet I cannot but suggest my belief, 
that the want of proper arrangements, in some degree 



184 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

occasioned those distresses of our army, consequent 
upon a want of clothing. Either the Continental 
agents should purchase the whole for the army at 
large, or the several States should be left entirely to 
clothe their own troops, without the least interference 
of the agents; for, so long as it is the joint business 
of the agents and the respective States, a mutual re- 
liance will occasion a failure of exertion in each. 
The former method is much to be preferred, because 
there would be a greater uniformity in the clothing 
of the troops, which will, among other conveniences, 
serve to prevent the existence of jealousies, arising 
from an apprehension of different usage. If an idea 
has ever been held up, that the Continental army is 
but the union of thirteen different armies, having dif- 
ferent interests, and, in some degree, different pur- 
suits, and of course, that good policy requires that 
each State should secure the affections of their own 
troops, and attach them to her particular interest, 
every step I wish might be taken to bury the sen- 
timent in oblivion, and every measure tending to sup- 
port it, if another can as conveniently be adopted, be 
by no means executed. 

This, then, will stand as another reason why the 
Continent should clothe the troops of the respective 
States, or rather their own army. The business of 
clothing the army is exceedingly loose and irregular, 
so far that this State, even at this late hour, are un- 
certain, whether Congress expect that they are to 
clothe their own troops, independent of them, or not. 
As it is a matter of great importance, I hope Con- 
gress will be explicit and decided on this point. It 
is particularly necessary that they should be so, as it 
is supposed, here, that the late requisition of Congress 
for the specific articles and cash, together with what 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 185 

they draw from the new emission, is the whole de- 
mand on this State ; and, as I said before, part of 
this expense must be provided for b}'' borrowing. 
Should Congress think it most expedient that this 
State, or the several States, should clothe their own 
troops and credit them for the expense, in the pre- 
sent requisition, I am confident that if they give 
orders to this State for this purpose, they will be 
immediately executed. 

Colonel Henly assures me, that the goods are here, 
and that an immediate supply for the whole army 
can be obtained. Some have been oiTered him on 
credit. He has no orders to purchase. 

To clothe all the troops of the Continent can now, 
I think, be easily effected. The inclosed wdll show 
your Excellency, what quantity of clothing has been 
lately sent on, and what remains on hand. I hope 
the matter will not be delayed a single moment, from 
an expectation of our receiving what we have in Eu- 
rope, or the West Indies. The danger of the seas, 
and the risk of capture, are too great to justify the 
least suspension. Indeed, was it to arrive at the hour 
of our procuring a full supply, should we even then 
have more on hand than sound policy would direct? 
I believe not; but am rather of opinion that a pro- 
vident people, under our circumstances, would store 
three times the quantity. If, on the whole, we should 
be ordered to clothe our own troops, I wish your 
Excellency's directions whether, if it can soon be 
effected, the recruits should be detained in the mean 
time, or marched on, without delay, to camp. In either 
case, I conceive it will be necessary to send a number 
of officers to Springfield, and to this town, as those 
will probably be the two principal places at which 

16* 



186 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

the troops will rendezvous; for, if we mean to keep 
them from straggling, marauding, and wasting their 
time, they must be sent in bodies under proper 
officers. It appears to me, that it will be also neces- 
sary to detain some of the arms now here and which 
are ordered on, to be put into the hands of those on 
whom we can depend. They will serve as a guard 
to others of a different character. 

The General Court have ordered, to each man, one 
dollar a mile, to enable him to march to camp ; but 
it is so far short of the real expense, that it will 
answer no valuable purpose. Indeed, if it was ade- 
quate, I think no good would arise from the measure ; 
for, I am confident, the men Avill not be got to camp 
unless they are marched under the care of proper 
officers, and diffijrent magazines established on the 
route, at which the men can be regularly supplied. 
I think there should be one in this town, one in 
Worcester, one in Springfield, and one in Litchfield. 
If your Excellency should be of opinion that the 
measure is necessary, I wish you would suggest it 
to the Governor, who, ever disposed to do right, 
doubts the propriety of his ordering these magazines 
from the specific articles called for by Congress. If 
these are not taken, it will be difficult to establish 
them. 

There are some matters to be attended to here, in 
the military way, which seem to be the particular 
business of your Excellency, as Commander-in-chief, 
or the Commanding Officer in a separate department. 
Am I, Sir, as senior officer here, competent to such 
business ? If I am not, and further powers from 
your Excellency should be necessary, and you should 
think proper to grant them, I hope, if it can be 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 187 

avoided, an idea of my being Commanding Officer in 
this department will not be held up. 

I have the honor to be, &c., 

Benjamin Lixcolx. 



FROM GOVERNOR RETLEDGE. 

Chei'aw, on Pedee River, 
in South Carolina, 28 December, 1780. 

Dear Sir, 

I received your Excellency's letter of September 
12th, about the latter end of October; and should 
ere now have transmitted to you an account of the 
several matters which you desired to know, if I could 
have obtained an authentic one ; but I have never 
been able to procure such information, even of the 
enemy's force and posts, as I conceived to be so, till 
lately. That, I communicated to General Greene, 
who, I doubt not, made you acquainted with it. In- 
closed is a state of their strength and posts at pre- 
sent, and an answer to the several questions proposed 
by your letter. 

I presume your Excellency will receive from Gene- 
ral Greene, by this opportunity, a return of the troops 
under his command. It is therefore unnecessary for 
me to say any thing on that head. But I cannot 
avoid lamenting that they are so few, and that I do 
not see the probability of their being soon much in- 
creased. 

I am sorry that circumstances have not admitted 
of your detaching, to the southward, any force from 
the main army, or from the troops of his most Christ- 
ian Majesty; and I fear that the effects of the ene- 
my's possessing the two southernmost States much 
longer, will be altogether ruinous to many individuals 



188 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

(some of whom are already reduced to the greatest 
misery and distress), and injurious to the common 
cause. Several, "whose characters were much respect- 
ed, have declared themselves British subjects ; many 
others will soon follow their example, unless we 
speedily receive considerable aid. The unfortunate 
affair near Camden ; the want of support ever since 
(for there has not been a Continental soldier in the 
State since that defeat, till within these three days); 
the little prospect of any; and the representation 
made by the enemy, of the inability or unwilliness 
of the other States to send any powerful aid, — have 
chagrined, and made unfavorable impressions on many, 
who Avere formerly our good friends. 

Some of the stanch inhabitants of Charleston have 
been lately sent to St. Augustine, and others are to 
follow. The enemy have hanged many people, who, 
from fear, or the impracticability of removing, had 
received protections or given paroles, and, from at- 
tachment to, had afterwards taken part with us. 
They have burnt a great number of houses, and turn- 
ed many women, formerly of good fortune, wdth their 
children (whom their husbands or parents, from an un- 
willingness to join the enemy, had left), almost naked, 
into the woods. In short, they seem determined to 
break the spirit of every man, if they can, or to ruin 
him. Their cruelties, and the distresses of the people 
are indeed beyond description. I entreat your Ex- 
cellency, therefore, seriously to consider the unhappy 
state of South Carolina and Georgia ; and I rely on 
your humanity and on your knowledge of their im- 
portance to the Union, for such speedy and effectual 
support, as may compel the enemy to evacuate every 
part of these countries. 

I have pressed the Governor, and several members 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 189 

of the Legislature of North Carolina, to raise its 
complement of Continental troops, according to the 
last requisition of Congress and the present arrange- 
ment of the army; and I am certain that Virginia 
and North Carolina mighty with proper exertions, soon 
bring five thousand such troops into the field. But 
I fear that North Carolina will persevere in her old 
plan of drafting militia for that service, and am per- 
suaded that no other recommendation or influence 
than yours, will prevail on Virginia to relinc^uish the 
same system, and to raise a respectable number of 
troops for the war. 

I have the honor to be, &c., 

John Rutledge. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Camp at the Cheraw, on the East side of Pedee, 
28 December, 1780. 

Sir, 
In my last despatches, of the 7th instant, I inform- 
ed your Excellency of my arrival at camp, and of 
the condition and situation of the arni}^. I was ap- 
prehensive, on my first arrival, that the country 
around Charlotte was too much exhausted to afford 
subsistence for the army at that place for any consi- 
derable time. Upon a little further inquiry, I was 
fully convinced, and immediately despatched Colonel 
Kosciuszko, to look out a position on the Pedee, 
that would afford a healthy camp and provisions in 
plenty. His report was favorable, and I immediately 
put the army under marching orders ; but the exces- 
sive rains, which continued eleven days, prevented our 
marching till the 20th instant. We arrived here the 



190 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

2Gtli, having performed the march with incredible 
difficulty, through a barren country, with wagons and 
horses altogether unfit for service. The probability 
that my taking this position would discourage the 
enemy from attempting to possess themselves of Cross 
Creek, which would have given them command of the 
greatest part of the provisions in the lower country, 
was another inducement to come to this place. It is 
also a camp of repose ; and no army ever wanted one 
more, the troops having totally lost their discipline. 

Before I left Charlotte, I detached three hundred 
of our best troops, and Lieutenant-Colonel Washing- 
ton's regiment of lio'ht dragoons, under the command 
of General Morgan, with orders to take a position on 
the south side of the Catawba, near the fork of Broad 
River, where he was to be joined by three hundred 
volunteers, under General Davidson, and four or five 
hundred South Carolina and Georgia militia, under 
the command of Colonel Clark and Colonel Few. 
With this party, he is either to act upon the offen- 
sive or defensive, as occasion may warrant. This 
will straiten the enem}^ in their limits, and prevent 
their drawing supplies from the upper country. It 
will also give spirits to the inhabitants of that quar- 
ter, and enable them to form a number of small ma- 
gazines in the rear of the troops (which General 
JNIorgan has particularly in charge), that we may have 
somethino; to subsist on should we be able to advance 
hereafter in force. 

Lord Cornwallis continues in the same position that 
he Avas when I wrote before, and General Leslie ar- 
rived off Charleston Bar the 14th ; but whether he 
has landed any of his troops, I am not informed. 
The troops, mentioned to have arrived in my former 
letter, were only some recruits that came in with 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 191 

provision vessels, not exceeding four or five liundrecl 

men. 

General Gates left tlie aroiy the 10th, and General 
Smallwood the 19th instant. The latter is gone to 
Maryland, with a view of forwarding the troops and 
supplies from that State, and to settle the matter 
with Congress respecting his right of promotion, be- 
ins determined not to submit to the command of the 
Baron de Steuben, who is still in Virginia, very use- 
fully employed in forming, and forwarding the troops 
from that State. 

I have been obliged to send Major Nelson's corps 
of horse and Colonel Armand's legion to Virginia, 
both being unfit for duty, for want of clothing and 
other equipments ; and the difficulty of subsisting 
them is much greater here than there. Before my 
arrival. General Gates made an attempt to employ 
part of Colonel Armand's legion, and fifteen of them 
deserted on the march from Hillsborough to Char- 
lotte, which obliged him to recall them. I wish your 
Excetlency's directions respecting this corps, as they 
are totally deranged, and cannot be fit for service for 
some time. 

Two slight skirmishes have been fought with the 
enemy, since my last, one by a party under Colonel 
Marion, upon the Santee, and the other by Colonel 
Few, near Ninety Six. About twenty or thirty were 
killed and wounded on each side. 

I w^ill not pain your Excellency with further ac- 
counts of the wants and sufferings of this army ; but 
I am not without great apprehension of its entire 
dissolution, unless the Commissary's and Quarter-mas- 
ter's departments can be rendered more competent to 
the demands of the service. Nor are the Clothing 
and Hospital departments upon a better footing. Not

without straw. I am, &c.,

P. S. This moment accounts have been received 
that General Leslie landed his troops at Charleston 
on the 21st instant, and, on the 24th, was at Monk's 
Corner, on his way to Nelson's Ferry. 

The Cherokee Indians have murdered a number of 
the inhabitants on the frontiers of North Carolina. It 
is said the militia have marched against their lower 
towns. 



FROM BRIG.iDIER-GENERAL WAYNE. 

Mount Kemble, 2 January, 1781. 

Dear General, 

The most general and unhappy mutiny suddenly 
took place in the Pennsylvania line, about nine 
o'clock last night. It yet subsists. A great propor- 
tion of the troops, with some artillery, are marching 
towards Philadelphia. 

Every exertion has been used by the ojQ&cers to 
divide them in their determination to revolt. It has 
succeeded, in a temporary manner, with near one 
half How long it will last, God knows ! I have or- 
dered the Jersey brigade to Chatham, where the mili- 
tia are also assembled, lest the enemy should take 
advantage of this alarming crisis. Indeed, the alarm- 
guns have been fired, and the beacons kindled, 
towards Elizabethtown ; perhaps it was occasioned 
by our unhappy affair. I am, this moment, with 
Colonels Butler and Stewart, taking horse to try to 
halt those on their march towards Princeton. As a 



THE AMEllICAN REVOLUTION. 19

last resort, I am advised to collect them, and move 
on slowly towards Pennsylvania. 

What their temper may he, I cannot tell. We 
had our escapes last night. Perhaps we may he 
equally fortunate to-day. If not, adieu, my dear Ge- 
neral, and helieve me 

Yours, most affectionately, 

Anthony Wayne. 

P. S. Captain Billings is killed ; Captain Talbot, 
mortally wounded ; some others are also hurt. Major 
Fishbourn, who carries this, will be able to give you 
a particular account of last night's and this morning's 
transactions. I am happy to inform you that not an 
officer was absent on this occasion, nor have any of 
the soldiers gone towards the enemy. Their general 
cry is, to be discharged, and that they will again en- 
list, and fight for America, a few excepted. Gene- 
ral Potter and Colonel Johnson, wdio were eye-wit- 
nesses of the W'hole, as far as it is yet gone, go

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL HEATH. 

Garrison, West Point, 7 o'clock P. M. ; 
C January, 1781. 

Dear General, 
The inclosed this moment came to hand, which I 
beg to submit to your Excellency. Tliis wall be for- 
warded at gun-firing in the morning. I detain the 
express, and wish your answer, if agreeable, by the 
return of the bearer, that Colonel Hull may have no- 
tice as early as possible. Colonel Thomas mentioned 
the matter in a letter to me yesterdays but, as it

did not come from Colonel Hull, I took no notice of 
it. If the plan should be approved, it will probably 
be necessary to furnish the militia with some ammu- 
nition. As to burning the houses at Morrisania, al- 
though they are a nest for the nefarious enemy, yet, 
as many of them belong to persons friendly to our 
cause, who have been obliged to abandon their habi- 
tations, it may not only be impolitic but injurious to 
do it. However, I will advise as your Excellency 
may think fit to direct. 

I must confess, I do not well like the militia hav- 
ing so much to do in the matter. Notifying and 
collecting men from three regiments, among whom 
many disaffected persons reside, and upon the very 
line of the enemy, is very likely to give air of the 
design; and a knowledge of the design will tend to 
blow the whole. I have the honor to be, with the 
greatest respect, 

Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

William Heath. 



FROM JOHN SULLIVAN.* 

Trenton, 7 January, 1781. 

Sir, 
The Committee appointed by Congress to quiet the 
disturbances of the Pennsylvania line, &c., think it 
proper to inform your Excellency that they arrived 
at this place last night, after dark; and that Presi- 
dent Reed, who acts in concert with us, has pro- 
ceeded to the neighbourhood of Princeton, at which 
place those troops are now posted. We are happy

to inform your Excellency, that some favorable ap- 
pearances of a speedy and honorable, as well as a 
safe, accommodation have appeared in their conduct 
this morning, as they have given an earnest of their 
sincerity and intentions, by no means equivocal, by 
seizing a negotiator, sent to them from New York, 
together with his conductor, both of whom they de- 
livered up to General Wayne, and have sent them 
out, under a guard, with their papers. They are ac- 
tually now in the hands of President Reed; and we 
do ourselves the honor of sending your Excellency a 
copy of the terms offered them, in writing, by those 
emissaries. Should your Excellency have any com- 
munications to make to Congress relative to the pre- 
sent state and temper of the army, we request that 
you will be pleased to make them through us, and 
direct them to this place. I am, with the highest 
and the most sincere esteem and regard, your Ex- 
cellency's 

Most obedient and humble servant, 

John Sullivan. 
By order of the Committee. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL ST. CLAIR. 

Morristown, 7 January, 1781. 

Sir, 

Your Excellency has heard of the shameful defec- 
tion of the Penns^dvania line; and I am very much 
concerned to inform you that, as yet, there is no 
prospect, that we know of, of any desire appearing 
in them to return to their duty. I happened to be 
in Philadelphia the day the accounts of it arrived 



196 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

there, and set out early next morning, in company 
with the INIarquis de Lafayette, to make trial of what 
influence we might have; but, though we were suf- 
fered to come into Princeton, and there was an ap- 
pearance of satisfaction in the countenance of the 
troops, w^e were not allow^ed to have any communica- 
tion with them. A Committee of Sergeants, who are 
doubtless at the bottom of the whole, have got the 
business into their own hands; and no person is al- 
lowed to speak to the soldiery, but through them. 

Their demands are no less than an almost total 
dissolution of the line. They are, to the best of my 
recollection, — the discharge of all those who have 
been enlisted in the years 1777 and '78, and who 
received the bounty of twenty and one hundred and 
twenty dollars ; immediate payment of their arrears 
and depreciation; and a general indemnity. General 
Wayne, in answer to those demands, made them such 
promises as ought to have satisfied reasonable men, 
looking only for redress of grievances, whether real 
or imaginary ; but they were rejected ; so that I have 
no doubt but emissaries from the enemy are amongst 
them, and believe that nothing but force will reduce 
them to reason. Unhappily, however, there seems to 
be no disposition in the militia of this State to 
come to that method; and it was the opinion of the 
Governor, and such members of the Legislature as 
we saw at Trenton, that they should be suffered 
to pass the Delaware. This I informed Governor 
Reed of, from that place, that he might have time to 
take the proper measures ; but they seem disposed 
to keep post at Princeton. Whilst we were at the 
last place, Colonel Laurens came up, and we very 
soon after received a notice that our being in town 
was very disagreeable, and desiring us, for our own 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 197 

safety, to retire; and our stay was afterwards limited 
to an hour and a half As we had no prospect of 
being of service, we set off, lest they should think 
of detaining us. We have since heard that they have 
made General Wayne, Colonels Butler, and Stewart, 
prisoners ; hut the most alarming circumstance is, 
( their having organized themselves, and appointed all 
the necessary officers. 

There are still a few men at the huts, to whom I 
have sent this morning, with an assurance that they 
will he considered principally in whatever may be 
done for the line at large, and have directed that 
they may be collected and marched to Persipenny, to 
render their communication with the revolters more 
difficult ; and have given directions for removing the 
remaining artillery and ammunition to Luckysunny. 

We were unfortunate to miss Major Fishbourn, 
and have no knowledge of your Excellency's inten- 
tions. I thought it probable that you might have 
come down to this place. If that is not your design, 
I beg I may be favored with your Excellency's in- 
structions; and am, with the greatest respect. Sir, 
Your most obedient servant, 

Arthur St. Clair. 

P. S. I have not learned that any movements of 
the enemy indicate an intention to enter Jersey ; yet 
I cannot persuade myself that they will not endea- 
vour to avail themselves of this disaster, though, per- 
haps, they may defer it until it is certain that force 
is necessary. 

After Major Fishbourn's departure from Princeton, 

from a desire expressed by the Committee to confer 

with some of the Council of Pennsylvania, General 

Wayne sent an express to Philadelphia, requesting 

17*

pected to arrive yesterday. 



FROM JOHN SULLIVAN. 

Barclay's House, near Trenton, 
8 o'clock, evening; 10 Januarj-, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 

We are happy to inform your Excellency, that the 
terms offered to the Pennsylvania troops are at length 
finally, and, as we believe, cordially and satisfactorily, 
agreed on ; and, to-morrow, we expect the Pennsylva- 
nia line will be arranged in its former order. Con- 
stitutionally, no concession has been granted them, 
that the critical situation of our affairs did not war- 
rant, and justice dictate. 

As an earnest of their sincerity, they have this 
night sent to us, under a strong guard, the two spies 
sent out by Sir Harry Clinton, with offers of terms 
to them, who are now in this house, under a guard 
of the Philadelphia light-horse; and a Court, consist- 
ing of Generals Wayne and Irvine, and Colonels But- 
ler, Stewart, and Major Pishbourn, are at this moment 
determining their fate. Several other emissaries have 
been sent out by Sir Harry, who have more prudent- 
ly delivered their credentials to us; whether more 
honestly, time will determine. In short, the whole 
progress of this affair, except the first tumult, has 
been conducted, on their part, with a consistency, firm- 
ness, and a degree of policy mixed with candor, that 
must astonish every theorist on the nature of the 
American soldiery, and cover Sir Harry with shame 
and confusion, if not stigmatize him with the appella- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 199 

tiou of the Prince of Blunderers, for having so illy 
succeeded in essays of this kind. 

Commissioners appointed by the Committee of Con- 
gress, consisting of Colonel Atlee, General Potter, 
Mr. Blair, McClaneghan, and Captain Morris, of the 
Philadelphia light-horse, will proceed to-morrow to ad- 
just their claims. 

January Wtli, 8 ddoch^ A. M. The British Emis- 
saries are condemned, and will be executed this morn- 
ing, at nine o'clock. The Commissioners are now 
sitting to determine which of the troops ought to be 
discharged, and which to remain; and we trust this 
day will complete the business. I have the honor to 
be, most respectfully, dear General, 

Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

John Sullivan, Chairman. 

By order of the Committee. 



FROM GOVERNOR JEFFERSON. 

Richmond, 10 January, 1781. 

Sir, 

It may seem odd, considering the important events 
which have taken place in this State within the 
course of ten days past, that I should not have 
transmitted an account of them to your Excellency. 
But such has been their extraordinary rapidity, and 
such the unremitted exertions they have required 
from all concerned in Government, that I do not re- 
collect the portion of time which I could have taken 
to commit them to paper. 

On the 31st of December, a letter from a private 



200 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON 

gentleman to General Nelson, came to my hands, no- 
tifying that, on the morning of the preceding day, 
twenty-seven sail of vessels had entered the Capes ; 
and, from the tenor of the letter, we had reason to 
expect, within a few hours, further intelligence, whe- 
ther they were friends or foes, their force, and other 
circumstances. We immediately despatched General 
Nelson to the lower country, with powers to call on 
the militia in that cjuarter, or to act otherwise as exi- 
gencies should require ; but waited further intelli- 
gence before we would call for militia from the middle 
or upper country. No further intelligence came till 
the 2d instant, when the former was confirmed. It 
was ascertained that they were enemies, and had ad- 
vanced up James River to Wanasqueak Bay. 

All arrangements were immediately taken for call- 
ing in a sufficient body of militia for opposition. In 
the night of the 3d, we received advice that they 
were at anchor opposite Jamestown. We then sup- 
posed Williamsburg to be their object. The wind, 
however, which had hitherto been unfavorable, shifted 
fair, and, the tide being also in their favor, they as- 
cended- the river to Kennon's that evening, and, with 
the next tide, came up to Westover, having on their 
way taken possession of some works we had at 
Hood's, by which two or three of their vessels had 
received some damage, but which were, of necessity, 
abandoned by the small garrison of fifty men placed 
there, on the enemy's landing to invest the works. 
Intelligence of their having quitted the station at 
Jamestown, from which we supposed they meant to 
land for Williamsburg, and that they had got in the 
evening to Kennons, reached us next morning, at five 
o'clock, and was the first indication of their meaning 
to penetrate towards this place or Petersburg. As 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 201 

the orders for drawing militia hither had been given 
but two days, no oj^position was in readiness. Every 
effort was therefore necessary to withdraw the arms 
and other military stores, records, &c., from this place. 
Every effort was accordingly exerted to convey them 
to the foundery, five miles, and to the laboratory, six 
miles above this, till about sunset of that day, when 
we learnt that the enemy had come to an anchor at 
Westover that morning. We then knew that tliis, 
and not Petersburg, was their object, and began to 
carry across the river every thing remaining here, 
and to remove what had been transported to the 
foundery and laboratory, to Westham, the nearest cross- 
ing, seven miles above this place, which operation was 
continued till they had approached very near. 

They marched from Westover at two o'clock in the 
afternoon of the 4th, and entered Richmond at ten 
o'clock in the afternoon of the 5th. A regiment of 
infantry, and about thirty horse, continued on, with- 
out halting, to the foundery. They burnt that, the 
boring-mill, the magazine, and two other houses, and 
proceeded to Westham ; but, nothing being in their 
power there, they retired to Richmond. The next 
morning they burnt some buildings of public, and 
some of private property, with what stores remained 
in them, destroyed a great quantity of private stores, 
and, about twelve o'clock, retired towards Westover, 
where they encamped within the neck the next day. 

The loss sustained is not yet accurately known. 
As far as I have been able to discover, it consisted, 
at this place, of about three hundred muskets, some 
soldiers' clothing to a small amount., some Quarter- 
master's stores, of which one hundred and twenty 
sides of leather was the principal article, part of the 
artificers' tools, and three wagons ; besides which, five 



202 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

brass four-pounders, wliicli we had sunk in the river, 
"were discovered to them, raised and carried off. At 
the foundery we lost the greater part of the papers 
belono-ino- to the Auditor's Office, and of the books 
and papers of the Council Office. About five or six 
tons, as we conjecture, of powder was thrown into 
the canal, of which there will be a considerable sav- 
ing by remanufacturing it. The roof of the foundery 
was burnt, but the stacks of chimneys and furnaces 
not at all injured. The boring-mill was consumed. 
Within less than forty-eight hours from the time of 
their landing, and nineteen from our knowing their 
destination, they had penetrated thirty-three miles, 
done the whole injury, and retired. Their numbers, 
from the best intelligence I have had, are about 
fifteen hundred infantry, and, as to their cavalry, ac- 
counts vary from fifty to one hundred and twenty; 
the whole commanded by the parricide Arnold. 

Our militia, dispersed over a large tract of country, 
can be called in but slowly. On the day the enemy 
advanced to this place, two hundred only were em- 
bodied ; they were of this town and its neighbour- 
hood, and were too few to do any thing. At this 
time, they are assembled in pretty considerable num- 
bers on the south side of James River, but are not 
all yet brought to a point. On the north side, are 
two or three small bodies, amounting, in the whole, 
to about nine hundred men. The enemy were, at four 
o'clock yesterday evening, still remaining in their en- 
campment at Westover and Berkley Neck. In the 
meanwhile Baron Steuben, a zealous friend, has de- 
scended from the dignity of his proper command, to 
direct our smallest movements. His vigilance has, in 
a great measure, supplied the want of force in pre- 
venting the enemy from crossing the river, which 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 20 



o 



might have heen very fatal. He has been assiduously 
employed in preparing equipments for the militia, as 
they should assemble, pointing them to a proper ob- 
ject, and other offices of a good Commander. Should 
they loiter a little longer, and he be able to have a 
sufficient force, I shall flatter myself they will not 
escape with total impunity. To what place they will 
point their next exertions, we cannot even conjecture. 
The whole countrv on the tide waters, and some dis- 
tance from them, is equally open to similar insult. I 
have the honor to be, with every sentiment of respect, 
your Excellency's 

Most obedient and most humble servant, 

Thomas Jefferson. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL BARON STEUBEN. 

Camp, near Hood's, 11 January, 1781. 

Sir, 
I had the honor to address your Excellency the 
8th instant, giving you a detail of what has passed 
down to that date. The enemy, lying still at West- 
over on the 9th, and some vessels which had lain at 
the mouth of the Appamatox, dropping down that 
day to their fleet, I thought it evident they had no 
design against Petersburg, and therefore ordered the 
few militia who were assembled there to march to 
Prince George Court-House, and went there myself, 
that I might be more at hand, to prepare against 
any movement of the enemy. The 10th, in the 
morning, I was informed they were embarking their 
troops; and, on reconnoitring them myself, from Cog- 
gin's Point, I found their embarkation completed, and 
the vessels preparing to sail. 



204 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

It had been found impracticable to remount the 
cannon at Hood's^ or to prepare any obstruction to 
their passing that place. Of this, however, the enemy 
were ignorant ; and, thinking it very probable they 
would land a party to examine those works before 
they attempted to pass, I ordered three hundred in- 
fantry and about thirty horse, under Colonel Clark, 
to lie in ambush to receive them. About 12 o'clock 
the fleet got under way, and at 4 o'clock I saw 
them, from Hood's, come to, within cannon-shot. At 
dark they landed troops from eighteen boats, desert- 
ers (say five hundred), who immediately attacked a 
small picket w^e had, and pursued them to within 
forty paces of the ambuscade, when our troops gave 
them a fire ; but, on their returning it, and charging 
bayonets, the militia immediately fled. After throw- 
ing the cannon into the river, the enemy returned to 
their ships, wdiich, at daylight, were five miles below. 
I ordered three hundred infantry and two troops of 
horse down to Cabin Point, and encamped with the 
remainder, about five hundred men, at this place. As 
an attempt might be made at Williamsburg, and as 
General Nelson had only four hundred men, I ordered 
five hundred and sixty militia, who were then on 
their way to join me, to cross the river and reenforce 
him. The next great object for the enemy being 
Hunter's Works, and the stores at Fredericksburg, I 
wrote the Governor to countermand the militia from 
that quarter. General Weedon had already advanced 
w^ith about three hundred and fifty, as far as Hano- 
ver Court-House, before he received the Governor's 
letter. It is left with him to return or not, accord- 
ing as he, from his knowledge of the force that can 
be collected, may think necessary. 

I cannot yet form any judgment of the future ope- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 205 

rations of the enemy. Should the}'- mean to pillage 
Williamsburg, Nelson's corps may harass, but cannot 
prevent them. If they take possession of Norfolk, I 
shall collect what force is necessary, and endeavour to 
keep them en echec. Or, if they should go into Po- 
tomac, I shall immediately march to form a junction 
with the militia under General Weedon, and cover 
Fredericksburg. 

The militia are coming in from all quarters, but 
without arms, for which they apply to me. I have 
delivered about five hundred we had, belonging to 
the Continent. Those of the State were so scattered, 
in removing them on the alarm, that their officers 
cannot collect them again. The troops have neither 
tents nor camp-kettles. It is impossible to describe 
the situation I am in, in want of every thing ; and 
nothing can be got from the State, rather for want 
of arrangement than any thing else. I am, with the 
greatest respect, Sir, your Excellency's 

Most obedient and most humble servant, 

Steuben. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENER.\JL DICKINSON. 

Hermitage, 12 January, 1781. 

Sir, 

I did myself the honor of forwarding to your Ex- 
cellency two packets from the Committee of Congress, 
which contained every occurrence worth communicat- 
ing, and prevented my addressing your Excellency 
sooner. 

Upon receiving the disagreeable intelligence re- 
specting the Pennsylvania line, I imagined the enemy 
would have taken the advantage of those disturb- 

VOL. III. 18 



206 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

ances, and have thrown a body of troops into this 
State. I therefore thought it prudent to make some 
disposition to receive them, as well as to answer an- 
other obvious purpose. Whilst the Pennsylvanians 
lay at Princeton, I formed a large body of militia 
between them and the Sound, a second at the Bap- 
tist meeting-house in Hopewell, a third at Cross wicks, 
and a fourth at South Amboy. This last body was 
composed of the Monmouth militia. Since their re- 
moval to Trenton, I have ordered those troops from 
the meeting-house and Crosswicks to move on to 
Princeton, where I intend visiting them this day. 
The moment an accommodation takes place between 
the Committee and the insurgents, I shall dismiss 
the militia, unless I should receive your Excellency's 
orders to the contrary, or the enemy (which I do not 
now expect) should make a descent into this State. 

The two spies were executed yesterday, pursuant 
to thek sentence, on a gallows erected just above 
Paddy's Ferry, in Pennsylvania. The execution was 
delayed some time for want of a rope and hangman; 
but, at last, the service was performed by a negro 
boy of Paddy. I was glad to hear this necessary 
business was ended. 

The great work is not yet begun, although Commis- 
sioners are appointed and preparations making. From 
the best information I can procure, I am of opinion 
that about three hundred of them wished to join the 
enemy. They still persist in retaining their arms 
until discharged, which is so absurd a demand it 
cau never be complied with, nor can I think they 
seriously expect a compliance. I wish the matter 
was finally settled. The difficulty of supplying the 
militia with provisions is very great. I use my ut- 
most exertions to draw supplies from our county 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 207 

contractors ; but the scarcity of cash pervades every 
department, and gives me but little reason to expect 
much support from that quarter. Whatever orders 
your Excellency thinks proper to give shall be exe- 
cuted by 

Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

Philemon Dickinson. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Camp, on Pedee, 13 Jauuary, 1781. 

Sir, 

Your Excellency's letter, of the 13th of December, 
came to hand this day. It is true I came to the 
southward in expectation of meeting with difficulties; 
but they far exceed Avhat I had any idea of 

This country is so extensive, and supplies are so 
difficult to obtain, that it is impossible to carry on 
the war any length of time with the militia. The 
waste of stores, and consumption of provision and fo- 
rage, must ruin any nation in the universe, whose 
revenue is not greater than ours. A good army, well 
appointed and supplied, consisting of four or five 
thousand infantry, and about eight hundred or one 
thousand horse, is what is wanted for the defence of 
this country; and without which it must be inevita- 
bly ruined and lost. With such a force, I think the 
country can be defended, wdth the occasional aid of 
the militia, against any force the enemy can main- 
tain in this quarter. Neither they nor we can main- 
tain a great force in this department, unless supplies 
can be had by a water communication. The country 
is so extensive, and there are such great barrens. 



208 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

that the natural strength and resources of these States 
are unequal to the burden of maintaining a very 
large force. 

The militia have ravaged this quarter in such a 
manner, that it will be with the greatest difficulty we 
shall be subsisted. The want of money is a great 
difficulty we meet with in supporting the army ; but 
the want of arrangement is no less an evil than that. 
We have but a very little force in the field, and two 
thirds of them are totally unfit for duty ; and, unless 
clothing arrives soon, I must disband them. I am 
persuaded, unless the States have it in their power 
to levy, equip, and support such an army as I have 
mentioned, these States are inevitably lost. 

The detachment which your Excellency mentions 
as embarking at New York, are arrived at Virginia, 
as I am this day informed by Baron Steuben, and 
are almost as high up James River as Petersburg. 
We have nothing to oppose them there, except the 
militia, and about four hundred eighteen-months' men, 
as rag-o-ed and naked as the Viro;inia blacks. The 
enemy in this quarter are making great preparations 
for an immediate movement. Our troops are in such 
a wretched condition, that we can give them little or 
no opposition. We will do all in our power; but the 
soldiers have no spirits, and it is impossible they 
should, in their present situation. I wish the enemy 
would give us a little more time to prepare ourselves. 
However, I don't intend to be drove out of North 
Carolina if I can possibly avoid it; and, if Virginia 
will furnish the provision I have requested to be de- 
posited upon Roanoke, we will hold one corner, at all 
events. 

Baron Steuben wrote me, that he met with insuper- 
able difficulties in his attempts to arrange the Virgi- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 209 

nia line. I have written to General Scott, at Charles- 
ton, to collect the wishes and intentions of the offi- 
cers in captivity. If there are as many in proportion 
to their numbers, as there are here, who wish to go 
home, there will he few left, I have had the resolu- 
tions of Congress respecting specific supplies, and 
shall make my requisitions accordingly. Inclosed is 
an extract of a letter from General Morgan, confirm- 
ing the account given in his former letter, an ex- 
tract of which is inclosed in my letter to go by Ge- 
neral Duportail, who has been detained a few days 
for want of horses. 

It is my opinion, if the French fleet and army at 
Rhode Island could be induced to push into Chesa- 
peake Bay, they would have it in their power to 
ruin the fleet and army with General Phillips. The 
Southern States are in a critical situation, and great 
exertions and some hazard are necessary to save 
them. This is not only my opinion, but General Du- 
portail's. I am, with great respect. 

Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 

Nathanael Greene. 



FROM GOVERNOR CHITTENDEN. 

Arlington, State of Vermont, 15 January, 1781. 

Sir, 
I am exceedingly unhappy when I view the criti- 
cal situation of the interest of the United States, and 
the great evils which attend the people in this quar- 
ter by the unhappy internal broils and contentions, 
caused by the disputes between them and the several 
adjacent States, which prevent that line of corre- 
spondence with your Excellency necessary to make

the common interest become mutual, and which, I 
am not insensible, puts it out of your Excellency's 
power to hold such correspondence as, I presume, 
from your known humanity and warm attachment to 
the liberties of mankind, would be otherwise granted 
with pleasure. 

Notwithstanding I esteem it my duty to inform 
your Excellency of the perseverance of the inhabit- 
ants of this State in the grand cause of liberty in 
which they have embarked, and of the high estima- 
tion they entertain of your Excellency's eminent ser- 
vices as Commander-in-chief of the American arms 
(not to flatter), I am wanting in language to ex- 
press their feelings. I can only assure your Excel- 
lency that nothing impedes their willingness to sup- 
port your Excellency in the important trust of Com- 
mander-in-chief, at the risk of every thing dear to 
them, but a want of being assured, at the end, of 
sharing equal privileges with the United States. 

It gives me pain to give your Excellency any in- 
telligence which ma}^, in the least, add to your bur- 
den. But duty to my country, and self-preservation, 
make it become necessary to present an official ac- 
count of our situation in this quarter, so far as re- 
spects the interest of the common cause ; for which I 
refer your Excellency to the inclosed letters, which 
are copies of those sent, as therein specified, and will 
give a particular relation of the subject. 

I can only mention further to your Excellency, 
that many prisoners, inhabitants of this State, are in 
the custody of the enemy in Canada; and that, not- 
withstanding we have taken more than three times 
the number from them, it is at present out of our 
power to return equal numbers, having delivered 
prisoners so taken, from time to time, to the United 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 211 

States. We are about settling a cartel for the re- 
demption of our men in Canada, as before mentioned. 
I must, therefore, beg your Excellency's indulgence 
with a sufficient number of prisoners to answer such 
an exchange, should the Commissioners, appointed for 
that purpose, agree. Should this proposal meet your 
Excellency's approbation, a return of the number 
shall be immediately transmitted, and a compliance 
with any reasonable requisition that may be necessary 
to complete a matter so earnestly wished for by. Sir, 
your Excellency's most respectful 

And most obedient, humble servant, 

Thomas Chittenden. 



FROM MESHECH WEARE, PRESIDENT OF NEW ILVMPSHIRE. 

Exeter, 20 January, 1781. 

Sir, 
I am honored with the receipt of your favor of the 
5th instant, by Brigadier-General Knox. Your Ex- 
cellency's exertions and early communications of the 
alarming situation of our army, demand our most 
grateful acknowledgments, at the same time that the 
late revolt and the present critical situation of our 
army, give us the most anxious concern. Our Gene- 
ral Assembly was sitting, when General Knox arrived. 
I immediately laid your letter before them, and Ge- 
neral Knox was pleased to give particular information 
of the circumstances of the revolt and situation of 
our army. The Assembly immediately took the matter 
under consideration, and came to a resolution, imme- 
diately to collect a sum of money to be exchanged 
for hard money, to send forward twenty-four dollars 
for each non-commissioned officer and private in our

sufferings they have been unavoidably exposed to. 
It was thought, by General Knox, that the Xew Eng- 
land States would go into this measure, and that it 
would give greater satisfaction than advancing some 
part of their pay. The money, I have no doubt, will 
be forwarded next week. It is the disposition of the 
General Assembly and people of this State to do 
every thing in their power for the support of the 
army. But we have not the means in our power, so 
much as some others may have. 

I am desired, by the General Assembly, to request 
of your Excellency that, as we have a considerable 
number of men belonging to this State now engaged 
in Colonel Jackson's and Hazen's regiments. Major 
Whitcomb's corps, and sundry other regiments not 
particularly belonging to this State, that such men 
may be turned OA^er to some one of our regiments, 
agreeably to the resolution of Congress, which would 
make it much more convenient in providing for and 
settling with our men. I have the honor to be, with 
every sentiment of esteem and respect. 

Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 

Meshech Weare. 



FROM PHILIP SCHUYLER. 

Albany, 21 January, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 
I embrace the opportunity which is offered me by 
Colonel Hughes to acknowledge the receipt of your 
Excellency's favor of the 10th instant, and most sin- 
cerely sympathize with you on the embarrassments 
which the disagreeable event in Jersey will occasion

you. It is an awful lesson to the States ; and if it 
would produce a serious attention to their situation; 
if it would induce to greater exertions, and hence re- 
lieve you from the variety of difficulties which their 
torpor has occasioned youj if it would evince the ne- 
cessity of parting Avith so much of their sovereignty, 
respectively, as would enable the governing power to 
draw forth the strength and resources of the coun- 
try, — the event would be happy to America. But, if 
only alarmed for the moment, and no adequate means 
are pursued for the future subsistence and pay of 
the army, our cause is lost, unless another system of 
^ government is adopted. 

Impressed with the necessity of lodging competent 
powers somewhere, to prosecute the w^ar with vigor, 
and finding a disposition in the Legislature to second 
my views, I have moved, in Senate, to request of the 
Eastern States to join in a Convention, to be held at 
an early day, for the purpose of settling and adjust- 
ing every difference which may exist with respect to 
boundaries ; to form a perpetual league of incorpora- 
tion, subservient, however, to the common interest of 
all the States ; to invite others to accede to it ; to 
create a new State in this quarter, on conditions to 
be stipulated in such Convention ; to appreciate the 
most effectual means for prosecuting the war with 
vigor; to devise a fund for the redemption of the 
common debts ; to form a permanent and uniform 
system for drawing out the resources of the country, 
that we may not be incessantly exposed to the many 
evils incident on temporary expedients ; and, lastly, 
to invest Congress with powers so extensive as to 
oblige each State to do its duty. 

This motion is not yet decided upon ; but I be- 
lieve it will not meet with much, if any, opposition

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Camp, Pedee, 24 January, 1781. 

Sir, 

My public letter will inform your Excellency of 
the success of the trooj)S under the command of Ge- 
neral Morgan. The event is glorious ; and I am ex- 
ceedingly unhappy that our wretched condition will 
not permit our improving it to the best advantage. 
I shall do all I can, but our prospects are gloomy. 
Our force is small, and daily declining. We have no 
clothing or provisions but what we collect from day 
to day ; and the enemy's late excursion into Virginia 
I apprehend, will cut off our prospects from that 
quarter. I hope your Excellency will repeat your 
letters to Congress upon the necessity of filling the 
army, and forming magazines of provision and forage. 
We never can be fortunate but that it operates to 
our disadvantage ; and above half the pleasure that 
results from the victory is lost in the apprehen- 
sion that it will relax the preparations for the sup- 
port of the war. I wish your Excellency to place 
this event in its true point of light to Congress ; 
that if it stands alone it will be of no consequence, 
but, if properly improved upon, it may have the 
most salutary effects. 

What your Excellency mentioned in your last pri- 
vate letter to me is very just; the Commanding Offi- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 215 

cer has a collective view of all the difficulties in the 
different departments. But, when I was Avith the 
Northern army, I had a pretty good opportunity of 
knowing the difficulties, from being at the head of 
one of the great departments, and from the con- 
fidence which you were pleased to honor me with. 

In comparing the difficulties of the northern ser- 
vice with this of the southern, one bears but a small 
proportion to the other — whether from the make of 
the country, the divisions among the inhabitants, the 
difficulty of obtaining supplies, or the unequal force 
we have to contend with. And my spirits would 
sink under the load, was it not from a persuasion 
that, to whatever straits I may be reduced, or how- 
ever unfortunate I may be, from the hazards I am 
obliged to run, 3-our Excellency will do justice to 
my intentions. I have one consolation, Avhich is, I 
have the confidence of the troops, and the good will 
of the officers. But the unsettled state of the differ- 
ent lines in point of rank, multiplies our embarrass- 
ments ; nor can I see the least prospect of bringing 
them to a speedy close. 

I hope Baron Steuben writes your Excellency re- 
specting the enemy's movements in Virginia, as I 
have desired him to be very particular, and keep 
you constantly informed of every material circum- 
stance. I beg my respectful compliments to Mrs. 
Washington, and to all the gentlemen of your fa- 
mily. I am, with esteem and regard. 

Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 

Nathanael Greene. 



216 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LINCOLN. 

Boston, 25 January, 1781. 

My dear General, 

As General Knox, who well knows the state of 
our affairs here, will be with your Excellency as ear- 
ly as this can reach you, I may omit many matters 
which otherwise I should think it my duty to men- 
tion. 

I am informed that Congress have acceded to a 
general exchange, and that it is left with your Ex- 
cellency to carry it into effect, at such time as you 
shall think proper. I know too well your Excellen- 
cy's feelings for the distresses of those of our people 
in captivity, not to be convinced that the first proper 
moment will be seized to execute a measure which 
will so effectually promote the happiness of many, 
who, it appears to me, have deserved every attention 
from their country. 

The inclosed is a list of a number of good men 
(not in the line of the army), who, before I left 
Charleston, solicited my interest in procuring their 
exchange. I wish, when an exchange shall take place, 
that these persons may be subjects of it. I have no 
doubt but there are many other citizens who wish to 
be exchanged. If their names can be obtained, I hope 
they will enjoy the same benefit. I am, my dear 
General, with the greatest esteem, 

Tour Excellency's most obedient servant, 

Benjamin Lincoln. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 217 

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Camp, oa Pedee, 28 January, 1781. 

Sir, 

In my clespatclies of the 29tli ultimo, I did myself 
the honor to acquaint your Excellency with the dis- 
position I had made to counteract the movements of 
the enemy, and to j)rotect the country from their de- 
predations. 

Lord Cornwallis continued at Weymsborough, mak- 
ing every preparation, and completely equipping his 
troops for the most active operations, until the 9th 
instant ; when, having been joined by the troops un- 
der General Leslie, he put his army in motion, and 
advanced as far as the Cross Roads, on the west side 
of the Catawba river, and about forty miles from Cam- 
den. The position which Brigadier- General Morgan 
occupies, was well chosen for harassing the left flank, 
and checking the progress of the enemy on the route 
they had taken for the execution of their plan of 
operations. This, I suppose, induced his Lordship, on 
the 11th, to detach Lieutenant-Colonel Tarleton to dis- 
lodge him, and disperse the few militia who were 
collecting. 

I have the satisfaction to transmit your Excellency 
a copy of a letter which I this moment received from 
Brigadier-General Morgan, announcing the total defeat 
of Lieutenant-Colonel Taiieton's detachment. The vic- 
tory was complete, and the action glorious. The bril- 
liancy and success with which it was fought does the 
highest honor to the American arms, and adds splen- 
dor to the character of the General and his officers. 
I must beg leave to recommend them to your Excel- 
lency's notice, and doubt not, but from your repre- 

VOL. III. 19 



218 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

sentation, Congress ^ill receive pleasure from testify- 
ing their approbation of their conduct. 

Colonel Pickens was left on the ground, to relieve 
the wounded and to cover that part of the country. 
I am unhappy that the distressed situation of this 
army will not admit of our improving the advantage 
we have gained. But I hope it has given the enemy 
a check that will prevent their advancing for some 
days. Our supplies of provisions are growing more 
precarious ; and the other stores, which I can only 
look for from Philadelphia, do not arrive in such 
quantities as to replace those which are daily de- 
stroyed in service, I have appointed Major Hyrne, 
Deputy Commissary-General of Prisoners for the 
Southern department, and ordered him to send all the 
prisoners of war to Virginia, The militia, under Gene- 
ral Stephens, will take charge of them, as their time 
of service has already expired. 

I have directed Major-General the Baron de Steu- 
ben to transmit to Congress and to your Excellency, 
regular reports of the operations in Virginia. I do 
myself the honor to inclose a copy of my letter to 
Congress respecting the action of the ITth instant. 
I am. with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and 
respect. 

Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 

Nathanael Greene. 



FROM JOHN MATHEWS. 

Philadelphia, 30 January, 1781. 



Dear Sir, 

As the intelligence received yesterday possibly may 
not be conveyed to you through any other channel 



THE AMEKICAN REVOLUTION. 219 

at this time, and being well assured it will afford 
you much satisfaction to he informed of it, I have 
therefore taken the liberty of communicating it to 
you. Though the information does not come officially 
from the State, yet it comes in such a manner that 
it is to be depended on, — that Maryland has at last 
agreed to confederate. We have the resolves as they 
passed the lower House, wliich have since passed the 
upper House. This is a most important circumstance, 
and comes very seasonably to our relief; for Con- 
gress have been disputing, for a long time past, what 
powers were necessary to enable them to prosecute " 
the business intrusted to them, and were, at this 
moment, as far from agreeing about it as when we 
began. I hope, now we have some certain principles 
to act upon, we shall be steady and decisive. Though 
the powers of the Confederation are very inadequate 
to vigorous prosecution of the present war, yet we 
must endeavour to make the most of them we can ; 
and it is better to have some authority to regulate 
us, than (as for some time past has been the case) 
have none. 

Viroiuia has agreed to a cession of their back 
lands, with some reservations. This is also a very 
important matter, our present circumstances consider- 
ed. I flatter myself it will give us some credit, 
which we stand much in need of, and may possibly 
give a spring to our affairs. 

Congress have been seriously engaged, for the last 
ten days, in a Committee of the Whole, considering 
of the ways and means for defraying the expenses 
of the present year. They have agreed to call upon 
the States for a duty of four per cent, on all goods 
imported; the like duty on all prize goods; and one 
eighth of a dollar per ton on all foreign shipping. 



220 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

This, it is computed, "SYill produce about six or seven 
hundred thousand specie dollars. This is but a trifle 
when compared with our wants -, but, however, we are 
going on. 

Please to make my most respectful compliments 
to Mrs. Washington; and believe me to be, my dear 
General, yours &c., 

John jMathews. 



FEOM COLONEL LAURENS. 

Boston, 4 February, 1781. 

My dear General, 

Upon my arrival here the 25th ultiuio, I found 
that men and money were still wanting to fit the 
Alliance frigate for sea. I immediately insisted on 
the necessity of an impress, and of having recourse 
to extraordinary means for the necessary supply of 
money. The head of the Navy Board, who is at the 
same time a leading member in the House of Repre- 
sentatives, gave me such positive assurances on both 
points, as tempted me to employ the interval of pre- 
paration in my visit to Newport. But, as I was re- 
turning, I was met with a letter informing me that 
the motion for an impress had been rejected. To 
add to our difficulties, the terror of an impress had 
cleared the port of seamen, and deprived us of the 
little succour we derived from the ships' rendezvous. 

In these circumstances, I was reduced to the ne- 
cessity of soliciting General Lincoln for authority to 
eno;ao;e such volunteers from the Continental recruits 
of this place, and soldiers of the invalid corps, as 
might be qualified for the sea-service. I applied to 
Governor Hancock for similar authority with respject 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 221 

to a corps of State troops -which garrison the Castle. 
I addressed myself to the principal merchants, and 
tried every expedient that could be thought of As 
Governor Hancock could not act but with the author- 
ity of the General Court, I yesterday presented a 
memorial, and obtained permission to enlist twenty 
volunteers from the Castle guard. General Lincoln, 
whose zeal in the service of his country is indefati- 
gable, has condescendingly undertaken to use his per- 
sonal influence in engaging the men, and has gone 
down to the Castle with a sum of specie, allowed by 
the General Court for that purpose ; if he is success- 
ful, we shall be able to go to sea with confidence. 
These men are the more necessary to us, as they are 
natives, and persons upon whose attachment we can 
depend, as a counterbalance to a number of British 
prisoners, who were admitted on board when the 
ship first began to be manned. 

I am, at all events, determined to insist on Barry's 
sailing with the first wind. I have admitted as many 
passengers as could be accommodated, on condition 
of their serving as volunteer marines. They will 
likewise be an additional security against the sus- 
pected part of our crew. 

1th. Captain Barry says that our ship is but bare- 
ly manned. However, I am determined to embark 
to-day, and expect he will sail in the course of the 
week, wind and weather permitting. 

I have only time to entreat your Excellency to 
present my respects to Mrs. Washington; and accept 
the assurances of attachment with wliich I am un- 
alterably yours, 

John Laurens.

222 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL KNOX. 

New Windsor, 7 February, 1781. 

Sir, 

111 pursuance of ^^our Excellency's instructions to 
me, dated the 7th ultimo, I proceeded to the States 
of Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and New 
Hampshire, and delivered the despatches, with which 
I was charged, to the Governors and to the Pre- 
sident, to whom they were addressed. 

The Legislatures of Connecticut and Rhode Island, 
unfortunately, were not sitting. The Governor of the 
former State, by having the powers of the Assembly 
in its recess, respecting the exigencies of the war, dele- 
gated to him, jointly with a certain Council, supposed 
that it would be unnecessary to call the Legislature 
on the matter of my mission, and that his Council 
would be competent to do every thing necessary on 
the occasion; for which purpose he proposed to call 
them together the next day after I had the honor 
of conversing with him, which was on the 11th ulti- 
mo. Governor Trumbull fully coincided in sentiment 
with me, in respect to the gratuity of the three half 
Johannes, in preference to any pay in pajDor money, 
as a matter that would be more efficacious to quiet 
the minds of the troops, and render them happy; 
and also as a measure which the New England States 
could execute with as much ease, under present cir- 
cumstances, as the three months' real pay in paper. 
He was clearly of opinion, that to attempt to obtain 
both the gratuity and three months' pay, would be 
to attempt more than could be performed consistently 
with their present exertions in order to put their 
finances on a tolerable footing. The Governor pledged 
himself to exert his utmost interest to have the gra- 



THE AiMERICAN REVOLUTION. 223 

tuity and deficiency of clothing given to the troops 
immediately; and requested me to impress on the 
Governors and official gentlemen in the other States, 
the necessity and propriety of New England adopt- 
ing similar measures. I believe the Governor reli- 
giously performed his part, and I am happy to be- 
lieve I did not fail in mine. 

At Lebanon I saw His Grace the Duke de Lauzun, 
who pressed me to write an account of the revolt of 
the Pennsylvania line to the General, Count de E,o- 
chambeau. This I intended to have done when I 
should have reached Providence, as a matter which I 
presumed would be agreeable to your Excellency's 
sentiments. It was only anticipating it a few hours. 
Therefore, in conformity to the Duke's solicitations, I 
wrote to His Excellency General Rochambeau the 
letter marked number One. 

Governor Greene, of Rhode Island, immediately 
called the Legislature of that State to meet him 
at Greenwich the 18th ultimo. 

I was more happy, in Massachusetts and Xew 
Hampshire, to find the Assemblies of those States 
convened. To them I represented, in the strongest 
terms I was capable, the distresses of the army in 
general; of the troops of their lines in particular; 
and of the probable means that would conciliate the 
affections of the soldiers, and make them quiet and 
happy. I take the liberty to annex, in paper num- 
ber Tavo, a summary of the arguments which I urged 
to these Assemblies, as far as they applied to their 
troops ; and these were the principal arguments which 
I urged to the States respectively. 

Massachusetts were pleased to adopt the measures 
proposed, as appears by their acts, contained in the 
paper number Three. New Hampshire also adopted 



224 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

the measures, as far as the circuDistances of their 
troops required. That is, they agreed immediately to 
grant a gratuity of twenty-four silver dollars per man 
to their soldiers enlisted for the war, and coats suffi- 
cient to complete their line. The State of Rhode 
Island thought proper to adopt a different mode, as 
appears by a copy of their proceedings, hereunto an- 
nexed, number Four, and certified by the Secretary 
of that State. But I hope, as their quantity of hard 
money will be as much as that of the other States, 
the effects will be equally good. The Council of Con- 
necticut determined upon nothing final, but appeared 
to intend to follow the example of Massachusetts. 
They were to meet at Hartford the 5th instant, on 
this business. The Governor informed me he had 
but little doubt that they would adopt similar mea- 
sures to Massachusetts. But, if they should decline, 
he Avould immediately call the Legislature, when he 
presumed the matter would be made certain. 

I have the pleasure to assure your Excellency, that 
all ranks of people, as well unofficial as official, from 
the private farmer up to the Governor, in the four 
States through w^hich I passed, appear perfectly well 
principled in the contest, and fully determined to 
make every sacrifice of property and personal ease 
to insure the happy termination of the war. The 
universal sentiment was, that the army ought to be 
supported, and should be supported at every reason- 
able expense. 

The business of obtaining recruits for their batta- 
lions proceeds with great vigor and spirit, — for three 
years only, indeed; but the prejudice or sentiments 
of the recruits, who generally are the farmers' sons 
of the country, are against engaging for an indefinite 
term of time. I believe it would be easier to engage 



THE AMEKICAN REVOLUTION. 225 

recruits from New England for seven years, than for 
the undefined term, for the ivar. 

I hope I have executed this business agreeably to 
your Excellency's ideas \ and if so, a line of approba- 
tion would render happy, yours, &c., 

Henry Knox. 



Sir 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Camp, Guilford Court-House, 9 February, 1781. 



Since I wrote your Excellency by Major Giles, 
Lord Cornwallis has been constantly in pursuit of the 
light infantry and the prisoners, and is now between 
the Shallow Ford, upon the Yadkin and Salem, one 
of the Moravian towns ; and still pushing into the 
country with great rapidity. The moment I was in- 
formed of the movements of Lord Cornwallis, I put 
the army in motion on Pedee, and left it under the 
command of Brigadier-General linger, and set out to 
join the light infantry, in order to collect the militia, 
and embarrass the enemy till we could effect a junc- 
tion of our forces. 

General Morgan, after the defeat of Tarleton, had 
very judiciously made forced marches up into the 
country, and happily crossed the Catawba the even- 
ing before a great rain, which prevented the enemy 
from following him for several days, during which 
time the prisoners were got over the Yadkin, and on 
their march for Dan River, which I hope they have 
passed, and are in Virginia. 

On my arrival at the light infantry camp, I found 
them at Sherald's Ford, on the Catawba. The enemy 
were a little lower down the river, at Mc Co wen's 



226 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

Forclj and tlie river still so high that they could not 
cross. We made the best disposition we could to 
stop them, when the river should fall. But the fords 
were so numerous, and our forces so small, that we 
could not effect it. General Davidson, who had great 
influence among the Muhlenberg and Roan militia, 
had made use of all the arguments in his power to 
get the militia into the field, but without effect. 
Thev had been so much in service, and their families 
so distressed, that they were loath to leave home, 
even on the most pressing occasion. 

The enemy crossed at McCowen's Ford, where Ge- 
neral Davidson was posted with the greatest part of 
the militia, who fled at the first discharge. The ene- 
my made good their landing, and the militia retreat- 
ed. A place of rendezvous was appointed for the 
ndlitia to collect at, who were posted at the different 
fords up and down the river above thirty miles. Part 
of them halted about seven miles short of the place 
of rendezvous, and were overtaken by Tarleton, and 
dispersed. I waited that night at the place appoint- 
ed for the militia to collect at, until morning ; but 
not a man appeared. The light infantry continued 
their march to Salisbury, and crossed the Yadkin. 
But before we got over all the baggage and stores, 
the enemy were at our heels. A pretty smart skir- 
mish happened between a party of our riflemen and 
the advance of the enemy near the ford. We had 
secured all the boats, and the river was so high that 
the enemy could not follow us. 

Heavy rains, deep creeks, bad roads, poor horses, 
and broken harness, as well as delays for want of 
provisions, prevented our forming a junction as early 
as I expected; and, fearing that the river might fall 
so as to be fordable, I ordered the army to file off 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 227 

to this place, where part of them arrived last even- 
ing; the rest I hope will be in this night. The ene- 
my, finding they conld not cross the Trading Ford, 
marched up to the Shallow Ford, where they passed 
the night before last, and are within twenty-five or 
thirty miles of this place. 

As soon as I arrived at the light infantry camp, I 
wrote letters to all the militia officers over the moun- 
tains, and in the upper country, to embody their 
men and join the army as early as possible. But 
very few have joined us, and those principally with- 
out arms or ammunition. We have no provisions but 
what we receive from our daily collections. Under 
these circumstances, I called a Council, who unani- 
mously advised to avoid an- action, and to retire be- 
yond the Roanoke immediately. A copy of the pro- 
ceedings I have the honor to inclose, 

I had previously ordered all the stores and heavy 
baggage to be removed to Prince Edward Court- 
House ; and informed Governor Nash of our situation. 
I have formed a light army, composed of the cavalry 
of the first and third regiments, and the legion, 
amounting to two hundred and forty; a detachment 
of two hundred and eighty infantry, under Lieute- 
nant-Colonel Howard ; the infantry of Lieutenant-Co- 
lonel Lee's legion, and sixty Virginia riflemen ; mak- 
ing in the whole seven hundred men, who will be 
ordered, with the militia, to harass the enemy in their 
advance, check their progress, and, if possible, give 
us an opportunity to retire without a general action. 

The force under Lord Cornwallis, consists of be- 
tween twenty-five hundred and three thousand troops, 
including near three hundred dragoons, and their 
mounted infantry. They have destroyed their wagons, 
and are completely equipped as light infantry. 



228 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

I have the honor to inclose a copy of a letter 
from Lieutenant-Colonel Lee, extracts of two letters 
from General Marion, and a copy of a letter from a 
well-informed gentleman, respecting the operations at 
Wilmington. General Morgan is so umvell that he 
has left the army. The enemy, since the action of 
the 17th ultimo, have pursued him upwards of two 
hundred miles. He was obliged to leave the w^ound- 
ed, the arms, wagons, and carriages of the artillery, 
taken in the action; but I hope they have not fallen 
into the hands of the enemy. 

I have ordered General JMarion to cross the Sautee 
River, and General Sumpter to collect the militia in 
the upper part of South Carolina. General Pickens 
has orders to take command of the men in arms in 
the rear of the enemy. I have wrote Mr. Henry, 
the late Governor of Virginia, to collect, if possible, 
fourteen or fifteen hundred volunteers, to aid us, 
should the enemy attempt to pursue us beyond the 
Dan River. I had the satisfaction to receive your 
Excellency's despatches of the 2Tth of December, and 
the 2d and 9th of January, a few days since. I 
have the honor to bo, w^ith sentiments of the highest 
esteem and respect, yours, &c., 

Nathanael Greene. 



Sir, 



FROM GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Albany, 14 February, 1781. 



Reflecting, with a most sincere satisfaction, on the 
marks of confidence which you have so repeatedly be- 
stowed upon the Government of this State, we esteem 
it incumbent on us to afford your Excellency the pe- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 229 

riisal of a letter whicli we have addressed to Con- 
gress, a copy whereof we have the honor to inclose. 
Minute as we have been in a detail of our dis- 
tresses, they fall far short of those we at this instant 
actually experience. Since we despatched the letter to 
Congress, petitions have been presented to us from 
every quarter of the frontiers, claiming protection, and 
entreating us, if we cannot afford it, in some degree, 
immediately, and during the campaign more effectu- 
ally, to advise them of it, that they may take the 
advantage of the snow to remove their families and 
effects to the interior part of the State. Whilst these 
applications were under consideration, in order to de- 
vise the means of relief for those unhappy people, the 
enemy have commenced their barbarities, and butch- 
ered some of the inhabitants in Tryon county, num- 
bers of whom, impelled by apprehensions too well 
founded, are already moving, and the remainder pre- 
paring to follow. In the dilemma to which this ca- 
lamity has reduced us, we wish, in order to prevent 
a total depopulation of the best part of our remain- 
ing territory, to have it in our power to assure the 
inhabitants that the two regiments of our State 
line will be destined for the frontier service ; and we 
therefore take the liberty to request your Excellency 
to enable us to give these assurances, and to be in- 
formed from you whether this, or any other equal 
force, will remain for the protection of the northern 
and western frontiers. As nothing but the fullest 
conviction that such severe calamities will follow from 
withdrawing these troops, as will be replete with 
ruin to the common cause, could have induced us to 
this request, we trust in your Excellency's candor 
for a favorable construction of our intentions, as any

230 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

interference in your command is the farthest from 
our Avish. 

A want of ability to raise a competent body of 
troops for the defence of the frontiers, and a convic- 
tion of the necessity of at least doubling their num- 
ber, induce us to entreat your Excellency to afford 
us whatever further assistance you may have in your 
power. Were it necessary to urge any motives to a 
gentleman who so eminently turns his attention to 
the commonweal of the Confederacy, we might state 
many to evince the importance of perfectly securing 
the country in question. We are convinced it is not; 
relying, in the fullest confidence, that all will be 
done for us that with propriety can be expected. 

The want of some artillerists and field-artillery, 
when the enemy penetrated into the country in the 
last campaign, was an evident disadvantage. We 
could, therefore, wish for such a portion of them 
as your Excellency may judge adequate to this ser- 
vice. The frequent calls on the militia, in the course 
of the last campaign, have exhausted all our stock of 
ammunition ; and, as we have not the means of ob- 
taining any, except from the public magazines, per- 
mit us to entreat your Excellency to direct a quan- 
tity to be expedited to this place for the use of the 
troops (the militia), who may be called into the field. 

The Commanding Officer here will, doubtless, inform 
your Excellency that the troops in this department 
are destitute of provisions of the meat kind ; that, 
on the 6th instant, there was beef at Fort Schuyler 
only for fourteen days, and that the troops in this 
city and Schenectady are billeted upon the inhabit- 
ants, for want of that article of provision. As a 
present relief, we have advanced all the money in 
our treasury, amounting to about twelve hundred dol- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 231 

lars of the new emission, to our agent to purchase 
beef. From this, however, we expect little success, 
as there are no beef cattle within the State ; and, 
should the agent succeed in making purchases to 
the amount of the cash, it will produce, at most, only 
a temporary supply. We therefore take the liberty 
to suggest to your Excellency the necessity of an 
order from you in favor of the Deputy Commissary 
of Issues, in tliis department, upon the magazine at 
Richmond, in Massachusetts, or any of the Purchasing 
Officers in the other States bordering upon this, for 
a supply of beef for the use of the troops in this 
department ; which, if granted, the bearer will convey 
to the Deputy Commissary of Issues, who is now in 
this place. 

By order, and in behalf of the Legislature, I have 
the honor to be, with the most perfect respect and 
esteem, yours, &c. 

George Clinton. 



FROM BENJAMIN LINCOLN. 

Boston, 15 February, 1781, 

My dear General, 
I have the pleasure to inform you that Colonel 
Laurens sailed on the loth, after waiting several days 
in Nantasket Road for a fair wind. On his arrival 
here, he found the Alliance had not completed her 
crew, and that it would be difficult soon to effi3ct it. 
This induced him to apply to the Navy Board to ob- 
tain from the General Court a power to impress, 
which not only failed in the House, but so alarmed 
the sailors, that some secreted themselves, and others 
left the town; so that, although the Assembly order- 
ed the bounty increased out of their own chest, and 



232 LETTEES TO WASHINGTON. 

afterwards gave a permission to enlist out of tlie 
State troojDS, a deficiency still existed, and the ship 
was detained solely by the want of a crew. This 
being represented by Colonel Laurens, and the im- 
portance of his mission, joined by his request that I 
would aid in completing the crew of the Alliance by 
suffering the sea-oflficers to engage such of the recruits 
of this State, as were qualified for the marine service, 
induced me to permit itj and eight or ten of the re- 
cruits, and about the same number of invalids, went 
on board, which I hope will meet with your Excel- 
lency's approbation. 

I have been frequently applied to for warrants for 
the pay of the invalids and others. Have I power 
to grant such w^arrants ? The late Lieutenant-Colonel 
Loring has been to Congress, I suppose, to solicit a 
new hearing. From the papers he showed me in 
September last, I thought that he had such new and 
material evidence to offer in his case, as gave flatter- 
ing hopes that he would obtain his wishes, and prove 
himself an honest man. I know his circumstances to 
be such as forbid his remaining longer from his fami- 
ly, without great injury to himself and them. Give 
me leave to beg, my dear Sir, if he is to enjoy the 
benefit of a new hearing, that he may, as early as 
possible, have that favor. 

There are many deserters strolling through the 
country, who, I suppose, w^ould return to their duty, 
if they could hope for a pardon. But past omissions 
to embrace the mercy so often held out to them, have, 
I presume, prevented your Excellency from repeating 
once more that which has been attended with so 
little success. Though I cannot solicit your Excellen- 
cy in behalf of these infatuated men, without hurting 
your feelings (for I am confident your willingness to 



THE AMERICAN EEVOLUTION. 233 

save has known no other hounds than the utmost 
limits of mercy to the wicked, which coukl he exer- 
cised short of cruelty to the good), yet I have my 
wishes that the most virtuous, if virtue can be ap- 
plied to any of them, might he encouraged to hope 
for an opportunity of evidencing the sincerity of their 
repentance by future obedience, and rewarded accord- 
ingly. I have the honor to be, my dear General, 
with every sentiment of esteem. 

Yours, &c., 

Benjamin Lincoln. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Camp, Irwin's Ferry, on the Dan Eiver, 
15 February, 1781. 

Sir, 

I wrote your Excellency at Guilford Court-House, 
giving you an account of our situation, and of the 
measures advised by the Council of War, since which 
time we have been manoeuvring constantly in the 
face of the enemy, who pressed our rear every day. 

Finding our numbers and condition so unequal to 
the enemy, that it would be too hazardous to risk a 
general action, and being pressed in point of time to 
get off our stores and baggage, notwithstanding I 
had ordered it to file off for Hillsborough when the 
army began their march from Pedee, and the stores 
from Hillsborouo-h to cross the Roanoke the moment 
I could satisfy myself that it was the intention of 
Lord Cornwallis to penetrate the upper country, — to 
gain time to effect this business, as well as give the 
militia an opportunity to collect, I found it necessary 
to form as strong a covering party as possible, wliich 
was commanded by Colonel Williams, who had orders 
20-'' 



234 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

to keep as near tlie enemy as lie could, without ex- 
posing the party too much, and retard their march 
all in his power. His conduct upon the occasion 
does him the hio;hest honor. 

Lord Cornwallis has been at our heels from day to 
day ever since we left Guilford; and our movements 
from thence to this place have been of the most cri- 
tical kind, having a river in our front, and the enemy 
in our rear. But, happily, we have crossed without the 
loss of either men or stores. Much credit is due to 
Lieutenant-Colonel Carrington on this occasion. The 
enemy are on the other side of the river, and, as it 
is falling, I expect it will be fordable before night; 
and the fords are so numerous, and the enemy lie in 
such an advantageous situation for crossing, that it 
would be a folly to think of defending them, as it 
would reduce our force to small parties, which might 
prove our ruin. The miserable situation of the troops, 
for want of clothing, has rendered the march the 
most painful imaginable, several hundreds of the sol- 
diers tracking the ground with their bloody feet. 
Your feelings for the suffering soldier, had you been 
here, must have been pained upon the occasion. 

The enemy's movements have been so rapid, and 
the country under such terror, that few or no militia 
have joined us, and the greater part we had have 
fallen off. Inclosed I send your Excellency the 
strength of the British army, which you will see 
is much stronger than I had calculated upon in my 
last. This account I believe may be depended upon, 
though I have not a shilling of money to obtain in- 
telligence, notwithstanding my application to jMary- 
land for money for this particular service ; and your 
Excellency knows that good intelligence is the soul 
of an army, and ought to govern all its movements. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 235 

I have done every thing to call out the militia of 
the upper country, and have kept Governors Nash 
and Jefferson as regularly advised of the state of 
matters, as time and circumstances would permit. No- 
thing is yet done to give me effectual support; and 
I am not a little apprehensive that it is out of the 
power of Virginia and North Carolina to afford it. 
I must repeat again what I have said in several let- 
ters, that I fear nothing can save the Southern States 
but a good regular army ; and I am more confirmed 
of the importance of the cavalry upon this occasion 
than ever I have been, though strongly impressed 
with it before. 

Should Lord Cornwallis cease his pursuit after this 
army, I imagine he will file off for Halifax, and en- 
deavour to establish a post there ; to prevent which 
I have sent Colonel Kosciuszko to fortify it. That 
position would greatly awe Virginia, and almost to- 
tally subject North Carolina. If we can prevent his 
taking post there, and oblige him to fill down into 
the lower country, he will reap little advantage from 
his movements. I wish it was in my power to give 
your Excellency more flattering accounts from this 
quarter; but I fear, unless reenforcements come from 
the northward, this will prove a devoted country. 
However, my utmost exertions shall be continued to 
save these States, and I shall be happy, if my con- 
duct meets with your approbation, as my situation 
affords me no prospect of personal glory. 

Lieutenant-Colonel Lee made a charge upon the 
enemy's advanced party, a few days since, and cut 
off the greater part of them. A captain and several 
privates were made prisoners. The enemy move with 
great caution, though with great rapidity, frequently 
performing marches of thirty miles a day. Myself 



236 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

and my Aids are almost -worn out with fatigue, wliicli 
prevents my giving you more frequent and particular 
accounts of our movements. Our army are in good 
spirits, notwithstanding their sufferings and excessive 
ftitigue. I have had no further accounts from Wil- 
mino'ton or the Baron Steuben since I wrote. 
I am, with great respect, yours, &c., 

Nathai^ael Greene. 



FROM GOVERNOR JEFFERSON. 

RIclimond, 17 February, 1781. 

Sir, 
By a letter from General Greene, dated Guilford 
Court-House, 10th February, we are informed that 
Lord Cornwallis had burnt his own wagons in order 
to enable himself to move with greater facility, and 
had pressed immediately on. The prisoners taken at 
the Cowpens were happily saved by the accidental 
rise of a watercourse, which gave so much time as 
to withdraw them from the reach of the enemy. 
Lord Cornwallis had advanced to the vicinity of the 
Moravian towns, and was still moving on rapidly. 
His object was supposed to be to compel General 
Greene to an action, which, under the difference of 
force they had, would probably be ruinous to the lat- 
ter. General Greene meant to retire by the way of 
Boyd's Ferry, on the Boanoke. As yet he had lost lit- 
tle or no stores or baggage, but they were far from 
being safe. In the instant of receiving this intelligence, 
we ordered a reenforcement of militia to him from 
the most convenient counties in which there was a 
hope of finding any arms. Some great event must 
arise from the present situation of things, which for 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 237 

a long time will determine the condition of southern 
afBiirs. 

Arnold lies close in his quarters. Two days ago I 
received information of the arrival of a sixty-four gun 
ship and two frigates in our Bay, being part of the 
fleet of our good ally at Rhode Island. Could they 
get at the British fleet here, they are sufficient to 
destroy them; hut the-se being drawn up into Eliza- 
beth River, into which the sixty-four cannot enter, I 
apprehend they could do nothing more than block up 
the river. This, indeed, would reduce the enemy, as 
we could cut off their supplies by land ; but the 
operation being lengthy, would probably be too dan- 
gerous to the auxiliary force. Not having yet had 
any particular information of the designs of the 
French Commander, I cannot pretend to say what 
measures this aid will lead to. 

Our proposition to the Cherokee Chiefs to visit 
Congress, for the purpose of preventing, or delaying, 
a rupture with that nation, was too late. Their dis- 
tresses had too much ripened their alienation from us, 
and the storm had gathered to a head when Major 
Martin got back. It was determined to carry the 
war into their country, rather than await it in ours; 
and I have it in my power to inform you, that, thus 
disagreeably circumstanced, the issue has been success- 
ful. The militia of this State and North Carolina 
penetrated into their country, burnt almost every 
town they had, amounting to about one thousand 
houses in the whole, destroyed fifty thousand bushels 
of grain, killed twenty-nine, and took seventeen pri- 
soners. The latter are mostly women and children. 
I have the honor to be, with great respect. 

Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

Thomas Jefferson. 



238 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

P. S. Since writing the above I received informa- 
tion, which, though not authentic, commands attention; 
that Lord Cornwallis had got to Boyd's Ferry on the 
14th. I am issuing orders, in consequence, to other 
counties to embody and march all the men they can 
arm. In this fatal situation, without arms, there will 
be no safety for the Convention troops, but in their 
removal, which I shall accordingly order. The prison- 
ers of the Cowpens were at New London (Bedford 
Court-Iiouse) on the 14th. 



FROM COLONEL PICKERING.* 

Newburg, 18 February, 1781. 

Sir, 
General Knox informed me, to-day, that no artillery 
was to go from hence. I had previously ordered 
fifty draught-horses to be impressed for transporting 
the artillery, ammunition, and tents. I now propose 
to dispose of them as follows; — For tiie Marquis de 
la Fayette's Avagon, four; a baggage tumbril for the 
artillery officers, three ; for three close wagons, in 
which are to be carried from hence eleven horsemen's 
and sixty common tents, twelve ; the Field-Ofificers 
and Captains of artillery, two or three ; total, twenty- 
two. These may proceed to-morrow for Pompton. The 
residue of the horses and sleighs, impressed on this 
occasion, I have ordered to be employed in carrying 

* Colonel Pickering was appointed Quartermaster-General of the ar- 
my on the 5th of August, 1780, after the resignation of General Greene. 
It was at the same time resolved by Congress, " that he be continued 
as a member of the Board of War, but that the exercise of aU his 
powers at the said Board, and his pay as a member thereof, be sus- 
pended during such time as he shall continue Quartermaster-General." 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 239 

clothing and provisions to West Point, while their 
forage and the sleighing lasts. 

I wrote yesterday morning to Colonel Hughes, de- 
siring him to give the necessary orders to his assist- 
ants at the Village, and King's Ferry, to impress 
twenty-five riding horses, for the Field and Staff Offi- 
cers of the detachment ; the whole, if he thought best, 
on the west side of the river, to save the trouble of 
crossing. I also desired him to impress ten two-horse 
wagons, and have them at King's Ferry on the 20th, 
to take up the baggage of the officers, and the ket- 
tles of the men, as soon as they crossed. That num- 
ber I judged sufficient, supposing the officers would 
take with them only their blankets, portmanteaus, and 
cooking utensils. Colonel Hughes received these or- 
ders, and answered me last evening that they should 
be executed. I have wrote to him this afternoon, de- 
siring him to send one hundred axes to Major Camp- 
bell, at the Village, to distribute to the detachment, 
when assembled, if they should need them. I have 
also requested him to examine into the condition of 
the boats at King's Ferry, and see that they are pre- 
pared to transport the troops. 

I have sent orders to Morristown, to have one 
hundred and fifty common, and ten or twelve horse- 
men's tents put in order immediately. These, with 
those proposed to be sent from hence, will be suffi- 
cient for the detachment, allowing seven men one 
common tent, and four Captains and subalterns one 
horsemen's tent. If there be three officers to a com- 
pany, six will have but one horsemen's tent. It is 
proposed to furnish the detachment with two hundred 
narrow axes, one hundred and thirty pickaxes, one 
hundred and fifty spades, and two hundred and fifty 
shovels. By a return, received in November, there 



240 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

appeared to be spades, shovels, and one hundred and 
six picks (enough) at Philadelphia. At the same time, 
there were plenty of good axes at Lancaster, from 
whence the transportation is easy to the Head of Elk. 
There are also five hundred axes at Morristown. But 
if, on my arrival at Philadelphia, there should be 
found a deficiency of intrenching tools, it will be 
practicable to complete the requisite number in two 
or -three days. 

I have proposed that the horses going from hence 
and King's Ferry, should be relieved at Pompton ; 
that the teams requisite for the tents, at Morristown, 
should be impressed in that neighbourhood, and go 
as far as Trenton ; and that the horses and teams 
impressed at Pompton should be relieved about So- 
merset Court-House. But should there chance to be 
provision teams at ISIorristown, returning to Trenton, 
they may be detained a day or two to take up the 
baggage of the detachment, and save an}^ farther im- 
press, except for the close baggage-wagons. The 
same may take place from Pompton to Morristown, 
should there be teams returninji; from Rino-wood. 
That from Bucks county, in Pennsylvania, teams 
and horses should be collected sufficient for the bag- 
gage of the whole detacJiment, and rendezvous at 
Trenton Ferry, unless the river should admit of 
water transportation ; that, if the whole proceed by 
land, the Bucks county teams should be relieved at 
Chester ; that teams should be furnished at Philadel- 
phia for the intrenching tools, and whatever may be 
taken up there ; and thus the whole proceed to the 
Head of Elk. I have sent Major Piatt to West 
Point to request of General Heath, an active officer 
to serve as Quarter-master to the detachment. 

I have provided two Forage-masters, that have ap- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 241 

peared to me as clever as any in the service, to 
accompany, or rather precede the detachment, to im- 
press teams and forage; and a Conductor to attend to 
the march of the baggage. The greatest difficulty, 
that I foresee, will he in impressing the teams and 
horses with proper despatch and punctuality, for want 
of dragoons. The time of every impress must be regu- 
lated by the orders of the Commanding Officer of 
the detachment. 

I request your Excellency's orders relative to any 
farther arrangement of this business, or alteration of 
the measures here proposed. I am, most respectfully. 
Your Excellency's obedient servant, 

Tbiothy Pickering. 



FKOM JOSEPH JONES, IN CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 21 February, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 
I beg leave to mention to you a young gentle- 
man, captured by the enemy when the Buckskin 
fell into their hands in the Chesapeake Bay, and 
who was put on shore under parole, and wishes to 
be discharged from the obligation as soon as possible, 
as he conceives it restrains him not only from acting 
in the field, should the situation of his country re- 
quire his services, but even from attending the hos- 
pitals for his instruction, which he is very desirous 
of doing. The person I speak of is Dr. John Lewis, 
a son of the late Mr. Charles Lewis, whose name I 
mentioned to you some years ago, while he was in 
New York, and, being refused the liberty of coming 
out, was at length obliged to return to Great Britain. 
His parole is, I think, singular, as it extends only to 
his not doing or speaking any thing to the prejudice 

VOL. III. 21 



242 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

of the enemy, without the clause of rendering him- 
self when called for. 

You will receive from the President a copy of a 
Report which has passed in Congress, in consequence 
of Colonel Harrison's communications. You will also 
be informed of the arrival of Provost, with a reen- 
forcement to the enemy in the south, and of his pro- 
gress since his arrival. Arnold's position at Ports- 
mouth, Provost in North Carolina, and Cornwallis in 
South Carolina, will, I fear, effectually obstruct the 
supplies from our State, or so delay them as to ren- 
der Greene's situation critical. If the French ships 
from Rhode Island shall succeed in their enterprise 
in the Chesaj)eake, the event will be propitious, and 
produce the happiest effects. Our State will be 
thereby further aided by a supply of one thousand 
stand of arms, and some stores retaken and sent for- 
ward in one of the French frigates. The arrival of 
Provost, and the great want of arms in the Southern 
States, it must be confessed, presents a rather gloomy 
prospect ; and, under this temper of mind, you will 
receive a letter reiterating what has, I think, been 
several times intimated, a desire that you will pay 
particular attention to the Southern department. I 
wish we could but content ourselves with a commu- 
nication of ficts, and any reflections upon them for 
illustration, leaving the combination and execution of 
the various operations of a campaign to those whose 
business it is to project and execute them. 

Paul Jones's arrival gives us no relief in clothing 
or arms, a disappointment the more to be regretted 
as our wants increase. Yet we know not whom to 
blame. Jones will, I expect, unfold this dark, and, 
as yet, mysterious business. I presume you must 
have been informed that Virginia has receded from 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 243 

her former instructions to her Delegates in Congress, 
res^DOcting the claim, on her part, to the free naviga- 
tion of the Mississippi, which, if approved by Congress, 
will probably bring about an alliance with Spain, and 
an acknowledgment of our independence. No doubt 
this event, if it takes place, will give us more credit 
in Europe ; but we pay dear for it. 

We are about appointing the officers who are to 
be at the head of our great departments. Yesterday 
Mr. Morris, without a vote against him (though 
S. A., and his colleague. General W., declined to bal- 
lot), was chosen Financier. I cannot say he will 
accept, but have some hopes he wilL Our finances 
want a Necker to arrange and reform them. Morris 
is, I believe, the best qualified of any our country 
affords for the arduous undertaldng. We shall, in a 
day or two, appoint the officers for the Foreign Af- 
fairs and the Marine. I wish we had men in these 
ojGfices as well qualified to execute them, as Morris in 
the Treasury. Some, however, that are nominated, if 
they can be chosen, will do very well. We are un- 
der difficulties about the War Office, lest any person 
we could now put into it may not answer so w^ell as 
the present Commissary. This may, and I expect 
will, postpone that appointment. 

With great esteem, I am, dear Sir, yours, &c., 

Joseph Jones. 



FROM COLONEL BRODHEAD. 

Fort Pitt, 25 February, 1781. 



Dear General, 
I am honored with your letters of the 29th De- 
cember and 10th of January last. That of the 10th 



244 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

came to hand on the 20th instant, and the other on 
the day following. As it is my duty, so it is my 
highest pleasure, to execute every instruction I re- 
ceive from your Excellency, to the utmost of my 
capacity. Captain Heth having retired to his farm, 
I cannot at this time send his rank, but have inclos- 
ed the rank of the Maryland officers ; and will for- 
w^ard that of the other officers by the next convey- 
ance. 

The Indians have lately killed one man upon Ten- 
Mile Creek, and the inhabitants are in great conster- 
nation. The frontier settlements will doubtless be 
deserted, as I have not troops to protect them. I 
shall be happy if the proposed expedition, under Co- 
lonel Clark, answers your Excellency's expectations. 
Nothing in my power shall be wanting to forward his 
operations. In my last, I begged leave of absence 
until I could do myself the honor to wait upon your 
Excellency. And as my force will now be much re- 
duced, I take the liberty to renew my application. 
With the most perfect respect, &c., 

Daniel Brodhead. 

P. S. I shall be glad to know if it be your Ex- 
cellency's pleasure to have a garrison continued at 
Fort Mcintosh. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Head- Quarters, High Rock Ford, on Haw River, 
28 February, 1781. 

Sir, 
I did myself the honor to write your Excellency 
on the 15th instant, when I was endeavouring to 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 245 

collect a body of militia to reenforce this army. But 
the enemy; early on the 19th, filed off to Hillsbo- 
rough, where Lord Cornwallis issued a proclamation 
(a copy of which is inclosed), and made use of every 
art to induce the people to join him. To prevent his 
success in the execution of this business, which we 
had every reason to believe he would accomplish, I 
was obliged to recross the Dan River before the 
militia could be assembled. This was effected on the 
23d, and with great difficulty we have reached this 
place. 

The scarcity of provision, which is rendered more 
distressing by the loose and irregular manner in 
which the militia of this country take the field, is 
not only embarrassing, but very alarming. The want 
of penal laws to oblige the inhabitants to supply 
themselves with arms and accoutrements, renders the 
aid of the militia precarious and almost useless. I 
am anxiously waiting the arrival of Colonel William 
Campbell, who is expected to join us with a respect- 
able body of mounted riflemen, which will enable 
this army to approach the enemy with greater confi- 
dence and effectually to harass their way. 

Lord Cornwallis evacuated Hillsborough on the 
26th, and moved on the road to Guilford Court-House, 
and crossed the Haw River, at Tralinger's Ford, twen- 
ty miles below this place, last night. His route and 
his object are uncertain; but circumstances lead to a 
belief that he will move towards Cross Creek, by 
which I fear he will collect a very large number of 
the disaffected inhabitants. I have received no ac- 
counts from General Sum.pter; but wish he may be 
able, in conjunction with General Marion, to destroy 
some of the enemy's small posts in South Carolina, 
and prevent the accomplishment of their designs in 
21* 



246 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON 

that country. The enemy have ordered two regi- 
ments of negroes to be immediately embodied, and 
are drafting a great proportion of the young men of 
that State, to serve during the war. 

We have the most unequivocal and full evidence of 
the disaffection of a great part of this State. The 
enemy have raised seven independent companies in a 
single day; and we have the mortification to find, 
that most of the prisoners we take are inhabitants 
of America. The Legislature, I am informed, have 
passed a law for drafting twenty-seven hundred men 
for tAvelve months, but they cannot attempt to carry 
it into effect while the enemy continue in the State. 

Our detachments have been successful in several 
attempts upon the enemy's pickets, having killed and 
wounded about thirty, and made twenty prisoners, 
without any loss. General Pickens, with a body of 
mounted riflemen, and Lieutenant-Colonel Lee, with 
the cavalry of his legion, were detached to endeavour 
to harass the enemy ; and being informed that Lieu- 
tenant-Colonel Tarleton had passed the Haw River, 
near General Butler's plantation, they immediately 
went in pursuit of him, but, unfortunately, came up 
with a body of upwards of two hundred of Colonel 
Hambleton's corps, and the North Carolina Tories, 
three miles in his rear, who were to have joined him 
that evening. The General attempted to pass by 
them as a detachment of the British army, which the 
legion succeeded in; but when the militia came up, 
the enemy discovered their mistake, which obliged 
our troops to charge them, in doing which, some of 
the militia could not be prevented from firing, which 
alarmed Colonel Tarleton, and gave him an opportu- 
nity to escape. The whole of the enemy were routed 
in a few minutes, and the greater part of them left 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION 247 

dead on the ground. Colonel Piles and several offi- 
cers were among the number. 

The want of supplies in this country, the superior- 
ity of the enemy, and the mode in which the militia 
do duty, are alarming circumstances at this critical 
period; and, unless the most vigorous exertions are 
made in the Southern States, we cannot be relieved. 
Of the troops raised by the State of Virginia last 
summer, four hundred are now at Chesterfield Court- 
House, naked, and unable to march. But the Baron 
Steuben has detained some clothing coming from Phila- 
delphia, Avhich will enable him to send them forward 
immediately. They were raised for eighteen months, 
but the greater part of the time will expire before 
they join the army. I wish these States could have 
been convinced of the loss they sustain by short en- 
listments. 

Your Excellency's letter of the 2d instant, with 
the inclosed Act of Congress, was handed me on the 
20th. I am convinced that Colonel Armand's legion 
can render no service on its present footing. The 
officers refuse to go on duty with the men ; thirty- 
eight, out of a detachment of forty men, deserted 
to the enemy, and the Baron Steuben was obliged 
to order a number of them to join their regiments, 
wlio are prisoners at Charlottesville. 

The militia of the back country have returned from 
their expedition, having destroyed most of the towns 
belonging to the Cherokee Indians. I have commis- 
sioned a number of the principal inhabitants to treat 
with the Cherokee and Chickasaw nations on terms 
of accommodation, subject to the determination of 
Congress. A copy of their instructions I shall in- 
close as early as possible. I have the honor to be, 
with esteem and respect, &c., 

Nathan.\el Geeene. 



248 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Philadelphia, 2 March, 1781. 

My DEAR General, 

Your letters of the 25tli and 26th are both come 
yesterday to hand, which shows that the expresses 
have not made great despatch. I would have done 
myself the honor of writing to your Excellency, had 
I not every minute waited for intelligences from the 
southward. 

Your Excellency remembers that our shortest cal- 
culation for the arrival of the troops at the Head of 
Elk was for the 6th of March. I am happy to in- 
form you that they will be there this day or to-mor- 
row early; and notwithstanding the depth of the mud, 
and the extreme badness of the roads, this march, 
which I can call rapid (as, for example, they came 
in two days from Morristown to Princeton), has been 
performed with such an order and alacrity, that, 
agreeably to the report, two men only have been 
left behind, and yet these two men have embarked 
at Trenton, with some remains of baggage. At every 
place where the detachment have halted, they have 
found covering and wood, &c., ready for them, and 
there has not been the least complaint made to me 
from any inhabitant. Every third day they have 
drawn their provisions. The clothing has been also 
distributed; and, having embarked yesterday at Tren- 
ton, they passed the city about two o'clock, by a 
wind which was extremely favorable. Congress have 
given to our troops the advance of one month's pay, 
which will be distributed at the Head of Elk, in their 
emission. 

The artillery, consisting of one twenty-four, six 
eighteen, two brass twelve, one eight-inch howitzer, 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 249 

two eight-inch mortarSj in all twelve heavy pieces, 
four six-pounders, and two small howitzers, with a 
sufficient proportion of ammunition, will be at the 
Head of Elk this day and to-morrow; so that by the 
4th I hope we shall be ready to sail. A quantity 
of medicines and instruments, and fifteen hundred 
pairs of shoes, will be at the Head of Elk before we 
embark. Vessels will be in readiness to receive us 
with thirty days' provisions on board. I am also as- 
sured, that we shall have a sufficient quantity of 
boats to land the detachment; and two heavy scows 
will be added for the artillery. The public, and 
some of the private armed vessels in the Bay, have 
been ordered to the Head of Elk. Two despatch- 
boats are there, and four more have been asked for. 
As a farther security for our subsistence, I have got 
the Minister's permission to dispose of the French 
flour and salt meat along the Bay, in case of neces- 
sity. 

On my arrival at this place I heard that M. de 
Tilly, the French Commander, had conferred with the 
Virginians, but upon seeing that nothing could be 
done immediately, he was undetermined whether to 
stay or return to Rhode Island. Fearing that our 
letters might miscarry, and wishing to hurry the 
preparations of the militia, I complied with the earn- 
est solicitations of the Minister of France to send on 
Colonel Gouvion, and directed him to go thither by 
land or water, as the state of the Bay would permit, 
on board the French squadron, and afterwards to 
Baron de Steuben's camp, where he may apprise 
these gentlemen of our force, our intentions, and the 
time of our arrival. 

This minute account I give to your Excellency to 
show you that nothing on our part has been w^anting 



250 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

for the success of tlie expedition. Our preiDarations 
have, in every article, fulfilled, and in the most im- 
portant one, time, have exceeded, what had been ex- 
pected. Your letter was sent by express to General 
St. Clair, who immediately came to town. But no- 
thing having been done for the settling of the ac- 
counts, none of the promises having been complied 
with, and the men being much scattered, it has, after 
much consideration, been thought impossible to em- 
bark any number with us ; and General St. Clair pro- 
mises to make every exertion for the sending of two 
or three hundred in a few days, whom, however, I 
am not to depend upon. 

I am myself going to the Head of Elk, and shall 
arrive there this evening. It has not been possible 
for me to leave sooner the city, as the three days I 
have remained here have been fully employed in 
making and forwarding preparations. Before I go I 
will wait on the Board of the Navy, and propose the 
sending of the frigates; but the Trumbull having not 
her complement of men, and those of the Ariel hav- 
ing mutinied at sea, I am afraid we shall find diffi- 
culties. 

The preparations made at New York; the return 
of the Aminta; the remasting of the Bedford; the 
impossibility M. Destouches is under to give us any 
farther assistance ; the uncertainty of what M. de 
Tilly may have determined before he had received 
your letter ; — such are, my dear General, the many 
reasons which, from a pretty certain expedition, have 
lately made a very precarious one. Under these cir- 
cumstances, indeed, there must always be more or 
less danger in going down the Bay, and venturing 
upon the low country about Portsmouth. 

Being unacquainted with the answer you have re- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 251 

ceived from Count cle Rochambeaii and M. Des- 
touches, I am not able to judge how far I may de- 
pend upon the same ship being ordered again to the 
Chesapeake, in case (before the reception of your 
letter) she had thought proper to sail. Her com- 
ing was not in consequence of your proposition ; her 
going was relative to the difficulties of an expedition 
very different from ours ; and I wish I might know, 
if, though M. Destouches cannot give further assist- 
ance, this assistance at least may be depended upon, 
so as to hope for the return of the ship, should M. 
de Tilly have left the Bay. The bottom of the Bed- 
ford is said to be damaged, the Aminta was said to 
have been dismasted. Suppose those circumstances 
were true, they would be in our favor. 

If a detachment was to go from New York to 
Portsmouth, AVest Point would be left in danger. If 
Cornwallis continues advancing, perhaps our being in 
the neighbourhood of Arnold may be of service. I 
will, however, confine myself literally to my instruc- 
tions ; and if Colonel Gouvion writes mo with certain- 
t}'^, that M. de Tilly is gone, if I am not led to sup- 
pose he will return, I will march back the detach- 
ment. For the present, I am going on, because, upon 
the increasing of the enemy's force at Gardiner's 
Bay, you recommend despatch to me. 

I hope, however, that I shall hear from your Excel- 
lency, now that the chain is established. Colonel 
Pickering says, that in six days I may receive your 
answer at the Head of Elk. The hope of seeing the 
French ship again, or some other reason, may detain 
me. But your answer will determine my motions; 
and I can receive it by the 8th, which is about the 
time when it was thouo;ht we should arrive at the 
Head of Elk. My expectations are not great, and I 



252 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

think we have hut few chances for us. I shall make 
all possible despatch, and listen particularly to the 
voice of prudence. However, some hazard must he 
run, if we undertake in these circumstances. 

General Duportail having not left this place, I am 
led to hope, that, if we do not go, I may return in 
time for the journey to Rhode Island. I most in- 
stantly beg, my dear General, you will favor me with 
an immediate answer. 

With the highest respect and most tender affection, 
I have the honor to be, &c. 

Lafayette. 

P. S. One of our transports from Trenton had got 
aground ; but the troops on board of her will still be 
in time at the Head of Elk. Some new difficulties 
have been made for the collecting of shoes, but I 
will try to get over them. From the extraordinary 
motions of Lord Cornwallis, whom we have not heard 
of these many days, and from the movements in New 
York, I am led to hope that I shall hear from you 
respecting my future conduct, and that I may be at 
head-quarters before you think it prudent to leave 
New Windsor. 



FROM JOHN SULLIVAN, IN CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 6 March, 1781. 

Dear General, 
I was duly honored with your Excellency's fwor of 
the 4tli of February, and omitted writing since upon 
a supposition that j^ou had gone to Rhode Island. I 
am happy to find your Excellency entertains the same 
sentiments of the virtues and abilities of Colonel 
Hamilton, as I have ever done myself After I wrote 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 253 

your Excellency, I found the ej^es of Congress turn- 
ed on Robert JMorris, of this city, as Financier. I did 
not therefore nominate Colonel Hamilton, as I foresaw 
it would be but a vain attempt. I shall this day 
nominate him as Secretary of Foreign Affairs, in 
which, I think, I shall meet. the approbation of most 
of the States. 

The choice of a Minister of "War is postponed to 
the first of October. This was a manoeuvre of Samuel 
Adams and others from the north, fearing that, as I 
was in nomination, the choice would fall on me, who, 
having apostatized from the true New England faith, 
'by sometimes voting with the Southern States, am 
not eligible. They were not, however, acquainted with 
all the circumstances. I was nominated against my 
will, and, if chosen, should not have accepted. Gene- 
ral McDougall is appointed Minister of Marine. The 
plans of finance and all other matters go on so slow- 
ly, that I tremble at the consequences. I am morti- 
fied at the useless harangues, which consume our time 
to no purpose. I am now endeavouring to obtain an 
adjournment of Congress, and for leaving a Committee 
to transact the business, as the only way of having 
the public business done with propriety and despatch. 
I fully agree with your Excellency, that Congress 
ought to have more power; but I also think that the 
old members should be in Heaven, or at home, before 
this takes place. 

The traffic carried on with the enemy is alarming, 
as it not only serves to furnish them with necessaries, 
but tends to reconcile our citizens to the idea of re- 
newing their connection with Great Britain, and of 
course disaffects them to our government. 

Since General Greene's letter of the 15th of Febru- 
ary, we have received advices from Governor Jefferson, 
VOL. III. 22 



254 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

and divers others, that Cornwallis is retreating, that 
General Greene crossed the river in pursuit of him 
the 21st, and that the militia had collected all round 
him. I hope it is not a manoeuvre to bring General 
Greene to an action. 

I have been settling my accounts with the Treasury- 
Board, and find I stand charged with money received 
at Cambridge, to pay the bounty to the New Hamp- 
shire recruits in 1776. All my papers were lost at 
New York, and I can remember little of the matter. 
This I am sure of, that I never received any public 
money, but what I immediately applied to the use 
intended. Perhaps Colonel Harrison has some papers 
which will settle the matter. I also am charged with 
the money paid for the troops engaged at Trenton, 
in December, 1776. I remember the whole of this 
was settled at Morristown about two months after, and 
I received a receipt in full, which is in New Hamp- 
shire. Perhaps your papers may save me the trouble 
of sending for it. I have the honor to be. 

With the highest esteem, dear General, yours, &c., 

John Sullivan. 



FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Head of Elk, 7 March, 1781. 

My DEAR General, 
Contrary winds, heavy rains, disappointments of ves- 
sels, and every inconvenience for which we had no 
remedy, have been, from the day of my arrival, com- 
bined against our embarkation. I hope, however, we 
shall be on board to-morrow morning ; and, as nothing 
certain has been heard from the French ships, no time 
will be lost on our part for the celerity of the ex- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 255 

pedition. The troops will embark five miles below 
this place, and three miles higher up than the point 
where General Howe landed. There will be more 
room for the arrangement of our vessels, and the shal- 
lowness of water insures us against the enterprises of 
any vessel of force. In this situation we may wait 
for intelligences from our friends. 

The State of Maryland have made to me every of- 
fer in their power. I will improve this opportunity 
of making up some deficiencies in the Quarter-master's 
and Engineer's departments, and of insuring to us a 
good stock of provisions. Upon the intelligence re- 
ceived that Baron Steuben was gone with a large de- 
tachment to the southward, I had hinted the possibi- 
lity of getting some militia from the lower counties, 
and repairing some cannon at Baltimore. But, having 
read the inclosed letter from the Baron, I will write 
again to Governor Lee (as my letter has been gone 
but two days), and save the State from any expense 
of that kind. 

To the obtaining of the vessels, has been joined 
the difficulty of getting them up the river, as they 
were taking every opportunity to slip off. All the 
vessels, three excepted, are only Bay crafts, and our 
Admiral ship mounts twelve guns. I have prepared 
some kind of orders for that fleet, but hope to be re- 
lieved from my naval command by the arrival of a 
French frigate, and have, at all events, sent for Com- 
modore Nicholson, of Baltimore. Mr. McHenry has 
been very active in accelerating the measures of his 
State. 

By a letter from Colonel Gouvion, dated Wicomico 
River, I find that, after many adventures, he had 
landed there on the 4th, and was proceeding by land 
to his destination. The wind is fair enough to come 



256 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

up the Bay, and I hope soon to hear from our friends. 
The inclosed letter from the Baron, having first come 
into my hands, and being on public service, as it was 
written upon io he forwarded uith desjxdch, I took the 
liberty to open it, but was very sorry to have done 
it after a letter of the same date had come also to 
my hands. Both say the same thing (at least in 
every material point), and I am happy to find that 
the Baron's preparations are going on rapidly. 

Whatever may be the Baron's opinion upon the 
facility of taking, sword in hand, the fortifications at 
Portsmouth, I will not hazard any thing before I have 
considered the matter with my own eyes. Arnold had 
so much time to prepare, and plays so deep a game; 
nature has made the position so respectable ; and some 
of the troops under his orders have been in so many 
actions, — that I do not flatter mj^self to succeed so 
easily as it may be thought. The prospect of pre- 
serving naval superiority must, I think, decide, if we 
are to have blood shed by regular approaches, or to 
risk our men in the dangers of an assault. But I 
would like to destroy the works in some measure, 
before we attempt to storm them. A conversation 
with the Baron, with Colonel Gouvion, and some other 
officers, joined to what I can see myself, will better 
fix my mind on the matter than it can be at present. 

When I left Philadelphia, General Wayne was not 
far from hoping he could soon collect a thousand 
men. But I am not so sanguine in my expectations. 
I am, however, trying to prepare matters for these 
men, but think that a sufficiency of vessels (unless 
ours are sent back) will not be obtained within a few 
days. Let General Wayne arrive in time, or not, 
when he comes under my direction I wish to know, 
if, in case we succeed, he must be sent on to Gene- 



THE AMERICAN KEVOLUTION. 257 

ral Greene. Supposing he is to go tliere, would your 
Excellency think of selecting some riflemen for the 
Grand Army ? It seems to me that I heard you once 
mentioning this matter. 

The State of Virginia, I am told, finds difficulties 
in the keeping of prisoners. Suppose something of 
the kind was stated to me, am I to alter any thing 
in what you said to me on the subject ? I am in a 
great hurry to go, my dear General, but, let us suc- 
ceed or fail in the object we have in view, I shall 
not be less hurried to return with the detachment to 
head-quarters, where I hope to be again as soon as 
you may possibly expect. 

With the highest respect, and most tender affec- 
tion, I have the honor to be, my dear General, &c., 

Lafayette. 

P. S. I beg you will present my respects to Mrs. 
Washington and Mrs. Hamilton, and my compliments 
to the family. 



FROM GOVERNOR JEFFERSON. 

Richmond, 8 March, 1781. 

Sir, 
I had the pleasure of receiving a letter from Ge- 
neral Greene, dated High Rock Ford, February 29 
(probably March 1), who informs me, that, on the 
night of the 24th, Colonel McCall surprised a subal- 
tern's guard, at Hart's Mill, killed eight, and wound- 
ed and took nine prisoners ; and that, on the 25th, 
General Pickens and Lieutenant-Colonel Lee routed a 
body of near three hundred Tories, on the Haw River, 
who were in arms to join the British army, killed 

22* 



258 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

upwards of one hundred, and wounded most of the 
rest, which had liad a very happy effect on the dis- 
affected in that country. 

By a letter from Major Magill, an officer of this 
State, whom I had sent to General Greene's head- 
(juarters, for the purpose of giving us regular intelli- 
gence, dated Guilford county, March 2d, I am in- 
formed that Lord Cornwallis, on his retreat, erected 
the British standard at Hillsborough ; that a num- 
ber of disaffected, under the command of a Colonel 
Piles, were resorting to it, when they were intercept- 
ed by General Pickens and Lieutenant-Colonel Lee, 
as mentioned by General Greene, and that their Com- 
manding Officer was among the slain ; that Lord 
Cornwallis, after destroying every thing he could at 
Hillsborough, moved down the Haw Ptiver ; that Ge- 
neral Greene was within six miles of him ; that our 
superiority in the goodness, though not the number 
of cavalry, prevented the enemy from moving witli 
rapidity or foraging. Having desired Major Magill 
to be particular in informing me what corps of mili- 
tia, from this State, joined General Greene, he ac- 
cordingly mentions that seven hundred men, under 
General Stevens, and four hundred from Botetourt, 
had actually joined General Greene ; that Colonel 
Campbell was to join him that day with six hundred, 
and Colonel Lynch, with three hundred from Bedford, 
were shortly expected ; the last three numbers being 
riflemen. Besides these mentioned by Major Magill, 
General Lawson must, before that time, have crossed 
the Boanoke with a body of militia, the number of 
which has not been stated to me. Beport makes 
them one thousand, but I suppose the number to be 
exaffgerated. Four hundred of our new levies left 
Chesterfield Court-House on the 25th of February, 



TPIE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 259 

and probably would cross the Roanoke about the 1st 
or 2d of March. 

I was honored with your Excellency's letter of 
February 21st, within seven days after its date. We 
have, accordingly, been making every preparation on 
our part, which we were able to make. The militia, 
proposed to operate, will be upwards of four thousand 
from this State, and one thousand or twelve hundred 
from Carolina, said to be under General Gregory. 
The enemy are at this time in a great measure 
blockaded by land, there being a force on the east 
side of Elizabeth River. Though they have a free 
exit from Elizabeth River, they suffer for provisions, 
as they are afraid to venture far enough to maraud 
in any great degree, lest the French squadron should 
be in their neighbourhood, and come on them. Were 
it possible to block up the river, a little time would 
suffice to reduce them by want and desertions, and 
would be more sure in its event than an attempt by 
storm. I shall be very happy to have it in my power 
to hand you a favorable account of these two ar- 
mies in the south. I have the honor to be, with the 
greatest esteem and respect, &c., 

TnojLvs Jefferson. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Head- Quarters, Iron Works, Norlli Carolina, 
10 March, 1781. 

Sir, 
Since 1 had the honor of addressing your Excel- 
lency last, there have been some changes in our cir- 
cumstances. On the 2d, LieutenanlrColonel Lee, with 
a detachment of riflemen, attacked the advance of the 



260 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

Britisli army under Colonel Tarleton, near Alamanee, 
and killed and wounded, by report, about thirty of 
them. On the 6th, the British moved down towards 
High Rock, either with a view to intercept our 
stores, or cut o£f the light infantry from the main 
body of the army, then advanced near seven miles ; 
but they were handsomely opposed, and suffered con- 
siderably, without effecting any thing. 

This manoeuvre occasioned me to retire over the 
Haw River, and move down the north side of it, 
with a view to secure our stores coming to the army, 
and to form a junction with several considerable re- 
enforcements of Carolina and Virginia militia, and 
one regiment of Virginia eighteen-months' men, on 
the march from Hillsborough to High Rock. I ef- 
fected this business, and the enemy retired towards 
Guilford Court-House. Our militia had been upon 
such a loose and uncertain footing ever since we 
crossed the Dan, that I could attempt nothing with 
confidence, though we kept within ten or twelve 
miles of the enemy for several days. The enemy 
kept close, seemingly determined that we should 
gain no advantage of them without risking something 
of consequence. I have the honor to be, with great 
respect and esteem, &c., 

Nathanael Greene. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL PARSONS. 

Reading, 14 March, 1781. 

Dear General, 

In consequence of your Excellency's directions, I 
have to this time been pursuing the objects of the 
inquiry you have ordered ; but have not been able 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 261 

to make the discoveries wished for, with a sufEcieiit 
degree of precision to make any attempt to secure 
the persons concerned. 

I believe it is certain, that an association is formed 
to submit to the British Government on the terms of 
the last proclamation ; that the number of associators is 
daily increasing; that their names are transmitted to 
New York as often as opportunity presents ; that a 
register was kept of them in Newtown, but it is not 
certain that this register is now there, or can be 
found, if there ; that a mode of conforming, different 
from that pointed out in the proclamation, is adopted; 
that many persons are engaged in the service of the 
enemy, who are preparing to join them ; about forty 
have made attempts since I have been here, but 
were disappointed. Persons are also employed to en- 
list these men, and are in the pay of the enemy, 
with the promise of commissions. Regular stages of 
intelligence arc established from the shores through 
the country to Canada. Despatches have lately gone 
through those channels to Vermont. I think it will 
be exceedingly difficult to detect the plan in its ex- 
tent. So much caution is used by them, that my 
prospects are small of obtaining the register, or ex- 
posing to punishment any characters of importance. 
Some of their recruiting officers, some of the recruits, 
pilots, concealers of the enemy, and conveyers of de- 
spatches may be taken. 

In the course of my inquiries I have been inform- 
ed of a great number in Ilorseneck, Stamford, and 
Norwalk, who are supplying the enemy with provi- 
sions, who conceal them when they make their ex- 
cursions from Morrisania and Long Island, and who 
keep up a correspondence and trade with the party 
at Lloyd's Neck. About forty of these I know, who 



262 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

are now at home pursuing the same courses, and 
may be taken up; and I believe this is not a quar- 
ter part of those who are concerned, and, upon in- 
quiry, may be exposed. By these pernicious prac- 
tices, the morals of most of the young men in those 
towns have been dissipated, and a thirst for plunder 
and money has induced them to courses which have 
eventually driven many of them to the enemy. 

It has become difficult to know wdiat is best to be 
done in those towns. To make the inquiry thorough- 
ly, and take up all concerned, will drive great num- 
bers to the enemy ; and to omit it, will put the few 
well-afTected, wdio now remain there, w^holly in the 
power of the eneni}", notwithstanding every effort we 
can make to protect them. Whether it is best to 
apprehend all of them, or let them all remain, or to 
select out some who are most criminal, and punish 
them in the most exemplary manner, without disclos- 
ing the names of the other persons concerned, and 
try what effect that may have, — are doubts which I 
am unable to resolve. The same questions will arise 
respecting the associators, pilots, conveyers of intelli- 
gence, &c. In short, the evil has taken so deep root, 
it is become a subject of a very delicate nature, and 
difficult to know how far it is best to extend the in- 
quiries. 

The State have passed a law subjecting all persons 
coming into the State to plunder, and those who 
aid, assist, or in any way abet their measures, to 
trial by Courts-Martial; declaring those people not ex- 
changeable, and to inflict capital or other discretion- 
ary punishments upon them. I must request your 
Excellency's particular directions how far I shall pro- 
ceed in these matters, and what I shall do wdth the 
offenders, wdien apprehended. A temporary check may 



THE AMERICAN REA^OLUTION. 263 

be given to the intentions of the disaffected by se- 
curing a number of them at present ; but no radical 
remedy is yet in my power. 

I am persuaded they expect a descent on the 
coast in April, to favor their designs of joining the 
enemy, and furnishing supplies for them. What pro- 
bability there is of the event taking place, you 
must be much better informed of The spy, employed 
amongst them, has assurances of generous pay for all 
the time he employs and expenses incurred in this 
service ; of a handsome gratuity "when he has done 
what he can ; to be settled in some more secure 
place, if he is detected and obliged to fly from his 
present settlements (which will be the case, if he is 
discovered) ; and, if he succeeds in discovering the 
full extent of the plan, so that the concerned may 
be detected, and it shall prove to be as extensive as 
is supposed, he shall be gratified with an annuity of 
one hundred dollars per annum for life, as a reward 
for his services. I believe him faithful and indus- 
trious in making the discoveries necessary. 

If you think it best to delay taking up any of 
the concerned, until further discoveries are made, I 
should judge it most expedient for me to return to 
camp, leaving Captain Walker to prosecute the in- 
quiries, lest my continuing here should occasion jea- 
lousies. I can return again, when any thing is pre- 
pared for execution. 

I am, with great respect, &c., 

Samuel H. Parsons. 



264 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

York, 15 March, 1781. 

My dear General, 

The number of small frigates and privateers that 
are in the Bay, has made it impossible for me to car- 
ry the detachment farther down than Annapolis ; and 
I have requested the Governor of jMaryland, as well 
as the principal officers of the detachment, to give out 
that we were going to join General Greene. But the 
object of the expedition is so perfectly known every- 
where, that our sole dependence to keep Arnold must 
be upon the apprehension he has of a French fleet 
being cruising off the Capes. 

For my part, I came in a barge from Annapolis, 
and, very luckily, escaped the dangers that were in 
the way. Colonel Harrison will have given to your 
Excellency a minute detail of the reasons which have 
prompted me to this measure. I have taken his ad- 
vice in the matter, a,nd have no doubt but that your 
Excellency (considering the probability that no fri- 
gate would have been sent) will approve of the step 
I have taken, to forward as much as possible both 
the advantage of the expedition and the honor of 
the American arms. 

On my arrival yesterday afternoon, I found that 
Baron de Steuben had been very active in mak- 
ing preparations, and, agreeably to what he tells 
me, we shall have five thousand militia ready to 
operate. This, with the Continental detachment, is 
equal to the business, and we might very well do 
without any land force from Newport. 

By papers found in the baggage of a British offi- 
cer (taken in a boat), it seems that General Gregory 
had a correspondence with the enemy. The Baron has 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 265 

suspended liim, but lie is still with the troops. Ar- 
nold is so well acquainted with the coming of the 
detachment, and the object is so well known, that, as 
I said before, our only chance to keep him must be 
the idea of a French fleet being off the Capes. He 
is fortifying at Portsmouth, and trying to get provi- 
sions. There have been some trifling skirmishes with 
the militia. To my great disappointment, the French 
fleet have not yet appeared. If the project has not 
been given up, they must be expected every minute. 
They have had double the time which they wanted, 
and such winds as ought to have brought them in 
four days. 

I wanted to hold up the idea of my going to the 
southward ; but the Baron says that, if the detach- 
ment is not announced, the militia will desert. He 
wanted me to take the command immediately ; but I 
thought it more polite not to do it until the detach- 
ment arrives, or operations are begun. In your first 
letter to the Baron, I wish, my dear General, you 
would write to him that I have been much satisfied 
with his preparations. I want to please him, and 
harmony shidl be my first object. As in all cases 
(even this of my going to the southward, and coming 
here to make arrangements with the Baron), I would 
reconnoitre the enemy's works, I will take an oppor- 
tunity of doing it as soon as possible. They have 
not been, as yet, reconnoitred by the Baron, and I 
think it therefore more necessary for me to see with 
my own eyes. 

As I am just arrived, my dear General, I cannot 
give you a very exact account of matters. This let- 
ter I send by duplicate ; and have the honor to 
be, with the highest respect and most tender affec- 
tion, &c., Lafayette.

266 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Camp, near the Iron Works, 
10 miles from Guilford Court-House, 18 March, 1781. 

Sir, 

My letter to Congress, a copy of wliicli I inclose 
to your Excellency, will inform yon of an unsuccess- 
ful action "with Lord Cornwallis on the 15tli. Our 
prospects were flattering ; and had the North Carolina 
militia seconded the endeavours of their officers, vic- 
tory was certain. But they left the most advan- 
tageous position I ever saw, without scarcely firing a 
gun. None fired more than twice, and very few 
more than once, and near one half not at all. The 
Virginia militia behaved with great gallantry, and 
the success of the day seemed to be doubtful for a 
long time. The action was long and severe. 

In my former letters I inclosed to your Excellency 
the probable strength of the British army, since which 
they have been constantly declining. Our force, as 
you will see by the returns, was respectable ; and 
the probability of not being able to keep it long in 
the field, and the difficulty of subsisting men in this 
exhausted country, together with the great advan- 
tages which would result from the action, if we were 
victorious, and the little injury, if we were otherwise, 
determined me to bring on an action as soon as pos- 
sible. When both parties are agreed in a matter, all 
obstacles are soon removed. I thought the determi- 
nation warranted by the soundest principles of good 
policy, and I hope events will prove it so, though 
we were unfortunate. I regret nothing so much as 
the loss of my artillery, though it was of little use 
to us, nor can it be, in this great wilderness. How- 
ever, as the enemy have it, we must also. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 267 

Lord Cornwallis will not give up this country 
without being soundly beaten. I wdsh our force was 
more competent to the business. But I am in hopes, 
by little and little, to reduce him in time. His 
troops are good, well found, and fight with great ob- 
stinacy. 

I am very happy to hear the ISIarquis de Lafayette 
is coming to Virginia, though I am afraid, from a 
hint in one of Baron Steuben's letters, he will think 
himself injured in being superseded in the command. 
Could the Marquis join us at this moment, we should 
have a glorious campaign. It would put Lord Corn- 
wallis and his whole army into our hands. I am 
also happy to hear, that the Pennsylvania line are 
coming to the southward. The mutiny in that line 
was a very extraordinary one. It is reported here 
to have proceeded from the great cruelty of the offi- 
cers. A member of Congress wTites this j but I be- 
lieve it to be so far from the truth, that I am per- 
suaded it originated rather through indulgence than 
from any other cause. 

Vii'ginia has given me every support I could wdsh, 
or expect, since Lord Cornwallis has been in North 
Carolina; and nothing has contributed more to this 
than the prejudice of the people in favor of your 
Excellency, which has been extended to me from the 
friendship you have been pleased to honor me with. 
The service here is extremely severe, and the officers 
and soldiers bear it with a degree of patience that 
does them the highest honor. I have never taken 
off my clothes since I left the Pedee. I was taken 
with a fainting last night, owing, I imagine, to ex- 
cessive fatigue and constant watching. I am better 
to-day, but far from being well. 

I have little prospect of acquiring much reputation 



268 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

while I labor under so many disadvantages. I hope 
my friends will make just allowances ; and as for vul- 
gar opinion, I regard it not. Neither time nor health 
will permit me to write your Excellency upon many 
matters which are upon my mind. I beg my best 
respects to Mrs. Washington. 

With esteem and regard I am, &c., 

Nathanael Greene. 



FROM COLONEL LAURENS. 

Passy, near Paris, 24 IVIarch, 1781. 

My dear General, 

Upon my arrival here, I found that our Minister 
Plenipotentiary had received the instructions, &c., 
transmitted to him, and commenced the negotiation 
with which we were charged; and that he had re- 
ceived the following communication from the Count 
de Vergennes. 

" It is impossible for his Majesty to favor a loan 
in this kingdom, because it would prejudice those 
which he has occasion to make himself for the sup- 
port of the war ; but his Majesty, to give the United 
States a signal proof of his friendship, grants them 
under the title of a donation, six millions of livres 
tournois. As the American army is in want of arms, 
clothing, &c., Mr. Franklin will be so good as to give 
a note of those articles; they will be procured of 
the best quality, and at the most reasonable price. 
General Washington will be authorized to give drafts 
for the remaining sum; but the drafts must be at 
long sight, in order to facilitate the payments from 
the Royal Treasury. The Courts of Petersburg and 
Vienna have offered their mediation. The King has 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 269 

answered, that it would be personally agreeable to 
him, but that he could not as yet accept it, because 
he has allies whose concurrence is necessary. Mr. 
Franklin is requested to communicate the overture 
and answer to Congress, and to engage them to send 
their instructions to their Plenipotentiaries. It is sup- 
posed the Congress will accept the mediation with 
eagerness." 

After my first interview with the Count de Ver- 
gennes, I presented to him a Memorial/'' in which I 
transcribed the principal part of the letter your Ex- 
cellency delivered to me ,at New Windsor, and repre- 
sented the insufiiciency of the succour proposed by his 
Majesty. I have since given in an extract of the 
estimate of the Board of War, accompanied with a 
letter, urging the necessity of despatch in furnishing 
those essential supplies. My personal solicitations 
have not been wanting to induce a prompt and fa- 
vorable answ^er; but M. de Maurepas and the Count 
de Vergennes both inform me, that nothing can be 
determined until the return of M, de Castries, who 
is expected the day after to-morrow; that the matter 
must be deliberated, and they will consider what can 
be done. M. Necker will be consulted to-day. 

M. de Vergennes complains very much of the ex- 
cessive demands of Congress, and seems to entertain 
an idea that they wish to throw too much of the 
burden of the war on their ally. He says that the 
exertions and expense with which France supports 
the war in different parts of the world, fully employ 
her means ; that her public credit has its limits, to 
surpass which would be fatal to it. 

Upon the whole, my expectations are very mode-

lution, Vol. IX. p. 211.

rate. The naval dispositions were made before my 
arrival; five ships of the line for the East Indies 
with troops ; twenty, commanded by De Grasse, for 
the West Indies, twelve of which are to proceed to 
America. They will probably arrive on our coast in 
July. We have no news yet of their departure. 

Your Excellency will see that I have written in a 
great hurry. In my next, I hope to be able to give 
you more particular intelligence of our affairs. In 
the mean time, I take the liberty of troubling you to 
present my respects to Mrs. Washington, my love to 
the family and the Marquis de Lafayette, the want 
of whose letters is a great disadvantage to me. My 
only hope of obtaining additional succour is founded 
on the exalted opinion which the Ministers have of 
your Excellency, and every thing which comes from 
you. 

I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect 
and most tender attachment, &c., 

John Laurens. 



FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Williamsburg, 25 March, 1781. 

My dk\r General, 

My letter of the 23d to your Excellency will, I 
hope, be safely transmitted, as the bearer of it. Major 
McLane, assured me that in case he was obliged to 
lose the despatch-boat, he could find means to get 
ashore and forward the despatches by land.^'^" In that 
letter, I gave to your Excellency an account of what 
had passed since I left Annapolis, and communicated 

* See this letter in Washington's Writings, Yol. VII. p. 509. 



THE AMERICAN KEVOLUTION. 271 

the intelligence of a British fleet having anchored in 
Lynn Haven Bay. This account, however, you will 
have sooner received from the Governor of Virginia, 
than you might possibly from me. My position with 
the troops near Portsmouth being intended to recon- 
noitre the works, and get, on board of ships in Hamp- 
ton Road, intelligence from the Capes was more speed- 
ily forwarded through Williamsburg, than it might 
have been in going around to Suffolk. 

;My surprise at not hearing of the French fleet was, 
I confess, very great, nor could I reconcile my mind 
to this uncertainty. But intelligence, received yester- 
day, has put it out of doubt, that they have done 
their best endeavours towards the cooperation ; and my 
accounts being gathered from many quarters, and 
some men who were at the first engagement, your 
Excellency may depend upon their veracity. 

On the 16th instant, both fleets fell in near the 
Capes with each other. They both consisted of eight 
ships of the line, fifties included, with the difference 
of twenty guns in favor of the enemy. Each ship of 
the line, and each frigate, singly engaged a partner, 
and the action lasted during three glasses. The ene- 
my had two seventy-fours, much worsted ; one of them 
had sixty-five men killed. The London suflered in 
her rigging, and the British fleet sheered off for the 
Chesapeake, while the French stood in a line formed 
in good order. The enemy have sent their wounded 
up to Portsmouth, taken all the sailors and marines 
at that place, and refitted their damaged ships. They 
were also reenforced from Portsmouth by the Charon, 
a forty-four, that can be made a fifty, and two large 
frigates. But it appears that our allies are determin- 
ed to carry the point, and that the addition to the 
British force has not prevented them from appearing 



272 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

near the Capes. Last morning the whole British 
fleet, with the reenforcement, went to sea, and about 
eleven o'clock we heard a furious cannonade, which 
lasted more than three hours. 

The action must have been bloody and obstinate. 
Upon its event depends the fate of our expedition. 
I wish it had been in my power not to make your 
Excellency a partaker of our anxiety, until I might 
have known on what side victory has been. But the 
fresh winds that blew last night make it impossible 
to have any account this morning. I shall, therefore, 
send off the present intelligence, which has come last 
night to hand; and, as expresses with proper officers 
are stationed at Hampton, I shall speedily forward 
every account that appears to be certain and inte- 
resting. 

I have directed that Arnold be circumscribed within 
his works on both sides of the Dismal Swamp. 
The water is still open to him, but every armed ves- 
sel in the river is getting ready to do what little 
service can be expected from them. The detachment 
at Annapolis is also ordered to be in the most per- 
fect readiness. With the highest respect, 

I have the honor to be, &c., 

L-IFAYETTE. 



FROM THE CHEVALIER DE LA LUZERNE. 

(Translation.) 

Philadelplila, 27 March, 1781. 

Sir, 

I have the honor to send to your Excellency an 

open packet for the Count de Rochambeau. You will 

there find the copy of a letter to me from M. Des- 

touches. I lament the ill success of an expedition. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 273 

which, if it had succeeded, would have been doubly 
agreeable to us by its utility to our allies, and by 
the honor it would have reflected upon the arms of 
the King. As to the rest, it appears that our Com- 
manders have fulfilled this latter point; and all the 
world is satisfied that, having a superior force to 
contend against, the manner of the contest has been 
highly honorable to them. 

I w^ait for happier events. Sir, from the campaign 
which is now about to open ; and I doubt not the 
Count de Rochambeau has given you, in detail, the 
news which he has received from France. 
I have the honor to be, &c., 

LUZER^^E. 



FROM COLONEL BRODHEAD. 

Fort Pitt, 27 March, 1781, 

Dear General, 

I am honored wdth your favor of the 28th ultimo, 
and am thankful for the contents. I have acknow- 
ledged the receipt of your letter of the 29th of De- 
cember, and shall give every encouragement to Gene- 
ral Clark's intended enterprise. I wdsh he may be 
in readiness before the waters fail, and the Kentucky 
settlements are destroyed by the enemy. But I am 
informed that little or nothing hath as yet been done 
at his boat-yards, and that the militia he expected 
from this side of the mountain are availing them- 
selves of the unsettled jurisdiction. 

Since my last, a small paper was brought to me 
by some faithful Indians, who found it rolled up very 
neatly in a powder-horn, which a disaffected person 
had lost near the waters of the Sandusky. I take 



274 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

the liberty to inclose a copy of it. I have discover- 
ed the writer, and put him in irons; but as, too pro- 
bably, some of the garrison are concerned, he may 
escape before he meets the reward of his demerit. 
Indeed, this place is infested with such a set of dis- 
affected inhabitants, that I have been under the ne- 
cessity of ordering some away, and others must soon 
follow, to prevent greater injury to the service. 

A number of Delaware Indians, from Coochocking, 
have been here since my last, and appear to be as 
friendly as ever. I am persuaded that a few are 
well affected ; but they are now put to the trial, by 
being ordered to remove hither without loss of time, 
and remain under our protection, where their daily 
transactions will be seen and known. 

I have called upon the county Lieutenants for a 
few of the militia ; and if I am not disappointed as 
usual, I intend to surprise the Indian towns about 
Coochocking. Two Delaware Indians, who, in their 
cups, spoke contemptuously of our service, I have 
confined in irons ; but I am at a loss what farther to 
do with them, until I see what number joins us, and 
hear what their general conduct has been. Immedi- 
ately after the termination of the intended excursion, 
I will avail myself of your indulgence to represent 
the state of things in this district. I have the honor 
to be, with the most perfect respect and esteem, &c., 

Daniel BRODiiE.iD. 

P. S. By the arrangement, it appears that Captain 
Brady is arranged in the third Pennsylvania regi- 
ment ; but, as he cannot be more useful than he is 
in this part of the country, I hope he will be per- 
mitted to remain until the campaign is closed. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 275 

FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL KNOX. 

New Windsor, 27 March, 1781. 

Sir, 

There being no established principles to govern the 
appointments to the vacancies of officers in the artil- 
lery, some doubts have arisen since the last regula- 
tion of the army, whether the right of appointment 
is in Congress, as generally has been the case, or in 
the States in which the regiments of artillery are ap- 
portioned, as part of their quotas. This uncertainty 
has operated to the prejudice of the service, by keep- 
ing vacant many second Lieutenantcies, which are 
highly necessary to be filled, as there is a great de- 
ficiency of officers of that rank. 

The regiments of artillery having different origins, 
the appointments, of course, have been derived from 
different authorities. Colonels Lamb's and Crane's 
regiments were raised, and the officers appointed, by 
virtue of powers given your Excellency in December, 
1776. Colonel Harrison's regiment was raised and 
appointed by the State of Virginia, under the author- 
ity of Congress. Colonel Proctor's was originally 
raised by Pennsylvania, as a State regiment, and af- 
terwards taken upon the Continental establishment 
by a resolve of Congress. The new appointments, 
which have taken place since the first formation of 
the regiments, have been made by Congress, in con- 
sequence of the request and certificates of the officers 
commanding regiments, countersigned by the General 
Officer commanding the corps. 

The promotions have been regimental to, and in- 
cluding, the rank of Captains, and to Field-Officers in 
the line of the corps at large. It is this principle 
which connects the regiments of artillery, and forms 



276 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

them into one corps, and which, if taken away, will 
reduce it to so many distinct regiments, independent 
of each other, without cement or any other quality 
which will enhance its utility and reputation. If the 
States interfere in the appointments, it is apparent 
the connection between the different regiments will 
be destroyed ; for the same power, which has a right 
to appoint, will claim a right to promote in case of 
vacancies; one is the consequence of the other. The 
distinction between the right of appointment and pro- 
motion, is too nice to be observed, or rather cannot 
be made. 

We have the experience of our own service, in ad- 
dition to that of others, that rank is esteemed an 
unalienable right, and the acquisition of it the high- 
est reward of military virtue. The principles of pro- 
motion, therefore, ought to be fixed and certain, and 
so clear as not to be liable to be misunderstood. 
The artillery, being composed of troops from differ- 
ent States, no one State can have the direction of 
the promotion of the whole, or even a part ; as a 
single promotion must affect the whole line. Con- 
gress only, with propriety, can make the appoint- 
ments and promotions. 

The qualifications requisite for an officer of artil- 
lery being materially different from those for an offi- 
cer of infantry, great care ought to be taken that 
none are appointed but such as possess a proper 
proportion of knowledge of the mathematics, and 
other necessary abilities for the nature of the service. 
It is from the talents of the officers of artillery, im- 
proved by experience, that America may expect to 
derive an essential part of her military character. 
That the greatest caution should be observed in 
making the appointments, I would humbly propose 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 277 

that they should originate with the Colonels of the 
regiments, who shall certify that the person recom- 
mended appears possessed of a proper proportion of 
mathematical knowledge, and such other qualifications 
as to make a good officer of artillery, and that this 
certificate should be countersigned hy the General 
Officer commanding the corps, and by him transmit- 
ted to Congress ; that the promotions should be re- 
gimental to Captains, and to Field-Officers in the line 
of the corps at large ; and that the principles of the 
appointments and promotions be expressed in the most 
explicit terms. 

I am persuaded, that unless the Honorable Con- 
gress immediately establishes a system for the ap- 
pointments and promotion of artillery, the corps will 
soon be involved in the utmost confusion. The best 
of the officers, seeing the uncertainty of promotion, 
will be disgusted, and leave the service ; and the pre- 
sent state of the artillery, which has been the work 
of years, may be ruined in an hour, by the prema- 
ture promotion of an individual State. If your Ex- 
cellency should view this matter in the same point 
of light, I beg you would be pleased to make such 
a representation to Congress, as may prevent the 
evils apprehended. 

I have the honor to be, with the highest respect 
and esteem, &c., 

Henry Knox. 

from major-general greene. 

Head-Quarters, at Colonel Ramsay's, 
on Deep River, 29 March, 1781. 

Sir, 
Inclosed, I send your Excellency a copy of my 
letter to Congress, for your information respecting

278 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

the operations in tliis department. The Marquis de 
Lafayette has arrived in Virginia ; but I believe his 
troops are still in Mar^dand. Some days since I sent 
Colonel Morris to confer with the Marquis, and see 
if he has your Excellency's permission to go farther 
southward. I received a letter from him on the 
road, acquainting me that there was an account from 
Richmond, of Admiral Arbuthnot's arriving in the 
Chesapeake, with six ships of the line and upwards 
of thirty transports, with a considerable reenforce- 
ment. If this report is true, our flattering prospects 
are at an end in that quarter. Nothing more can be 
expected than confining the enemy in their fortifica- 
tions. It would afford me great relief, if the detach- 
ment under the Marquis could proceed farther south- 
ward. But I fear the state of the Northern army 
will not admit of this, nor am I informed of the lati- 
tude your Excellency had given him on that subject. 
The regular troops will be late in the field, if they 
are raised at all. Virginia, from the unequal opera- 
tion of the law for drafting, is not likely to get 
many soldiers. Maryland, as late as the loth of this 
month, had not got a man ; nor is there a man raised 
in North Carolina, or the least prospect of it. In 
this situation, remote from reenforcements, inferior to 
the enemy in numbers, and no prospect of support, I 
am at a loss what is best to be done. If the enemy 
falls down towards Wilmington, they will be in a 
position where it would be impossible for us to injure 
them, if we had a force. In this critical and distress- 
ing situation, I am determined to carry the war imme- 
diately into South Carolina. The enemy will be oblig- 
ed to follow us, or give up their posts in that State. 
If the former takes place, it will draw the war out 
of this State, and give it an opportunity to raise 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 279 

its proportion of men. If they leave their posts to fall, 
they must lose more there than they can gain here. 
If we continue in this State, the enemy will hold 
their possessions in both. All things considered, I 
think the movement is warranted by the soundest 
reasons, both political and military. The manoeuvre 
will be critical and dangerous, and the troops ex- 
posed to every hardship. But, as I share it with 
them, I hope they will bear up under it with that 
magnanimity which has already supported them, and 
for which they deserve every thing of their country. 
I expect to be ready to march in about five days, 
and have written to General Sumpter to collect the 
militia to aid the operations. I am persuaded the 
movement will be unexpected to the enemy, and I 
intend it shall be as little known as possible. Our 
baggage and stores, not with the army, I shall order 
by the route of Saura Towns and Shallow Ford, to 
Charlotte. By having them in the upper country, we 
shall always have a safe retreat, and from those in- 
habitants we may expect the greatest support. I 
shall take every measure to avoid a misfortune. But 
necessity obliges me to commit m^^self to chance ; 
and, I trust, my friends will do justice to my repu- 
tation if any accident attends me. 

I am, with the greatest respect, &c., 

Nathanael Greene. 

P. S. Inclosed, I send you a general return of 
the army. 



280 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM PHILIP SCHUYLER. 

Albany, 3 April, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 

Your Excellency's obliging favor of the 23d of last 
month I had the pleasure to receive on the 31st fol- 
lowing. It was exceedingly mortifying to me, that 
the Senate was so thin of members when your lady 
honored us with a visit, that my attendance could 
not be dispensed wdth, even for a day. I was, conse- 
quently, deprived of affording that attention which 
inclination, esteem, and the most friendly feelings, 
impelled me to. She saw my embarrassments, and, 
with a good nature and complaisance which at once 
charmed and captivated, made every allowance. 

The motives which led Congress to postpone filling 
the War department have leaked out, and been com- 
municated to me. General Gates w^as in nomination; 
but his friends, reflecting that the impropriety of ap- 
pointing him before he had exculpated himself from 
the imputation of misconduct in his command, would 
be too glaring an abuse of power, deferred it, in 
hopes that, by an acquittal, the public confidence will 
be restored to him. But surely the gentlemen who 
intend him the office, neither consult his reputation 
nor the public interest. Not the former, because his 
inability to discharge it wdll certainly draw disgrace 
on him ; nor that of the latter, for, if even he was 
competent, he ought to be precluded, as the invete- 
rate enmity which he bears to you, and wdiich will 
influence him the more for being groundless, will lead 
him, without hesitation, to reject or thwart the most 
salutary measures you may propose. Gracious God! 
How much it is to be lamented that rulers, charged 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 281 

with the affairs of an empire, will sacrifice the best 
interests of their constituents to little, narrow-minded 
prejudices, and local politics, favorable only to their 
unworthy sycophants ! That they will close their eyes 
to the evident advantages which would result from 
choosing men to fill the great offices of the State, 
who have a mutual confidence in each other, and will 
give mutual support to every measure calculated to 
promote the public weal. The man in question, I 
fear, will also embarrass the Financier ; for he has not 
the least idea of public economy in his composition, 
nor do I believe that they entertain much esteem for 
each other. 

I most sincerely lament that a plan so judiciously 
formed as that you mention in conj&dence, should be 
defeated by those Avho would have reaped so much 
credit from the success which would, in all human 
probability, have ensued, and the glory of having 
rendered so essential a service to the allied powers.''^ 
My heart realizes your feelings on the occasion, and

FROM GOVERNOR NASH. 

Newbern, 4 April, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 

I did myself the honor to write your Excellency 
a few lines from General Greene's camp, dated the 
18th ultimo, as the express was just going off, as I 
arrived at the General's. I hope you were good 
enough to excuse the hasty manner in which it ap- 
peared to have been written. I am now just arrived 
home from camp, and have the pleasure to acquaint 
you that our worthy and excellent General, with his 
little distressed though successful army, has in turn 
driven his Lordship over Cape Fear River. This he 
passed, as the General informs me, on the 28th, with 
great precipitation, leaving several dead of his late 
wounded, unburied, and leaving his bridge over the 
river undestroyed. The General was very near over- 
taking the enemy at this place, but says he must 
now make a halt, as a considerable part of the Vir- 
ginia militia were leaving him, and as his army was 
distressed for provisions. 

I have assured him that the powers of the State 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 283 

shall be exerted to the utmost to support him; and 
that, in aid of the provision made by law for the 
support of the army, I had, with the advice of my 
Council Extraordinary, demanded from the inhabit- 
ants of the whole State (those reduced by the con- 
tending armies excepted), one fifth part of all their 
bacon and other salted meat, and had appointed 
proper officers in every county to collect this contri- 
bution immediately. And as this State has lately 
suffered so much, and been in such imminent danger 
of being entirely overrun and ruined by the enemy, 
I have every reason to hope the requisition will meet 
with no opposition. 

The State is now busily employed in drafting 
their regulars for our four battalions ; and as the 
militia, by a late law, are subjected, in case they 
desert their colors in time of action and run away, 
to the condition of Continental soldiers during the 
war, we expect to derive some good from the evil 
they did in running away from the enemy in the 
action of the loth, at Guilford; and I am sorry, on 
this occasion, to acknowledge that the most important 
advantages were that day lost by the shameful con- 
duct of our men. All ranks of people here seem 
now fully sensible of the necessity of having a re- 
gular and well-appointed army, and that the country 
cannot be any other way effectually defended. The 
British, with their small force at Wilmington, still 
keep that post, and are kept in it by a party of our 
militia, who have once had a successful skirmish with 
them. It is pretty certain, from my last letters from 
General Greene, that Lord Cornwallis, with Ms army, 
is now at Cross Creek. The General does not hint 
what he expects will be his Lordship's next enter- 
prises. If the General allows him, it is not improba- 



284 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

ble lie will now take some rest. With the highest 
respect and esteem, 

I have the honor to be, &c., 

Abner Nash. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL STARK. 

Derryfield, 9 April, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 

The lingering illness, which occasioned my leaving 
camp, still attends me. But notwithstanding my phy- 
sical ills, I have undertaken the business of sending 
the recruits of this State to the army, and have de- 
tained several officers that were on furlough in the 
State, to conduct parties. I hope that this measure, 
which has every appearance to be for the public good, 
will meet your approbation. With this letter, I sup- 
pose you will be joined by about fifty levies. Between 
forty and fifty have already marched from Exeter, 
and I expect about fifty more will march, by the last 
of this week. 

A number of deserters have come voluntarily and 
delivered themselves up to me, since my arrival in 
the State. I could wish that their treatment might 
be as favorable as possible. I am persuaded, if an 
act of grace was published, a great number of sol- 
diers, now prevented from delivering themselves up, 
for fear of punishment, would return to their duty 
with pleasure. 

I attended the General Assembly last week, and 
urged all in my power their exertions for filling up 
the quota of troops for the army ; and am happy to 
acquaint you, that I think they will do as well as 
their abilities will permit. It is entirely uncertain, 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 285 

when I shall be able to join the army ; but as soon 
as the situation of my health will justify the measure, 
I shall lose no time in repairing to my duty. In 
the mean time, that health may attend you, and suc- 
cess your glorious undertakings, is the ardent wish 
of, my dear Sir, 

Your most obedient and very humble servant, 

John Stark. 



FROM COLONEL LAURENS. 

Passy, near Paris, 11 April, 1781. 

My dear General, 

Not to trouble your Excellency with a detail of 
writings, conferences, attendances, and imiDortunities, 
I pass at once to the result, as communicated to me 
by the Count de Vergennes. It is his most Christian 
Majesty's determination to guarantee a loan of ten 
millions of livres, to be opened in Holland, in favor 
of the United States, in addition to the gratuitous 
gift of six millions granted before my arrival, and 
four millions appropriated for the payment of bills of 
exchange drawn by Congress. The value of the cloth- 
ing, ordnance, and military stores, of which articles 
I have delivered an estimate, reduced in proportion 
to the quantities already obtained and forwarded by 
Dr. Franklin, is to be deducted from the six millions. 

The distance of the manufacturino- towns from the 
sea, renders it impossible to procure the woollen cloths 
at a short notice. The Marine department, which 
the JNIarquis de Lafayette imagined, from the similar- 
ity of uniforms, might be able to give us some assist- 
ance, has no reserve stores of this kind. The dif- 



286 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

ferent regiments in the land service proidde their own 
clothing; so that there will be unavoidable difficulties 
and delays in procuring the quantity demanded. 

I am using my utmost efforts to prevail upon the 
Ministers to advance the ten millions from the trea- 
sury of France, and avail themselves of the proposed 
loan in Holland, for replacing the sum. This arrange- 
ment, it appears to me, can be attended with no pos- 
sible inconvenience to the finances of France, and I 
need not add to your Excellency how invaluable this 
gain of time will be to America. I shall likewise 
endeavour to negotiate the ordnance and other mili- 
tary effects that may be supplied from the King's 
arsenal, on credit, to economize as much as possible 
the six millions. The Marquis de Castries has pro- 
mised to make immediate arrangements for forwarding 
the supplies, and has renewed his assurances that a 
naval superiority will exist on the American coast 
the ensuing campaign. But there are not those dis- 
positions made for maintaining it, that the success of 
the common cause demands ; and I am sorry to inform 
your Excellency, that the Ministry do not seem to 
approve of the siege of New York as an operation 
for the ensuing campaign. What may be the effect 
of farther and more particular conferences on the sub- 
ject, I cannot determine. 

Inclosed your Excellency will receive extracts of 
letters intercepted in a packet bound from Falmouth 
to New York. They were communicated to me by 
the Marquis de Castries, but do not appear to have 
made that impression on him and the rest of the 
Ministry which was reasonably to be expected. 

It mortifies me much, not to be able to announce 
to your Excellency the day of my departure from 
this country. It is impossible to express the impa- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 287 

tience which I feel to return to my military functions, 
and to have opportunities of proving to your Ex- 
cellency that I am unalterably, with the profoundest 
veneration and most tender attachment, 

Your Excellency's faithful aid, 

John Laurens. 

P. 8. I must trouble your Excellency to present 
my respects to Mrs. Washington, my love to the 
Marquis de Lafayette, Colonel Hamilton, and the rest 
of the family. 



FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE.* 

Susquehanna Ferry, 13 April, 1781. 

Dear General, 

Had your Excellency's answer to my letter of the 
8th been forwarded with an equal celerity w^ith your 
favor of the 6th, I should have received it before this 
time. But whatever change my new situation could 
make in your Excellency's dispositions, I thought it 
my duty in the meanwhile to obey the positive or- 
ders I had received. The troops are now crossing 
the feny, and will, with all possible speed, proceed to 
Richmond. 

By a letter just received from General Greene, I 
find that he is strongly of opinion that I must go to 
the southward. His intention is to carry the seat of 
war into South Carolina, thereby preventing a junc- 

* Tbe expedition to Virginia not having been carried into effect, 
Lafayette returned with his detaclimcnt to the Head of Elk, where he 
received orders from General Washinoton to march to the south, and 
put himself under the orders of General Greene. See two letters from 
him, dated April 8th and 18th, in Washington's Writings, Vol. VIII. 
p. 512, 513. 



288 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

tion between Arnold and Cornwallis. He gives me 
many excellent reasons to justify the movement. He 
requests me to move to Richmond ; and this will, if 
possible, increase my zeal to execute your Excel- 
lency's orders. General Greene's opinion is, that Lord 
Cornwallis will fall down towards Wilmington. His 
own project is, to carry the war into South Carolina. 
Under these circumstances a corps of light infantry, 
embarked at Philadelphia on board a light squadron, 
might have been upon the seat of war in a very 
short passage. I cannot help fearing, my dear Ge- 
neral, that our campaign will take a defensive turn, 
which is far from answering our first plans and ex- 
pectations. 

Major Macpherson is with me as a volunteer. That 
officer has most zealously employed himself, and has 
been most dangerously exposed in the discovery of a 
plot made to furnish the enemy with provisions. He 
has managed this matter with infinite address, being 
for two days and one night with six soldiers, w^ho, as 
well as himself, put on the air of British, and in 
company with a spy v/ho thought them to be the 
enemy ; and, by a most violent gale of wind, crossed 
the Bay in a small boat, by which means he was 
made sensible that a trade of flour is carried on with 
the enemy from the western shore of Maryland ; and 
saved a magazine of eight hundred barrels of Conti- 
nental flour, which would otherwise have fallen into 
the hands of the enemy. In case we proceed south- 
erly, perhaps it will be possible for General Greene 
to give Major Macpherson a command in some de- 
tachment; and I should be happy, if he was recom- 
mended to him by your Excellency. 

My determination being to go on with rapidity, 
unless I am recalled, your Excellency may easily 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 289 

judge of my movements from the answer I shall pro- 
bably receive in a few hours. Was I to assure your 
Excellency, that this journey is perfectly agreeable 
to the troops, I should not use that candor which 
you have so many rights to expect. But their zeal 
and discipline insure their readiness to obey. I shall 
do my utmost to prevent desertion; and, unless I am 
recalled, I shall proceed with celerity. But I beg 
your Excellency to remember, that experience has 
often taught us how much reduced has ever been 
the number of our troops, from the time of their de- 
parture to that of their arrival at the Southern army. 
With the highest and most affectionate respect, &c., 

Lafayette. 



FROM COLONEL PICKERING. 

Newburg, 14 April, 1781. 

Sir. 
I had the honor to inform you, on my return from 
Philadelphia, of what passed there relative to the 
means of procuring the numerous supplies requisite 
in my department for the ensuing campaign ; and 
was unhappy that no prospect was presented of my 
obtaining a single shilling for that end. As the only 
alternative, therefore, I submitted to your Excellen- 
cy's judgment the expediency of calling on the seve- 
ral States to furnish camp equipage for their own 
troops respectively; which proposal you was pleased 
to approve. This also corresponds with the articles 
of Confederation, wherein it is declared (article nine), 
that Congress shall make requisitions from each State 
for its quota of troops, which requisition shall be 
binding; and thereupon the Legislature of each State 

VOL. m. 25 



290 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

sliall appoint the regimental officers, raise the men, 
and clothe, arm, and equip them in a soldier-like 
manner, at the expense of the United States. 

I therefore now beg leave to lay before your Ex- 
cellency the inclosed estimates of tents, knapsacks, 
and haversacks requisite for the troops of the four 
New England States. If in this mode these can be 
supplied, the general provision made and making will 
be adequate to the demands of the other troops com- 
posing the main army. In these estimates I have 
omitted camp-kettles, because they are not to be pro- 
cured in the Eastern States, and I hope to obtain 
them from Pennsylvania. Canteens are making in 
Massachusetts for the whole main army. 

I have made the estimates in detail, that, by in- 
spection only, 3^our Excellency might judge of the 
propriety of the proposed allowances of camp equi- 
page. I thought, too, that in this form they would 
be more satisfactory to the States themselves than 
a general demand. I have the honor to be, with the 
greatest respect, 

Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

Timothy Pickering. 



FROM BARON STEUBEN. 

Chesterfield Court-House, 15 April, 1781. 

Sir, 
The expedition against Portsmouth having failed, 
my first care was to save those articles which had, 
at so much trouble and expense, been collected for 
that purpose. And here I must do justice to this 
State for their efforts on this occasion. I can, with 
truth, say that every possible preparation was made. 



THE AMERICAN HEVOLUTION. 291 

The expectations of the people were accordingly very 
great, but not so much so as the consternation they 
were thrown into by the arrival of the British fleet 
with a reenforcement. 

The Marquis has doubtless communicated to your 
Excellency the project I had formed before his de- 
parture. Lord Cornwallis being then in the environs 
of Hillsborough, I proposed to Government to march 
with the whole of the militia, and by forced marches 
cross the Roanoke, and, in conjunction with General 
Greene, fall on his Lordship before the enemy here 
could have time to form any plan. This manoeuvre, 
I flattered myself, would at least drive Cornwallis 
from North Carolina, and probably, by obliging Gene- 
ral Phillips to follow ns with all his force, have re- 
moved the seat of war from this State. 

I submitted this plan to the Marquis, to General 
Weedon, and to Colonel Gouvion, who approved it. 
On my way to Richmond I met Lieutenant-Colonel 
Morris, who came directly from General Greene. lie 
informed me that his Lordship had already begun 
to retire towards Cross Creek, and that General 
Greene wanted a reenforcement to enable him to 
pursue with vigor. This served to strengthen my 
opinion; and, as I had then upwards of four thousand 
militia together, I confined my requisition to two 
thousand men, whom I only required for thirty or 
forty days. The answer of Government to this pro- 
position I have the honor to inclose. The perplexity 
the arrival of the reenforcement had thrown them 
into, together with the Marquis's retiring at this 
juncture to the northward, made them reject every 
idea not tending to the immediate defence of the 
State. My situation here is not the most agreeable, 
obliged to undertake the defence against three thou 



292 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

sand regular troops, with notliing to oppose to them 
hut militia, whose numbers decrease every day. Those 
who have served since the Ibeginning of the invasion 
have discharged themselves, and are not yet replaced 
by others ; in consequence of which General Muhlen- 
berg is left on the south side of the river with only 
seven hundred men, and General Weedon on the 
north side with about six hundred men. If the ene- 
my have any intention to penetrate the country, the 
opposition we can make will avail little. 

A very great evil resulting from this invasion is, 
that it stops the recruiting for the army. So long 
as a county has any militia in the field, so long that 
county is prevented from drafting; and as most of the 
counties have had part of their militia either here or 
with General Greene, little or nothing has yet been 
done in the business. Only fifty-two have yet come 
in ; and of these some have already deserted. Some 
who came as substitutes have received twenty-five 
and thirty thousand pounds'^ for eighteen months. 

I am much at a loss w-hat to do for arms, when 
the recruits do come in. I had reckoned on those 
by M. de Tilly; and I must entreat your Excellency 
to order them on by land, as we have not the least 
prospect of a single musket any other way. We 
shall also be much distressed for ammunition. Gene- 
ral Greene presses me for a supply, whilst I can 
scarce find enough to supply the militia. The Mar- 
quis has sent one hundred thousand cartridges to 
Fredericksburg ; these I will take care to forward to 
General Greene. Your Excellency has, I presume, 
been informed that the lead mines have given out. 
This article is not now to be had here. If the East- 

* This amount was of course in the paper currency of the time. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 293 

ern States do not send us a supply, we shall be 
sadly at a loss. Powder is also scarce. A powder- 
mill, near this, was blown up some time since, sup- 
posed by an emissary of the enemy. I imagine 
Maryland would furnish some, on application of the 
Board of War. 

Another important and very difficult object is, re- 
mounting the cavalry. The Assembly have passed a 
law limiting the price of horses for the cavalry at 
five thousand pounds, a price inadequate to the pur- 
chase of the meanest horse. Verv indifierent horses, 
which have been impressed, have been valued from 
twenty to thirty thousand pounds and upwards. No- 
thing, therefore, can possibly be done till the meet- 
ing of the Assembly. The Southern army will re- 
quire, at least, three hundred cavalry horses for next 
campaign. I suppose thirty guineas to have been 
the old price of such horses. Allowing now forty 
guineas, the whole will amount to twelve thousand 
guineas. The price must be limited, or the Continent 
will not be able to pay the expense of remounting 
two regiments of cavalry. I beg your Excellency's 
directions for my guide in making a proper repre- 
sentation to the Assembly, which meets the 10th of 
next month. Swords will also be much wanted for 
the cavalry. I have ordered six hundred to be made 
at Mr. Hunter's works, but dare not reckon on them 
in time. Cartridge-boxes are an article the State 
cannot furnish. If possible, two thousand should be 
sent immediately from Philadelphia. 

The little success I have had in creating the line 
of this State, and in furnishing the necessary supplies 
for the Southern army, induced me to request Gene- 
ral Greene to call me to the army. He has, however, 
refused me, and in such a manner as to engage me, 

25=^ 



294 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

if possible, to redouble my zeal in assisting him from 
this quarter. I lament only that the invasion not 
only takes up a part of my attention, but prevents 
those succours which might otherwise be expected. 
The number of troops of this State diminishes great- 
ly. When I first arrived here, Colonel Buford had 
five hundred men with him. Since then, I have 
sent from hence eight hundred rank and file, exclu- 
sive of sergeants, music, waiters, and wagoners ; and, 
by Colonel Morris's account, they have not now 
more than seven hundred men in the field. Some 
speedy and effectual measures must be taken to stop 
such desertion, or it will be in vain to raise men at 
such an expense. 

I shall be much obliged to your Excellency to or- 
der the Commissary of Prisoners to send me, as soon 
as possible, a list of the southern officers exchanged, 
that I may order them to join. Many refuse to act, 
from not having received official accounts of their 
being exchanged. I inclose to your Excellency a re- 
presentation of the officers of the Virginia line against 
General Weedon. the propriety of which Congress and 
your Excellency will judge. A copy has been sent 
to the Board of War. The enemy, in Portsmouth, 
are busied in strengthening their works, and in build- 
ing boats. They have, also, some parties in Princess 
Ann, and about five hundred men in Norfolk. 

I have the honor to be, &c., 

Steuben.

FKOM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Alexandria, 23 April, 1781. 

My dear General, 

Great happiness is derived from friendship ; and I 
do particularly experience it in the attachment "which 
unites me to you. But friendship has its duties, and 
the man that likes you the best will be the forward- 
est in letting you know every thing where you can 
be concerned. 

When the enemy came to your house, many ne- 
groes deserted to them. This piece of news did not 
affect me much, as I little value those concerns. But 
you cannot conceive how unhappy I have been, to 
hear that Mr. Lund Washington went on board the 
enemy's vessels, and consented to give them provi- 
sions. This being done by the gentleman who, in 
some measure, represents you at your house, will cer- 
tainly have a bad effect, and contrasts with spirited 
answers from some neighbours, that had their houses 
burnt accordingly. You will do what you think pro- 
per about it, my dear General; but, as your friend, 
it was my duty confidentially to mention the circum- 
stances. 

With the help of some wagons and horses, we got 
in two days from the camp, near Baltimore, to this 
place. We halted yesterday, and having made a 
small bargain for a few shoes, are marching to Fre- 
dericksburg. No official account from Phillips. But 
I am told they are removing stores from Richmond 
and Petersburg. I am surprised nobody writes to 
me ; and hope soon to receive intelligence. 

Our men are in high spirits. Their honor having 
been interested in this affair, they have made it a 
point to come with us; and discontents, as well as 



296 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

desertion, are entirely out of fashion. Requesting my 
best respects to be presented to Mrs. Wasliington, 
and compliments to the family, I have the honor 
to be, with those sentiments which you know, my 
dear General, 

Your most obedient servant and friend, 

Lafayette. 

P. S. The Chevalier writes me, that Count de 
Rochambeau is going to join you, so that both armies 
will cooperate, I had rather remain in Virginia than 
go to Carolina. This I mention, because orders are 
to come from General Greene. But, if the detach- 
ment is to go more southerly, I will go there as fast 
as I can. 



FROM GOVERNOR JEFFERSON. 

RIclimond, 23 April, 1781. 

Sir, 
On the 18th instant, the enemy came from Ports- 
mouth up James River, in considerable force, though 
their numbers precisely are not yet known to us. 
They landed at Burwell's Ferry, below Williamsburg, 
and near the mouth of Chickahominy, above it. This 
latter circumstance obliged Colonel Innes, who com- 
manded a body of militia stationed on that side the 
river, to cover the country from depredation, to retire 
upwards, lest he should be placed between their two 
bodies. One of these entered Williamsburg on the 
20th, and the other proceeded to a ship-yard we had 
on Chickahominy. What injury they have done there, 
I am not yet informed. I take for granted they have 
burnt an unfinished twenty-gun ship we had there. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 297 

Sucli of the stores belonging to the yard, as were 
movable, had been carried some miles higher up the 
river. Two small galleys also retired up the river. 
AVhether by this, either the stores or galleys were 
saved, is as yet unknown. 

I am just informed, from a private hand, that they 
left Williamsburg early yesterday morning. If this 
sudden departure was not in consequence of some 
circumstance of alarm unknown to us, their expedi- 
tion to Williamsburg has been unaccountable. There 
were no public stores there, but those which were 
necessary for the daily use of the men stationed 
there. Where they mean to descend next, the event 
alone can determine. Besides harassing our militia 
with this kind of war, their being taken from their 
farms at the interesting season of planting then- corn, 
will have an unfortunate effect on the crop of the 
ensuing year. I have heard nothing certain of Gene- 
ral Greene, since the 6th instant, except that his 
head-quarters were on Little River on the 11th. 
I have the honor to be, &c., 

Thomas Jefferson. 



FROM COLONEL HAMILTON. 

De Peyster's Poiut, 27 April, 1781. 

Sir, 

I imagine your Excellency has been informed that, 
in consequence of the resolution of Congress for 
granting commissions to Aids-de-camp appointed un- 
der the former establishment, I have obtained one of 
Lieutenant-Colonel in the army of the United States, 
bearing rank since the 1st of March 1777. 

It is become necessary to me to apply to your 



298 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

Excellency to know in what manner j'-ou foresee you 
will be able to employ me in the ensuing campaign. 
I am ready to enter into activity whenever you 
think proper, though I am not anxious to do it till 
the army take the field, as, before that period, I per- 
ceive no object. Unconnected as I am with any re- 
giment, I can have no other command than in a 
light corps, and I flatter myself my pretensions to 
this are good. 

Your Excellency knows I have been in actual ser- 
vice since the beginning of 1776. I began in the 
line; and had I continued there, I ought, in justice, to 
have been more advanced in rank than I now am. 
I believe my conduct, in the different capacities in 
which I have acted, has appeared to the officers of 
the army in general such as to merit their confidence 
and esteem; and I cannot suppose them to be so un- 
generous as not to see me with pleasure put into a 
situation still to exercise the disposition I have al- 
ways had of being useful to the United States. 

I mention these things only to show that I do not 
apprehend the same difficulties can exist in my case 
(which is peculiar), that have opposed the appoint- 
ment to commands, of some other officers not belono-- 
ing to what is called the line. Though the light 
infantry is chiefly formed, yet being detached to the 
southward, I take it for granted there will be a van- 
guard by detachment formed for this army. I have 
the honor to be, very respectfully, 

Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

Alexander Hamilton. 



THE AMERICAN KEVOLUTION. 299 

FKOM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Camp, 1 May, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 

My public letters to Congress will inform your 
Excellency of our situation in this quarter. We 
figiit, get beatj and fight again. We have so much 
to do and so little to do it with, that I am much 
afraid these States must fall, never to rise aa'ain : 
and, what is more, I am persuaded they will lay a 
train to sap the foundation of all the rest. 

I am greatly obliged to your Excellency for order- 
ing the Marquis to the southward. I propose to halt 
him in Virginia, until the enemy's plan of operations 
is better known. Baron Steuben will join this army. 
He, having offended the Legislature of Virginia, can- 
not be as useful there as he has been. The Marquis 
is desired to keep your Excellency advised of all 
matters in that quarter, as it is too far first to come 
to this army and then be sent back again. 

When I was appointed to the command of this 
army, I solicited Congress to give Dr. McIIenry a 
majority, that he might serve nie in the character of 
Aid. This they refused. I was persuaded, when I 
made the application, of the necessity, and since have 
felt it most sensibly. Your Excellency can scarcely 
tell how happy you are in your family, and therefore 
can hardly judge of my situation. I cannot make a 
second application to Congress on the subject, nor 
should I have hopes of succeeding, if I did ; but I 
shall esteem it a peculiar mark of your Excellency's 
friendship and esteem, if you will interest yourself 
in the matter, and get him a majority. Your Excel- 
lency will judge of the propriety of my request; and 
if my wishes have prompted me to ask any thing 



300 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

that does not accord "svitli your opinion or your feel- 
ings, I must beg you to decline the measure, and 
excuse me. 

It is a long time since I received a line from Mrs. 
Greene. I am afraid they have miscarried, before 
they got to head-quarters. I am sorry that you had 
not leisure to call on her on your return from New- 
port. She would have thought herself greatly honor- 
ed, and been peculiarly happy on the occasion. 

With the greatest respect and esteem, I am, &c., 

Nathanael Greene. 



FROM COLONEL HAMILTON. 

De Pej-ster's Point, 2 May, 1781. 

Sir, 

I am extremely sorry to have embarrassed you 
by my late application, and that you should think 
there are insuperable obstacles to a compliance with 
it. Having renounced my expectations, I have no 
other inducement for troubling your Excellency with 
a second letter, than to obviate the appearance of 
having desired a thing inconsistent with the good of 
the service, while I was acquainted with the circum- 
stances which made it so. 

I was too interested a spectator of what happened 
in the case of Major Macpherson, not to have re- 
marked and not to recollect all the circumstances. 
The opposition turned ostensibly on his being a Bre- 
vet Officer, yet having a command in a corps formed 
entirely from one line. The propriety of his being 
employed in a detachment from the army at large, 
so far as I remember, was not disputed. In delicacy 
to Major Macpherson, no personal objections were for- 
mally made ; but in reality they existed, and contri- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION, 301 

buted to the discontent. It was thought a peculiar 
hardship, that a gentleman who had for a long time 
fought against us, and had not taken part with us 
till a late period, and when our affairs had assumed 
a more prosperous aspect, should he preferred in one 
of the most honorary commands of the service. Your 
Excellency must be convinced that I mention this in 
no other view than to show the sentiments of the 
officers at the time, and the whole grounds of the 
opposition. My esteem for Major Macpherson, and 
other reasons, make it impossible I can have a differ- 
ent intention. 

I know less of the motives of dissatisfaction in the 
cases of Colonel Gimat and Major Gal van; but I have 
understood that it is founded on their being appoint- 
ed in the light corps for two successive campaigns. 

It would be uncandid in me not to acknowledge 
that I believe a disposition to exclude Brevet Offi- 
cers, in general, from command, has a great share in 
the opposition in every instance, and that, so far, it 
affects my case. But, at the same time, it appears 
to me, this principle, alone, can never be productive 
of more than momentary murmurs, when it is not 
seconded by some plausible pretext. I also am con- 
vinced that the Pennsvlvania officers, for their own 
sakes, repented the rash steps the}^ had taken, and, 
on cool reflection, were happy in an opportunity 
to relinquish their menaces of quitting a service to 
which they were attached by habit, inclination, and 
interest, as well as by patriotism. I believe, too, we 
shall never have a similar instance in the army, un- 
less the practice should be carried to excess. Major 
Galvan, I am told, will probably be relieved. Colonel 
Gimat will then be the only Brevet Officer remaining 
in command. Your Excellency is the best judge of 
VOL. III. 26

302 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

the proper limits ; and there can be no doubt that 
the rights of particular officers ought to give place 
to the general good and tranquillity of the service. 

I cannot forbear repeating that my case is pecu- 
liar, and dissimilar to all the former. It is distin- 
guished by the circumstances I have before inti- 
mated. My early entrance into the service ; my 
Laying made the campaign of 1776, the most disa- 
greeable of the war, at the head of a company of 
artillery, and having been entitled, in that corps, to 
a rank equal in degree, more ancient in date, than I 
now possess ; my having made all the subsequent cam- 
paigns in the family of the Commander-in-chief, in a 
constant course of laborious and important service; — 
these are my pretensions, at this advanced period of 
the war, to being employed in the only way which 
my situation admits ; and I imagine they would have 
been weighty in the minds of the officers in general. 
I only urge them, a second time, as reasons which 
will not suffer me to view the matter in the same 
light with your Excellency, or to regard as impracti- 
cable my appointment in a light corps, should there 
be one formed. I entreat they may be understood 
in this sense only. I am incapable of wishing to 
obtain any object by importunity. 

I assure your Excellency that I am too well per- 
suaded of your candor, to attribute your refusal to 
any other cause than an apprehension of inconven- 
iences that may attend the appointment. I have the 
honor to be, with perfect respect, Sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

Alexander Hamilton. 

P. S. I have used the term Brevet in the sense 
your Excellency appears to have understood it, as ' 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 303 

signifying, in general, all officers not attached to any 
established corps. Congress seem, however, to have 
made a distinction ; they only give a kind of war- 
rant to those whom they designate as Brevet Officers. 
Mine is a regular commission. 



FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Camp, near Bottom's Creek, 4 May, 1781. 

My dear General, 

I request you will receive my affectionate acknow- 
ledgments for your kind letters. Every mark of 
friendship I receive from you adds to my happiness, 
as I love you with all the sincerity and warmth of 
my heart; and the sentiment I feel for you goes to 
the very extent of my affections. Inclosed, I send 
you, my dear General, two copies of letters to Gene- 
ral Greene, which I also have sent to Congress for 
their information. You will also find copies of the 
strange letters I have received from General Phillips, 
and the answers, which, if he does not behave better, 
will break off our correspondence. 

The leaving of my artillery appears a strange 
whim. But had I waited for it, Richmond was lost, 
and Major Galvan, who has exerted himself to the 
utmost, cannot bo with us under two days, as he 
could never obtain or seize horses for the artillery 
and ammunition wagons. It is not without trouble 
I have made this rapid march. General Phillips has 
expressed to an officer, on flag, the astonishment he 
felt at our celerity; and when, on the 30th, as he 
was going to give the signal to attack, he reconnoi- 
tred our position, Mr. Osburn, who was with him, 



304 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

says that he flew into a violent passion, and swore 
vengeance against me and the corps I had brought 
with me. 

I am, however, uneasy, my dear General, and do 
not know what the public will think of our conduct. 
The little dependence we put upon their militia, I 
cannot expose in an official letter. I cannot say that 
no boat, no wagons, no intelligence, not one spy 
could be obtained ; that if once I had been manoeu- 
vring wdth Phillips, he had every advantage over me ; 
that a defeat would have scattered the militia, lost 
the few arms we have, and knocked down this hand- 
ful of Continental troops. A great deal of mischief 
had already been done. I did not know but that the 
enemy meant to establish a post. Under these cir- 
cumstances, I thought it best to fight on none but 
my own grounds, and to defeat the main and most 
valuable object of the enemy. Had I gone on the 
other side, the enemy would have given me the slip, 
and taken Richmond, leaving nothing to me but the 
reputation of a rash, inexperienced young man. Our 
stores could not be removed. 

No orders from General Greene have as yet come 
to me. I cannot conceive the reason of his delay in 
answering my letters. In the meanwhile, Phillips is 
my object ; and if, with a thousand men, I can be 
opposed to three thousand in this State, I think I am 
useful to General Greene. In a former letter, he 
tells me his object is to divide the enemy; and hav- 
ing no orders, I must be regulated by his opinion. I 
wish he would call for the Pennsylvanians, and leave 
me here. The enemy are gone down the river. I 
have detached some militia to Hood's, where I mean 
to make a fort. Colonel Innes, with another corps of 
militia, is gone towards Williamsburg. His orders 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 305 

are, in case the enemy land there, to annoy them, 
and in case they mean to establish a post, he is to 
disturb them until I arrive. This position is sixteen 
miles from Richmond, forty-two from Williamsburg, 
sixty from Fredericksburg. I have sent an officer to 
Point Comfort, and established a chain of expresses 
to know if they appear to turn towards the Potomac. 
Should it be the case, Fredericksburg will have my 
attention. Having missed Richmond, Mr. Hunter's 
Works, at Fredericksburg, must be their next object, 
as they are the only support of our operations at the 
southward. 

Your first letters, my dear General, will perhaps 
tell me something more about your coming this way. 
How happy I should be to see you, I hope I need 
not to express. As you are pleased to give me the 
choice, I shall frankly tell my wishes. If you co- 
operate with the French against the place you know/'' 
I wish to be at head-quarters. If something is co- 
operated in Virginia, I shall find myself very happily 
situated. For the present, in case my detachment 
remains in this State, I wish not to leave it, as I 
have a separate and active command, though it does 
not promise great glory. But, as you gave me leave 
to do it, I shall in a few days write to you more 
particularly on my private concerns. It is not only 
on account of my own situation, that I wish the 
French fleet may come into the Bay. Should they 
come, even without troops, it is ten to one that they 
will block up Phillips in some of the rivers, and 
then I answer he is ruined. Had I but ships, my 
situation would be the most agreeable in the world. 

Adieu, my dear General. You will make me happy

to write me sometimes. With the highest respect, 
and most tender affection, 

I have the honor to be, yours, 

Lafayette. 



FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Richmond, 8 May, 1781. 

My dear General, 

There is no fighting here, unless you have a naval 
superiority, or an army mounted upon race-horses. 
Phillips's plan against Richmond has been defeated. 
He was going towards Portsmouth, and I thought it 
would be enough for me to oppose him at some prin- 
cipal points in this State. But now it appears I shall 
have business to transact with two armies, and this 
is rather too much. By letters from North Carolina 
I find that Lord Cornwallis, who, I had been assured, 
had sailed for Charleston, is advancing towards Hali- 
fax. In consequence of letters from the same quarter, 
General Phillips has altered his plan, and returned to 
a place called Brandon, on the south side of James 
River, where he landed the night before last. Our 
detachment is under march towards the Halifax road. 
His command of the water enabled him to land where 
1 could not reach him. The bridge at Petersburg is 
destroyed; and unless he acts with an uncommon de- 
gree of folly, he will be at Halifax before we are. 
Each of these armies is more than double the supe- 
rior to me. AVe have no boats for militia, and less 
arms. I will try to do for the best, and hope to de- 
serve your approbation. 

Nothing can abstract my sight from the supplies 
and reenforcements destined to General Greene's ar- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 307 

my, while I am going to get beaten by both armies, 
or each of them separately. The Baron remains at 
Richmond, where he hurries the collection of recruits, 
and every other requisite. I have forbidden every 
department to give me any thing that may be thought 
useful to General Greene ; and should a battle be ex- 
pected (an event which I will try to keep off), no 
consideration will prevent our sending to Carolina 
eight hundred recruits, who, I hope, may be equipped 
in a fortnight. When General Greene becomes equal 
to offensive operations, this quarter will be relieved. 
I have wrote to Wayne to hasten his march ; but, un- 
less I am very hard pushed, I shall request him to 
proceed southward. The militia has been ordered out, 
but are now unarmed, and not yet used to this busi- 
ness. General Greene, from whom I have as yet no 
letters, was, on the 2Gth, before Camden, but did not 
think himself equal to the storming of the works. 

Most respectfully, &c., 

Lafayette. 



FROM GOVERNOR JEFFERSON. 

Riclimond, 9 May, 1781. 

Sir, 

Since the letter, which I had the honor of last ad- 
dressing to your Excellency, the military movements 
in this State have scarcely merited communication, 
except a very late one. The enemy, after leaving 
Williamsburg, came directly up James River, and 
landed at City Point, being the point of land on the 
southern side of the confluence of Appomattox and 
James Rivers. They marched up to Petersburg, 
where they w^ere received by ]\Iajor-General Baron 



308 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

Steuben with a body of militia somewhat under one 
thousand, who, though the enemy were two thousand 
three hundred strong, disputed the ground very hand- 
somely two hours, during which time the enemy 
gained one mile only, and that by inches. Our troops 
were then ordered to retire over a bridge, which they 
did in perfectly good order. Our loss was between 
sixty and seventy, killed, wounded and taken. The 
enemy's is unknown ; but from circumstances of pro- 
bability it must have been equal to ours. For their 
own honor they must confess this, as they broke 
twice, and ran like sheep, till supported by fresh 
troops. An inferiority of number obliged our force 
to withdraw about twelve miles upwards, till more 
militia should be assembled. The enemy burnt all 
the tobacco in the warehouses at Petersburg and its 
neighbourhood. They afterwards proceeded to Os- 
borne's, where they did the same, and also destroyed 
the residue of the public armed vessels, and several 
of private property, and then came to Manchester, 
wdiich is on the hill opposite to this place. 

By this time, Major-General the Marquis de Lafay- 
ette, having been advised of our danger, had, by 
forced marches, got here with his detachment of Con- 
tinental troops ; and reenforcements of militia having 
also come in, the enemy, finding we were able to 
meet them on an equal footing, thought proper to 
burn the warehouses and tobacco at Manchester, and 
retire to Warwick, where they did the same. Ill-arm- 
ed and untried militia, who never before saw the face 
of an enemy, have, at times during this war, given 
occasion of exultation to our enemies. But they afford- 
ed us, while at Warwick, a little satisfaction in the 
same way. Six or eight hundred of their picked men, 
of the light infantry, with General Arnold at their 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 309 

head, having crossed the river from Warwick, fled from 
a patrol of sixteen horse, every man into his hoat 
as he could, some pushing north, and some south, as 
their fears drove them. 

Their whole force then proceeded to the Hundred, 
being the point of land within the confluence of the 
two rivers, embarked, and fell down the river. Their 
foremost vessel had got below Burw^ell's Ferry on the. 
Gth instant, when, on the arrival of a boat from 
Portsmouth, and a signal given, the whole crowded 
sail up the river again, wdth a fair wind and tide, 
and came to anchor at Brandon. There, six days' pro- 
vision were dealt out to every man. They landed, 
and had orders to march an hour before day the next 
morning. We have not yet heard which w\ay they 
went, or w^hether they are gone ; but, having about the 
same time received authentic information that Lord 
Cornwallis had, on the 1st instant, advanced from 
Wilmington half way to Halifix, w^e have no doubt, 
putting all circumstances together, but that these two 
bodies are forming a junction. 

We are strengthening our hands with militia, as 
far as arms, either private or public, can be collected ; 
but cannot arm a force wdiich may face the combined 
armies of the enemy. It will therefore be of very 
great importance that General Wayne's forces be 
pressed on with the utmost despatch. Arms and a 
naval force, however, are what must ultimately save 
us. This movement of our enemies, we consider as 
most perilous in its consequences. 

Our latest advices from General Greene are of the 
26th ultimo, when he was lying before Camden, the 
works and garrison of which were much stronger than 
he had expected to find them. 

I have the honor to be, &c., 

Thomas Jefferson. 



110 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Camp, at Mc Cord's Ferry, on the Congarce, 
14 May, 1781. 

Sir, 

I wrote your Excellency on the 5th, from near 
Camden, by Captain O'Hara. On the 10th, that place 
was evacuated by the enemy. They left it with 
great precipitation, after burning the greater part of 
their baggage, and stores belonging to the inhabitants. 
They also burnt the jail, mill, and several other houses, 
and left the town little better than a heap of rub- 
bish. They left all our men, wounded on the 25th, 
amounting to thirty-one, and fifty-eight of their own, 
and three officers, who were all too badly wounded to 
be moved. It is confidently asserted, by several people 
of the place, that the enemy suffered, in the late ac- 
tion, not less, in killed and wounded, than three hun- 
dred men.* 

Upon the enemy's evacuation, we immediately took 
possession of the place, and the works are levelling, 
a plan of which is herewith inclosed. Had the Vir- 
ginia militia arrived in time, the garrison would have 
fallen into our hands, as they would have enabled us 
to have invested it on all sides, and the garrison had 
neither provision nor stores to hold out a siege, the 
detachments below, operating under General Marion 
and Lieutenant-Colonel Lee, having cut olT their sup- 
plies, particularly the article of salt, of which the gar- 
rison was entirely destitute. 

On the 9th, the army inarched for this place. On 
the 11th, the post of Orangeburg, commanded by a 



* The action here referred to, was that of Ilobklrk's Hill, near Cam- 
den.  , 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 311 

Colonel, and consisting of upwards of eighty men and 
several officers, part British, surrendered to General 
Sumpter, who, by his address, so intimidated the gar- 
rison, in the disposition of his artillery and troops, as 
to produce a surrender of a very strong post, -without 
loss of time or men. Great quantities of provision, 
and some other stores, were found at this. 

On the 12th, Fort Mott surrendered to General 
Marion. The garrison consisted of upwards of one 
hundred and forty men, one hundred and twenty of 
whom were British and Hessian, and seven or eight, 
officers. The place was invested on the 8th, and the 
approaches carried to the foot of the ahatis before it 
surrendered. The redoubt was exceedingly strong, and 
commanded by Lieutenant Macpherson, a ver}^ gallant 
officer. Great credit is due to General Marion, and 
the few militia that continued with him in the reduc- 
tion of this post. Lieutenant-Colonel Lee's legion, and 
the detachments serving with him under Major Eaton, 
Captains Finley, of the artillery, and Oldham and 
Smith, of the infantry, were indefatigable in prosecut- 
ing the siege. There were taken at the fort, one 
carronade, about one hundred and forty stand of arms, 
a quantity of salt, provisions, and other stores, returns 
of which shall be forwarded hereafter. 

When v^Q began our march towards Camden, from 
Deep River, I wrote to General Pickens to endeavour 
to collect a body of the militia to lay siege to Au- 
gusta and Ninety Six ; and both places are now in- 
vested. As soon as the Virginia militia join us, I am 
in hopes to be able to make such detachments from 
this army as will effect their reduction. The fort at 
Friday's Ferry w^ll be invested by to-morrow morn- 
ing. Lieutenant-Colonel Lee, with his legion, and 
some of the detachment serving under him, marched 



312 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

for this purpose last evening. The army marches for 
tliat phice this morning. 

The last intelligence I had from Lord Rawdon, he 
was near Nelson's Ferry, where the enemy have a 
post, the stores at which were moving for Charleston, 
which indicates an evacuation. Generals Sumpter and 
INIarion are watching their motions. If proper exer- 
tions were made to support the southern war, the 
enemy would soon he convinced that, if they divide 
their force, they will fall by detachments, and, if they 
«)perate collectively, they cannot command the coun- 
try. Captain Pierce, one of my Aids, who is out 
watching the motions of Lord Cornwallis, informs me 
that he is on his march towards Halifax, from Duplin 
Court-House. Should he push his operations in that 
quarter, I shall leave the army here, under the com- 
mand of General Huger, to effect the reduction of the 
remaining posts, and join the troops collecting to the 
northward. Inclosed I send your Excellency copies 
of several letters found among the papers of Lieuten- 
ant Macpherson. 

I have the honor to be, &c., 

Nathanael Greene. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL HEATH. 

Hartford, 15 May, 1781. 

Dear General, 
I arrived here yesterday afternoon, found the Gene- 
ral Assembly sitting, and presented your letter to 
Governor Trumbull, together with a representation, 
containing the spirit of my instructions. This morn- 
ing I attended the Governor, Council, and the Repre- 
sentatives in the Council Chamber, when the papers 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 313 

were read, and I had an opportunity to speak on 
them. The papers were committed to a Committee 
of both Houses. I have the pleasure to acquaint 
your Excellency, they had that attention paid to 
them which their interesting importance required. A 
resolution has passed to send on immediately one 
hundred and sixty head of beef-cattle, which, it is 
supposed, will amount to five thousand rations per 
day, to the 1st of June. One thousand barrels of 
salted meat are also to be forwarded with the greatest 
despatch, with a quantity of rum. There are about 
a thousand barrels of salted meat deposited in this 
town ; it has been repacked, and is well stored. I 
shall endeavour, in the morning, to obtain a return 
of the whole quantity which has been procured in 
this State. I believe an accurate return has never 
been given in of the whole. 

An addition is made to the Committee of both 
Houses, who are to proceed to the consideration of 
the great supply for the campaign. Their resolutions 
on this head I think will equal your expectations. I 
have sent an express to Mr. Phelps, to forward all 
the beef-cattle he can command, without a moment's 
delay. I shall proceed to Rhode Island to-morrow, 
I have the honor to be, &c., 

William Heath. 



FROM JOSEPH JONES. 

Philadelphia, IG May, 1781. 



Dear Sir, 

Having returned to Congress a few days only, and 
private matters requiring my attention for great part 
of the time, I have not been able regularly to attend 
VOL. m. 27 



314 LETTEES TO WASHINGTON. 

to business, or to acknowledge the receipt of your 
favor transmitted to Philadelphia, after my leaving it, 
and sent after me to Virginia by Mr. Madison. The 
moment for successful operations against our enemies 
was certainly immediately after the disaster in Gardi- 
ner's Ba}^, when, had it been embraced, the port at 
Portsmouth, and the troops under Arnold, as well as 
the British ships then in Virginia, must have fallen 
an easy conquest to our united efforts ; for which 
purpose the State was, I believe, in readiness. 

Abortive as the project has proven, we yet hope 
for the best, and that still it may be in the powder 
of our ally to give us effectual aid in the Chesa- 
peake I and, believe me, at no time was it more ne- 
cessary than at present, when all the lower country 
of our State, from its great navigable waters, is ex- 
posed to the ravage and rapine, not only of Bri- 
tish ships of war, but of the vessels employed by 
the Board of Refugee Commissioners in New York. 
To you it is unnecessary to describe the distress of 
the inhabitants upon the navigable waters of Virginia. 
Your knoAvledge of the country enables you suffi- 
ciently to judge of it, exclusive of such information 
as, I doubt not, you receive from that quarter. Had 
we a sufficient stock of arms, distressing as it is to 
our militia to be so generally out on duty, as it must 
be to them at this season of the year, I think they 
would do much in opposition to the enemy, support- 
ed even by no considerable body of regulars. But, 
wanting arms, their negroes flying from them, and 
their prospects of making little or nothing from their 
estates to support their families and bear the bur- 
dens of the war, may shake their fidelity and attach- 
ment to the cause so far as to slacken their exer- 
tions, if some succour is not afforded them by water, 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 315 

to restrain the ravage of these plunderers. I mention 
these things as facts falling under my own observa- 
tion before I left the State, that, if they have not 
been more particularly communicated by others, you 
might hear some intimation of them. 

The late movements of Cornwallis and Phillips in- 
dicate a junction of their armies on the Roanoke, 
from whence they may direct their operations north 
or south, as they shall see best, without the fear of 
successful opposition ; or may, it would seem, cut off 
all communication between Virginia and the other 
Southern States, and reduce General Greene to the 
greatest extremity. From these dangers, that at pre- 
sent threaten us, a naval force sent to the Chesa- 
peake would at once relieve us, and admit Virginia 
to afford that succour to the other Southern States 
they so much need. The great object of the enemy 
is undoubtedly the Southern States ; and it is submit- 
ted to your reflection, how far you can support them 
by your influence, in the destination of such aids as 
may arrive from Europe, or the operation of that 
force now here. We are told all the ships of war 
have left New York, with about two thousand troops, 
after having once put back. Adieu ! Pardon the 
haste of this letter, which is written in Congress, in 
consequence of the President's information that an 
express was coming off for head-quarters. 

Yours, &c., 

Joseph Jones. 



316 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 



FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Camp, Wilton, on James Elver, 17 May, 1781. 

Dear General, 

My correspondence with one of the British Gene- 
rals, and my denial of a correspondence with the 
other, may be perhaps misrepresented. I shsdl there- 
fore give an account of what has passed, and hope 
your Excellency and General Greene will approve of 
my conduct. On the arrival of our detachment at 
Richmond, three letters were brought by a flag, which 
I have the honor to inclose, and which, as Commander 
of the troops in this State, it became my duty to 
answer. The inclosed letters were successively sent 
in pursuit of General Phillips, who received them 
both with a degree of politeness that seemed to apo- 
logize for his unbecoming style. 

General Phillips being dead, of a fever, an officer 
was sent with a passport and letters from General 
Arnold. I requested the gentleman to come to my 
quarters; and having asked if General PhilUps ivas 
dead, to which he answered in the negative, I made 
it a pretence not to receive a letter from General 
Ai'nold, which, being dated head-quarters, and directed 
to the Commanding Officer of the American troops, 
ouffht to come from the British General, chief in 
command. I did, however, observe, that should any 
other officer have written to me, I would have been 
happy to receive their letters. 

The next day the officer returned with the same 
passport and letter, and informed me that he was 
now at liberty to declare that Phillips was dead, and 
Arnold was Commander-in-chief of the British army 
in Virginia. The high station of General Arnold 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 317 

having obliged me to an explanation, the inclosed 
note was sent to the officer of the flag, and the 
American officer verbally assured him that, was I re- 
quested to put in writing a minute account of my 
motives, my regard for the British army was such 
that I would cheerfully comply with the demand. 

Last evening a flag of ours returned from Peters- 
burg, who had been sent by General Nelson from 
the advanced corps he commands, and happened to 
be on his way while the British officer was at our 
pickets. Inclosed is the note written by General 
Arnold, in which he announces a determination of 
sending our officers and men to the West Indies. 
The British General cannot but perfectly know that 
I am not to treat of partial exchanges ; and that the 
fate of the Continental prisoners must be regulated 
by a superior authority to that with which I am in- 
vested. With the highest respect, 

I have the honor to be, &c., 

Lafayette. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL CLARK. 

Pittsburg, 21 May, 1781. 

Sir, 
I this moment received yours of the 25th of 
April. The intelligence is by no means alarming to 
me ; it corresponds with my former suspicion. I have 
for several years past kept up a constant chain of in- 
telligence from the Lakes through the channel of the 
Illinois inhabitants. And a few hours after yours, I 
received despatches from the Mississippi and St. Vin- 
cent's ; — the whole a confirmation of your Excellen- 
cy's hints, except that part of their [not] coining by 
27* 



318 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

the way of the Alleghany River, but rather through 
the western pass, as more immediately among the 
Indian nations, whom they would wish to have with 
them. And what greatly favors the idea is, that up- 
wards of one thousand Wabash Indians have again 
declared themselves in our favor, and of course will 
draw their attention that way for some time, for fear 
that our troops in that quarter, reenforced by those 
Indians, should make a diversion on the Lakes, while 
they had drawn off their forces to Pittsburg. For 
in fact it has been the influence of our posts on the 
Illinois and Wabash that has saved the frontiers, and 
in a great measure baffled the designs of the enemy 
at Detroit. If they get possession of them, they will 
then command three times the number of valuable 
warriors they do at present, and be fully enabled to 
carry any point they aim at, except we should have 
a formidable force to oppose them. 

I am well acquainted with Colonel Connolly, and 
should be happy to meet him on equal terms. If his 
dependence is principally on Indians, and we should 
fortunately get into the field before him, he will 
probably meet with a disappointment. But should he 
be independent of them, our circumstances will be 
truly deplorable, except we had other measures of 
drawing the inhabitants of tliis country to the field 
besides persuasive arguments, which are too much our 
dependence at present. I wrote to the Governor of 
Pennsylvania on this subject, but received no answer. 
I cannot think any thing of importance is to be ex- 
pected by the way of Venango, but much to be ap- 
prehended from the other quarter. I refer you to 
Captain Randolph for the news of this quarter. 
I have the honor to be, &c., 

George R. Clark. 



THE AMEllICAN REVOLUTION. 319 

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GATES. 

Philadelphia, 22 May, 1781. 

Sir, 

I have been honored with your letter of the 12th 
instant, declaring to me that no charge having been 
brought against me before your Excellency, the Court 
of Inquiry into my conduct could proceed upon no 
other principle, in the military way, than the resolve 
of Congress, of the 5th of October last. Having been 
informed that Congress had no charge against me, I 
transmitted to them, by the President, your Excellen- 
cy's last letter. Their inclosed resolve is the result; 
and I conceive that your intention, pointed as it was, 
has been mistaken.'*'' 

This evening, I wrote to his Excellency the Presi- 
dent, that " before our disaster at Camden, had a re- 
solve of Congress ordered that every Commanding 
Officer, who shall not beat the enemy, must be re- 
called, and subjected to a Court of Inquiry, whether 

* The foUowinnf are the Resolves of Conojress here alluded to. 

" October 5t7i, 1780. Resolved, that the Commander-in-chief be, and 
hereby is directed to order a Court of Inquiry to be held on the con- 
duct of Major-General Gates, as Commander of the Southern army. 

" Resolved, that the Commander-in-chief be, and hereby is directed 
to appoint an officer to command the Southern array, in the room of 
General Gates, until such inquiry be made." 

"May 21, 1781. Resolved, that the resolutions of the 5th of October 
last, directing a Court of Inquiiy to be held on the conduct of Major- 
General Gates, as Commander of the Southern army, and directing the 
Commander-in-chief to appoint an officer to command the Southern ar- 
my, in the room of General Gates, until such inquiry be made, did not 
operate as a suspension of General Gates from his command in the Une 
of the army at lai-ge, as a Major-General ; and as, from the situation of 
afi'airs in the Southern department, such Court of Inquiry cannot be 
speedily held, that Major-General Gates be informed, that he is at 
liberty to repair to head-quarters, and take such command as the Com- 
mander-in-chief shall direct." 



320 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

or not any crime be laid to liis charge, I would as 
patiently submit to my fate, as officers who surrender 
a fort, or lose a ship. The special resolve of Congress 
dooms me to temporaiy disesteem, and loss of confi- 
dence." For these reasons, Sir, I can neither with 
advantage to the public, nor honor to mj^self, accept, 
under my present circumstances, the proffered indul- 
gence of Congress. 

Convinced that you have done every thing, which 
propriety could admit, to protect slandered officers 
against anonymous accusations, I will set out to-mor- 
row morning for Virginia, where I shall wait for your 
Excellency's orders. 

With sincere thanks for the army in general, and 
myself in particular, I have the honor to be. Sir, &c., 

Horatio Gates. 



FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Elchmond, 24 Mav, 1781. 

My dear General, 
My official letter, a copy of which I send to Con- 
gress, will let you know the situation of affairs in 
this quarter. I ardently wish my conduct may meet 
with your approbation. Had I followed the first im- 
pulse of my temper, I would have risked something 
more. But I have been guarding against my own 
warmth; and this consideration, that a general defeat, 
which, with such a proportion of militia, must be ex- 
pected, would involve tliis State and our affairs in 
ruin, has rendered me extremely cautious in my 
movements. Indeed, I am more embarrassed to move, 
more crippled in my projects, than we have been in 
the Northern States. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 321 

Had the Pennsylvanians arrived before Lord Corn- 
wallis, I was determined to attack the enemy, and 
have no doubt but what we should have been suc- 
cessful. Their unaccountable delay cannot be too 
much lamented, and will make an immense difference 
in the fate of this campaign. Should they have ar- 
rived time enough to support me in the reception of 
Lord Cornwallis's first stroke, I should still have 
thought it well enough ; but, from an answer of Ge- 
neral Wayne, received this day, and dated the 19th, 
I am afraid that at this moment they have hardly 
left Yorktown.^-' 

Public stores and private property being removed 
from Richmond, this place is a less important object. 
I do not believe it would be prudent to expose the 
troops for the sake of a few houses, most of which 
are empty. But I am wavering between two incon- 
veniences. Were I to fight a battle, I should be cut 
to pieces, the militia dispersed, and the arms lost. 
Were I to decline fighting, the country would think 
herself given up. I am, therefore, determined to skir- 
mish, but not to engage too far; and particularly to 
take care against their immense and excellent body 
of horse, which the militia fear as they would so 
many wild beasts. 

A letter from General Greene to General Sumner 
is dated May 5th, seven miles below Camden. The 
Baron is going to him with some recruits, and will 
get some more in North Carolina. When the Penn- 
sylvanians come, I am only to keep them a few days, 
which I will improve as well as I can. Cavalry is 
very necessary to us. I wish Lauzun's legion could 
come. I am sure he will like to serve with me; and 

* In Pennsylvania. The troops under General Wayne left that town 
on the 26th of May. 



322 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

as General Greene gave me command of the troops 
in this State, Lauzun might remain with me in Vir- 
ginia ; if not, Sheldon's dragoons might he sent. As 
to Mojlan, I do not believe he will be ready before 
a long time. 

Were I any ways equal to the enemy, I sliould be 
extremely happy in my present command ; but I am 
not strong enough even to get beaten. Government, 
in this State, has no energy, and laws have no force. 
But I hope this Assembly will put matters upon a 
better footing. I had a great deal of trouble to put 
the departments in a tolerable train. Our expenses 
were enormous ; and yet we can get nothing. Ar- 
rangements, for the present, seem to put on a better 
face, but for this superiority of the enemy, wdio will 
chase us wherever they please. They can overrun 
the country ; and, until the Pennsylvanians arrive, we 
are next to nothing in point of opposition to so large 
a force. This country begins to be as familiar to me 
as Tappan and Bergen. Our soldiers are hitherto 
very healthy, and I have turned doctor to regulate 
their diet. Adieu, my dear General. Let me hear 
sometimes from you. Your letters are a great happi- 
ness to your affectionate friend, 

Lafayette. 

P. S. As I am for the present fixed in the com- 
mand of the troops in this State, I beg it as a great 
favor that you will please to send me Colonel Gou- 
vion. Should a junction be made with General Greene, 
he will act as my Aid-de-camp. My respects, if you 
please, to Mrs. Washington, and compliments to the 
family. 



Sir, 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 323 

FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL CLARK. 

Fort Pitt, 26 May, 1781. 



Reduced to the necessity of taking every step to 
carry my point the ensuing campaign, I hope your 
Excellency will excuse me in taking the liberty of 
troubling you with this request. The invasion of 
Virginia put it out of the power of the Governor to 
furnish me with the number of men proposed for the 
enterprise to the west; but he informed me he had 
obtained leave of the Baron Steuben, and agreeably to 
your letters, for Colonel John Gibson and regiment, 
together with Heth's company, to join my forces, — 
an addition, he supposed, of more worth than the mili- 
tia we were disappointed of On consulting Colonel 
Brodhead, he could not conceive that he was at liber- 
ty to suffer them to go, as ^^oiir instructions were 
pointed respecting the troops and stores to be fur- 
nished by him. From your Excellency's letters to 
Colonel Brodhead, I conceived him to be at liberty to 
furnish what men he pleased. I am convinced he did 
not think as I do, or otherwise he would have had no 
objection, as he appeared to wish to give the enter- 
prise every aid in his power. 

The hope of obtaining a grant of those troops has 
induced me to address your Excellency myself, as it 
is too late to consult Governor Jefferson firther on 
the subject. Wishing to set out on the expedition 
early in June, as our stores of provisions are nearly 
complete, if our force should be equal to the task 
proposed, I cannot conceive that this post, with a 
very small garrison even of militia, will be in any 
danger, as it is attached to a populous country, and. 



324 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

during our time in the enemy's, Mcintosh and Wheel- 
ing will be useless, or might also be garrisoned by 
small parties of militia. Those I know to be your 
Excellency's ideas. If you should approve of the 
troops in this department joining our forces, though 
they are few, the acquisition may be attended •with. 
great and good consequences, as two hundred only 
might turn the scale in our favor. The advantage 
that must derive to the States from our proving suc- 
cessful, is of such importance that, I think, it de- 
served a greater preparation to insure it. 

But I have not yet lost sight of Detroit. Nothing 
seems to threaten us but the want of men. But even 
should we be able to cut our way through the In- 
dians, and find they have received no reenforcements 
at Detroit, we may probably have the assurance to 
attack it, though our force may be much less than 
proposed, wdiich was two thousand ; as defeating the 
Indians, wdtli inconsiderable loss on our side, would 
almost insure us success. Should this be the case, a 
valuable peace with them will probably ensue. But, 
on the contrary, should we fall through in our pre- 
sent plans, and no expedition take place, it is to be 
feared that the consequences wdll be fatal to the 
whole frontiers ; as every exertion w^ill be made by 
the British party to harass them as much as possible, 
and disable them from giving any succours to our 
eastern or southern forces. The Indian war is now 
more general than ever. Any attempts to appease 
them, except by the sword, will be fruitless. 

Captain Randolph waits on your Excellency for an 
answ^er to this letter, which, I flatter myself, you 
will honor me with immediately. Colonel Gibson, 
who commands in the absence of Colonel Brodhead, 
will keep the troops ready to move at an hour's 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 325 

warning ; conducting myself as though this request 
was granted, impatiently waiting for the happy order. 
It is with gratitude I thank your Excellency for 
the honor you have done me in your several letters. 
The greatest earthly happiness I could possibly en- 
joy would be to conduct myself with such propriety, 
as to be entitled to your esteem. 

I have the honor to be, &c., 

Geokge E. Clark. 



FROM GOVERNOR JEFFERSON. 

Charlottesville, 28 May, 1781. 

Sir, 

I make no doubt you will have heard, before this 
shall have the honor of being presented to your Ex- 
cellency, of the junction of Lord Cornwallis with the 
force at Petersburg under Arnold, who had succeeded 
to the command on the death of Major-General Phil- 
lips. I am now advised, that they have evacuated 
Petersburg, joined at Westover a reenforcement of 
two thousand men just arrived from New York, 
crossed James River, and, on the 26th instant, were 
three miles advanced on their way towards Richmond, 
at Avhich place Major-General the JMarquis de Lafay- 
ette lay with three thousand men, regulars and mili- 
tia, that being the whole number we could arm, till 
the arrival of the eleven hundred arms from Rhode 
Island, which are about this time getting to the place 
where our public stores are deposited. The whole 
force of the enemy within this State, from the best 
intelligence I have been able to get, I think is about 
seven thousand men, infantry and cavalry, including 
also the small garrison left at Portsmouth. A num- 
VOL. III. 28 



326 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

ber of privateers and small vessels, ^'hicli are con- 
stantly ravaging the shores of our rivers, prevent us 
from receiving any aid from the counties lying on 
navigable waters -, and powerful operations, meditated 
against our western frontier by a joint force of Bri- 
tish and Indian savages, have, as your Excellency 
before knew, obliged us to embody between two and 
three thousand men in that quarter. 

Your Excellency will judge from this state of things, 
and from what you know of your own country, what 
it may probably suffer during the present campaign. 
Should the enemy be able to produce no opportunity 
of annihilating the Marquis's army, a small proportion 
of their force may yet restrain his movements efifect- 
uall}^, Avliile the greater part is employed in detach- 
ment, to waste an unarmed country, and to lead the 
minds of the people to acquiescence under those 
events which they see no human power prepared to 
ward off. We are too far removed from the other 
scenes of war, to say whether the main force of the 
enemy be within this State ; but I suppose they can- 
not anywhere spare so great an army for the opera- 
tions of the field. Were it possible for this circum- 
stance to justify, in your Excellency, a determination 
to lend us your personal aid, it is evident, from the 
universal voice, that the presence of their beloved 
countryman, whose talents have been so long success- 
fully employed in establishing the freedom of kindred 
States, to whose person they have still flattered them- 
selves they retained some right, and have ever look- 
ed up as their dernier resort in distress, — that your 
appearance among them, I say, would restore full 
confidence of salvation, and would render them equal 
to whatever is not impossible. 

I cannot undertake to foresee and obviate the diffi- 



THE AMERICAN EEVOLtJTION. 327 

culties which stand in the way of such a resolution. 
The whole subject is before you, of which I see only 
detached parts; and your judgment will be formed 
on view of the whole. Should the danger of this 
State and its consequence to the Union be such as 
to render it best for the whole that you should repair 
to its assistance, the difficulty would then be how to 
keep men out of the field. I have undertaken to 
hint this matter to your Excellency, not only on my 
own sense of its importance to us, but at the solici- 
tations of many members of weight in our Legislature, 
which is not yet assembled, to speak their own de- 
sires. A few days will bring to me that period of 
relief which the Constitution has prepared for those 
oppressed with the labors of my office ; and a long- 
declared resolution of relinquishing it to abler hands, 
has prepared my way for retirement to a private sta- 
tion. Still, however, as an individual citizen, I should 
feel the comfortable effects of your presence, and have 
(what I thought could not have been), an additional 
motive of that gratitude, esteem and respect with 
which 

I have the honor to be, &c., 

Thomas Jefferson. 



FROM THE CHEViVLIER DE LA LUZERNE. 

(Translation.) 

Philadelphia, 1 June, 178L 

Sir, 
I have received the letter which your Excellency 
did me the honor to write on the 23d of the past 
month, and that of the Count de Rochambeau, with 
which it was accompanied. 



328 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

I wait with extreme impatience the news of the 
arrival of the French division before New York; and 
no one can desire more warmly than I do to see it 
under your immediate command. I hoped most fer- 
vently that you would have been this spring in the 
command of a more considerable body of auxiliaries. 
The causes which have hindered the execution of 
that plan have been* so urgent and so decisive, that I 
am sure you will approve them, after I shall have 
had the honor of making you acquainted with them. 
I have nevertheless been much pained that I could 
not explain to you this change of measures; and my 
attachment to the cause which you defend has made 
me feel, as sensibly as any citizen of America, all the 
delays which could happen to the assistance which we 
wish to give to the thirteen States. 

I am impressed with the necessity of maintaining 
a perfect confidence with your Excellency upon these 
different points, and I shall seize the first occasion 
which presents itself to visit your army. 

In the mean time, I am going to transmit to the 
Count de Grasse what your Excellency did me the 
honor to communicate. Be persuaded that I shall 
use the most pressing motives to determine him, and 
I shall do it with so much the more zeal, as I feel 
the necessity of it. I shall transmit to that General 
an extract of your letter; and nothing appears to me 
more likely to give weight to the demand which I 
shall make from him. 

The King has charged me, Sir, to inform Congress, 
that he grants them a gratuitous subsidy, to enable 
them to make the greatest eflbrts in the course of 
this campaign. This subsidy, amounting to six mil- 
lions of livres tournois, is to be employed in the 
purchase of arms, ammunition, and clothing ; and it is 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 329 

the intention of the King, that the surplus shall he 
at the disposal of Congress. I have not been in- 
structed, as to what will be the exact amount of this 
surplus; but in the mean time it is determined that 
one million and a half shall be employed by the Su- 
perintendent of Finances of the thirteen States, ac- 
cording to the directions which you shall give him, 
and after the arrangements which you shall make 
with him in the visit which he intends making you. 
I have informed Congress, and I intrust it to 3'our 
Excellency, that the Emperor and the Empress of 
Russia have offered their mediation to the Court of 
London, which has accepted it. It has also been of- 
fered to the Court of Versailles and that of Madrid. 
But they have given for answer, that time must be 
left to Congress to determine, if it suits them to put 
the interests of the thirteen States into the hands of 
the Mediators. In any event, it is of the greatest 
importance that the allies make all their efforts to 
drive the enemy from tliis Continent; and nothing will 
be more likely than the success of the confederate 
arms, to make a successful negotiation. 
I have the honor to be, &c., 

Luzerne. 



FROM JOHN C.U)AVAL.iDER. 

Annapolis, 5 June, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 
As Captain Fitzhugh goes immediately to head- 
quarters, I can,not omit so good an opportunity of 
acknowledging the receipt of your letter dated about 
three months since, and thanking you for the senti- 
ments of esteem you so warmly express towards me. 

28* 



330 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

It is unnecessary to repeat the information relating 
to the movements of the enemy in Virginia, as you 
must be acquainted with every particular in an offi- 
cial way. 

You know so much better than I do the causes 
of those misfortunes which have reduced us to our 
present deplorable situation, that I shall not give you 
the pain which a recital of ill-judged measures must 
occasion. I wish past errors may teach us wisdom 
in conducting our future operations. The idea enter- 
tained by most people, that the war was near a 
close after the treaty was concluded with France, has 
excluded every proposal for establishing system, and 
continued those temporary expedients, which M'ere in- 
troduced at the commencement of the war, and Avhich 
have brought us to the brink of ruin. To recover the 
lost confidence of the people is certainly the first step 
to be taken, and this cannot be done by mere decla- 
rations of the Legislature ; we must give every proof 
in our power of our future honest intentions. Acts 
of violence may procure clotliing and provisions for 
the army ; but these are not suflicient to prevent dis- 
contents and a general mutiny. We must find mo- 
ney to pay our troops, and this cannot be obtained 
by any other means than such as tend to restore 
public credit ; and how to effect this, the wisest men 
among us are at a loss to determine. We certainly 
have the means in our possession ; but the difficulty 
is to draw them forth. A Committee of the Whole 
House had these great points under consideration for 
several days; and, after" sitting in silence for hours, 
without any one venturing to suggest a remed}^, we 
resolved to submit them to a Committee of both 
Houses. With them the matter rests. We have, 
however, passed a law for the seizure of clothing 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 331 

and provisions, and six hundred horses for the army. 
We have resolved to raise, immediately, seven hun- 
dred and fifty negroes, to be incorporated with the 
other troops ; and a bill is now almost completed. 

The people, from every information, are generally 
disposed to act with spirit. But the means of exten- 
sive opposition is not in our power for [w^ant of] 
armsj and I fear the measures taken to provide fixed 
ammunition will not afford us a timely and neces- 
sary suppl}^ After carrying on a war for six years, 
we might reasonably expect that affairs would be 
conducted with some degree of method; but we have 
derived no advantages from so much experience. 

That the enemy intend to make the Southern 
States the scene of action the ensuing campaign, is 
past a doubt ; and the consequences are easily fore- 
seen, unless considerable reenforcements very soon 
arrive, either from France or the Northern army. 
But with these, I see no prospect of doing any thing 
to effect whilst the enemy have the command of the 
navigation. You know so well the difficulties I al-.. 
lude to, that it is unnecessary to recite them. The 
possession of these States must be of the last import- 
ance to the enemy ; because in these they possess 
the tobacco, rice, indigo, and naval stores, which to 
them, perhaps, are more valuable than all the other 
States together. These, too, are separated by a great 
natural line from the other States ; and it appears to 
me more than probable, considering all circumstances, 
that Great Britain finds it impracticable to possess 
themselves of all America, and is now preparing to 
conquer these States, in hopes that the powers of 
Europe, by their interposition, will secure them 
to her. 

You, however, can best determine where your pre- 



332 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

sence is most necessary, nor do I presume to advise, 
being satisfied that whatever you determine upon will 
best promote the public service. But, permit me. Sir, 
to express that my wishes, and the wishes of every 
person with whom I converse, are, that you may 
think it necessary to take the command of the 
Southern army. Your presence, we conceive, may 
create an unanimity and vigor that would relieve us 
from the dangers that threaten us, and that must 
otherwise overwhelm us. 

I have made a tender of my services to the Exe- 
cutive ; but whether they will honor me with a com- 
mand or not, I shall not remain a distant spectator. 
I have the honor to be, 

With the greatest esteem, &c., 

John Cadwalader. 



FROM RICHARD HENRY LEE. 

Chantilly, 12 June, 1781. 

]\Iy dear Sir, 

Although our correspondence has been long inter- 
rupted, I hope that our friendship never will, notwith- 
standing the arts of wicked men, who have endea- 
voured to create discord and dissension among; the 
friends of America. For myself, having little but my 
good wishes to send you, it was not worth while to 
take up your attention a moment with them. The 
contents of this letter will, I am sure, require no 
apology, because you always approve that zeal which 
is employed in the public service, and has for its ob- 
ject the public good. 

The present state of our country. Sir, is such as 
to demand the most immediate and most effectual in- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 333 

terposition to prevent the numerous resources of Vir- 
ginia from becoming means, in the hands of our ene- 
mies, for subduing the liberties of North America. 
For, though the efforts of this State have been not 
Cjuite so strong as its abilities warranted, yet when it 
shall be placed under the sword of a conqueror, such 
resources will be found, and such powers drawn from 
it, as will put the liberties of North America in im- 
minent peril. My following opinion is not founded 
upon vain apprehensions, but upon good materials and 
attentive observation. 

Virginia, it is true, has nine times the number of 
men that now threaten its ruin; but they are dis- 
persed, unarmed, without system, government, and 
very little probability at present of the Legislature 
assembling. The enemy's army is in the heart of the 
country, employing, with exquisite industry'-, every en- 
gine that force and fraud can move, to effect a con- 
quest of the whole, or far greater part, immediately. 
I think. Sir, that they will succeed, if adequate pre- 
vention be not presently applied. When the enemy's 
army began to move, after the junction of their troops, 
in force much superior to the Marquis, the Assembly 
adjourned to Charlotteville, where they were never 
able to collect members sufficient to form the Legis- 
lature, before they were dispersed by five hundred of 
the enemy's light-horse, with as many light infantry 
mounted behind, as we learn from some of the flying 
Delegates. The Governor had resigned his office, but 
no successor had been appointed; and Mr. Digges, 
the Lieutenant-Governor, it seems has been made a 
prisoner, and released upon parole ; whilst there is, 
in the present state of things, little chance for a 
meeting of the Assembly to apply the feeble remedy 
which their choice of a Governor would amount to. 



334 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

Thus we remain Tdthout Government, at a time 
when the most wise and most vigorous administration 
of puhlic affairs can alone save us from the ruin de- 
termined for us hy the enemy. I have taken the 
liberty of communicating my thoughts on this subject 
to Mr. Lovell, in a letter, a copy of which I have 
now the honor to inclose to you, together with a let- 
ter from your brother, who agrees perfectly with me 
in sentiment ; and, I verily believe, there is not a good 
citizen, or friend to the liberty of America, in the 
State, who does not wish that the plan proposed may 
immediately be adopted. I have written in the same 
manner to Colonel Bland and Mr. Jones, our Delegates 
in Congress. 

It would be a thing* for angels to weep over, if 
the goodly fabric of human freedom, which you have 
so well labored to rear, should, in one unlucky mo- 
ment, be levelled with the dust. There is nothing I 
think more certain than that your personal call would 
bring into immediate exertion the force and the re- 
sources of this State, and its neighbouring ones, 
which, directed as they would be, will effectually dis- 
appoint and baffle the deep-laid schemes of the ene- 
my. By seizing the fine horses on James River, 
they have mounted a gallant and most mischievous 
cavalry of five or six hundred in number. We have 
plenty of horses left, to be sure, but we are deficient 
in proper accoutrements ; though I understand that 
the Marquis is endeavouring to mount a thousand 
men as quickly as possible, to control the boundless 
ravage of the enemy's horse. Some of the dispersed 
Delegates report it as extremely probable that our 
collected stores in the north fork of James Biver 
have fallen into the enemy's hands, as their cavalry 
were a little above, and the main body of their army

not far below, directing its course to the north fork, 
which was guarded only by seven or eight hundred 
new levies under Baron Steuben. 

Our country is truly, Sir, in a deplorable way, 
and, if relief comes not from you, it will probably 
come not at all. I have heard it reported in this 
country, that General Wayne dislikes being command- 
ed by the Marquis. If this should be unhappily true, 
the consequences will be obvious to you. I have the 
honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect es- 
teem, dear Sir, your most affectionate friend. 

And most obedient servant, 

RiCHAED Henry Lee.* 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL JAMES CLINTON. 

Albany, 15 June, 1781. 

Sir, 

I have been honored with your Excellency's favors 
of the 28th ultimo, and 5th and 10th instant. I am 



* The following extracts are taken from the letter to Mr. Lovell, men- 
tioned above. 

" It is impossible for a person, so attentive as I have always been, not 
to know that the final and fierce designs of our enemies are levelled at 
us, and through us, I apprehend, at the liberties of North America ; for, 
however feeble the resources of this country may have been under Re- 
publican government, if it is once placed under the sword of a conqueror, 
such efforts and such resources will appear as to put the liberties of 
the rest in very imminent peril. I love liberty, and wish that the whole 
human race enjoyed it ; and I have a peculiar affection for that of the 
eastern part of this Union. Let me entreat you, therefore, Sir, and your 
worthy associates from the east, not to slumber a moment over our pre- 
sent actual state. Decision, despatch, and much wisdom are indispen- 
sably necessary, or I verily believe we shall soon be lost to ourselves 
and you. I do not write under any influences of vain apprehensions, 
but from the cool, considerate dictates of judgment founded upon good

informed by Colonel Cortlanclt, that the stores are all 
safely brought clown from Fort Schujder to the Ger- 
man Flats, and the old fort entirely destroj^ed. JMajor 
Villefranehe has arrived, and will proceed immediately 
to erect the intended work at the Flats, which, from 
our very embarrassed circumstances, I fear will be 
attended with many difficulties, though I have reason 
to believe the inhabitants will contribute every assist- 
ance in their power to complete it. 

The six companies under Colonel Van Schaick, and 
the regiment under Lieutenant-Colonel Antill, have 
arrived, which, together with the troops already sta- 
tioned here, are disposed of in the following manner. 
The first New York regiment is stationed at Sara- 
toga, except two companies under the command of 
Major Graham, which I have detained in town ; the 
second, at the German Flats, except one company 

materials. A very great majority of tlie people of this country are 
good AVhigs, and very determined to maintain their independence ; and 
being so, how they came into their present state of thraldom is beside 
my present purpose to inquire. Like good physicians, the Congress 
■will consider that the inordinacy of the symptoms must be subdued, 
before application can Tvith safety be made to the cause." 

" I clearly see in this state of things, that, wanting a rudder in 
the storm, the good shiji must inevitably be cast away. Congress 
alone can furnish the preventive. The temper of the people here, and 
a thousand other considerations, point to the remedy. Let General 
Washington be immediately sent to Virginia with two or three thou- 
sand good troops. Let Congress, as the head of the Federal Union in 
this crisis, direct that, until the Legislature can convene and a Governor 
be appointed, the General be possessed of dictatorial powers, and that 
It be strongly recommended to the Assembly, when convened, to con- 
tinue those powers for six, eight, or ten months, as the case may be. 
And the General may be desired Instantly, on his arrival In Virginia, 
to summon the members of both Houses to meet where he shall ap- 
point, to organize and resettle their Government. You may be assured, 
SIi-, that if this is quickly done, and arms and ammunition forwarded, 
the enemy's possessions in the South will be very few, and the pros- 
pects they may propose to themselves from a truce, thus rendered abor- 
tive."

at Schoharie, whose place I have supplied by a com- 
pany of levies. Hazen's regiment I have ordered 
to Caghnawaga, about twenty-five miles above Sche- 
nectady, on the Mohawk River, leaving one company 
at Schenectady, for the purpose of forwarding stores 
up the river. Colonel Willett, with such of the levies 
as are not otherwise disposed of, will be stationed at 
the Rapid and Fort Plane, about half way between 
Caghnawaga and the German Flats. I flatter myself 
this disposition will meet your Excellency's approba- 
tion, especially when you consider the very extensive 
line of communication which is to be supported, and 
the very many avenues through which we are ex- 
posed to attacks from the enemy in small parties. 

From a variety of accounts, received through differ- 
ent channels, I am informed the enemy's force at 
Crown Point is near two thousand, though I cannot 
persuade myself that they are near so strong. A 
party of our Indians, I hear, have returned, and 
brought in two prisoners, who have not yet arrived 
in town, by whom I may possibly obtain some intel- 
ligence which may be depended on, and which, when 
received, shall be transmitted to head-quarters. From 
the complexion of Hazen's regiment, and their dispo- 
sition to mutiny, I could have wished they had not 
been sent up. They have been necessarily detained 
a few days in this city; and the numerous disaffected 
tribes, which swarm here, have so far inflamed their 
minds that they are already become almost ungovern- 
able. They have declared they will not march with- 
out money. Two of the principals, who had been 
confined, Avere forcibly released by their fellows last 
night, and the most disorderly conduct ensued. We 
have, however, apprehended them this morning, and 
a Court-Martial is now sitting to determine their fate.

338 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

With respect to provisions, I hope we shall be able 
to procure the necessary supplies of flour, but beef 
we are entirely destitute of I have directed Mr. 
Gamble to proceed to the eastward, and forward on, 
without loss of time, such quantities as he may be 
able to procure, either from Mr. Phelps, or Springfield, 
or both, agreeably to your Excellency's instruction. 
I have been so particularly attentive to the issues of 
provisions in this quarter, that shortly after my ar- 
rival here I ordered no returns to be answered unless 
countersigned by me, which I find has been product- 
ive of the best consequences. I could wish some 
direct line of conduct was pointed out, specifying 
who are the proper objects of public bounty, and 
who not; for, though the wives and children of the 
soldiers, as well as the Canada refugees, swell the 
provision returns to a very considerable amount, yet 
when we consider that the former cannot receive the 
reward either of their own or their husbands' labor, 
and the sacrifice which many of the latter have made 
by their voluntary exile, it appears an act of cruelty 
to deny them a scanty pittance. 

For the protection of the surviving part of this 
devoted State, I could wish the troops now here 
could be permitted to remain until absolute and im- 
mediate necessity calls for their services with the 
army. Their stations are compact, and in seven days 
of favorable weather they could be landed at West 
Point. There are now in the ground the most pro- 
mising crops, and the face of the country affords a 
most flattering prospect. Prudence and policy, as 
well as dear-bought experience, evidently dictate the 
necessity of endeavouring to preserve it. I must 
here beg leave to plead your Excellency's promise, 
and request that, when offensive operations commence

against the enemy, I may not be forgotten among 
those who are ambitious of devoting themselves and 
their services to the good of their country. I have 
the honor to be,

FROM ROBERT MORRIS. 

Philadelphia, 15 June, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 
I have been honored with your very kind and 
obliging letter of the 4th instant^ and should sooner 
have replied, but I am kept here in a kind of sus- 
pense by the very slow manner of proceeding in the 
Assembly of this State. I am Financier electa, but 
that is all; for had I taken the oath and my com- 
mission, my seat in the Assembly must have been 
vacated. And I think it of the utmost consequence 
to preserve my right of appearing there, until the 
tender and penal laws are totally repealed ; for I 
consider those laws as destructive of all credit, even 
amongst private people in dealings with one another. 
But to the public officers, after the experience we 
have had, it is evident that the existence of such 
laws much longer, must totally preclude them from 
every possibility of credit; and in our circumstances 
the war cannot be carried on without it. I have al- 



340 LETTEKS TO WASHINGTON. 

ready made such an impression on this siihject, that 
I feel prett}^ sure those laws will be repealed in this 
State within these few days ; and I expect the other 
Legislatures will readily follow the example. 

I am also pressing our Assembly to levy effective 
taxes in hard money. There are stronger objections 
made to this than the other measure, and they are 
more pertinaciously insisted on. But still they will, 
either wholly or partially, come into this also; and if 
once the ice is broken, they will see such advantages 
flowing from these foundations, as will readily induce 
them to follow up the plans that evidently prove, in 
the operation, how beneficial they are to the country. 

Insuperable obstacles have hitherto prevented me 
from bending my course towards your camp, and it 
seems yet uncertain when it may be in my power ; 
for although I stipulated with Congress that they 
should not rest any part of the present campaign on 
me, yet they cannot refrain, and already much of 
my time and attention is engaged in that way. 
Not having taken any commission, prevents me from 
calling on the several departments for such returns 
as I should choose to have with me when I wait on 
your Excellency ; for my objects are to reduce our 
public expenditures as nearly as possible to what 
they ought to be, and to obtain revenues in our own 
country, to meet those expenses as nearly as can be; 
and then to show foreign nations, engaged in the 
war, that we must look to them for the balance. 
And I am very confident, when they shall see exer- 
tions on one hand, and economy on the other, they 
will be willing to assist us all they consistently can. 
The promise you so cheerfully make, of granting all 
the support in your power, increases my own confi- 
dence, and I will, before long, engage in the duties 



THE AMEEICAN REVOLUTION. 341 

of my deiDartment, with all the energy I am master 
of; that is, provided these tender and penal laws 
are done away. I have the pleasure to hear, that 
Mr Lowry has sent one thousand barrels of flour 
to camp. From General Schuyler, I have not yet 
heard. I have the honor to be. 

Your Excellency's most devoted, humble servant, 

Robert Morris. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Camp, Bush River, 22 June, 1781. 

Sir, 

Your Excellency's letters of the 19th and 21st of 
April, I have had the honor to receive. Nothing 
would afford me greater pleasure than to have it in 
my power to oblige Major Macpherson, especially as 
it will afford me an opportunity of obliging your Ex- 
cellency at the same time. 

Inclosed is a copy of my last letter to Congress. 
Copies of my former letters I desired the President 
of Congress to forward to you, which I hope you 
have received. We are anxiously waiting the arrival 
of the second division of the French fleet. Virginia 
affords the most inviting object. Lord Cornwallis's ar- 
my, and the garrison and shipping at Portsmouth. 
The whole may be taken in three weeks, or less; 
while New York and Charleston will produce a long, 
tedious, and uncertain siege. I hope the Marquis 
will be successful in Virginia. What I mean by suc- 
cess is, to avoid a capital misfortune. Your Excel- 
lency will see, by my letters to Congress, I have left 
the command of all the force coming southward with 
the Marquis. My fears are principally from the ene- 
29* 



342 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

my's superior cavalry. To the northward, cavalry is 
nothing, from the numerous fences; but to the south- 
ward a disorder, by a superior cavalry, may be im- 
proved into a defeat, and a defeat into a rout. Vir- 
ginia and North Carolina could not be brought to 
consider the cavalry of such great importance as they 
are to the security of an army and the safety of a 
country. 

Before this, I hope the New England States have 
filled up their regiments. Nothing but drafting can 
lay a permanent foundation for the liberties of Ame- 
rica; and with it we have little to fear, even from a 
failure of our finance. I am, with great respect. 
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 

NaTHANAEL GPvEENE. 



FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Mattapony Elver, 24 June, 1781. 

My dear General, 

This letter will be handed by Colonel Morris, who 
waits upon jonv Excellency with General Greene's 
sentiments upon the different Avays to improve Count 
de Grasse's assistance. I have been desired to add 
my own ; but the last letter I had the honor to write 
has anticipated the information which General Greene 
wanted me to give. 

The light infantry are eight hundred and fifty ; the 
Pennsylvanians, about six hundred ; Virginia exchang- 
ed soldiers and new levies, four hundred ; the Mary- 
landers will be six hundred. We have one hundred 
and twenty dragoons, and a chance to obtain sixty 
more. Had we accoutrements, we could have two 
hundred more, whom Colonel AVhite has in readiness, 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 343 

with two hundred excellent horses, sixty of which I 
hope to equip by dismounting volunteers. As to 
militia, we may, in a few days, have three thousand. 
A demand from you upon the State of Maryland will 
procure one thousand well-armed militia. The conduct 
of some people in that State, appears to me very in- 
jurious to public interests. The new levies have been 
every day delayed, every petty pretence employed to 
prevent their joining either General Greene or this 
army. The danger of Baltimore, upon which I was 
not very hasty to quiet them, brought on a confession 
that the men were ready. I then demanded them, in 
most urgent terms. At last, I sent George there, who 
wrote me that they make a beautiful battalion. But 
he could not obtain more than a promise to send 
tlieni in three or four days. 

Portsmouth is evacuated with some precipitation. 
I wait for a more particular account before I write 
officially. Yesterday, M. de Camus, a French officer 
of the navy, reconnoitred the shipping in York River. 
There are sixty sail, — ten of which, armed vessels; the 
largest, a fifty-gun ship ; their situation very much 
exposed. The enemy are not yet fortifying at York. 
What is doing at Gloucester is rather upon a con- 
tracted scale. They do not appear very much alarm- 
ed. Colonel Dundas was heard to say that an Eng- 
lish and a French fleet had sailed at the same time. 
The intelligence concerning Count de Grasse has been 
kept a profound secret. 

My coming into this country has attracted this side 
a large portion of the enemy's force. In the mean- 
while General Wayne was filing off towards West- 
over, and the remainder of the army to Ruffin's Ferry. 
Should the enemy move southerly, we shall be at 
Westover before Wayne has done crossing, as the 



344 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

cavalry will be liiirriecl. The moment Count de Grasse 
arrives, I will collect our force about Good's Bridge, 
and wait for intelligence from him. 

Colonel Gimat, and the French officers I have men- 
tioned, are gone to Portsmouth, under pretence to see 
the fortifications which I have ordered to be levelled, 
and will proceed to Cape Henry, in order to deliver 
my despatches to the French Commanders, and give 
them every information in their power. Heavy artil- 
lery, and every thing relative to a siege, from the 
cannon to the tool, are not to be found this side of 
Philadelphia. Clothing, and particularly shoes, arms, 
dragoons' and horse equipments, ammunition, are arti- 
cles which your Excellency will be obliged to send 
from the northward. I may add, medicines and hos- 
pital stores. Could Lauzun's legion be forwarded with 
despatch, they will be extremely useful; they might 
come with you, and would, in the mean time, serve 
to the safety of your journey. 

As to provisions, my dear General, want of system 
will render our subsistence difficult, unless intelligent 
Commissaries are immediately sent on. If you in- 
tend, as I hope, to come yourself, you might send on 
the heads of departments. An early application upon 
the State of jMaryland may be productive of great 
good. My expectations have not, as yet, been com- 
municated to any General Officer, not even to the 
Executive. I wish to write a private letter to the 
Governor. Count de Grasse will arrive before long. 
In case important operations are carried on in Vir- 
ginia, which, I think, cannot fail to succeed, Mr. Mor- 
ris ought to send some hard money. From the 
moment I took the command of this army, there has 
not been a farthing sent from the Treasury; and this 
State money is good for nothing. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 345 

Lord Cornwallis's force at Richmond was four thou- 
sand. There were then, at least, one thousand in 
Portsmouth. Some have been killed, and some are 
sick. But, if you add sailors, he will have much up- 
wards of five thousand men, at the least. With the 
highest regard and affection, I have the honor to he, 
my dear General, 

Your affectionate friend, 

Lafayette.

FROM COLONEL COBB.* 

Newton, 30 June, 1781. 



I was at Count Rochamheau's this evening, when 
I received your Excellency's despatches. General 
Chastellux was immediately sent for, and the heads 
of departments consulted on the new-intended route 
of the army. The Count inquired whether your Ex- 
cellency was acquainted with the removal of the 
Yagers, and some other troops, from Long Island to 
New York. I assured him your Excellency was per- 
fectly acquainted with it, and all the other move- 
ments of the enemy at New York; and that your 
Excellency would never undertake a matter of this 
kind, but upon certain intelligence and the surest 
grounds of success. 

The Count was perfectly satisfied with the plan 
proposed, and assured me that duty, as well as in- 
clination, prompted him to comply with your Excel- 
lency's wishes. Orders are accordingly given for the 
march of the first brigade in the morning; and the

Duke's legion, whicli is now at New Stratford, will 
undoubtedly march at the same time. It will be 
at the place of destination by the time proposed, 
twelve o'clock. The rest of the army will follow 
when the other division arrives, which comes up to- 
morrow. The Count, in his letter, wishes an answer 
from your Excellency by to-morrow night. It would 
be more agreeable if it comes sooner.=-- I am, &c.,

FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL KNOX. 

Peekskill, 2 July, 1781. 

Sir, 

I came to this place to-day, to take your Excel- 
lency's ultimate directions when the park should join 
the army, and to take any other orders your Excel- 
lency should please to give me ; but I was disap- 
pointed by the army and your Excellency having 
moved. I presume the laboratory preparations will 
be in such forwardness by Sunday next, that we 
might then move without retarding any thing mate- 
rial. The artificers must remain longer. 

If your Excellency should think fit to alter the 
time of the arrival of the stores from Philadelphia, I 
pray you to write to the Board of War on the sub- 
ject. If your Excellency should be engaged in any 
operations, which j^ou intend to lead to immediate ac- 
tion, I hope I may with confidence expect your sum- 
mons, even previous to the time mentioned above. I 
beg the favor of a speedy answer; and am

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 347 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL WAYNE. 

Chickahominy Church, 8 miles from Jamestown, 
8 July, 1781. 

Dear General, 

After a variety of marches and countermarches, 
frequently offering battle to Lord Cornwallis upon 
military terms, the Marquis de Lafayette received in- 
telligence on the 5tli that the enemy had marched 
from Williamsburg for Jamestown, and were preparing 
to throw their baggage and troops over that river. 
This induced the General to make a forward move 
to this place with the Continental troops, including 
Major Macpherson's little legion, together with a few 
volunteer dragoons under Colonel Mercer and Captain 
Hill, the vicinity of which to the enemy was such as 
to put it into his powder to strike them, should the 
passage of the James be their object. 

On the morning of the 6th several corroborating 
advices arrived, removing every doubt upon that head, 
with the addition that nothing but a forced march, 
with the lightest and most advanced part of the troops, 
could arrive in time to affect their rear. This induced 
the Marquis to order the advanced guard, ]\Iajor Mac- 
pherson's, Colonel Mercer's, and Captain Hill's corps, 
one hundred and fifty riflemen, with Colonel Stewart's 
detachment of Pennsylvanians, amounting in the Avhole 
to about five hundred men, artillery and dragoons in- 
cluded, to make a forward move under my conduct, 
and endeavour to come up with the enemy. 

Upon our arrival at the Green Spring Farm, a va- 
riety of contradictory intelligence rendered it prudent 
to reconnoitre them with a military eye. Their vast 
superiority in horse also made it expedient to ad- 
vance the whole of our little corps to drive in their 



348 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

guards, and keep their horse in check. About this 
period the Marquis arrived in person, and adopted 
the manoeuvre, Avhich being effected, it was soon dis- 
covered that a very considerable part of their army 
yet remained on this side of the river, -which induced 
the General to send for the remainder of the Conti- 
nentals, distant about six miles. At two o'clock, P. M., 
a large smoke was raised by the enemy, probably as 
a signal to their parties to return to camp, and for 
all such as had crossed the river to repass it. 

At three o'clock the riflemen, supported by a few 
regulars, began and kept up a galling fire upon the 
enemy, which continued until five in the evening, 
when the British began to move forward in five 
columns. The Marquis, anxious to view them near, 
had proceeded rather far upon their left. It was 
therefore thought proper to order Major Galvan, at 
the head of the advanced guard, to meet and attack 
their front ; who, after a spirited though unequal con- 
test, retired upon our left. A detachment of the 
light infantry, under Major Willis, having that mo- 
ment arrived, also commenced a severe fire upon the 
enemy's left, but were obliged to fall back; which 
the enemy taking advantage of, began to turn our 
flanks, a manoeuvre by which, had they persevered, 
they must inevitably have penetrated between this 
corps and the other part of the army. But being 
joined at this crisis by Lieutenant-Colonel Harmer 
and JNIajor Edwards, with two detachments from the 
second and third battalions of Pennsylvanians, under 
Colonel Hampton, it was determined, among a choice 
of difficulties, to advance and charge them. This was 
done with such vivacity as to produce the desired 
effect; that is, checking them in their advance, and 
divertin2; them from their first manoeuvre. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 349 

But, being enveloped by numbers, many brave and 
worthy officers and soldiers killed or wounded, we 
found it expedient to fall back half a mile to Green 
Spring Farm. Two of our field-pieces, which were 
necessarily introduced to keep up the idea of our 
being in force, were served with equal spirit and 
effect, until disabled by having Captain Crosby, with 
many matrosses, dangerously wounded, and all the 
horses killed. They at last fell into their hands. 
The wagons and ammunition were carried off safe. 
The enemy, sore from the contest, and finding us 
supported at that place by the remainder of the 
light infantry, were content with barely keeping the 
field, although opposed but by a handful of men 
compared with their numbers ; and who, from the 
nature of the ground, were obliged to act in a de- 
tached manner, except that part of the Pennsylvania 
line which had time to arrive, and then not more 
than five hundred men, with a few dragoons under 
Major Macpherson. 

From the mutual emulation in the officers and men 
of each corps, I am confident that, had the army 
been in force, victory would have inclined to our 
arms. However, every circumstance considered, our 
small reconnoitring party of horse and foot, who had 
the hardiness to engage Lord Cornwallis at the head 
of his whole army, with the advantage of so nume- 
rous a cavalry, on their own ground, and in their 
own camp, is more to be envied than pitied ; as it 
not only disconcerted the British General, and effectu- 
ally amused him from his premeditated manoeuvre, 
but precipitated his retreat to James Island the same 
night, to avoid a general action in the morning, which 
the pointed attack he experienced in the evening 
might be the sanguinary prelude to.

50 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 



Our Field-Officers were generally dismounted by 
havino* their horses either killed or wounded under 
them. Colonel Cheeves, and other young Virginian 
gentlemen of his corps, were not more fortunate. I 
will not condole with the Marquis for the loss of 
two of his, as he was frequently requested to keep 
at a greater distance. His native bravery rendered 
him deaf to the admonition. I cannot attempt to 
discriminate between any corps of officers or men so 
equally deserving; but beg leave to observe, that if 
they possess a fault, it is an excess of bravery, a 
crime the least to be reprehended in a soldier. 

As the Marquis de Lafayette will furnish your Ex- 
cellency with a general return of the killed and 
wounded, I shall only mention that the enemy, from 
every account and circumstance, have sustained a loss 
of near three hundred men in Idlled and wounded, 
among whom are many officers. 

I have the honor to be, &c., 

Anthony Wayne. 

P. S. Colonel Stewart requests his best compli- 
ments to your Excellency. His small detachment suf- 
fered most, from their local situation.

Dear Sir, 
I am honored with your Excellency's letter of 25tli

General Parsons, inclosed. Your feelings of distress 
excite a sympathy in my breast, and a readiness to 
do all in my power to remove the occasion. That the

Committee from the Connecticut line of the army did 
not accomplish a full settlement, was to me a mat- 
ter of sorrow, and fear for its consequences. The 
veteran troops who faithfully served, and bravely en- 
dured so many distresses in defence of their own and 
their country's righteous cause, in the unhappj'' con- 
test with the British King and Ministry, and con- 
tinue therein to the end, will be rewarded, acknow- 
ledged, and remembered with love and gratitude by 
this and future generations. Surely, none will forsake 
it, or cause disturbances at tliis time, when in a near 
view of a happy issue. Those who do, will meet with 
reproach and regret. 

The country, universally, have had many, very many 
embarrassments and great difficulties to encounter and 
struggle through; enemies secret as well as open; 
no permanent army raised ; soldiers to be hired into 
the service for short periods, at extravagantly high 
prices ; no magazines of provisions ; an army to be 
fed from hand to mouth ; finances deranged ; public 
credit abused and ruined ; a rapid depreciation of 
the currency ; the army not paid or clothed ; the force 
and pernicious policy of a cruel and inveterate ene- 
my to be met and avoided ; heavy taxes ; unreasona- 
ble jealousies ; with a train of other grievances more 
easily conceived than expressed. Suffer me to men- 
tion one more, by way of inquiry; — whether it is not 
grievous to hear our officers say, " that they have 
no justice to hope for from the State, unless their 
accounts are closed, and their wages and subsistence 
secured, before the period arrives in which they have 
no further occasion for the services of the army." 

I do sincerely wish for that period, and will then, 
and ever, exert myself to obtain justice for the offi- 
cers and soldiers of our line, as freely as I have 



352 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

done so to bring the war to a liappy close. A full 
settlement was agreed on for the pay and wages of 
our line. The subsistence of the officers is the only 
matter unsettled. It was proposed to give them, eight- 
pence half-penny per ration, not from the first of 
April last, as mentioned in the letter, but from the 
first of April, 1780 ; the residue to lie open for the 
determination of Congress. 

The Le2;islature of this State is not sitting. To 
call it to meet at this season, when every other busi- 
ness, public and domestic, calls for the attention of 
the members, will cause discontent and uneasiness. 
You may depend on my giving the subject as early 
a consideration as may be found convenient, and con- 
sistent with other circumstances. A sum of money 
for our line of the army, as much as can be collected, 
shall be forwarded soon. I liave the honor to be, with 
sentiments of great regard and consideration, &c., 

Jonathan Trumbull. 



FROM SAMUEL HUNTINGTON, IN CONGRESS. 

PhiladelpMa, 10 July, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 
My health is so much impaired, by long confine- 
ment and application, as compels me to retire from 
Congress. I have the pleasure to inform your Ex- 
cellency, they have elected his Excellency Thomas 
McKean, to be their President. It also gives me 
much satisfaction, on retiring, to see our public afiliirs, 
in many respects, wear a more promising aspect than 
heretofore. The enemy, at present, in every part of 
the United States, seem to be reduced to a situa- 
tion merely on the defensive ; and, should the States

improve the opportunity with proper and vigorous 
exertions, we have reason to hope, from the smiles 
of Providence, yet more favorable events. 

The distresses we have suffered from the deranged 
state of our finances begin to be relieved; and the 
arrangements taken by the appointment of a Super- 
intendent of Finance, and the measures he is adopt- 
ing, give me great encouragement on that most im- 
portant subject. I am now to take leave of your 
Excellency, with respect to my official correspondence. 
But be assured, Sir, my warmest wishes still continue 
to attend you, that your military operations may be 
prospered and crowned with the most desirable event, 
a speedy and honorable peace, and that you may 
experience many days of tranquillity in the enjoy- 
ment of the happy fruits of your important and ardu- 
ous services in the cause of your country. 

Whatever my future situation in life may be, I shall 
always love my country. In her happiness and pros- 
perity will consist my own, personally. Should my 
state of health permit me the pleasure of waiting 
upon your Excellency (which a few days' journey 
will determine), I shall certainly improve the oppor- 
tunity on my return to Connecticut. I have the 
honor to be, with the highest respect and esteem. 

Your most humble servant, 

Samuel Huntington.

next week, and on my passage sliall hold a treaty 
with the Green Mountain Boys. But not having seen, 
or been acquainted with those turbulent sons of free- 
dom, for several years, I am at a loss to determine 
my reception; but hope it will be such as shall tend 
to the general good. I shall endeavour to give you 
a more particular account on my arrival at Saratoga. 

My health is not fully restored, but perhaps com- 
petent to my new command. That the operations of 
the campaign may be such as shall render the Ame- 
rican arms glorious in the eyes of the world, and the 
conclusion produce a peace, honorable and lasting, is 
the ardent desire of, dear Sir,

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Head-Quarters, on the High Hills of Santee, 
17 July, 1781. 

Sir, 

Since I wrote your Excellency at Little River, near 
Ninety Six, I have been favored with your despatch 
of June the 1st. It affords me great pleasure to 
hear that an attack is meditating against New York. 
This measure no doubt will create a powerful diver- 
sion in favor of this country ; and I wish most ardentr 
ly that the Northern States may enable you to com- 
plete its reduction. But I confess this is so import- 
ant an object, that I can hardly flatter myself with 
so fortunate an event. 

The copy of my former letters to Congress will in- 
form your Excellency of the measures I took for the 
defence of Virginia; and inclosed is a copy of my 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 355 

letter to Congress, giving an account of our move- 
ments in this quarter, since we raised the siege of 
Ninety Six. I hope the steps I took both with re- 
spect to Virginia and here, will meet your approba- 
tion. The Marquis has conducted the operations in 
Virginia, as far as I can learn, with great good con- 
duct, and I hope Congress will give him a testimony 
of their good opinion of it. When I found Virginia 
was going to be attacked in so formidable a manner, 
I halted all the troops coming to the southward, and 
determined to struggle with the little force I had in 
the best manner I could, until I could learn better 
the enemy's intentions in that quarter. I thought, 
upon the whole, it was much better to keep up the 
war here, than to give up three States in an attempt 
to afford Virginia such an ineffectual reenforcement, 
as I could have carried to her aid, which must have 
been greatly reduced by a march of at least four 
hundred miles. Besides, if I had left this country, 
the enemy would have been able to detach to Virgi- 
nia a far greater force than I could have carried 
there ; and the efforts of the militia in this quarter, 
for want of countenance, would have totally ceased. 
All these considerations determined me in the line 
of conduct I pursued ; and I hope time will show the 
measure to be warranted from every principle of good 
policy. 

The late European intelligence, I am apprehensive, 
will determine the enemy upon a new plan of con- 
ducting the war. For, instead of attempting to over- 
run the whole country, I expect they will make an 
effort to complete the reduction of two States, and 
secure the possession of New York. Intelligence, 
therefore, from the northward will be important. 
Should your Excellency get any information by which 



356 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

their intentions may be explained, I beg you will 
forward it with all possible despatch. I am with great 
respect and regard, 

Your Excellency's obedient^ humble servant, 

Nathanael Greene. 



FROM GOVERNOR TRUMBULL. 

Lebanon, 17 July, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 

Since my last to your Excellency, I have received 
a letter from General Parsons, dated the 10th in- 
stant, filled with severe remarks and reflections on 
our Legislature. A copy thereof, with my answer, 
is inclosed. 

I wish to do the things that make for peace with 
both officers and men of the Connecticut line of the 
army, consisting of our own people, raised for defend- 
ing and securing the rights and liberties of the whole, 
embarked in the same common cause, and to return 
to citizens again when the contest with the British 
King and Ministry is ended; to prevent, if possible, 
discord and division, so very dangerous in our situa- 
tion, and hazardous to our present operations. Surely 
the officers do not desire to inflame the soldiery with 
apprehensions that the Assembly deny them that 
justice which was done them the last year, with 
which they were satisfied, when the Committee from 
the line know the whole accounts of pay and wages 
were gone through, and ready to be closed on the 
same principles, and that nothing remained in ques- 
tion but only the detained rations of the officers. 
This was not agitated, till it became time for the 
Committee to return to their duty ; when there was 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 357 

scarcely time for the members of so numerous a "body 
to deliberate on the subject. Eightpence half-penny 
per ration was offered from the 1st of April, 1780. 
jMany were of opinion, that by the time of payment, 
that rate would be more than sufficient for the same. 
Others proposed to secure a specific payment. As to 
what was due before that 1st of April, 1780, it natu- 
rally lay open for the direction of the Honorable Con- 
gress. 

In the midst of these deliberations, the Committee 
left us unexpectedly. I observed no design to deny 
justice to the officers ; to the soldiery there could be 
none. The accounts were fully agreed, prepared, and 
ready to be closed. I choose to forbear any recrimi- 
nation. Yet suffer me to inquire, why the Committee 
from the line did not bring on the settlement for 
detained rations earlier. They knew it must require 
time of deliberation, when they well knew the prin- 
ciples for settlement of pay and wages were agreed 
on the last year. Do they mean to press for more 
than justice, from the necessity of their present ser- 
vices, and the fears of fatal consequences if denied? 
The whole line know and ought to consider their pay 
and wages are secured in full value, while the de- 
preciation operates as a heavy tax upon the rest of 
the people. The officers may likewise consider, that 
their pay ^vas raised by Congress, fifty per cent, 
above what the State agreed with them for. The 
maxim adopted by the enemy is that old one of 
divide ct imjiera. Shall we suffer avarice to divide 
and ruin us and our cause, and give • them opportu- 
nity to exult and triumph over us ? 

Providence hath and doth smile propitiously upon 
us, and calls aloud for union, vigorous exertions, pa- 
tience, and perseverance, and to endure hardship as 



358 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

good soldiers, that the end may be peace. Justice 
and peace ride together in the same chariot. It will 
he my constant endeavour, that peace may be obtain- 
ed on just and honorable terms, and that justice be 
done to them who jeopard their lives in the high 
places of the field, in defence of, and to secure the 
blessings of freedom for ourselves and posterity. 

I wrote yesterday to the Treasurer, to inform me 
this week, what sum of hard money is and can be 
immediately collected for the arm}'-, which shall be 
sent forward without delay. The measures directed, 
and orders given for raising and marching our troops 
to the army, are now diligently carrying into execu- 
tion. I have the honor to be, with every sentiment 
of esteem and consideration. 

Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 

JONATH.iN TeUMBULL. 



FROM COLONEL PICKERING. 

Camp, ID July, 1781. 

Sir, 

General Knox has called on me to-day, respecting 
a provision of horses for the light artillery. I have 
authorized Colonel Hughes to purchase one hundred 
for thai service onli/, and promised payment by the 
1st of November. He writes me, encouragingly, that 
many may be so procured. The essential service to 
which they are to be applied will, I trust, facilitate 
a grant of money to enable me to fulfil my promise, 
which no ordinary calls would have induced me to 
hazard. 

I have heard nothing of the horses expected from 
Pennsylvania since Colonel Mills wrote me, on the 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 359 

29tli ultimo, that, " on that and the following days, 
he should send money to all the counties where any 
horses remained, to enable the drivers to defray their 
expenses to the army." I desired they might he 
shod before they left the State. This may have 
retarded their progress a few days. I think they 
cannot now be far off. I expect they amount to a 
hundred ; but the numbers given me on paper have 
so often deceived me, I will not undertake to say 
how many will arrive. General Knox demands one 
hundred for the light artillery, which he is impatient 
to ])ring into the field. There is no practicable way 
of procuring them with despatch, but by an impress. 
In this part of New York there are few or no horses 
worth impressing. The other parts of this State have 
been harassed by impresses during the whole winter. 
Jersey has suffered in this way very little, nor am I 
informed of its having made any material effort^ either 
in furnishing supplies or services, since the last cam- 
paign. If one hundred horses were impressed there 
on this occasion, they might probably be relieved by 
those from Pennsylvania and Colonel Hughes's pur- 
chases, in the course of a fortnight or three weeks. 

As the enemy's shipping have gone down the 
river, I request your Excellency's determination whe- 
ther a ferry-boat or two, capable of carrying horses, 
and some of Major Darby's bateaux, should not be 
brought down to Dobbs's Ferry; whether, if the 
Jersey troops continue on the other side, the trans- 
portation of stores from Trenton and Morristown may 
not be turned thither; and whether the route of the 
expresses from Philadelphia may not be shortened in 
the same way. 

I beg leave to add, on the subject of an impress 
of horses, that, if your Excellency should judge it 



360 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

expedient to adopt the measure, Lieutenant-Colonel 
Dearborn will cross the river, consult Colonel Day- 
ton, and fix on the proper persons to make the im- 
press, aided by small detachments from the Jersey 
line. I have the honor to be, with the greatest 
respect; 

Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

Timothy Pickering. 



FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Malvan Hill, 20 July, 1781. 

My DEAR General, 

This letter is not by any means directed to the 
Commander-in-chief, but to my most intimate and long- 
cherished friend. I will lay before you my circum- 
stances and my wishes. Certain I am you will do 
whatever you can for me, that is consistent with your 
public duty. 

When I went to the southward, you know I had 
some private objections. But I became sensible of 
the necessity there was for the detachment to go, 
and I knew that, had I returned, there was nobody 
that could lead them on against their inclinations. 
My entering this State was happily marked by a 
service to the capital. Virginia became the grand 
object of the enemy, as it was the point to which the 
Ministry tended. I had the honor to command an 
army, and oppose Lord Cornwallis. When incompara- 
bly inferior to him, fortune was pleased to preserve 
us ; when equal in numbers, though not in kind of 
troops, we have also been pretty lucky. Cornwallis 
had the disgrace of a retreat, and this State being 
recovered, Government is properly reestablished. The 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 361 

enemy are under the protection of their works at 
Portsmouth. 

It appears an embarkation is taking place, probably 
destined to New York. The war in this State would 
then become a plundering one, and great manoeuvres 
be out of the question. A prudent officer would do 
our business here, and the Baron is so to the utmost. 
AVould it be possible, my dear General, that in case 
a part of the British troops go to New York, I may 
be allowed to join the combined armies ? I know the 
command of a separate army ought not to be quitted. 
But, besides the services I may render in the co- 
operation, some arrangements, which I leave to your 
goodness for me to think of, may put me in a very 
brilliant station. 

jM. de Choisy, I am told, is very unhappy to be left 
behind. Perhaps these French troops will be replaced 
by militia, which requires a general officer; perhaps 
a corps of observation in the Jerseys will be given 
to another. The militia requires a Major-General, as 
it Avill be very numerous. Does not General St. Clair 
take command of the Pennsylvania line, and will not 
this line be forwarded to the southward, rather than 
the New England light infantry ? So that, my dear 
General, I hope something may be found for me in 
the Continental part of the army; the more so, as it 
seems it will form one of the divisions of the com- 
bined army under your command. 

I have calculated that nothing very material would 
happen before September. By that time your forces 
will be collected, clothed, and arranged ; a succour 
from the West Indies may arrive ; you will then de- 
cide if the upper part of the Island, Long Island, 
Staten Island, or New York Island, is to be in our 
possession. This letter goes to-day by a faithful ser- 

VOL. III. 31 



362 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

vant. It will arrive on the 29tli at camp. Your 
answer might he with me so that I may leave on the 
10th, and arrive at head-quarters about the 20th. 
This matter I have not mentioned to any body, and 
wish it may rest between you and me. Lord Corn- 
wallis is every day inquiring about my going to the 
Grand Army, which he says must be soon the case. 
This induces me to think they believe you are in 
earnest in your preparations. 

The command of this army has been a great mat- 
ter for me. You may end this campaign of mine in 
the most brilliant manner, by the command I may, 
with some arrangements, get in the combined army. 
The services I may render, with respect to the co- 
operation, may be a very good reason, and my com- 
ing unexpectedly, unless I have many senior officers 
in the way, may entitle me to a great command. 
Should not a great part of the operating army in 
this quarter go to New York, I would not trouble 
you with my wishes to return to head-quarters. But 
do not, I pray, believe I have the least notion of 
calculating upon commands, though in my personal 
circumstances they become peculiarly important to 
me. If I may be of the least use to you, it will 
make me happy to serve as a volunteer Aid-de-camp 
to you. 

Since writing the inclosed, my dear General, an 
officer of Tarleton's legion, who has been taken, was 
brought to my quarters. He had much conversation 
with my Aids-de-camp, and being an unguarded young 
man, spoke very freely. He says Lord Cornwallis 
and Colonel Tarleton are certainly going to New 
York. He adds, the light infentry, and a regiment 
of horse, do certainly embark for the same place. 
Preference is given to such troops as were the most 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 363 

fatigued in their manoeuvres through Virginia. He 
thinks the guards are to remain here ; does not know 
the disposition of any other troops. I thought this 
was worth mentioning to you. Would to God this 
embarkation could be intercepted ! '•' 

I have this day seen the order of battle.f It ap- 
pears to me General St. Clair is not comprehended 
in it. The Jersey troops, not being there, are, I pre- 
sume, destined to a diversion with the New Jersey 
militia. New England, or the whole body of the 
militia, will perhaps furnish some general employ- 
ment, so that I hope I may be put in, at all events. 
I should be with you, and of course should be very 
happy. 

Should the enemy remain quiet in this State, the 
Baron might do very well. But if the siege of New 
York does not succeed, and there is no place, I ima- 
gine you will march here in force. Adieu, my dear 
General. You will not forget this letter is entirely 
private, and by no means directed to the Command- 
er-in-chief With every sentiment of respect, and the 
most tender affection, I have the honor to be, my 
dear General, &c., 

Lafayette. 

P. S. In case there is no appearance of a move 
of the enemy, and no propriety in our going toward 
Portsmouth, I intend reconnoitring the grounds about 
Fredericksburg, where, if I am made certain nothing 
will happen in my absence, I may meet your letter. 

* As no such movements in Cornwallis's anny took place, it is 
probable that this officer of Tarleton's legion was a -willing prisoner, and 
a spy in disguise.

364 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM TILE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Malvau Hill, 30 July, 1781. 

My dear General, 

Your letter of the loth is just come to hand. The 
moment a perfect intelligence can be got, Major Mac- 
pherson ^vill be despatched. But some expressions in 
3'our last favor ^vill, if possible, augment my vigilance 
in keeping you well apprised of the enemy's move- 
ments. 

There are, in Hampton Road, thirty transport 
ships full of troops, most of them red-coats ; there 
are eight or ten brigs, which have cavalry on board. 
They had excellent winds, and yet they are not 
gone. Some say they have received advices from 
New York in a row-boat. The escort, as I mentioned 
before, is the Charon, and several frigates; the last 
account says, seven. The light infantry. Queen's 
rangers, and two British regiments, are, I think, on 
board. Two German regiments are, it seems, destined 
to the same service. I cannot be positive, and do 
not even think Lord Cornwallis has been fully deter- 
mined. I have got in Portsmouth many people that 
watch his motions. But none has been able to slip 
out. His Lordship went to Old Point Comfort, had 
a survey taken of the properest place to build a fort, 
had the soundings examined, and returned to Ports- 
mouth with General Leslie. 

This State is so difficult to be defended, that one 
false step involves the one that does not command 
the water, in a series of inconveniences. His Lord- 
ship has taken pilots for the Bay and for Ports- 
mouth. This, I suppose, is a feint. But a march south 
of James River, throws me out of supporting distance 
for any thing that is north of it; a march to the 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 365 

north gives the enemy command of every thing south 
of the river. 

Two battalions of light infantry and the militia are 
at this place, the healthiest and best-watered spot in 
the State. General Wayne is at Good's Bridge, on 
the Appomattox, with the Pennsylvanians and Virgi- 
nia Continentals, and looks toward Roanoke or Ports- 
mouth. Muhlenberg, with a battalion of light infint- 
ry, some riflemen, and the horse, has an intermediar}^ 
position between me and Suffolk, in the neighbour- 
hood of which moves a party of militia under Colonel 
Parker. General Weedon is in person at Fredericks- 
burg, and, the moment a fleet appears, will call out 
the militia. Gregory is on the other side of the Dis- 
mal Swamp. I cannot hear from him, but sent him 
orders by a safe hand to call out the militia, mount 
some cannon on the passes, and take out of the way 
every boat which might serve the enemy to go to 
North Carolina. You know, my dear General, that, 
with a very trifling transportation, they may go by 
water from Portsmouth to Wilmington. The only 
way to shut up that passage is to have an army be- 
fore Portsmouth, and posted at the head of these 
rivers ; a movement, which, unless I was certain of 
a naval superiority, might prove ruinous. But, should 
a fleet come into Hampton Road, and should I get 
some days' notice, our situation would be very agree- 
able. 

I am endeavouring to get a cavalry, and it is not 
without trouble. Transportation is a great objection 
to the formation of magazines. A naval superiority 
would also level that difflculty. It appears a pretty 
large body of troops have been sent to Kemp's Land- 
ing ; some cannon removed from Portsmouth ; but no- 
thing that can make his Lordship's intentions perfectly 
31* 



366 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

understood. Any certainty of a naval superiority, I 
would wish to know instantly, as then I will give 
his Lordship every opportunity to go up the rivers. 
There is a chain of expresses ; but I shall see that 
it is more properly conducted. With the highest 
esteem and most tender afFection, my dear General, 

Yours, Lafayette. 



FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Camp, on the Pamunky, 6 August, 1781. 

My DEAR General, 

The embarkation, which I thought and do still 
think to have been destined to New York, was re- 
ported to have sailed up the Bay, and to be bound 
to Baltimore, in consequence of which, I wrote to 
your Excellency, and, as I had not indulged mj^self 
too near Portsmouth, I was able to cut across to- 
wards Fredericksburg. But, instead of continuing his 
voyage up the Bay, my Lord entered York Biver, 
and landed at York and Gloucester. To the former 
vessels were added a number of flat-bottomed boats. 
Our movements have not been precipitate. We were 
in time to take our course down Pamunky Biver, and 
will move to some position where the several parts of 
the army Vv^ill unite. 

I have some militia in Gloucester county, and some 
in York. We shall act agreeably to circumstances, 
but avoid drawing ourselves into a false movement, 
which, for want of cavalry and command of the ri- 
vers, would give the enemy the advantage of us. His 
Lordship plays so well, that no blunder can be hoped 
from him to recover a bad step of ours. The troops 
in York and Gloucester are, — two battalions of light 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 367 

infantry; two large Auspacli regiments, the eightieth 
and seventy-sixth, which are said to be the two larg- 
est ones in the British army; the forty-third, the 
Queen's rangers, and some horse. Lord Cornwallis 
himself commands. General O'Hara is in Portsmouth 
with the remainder of the troops. Leslie is, it is 
said, gone in a frigate to Charleston. You must not 
wonder, my dear General, that there has been a fluc- 
tuation in my intelligence. I am positive the British 
counsels have also been fluctuating. I am so earnest 
in my opinion, that I should not be surprised if the 
light infantry and Anspachers were detached to New 
York. 

York is surrounded by the river and a morass. 
The entrance is but narrows There is, however, a 
commanding hill (at least I am so informed), which, 
if occupied by them, w^ould much extend their works. 
Gloucester is a neck of land projected into the river, 
and opposite to York. Their vessels, the biggest of 
which is a forty-four, are between the two towns. 
Should a fleet come in at this moment, our affairs 
would take a very happy turn. 

General Gregory and Colonel Parker have been 
directed to collect forces, and press near Portsmouth. 
I have written to North Carolina to be guarded 
against any movement by land. I have written to 
]Maryland for their new levies ; and, as agreeably to 
your intentions, his Lordship's remaining in the State 
keeps me with this army, I am still more anxious, 
if possible, to receive the private communications that 
have been announced. Had not your attention been 
turned to New York, something, with a fleet, might 
be done in this quarter. But I see New York is 
the object, and consequently I attend to your in- 
structions by Captain Olney. It is the more import- 



368 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

ant for me to know what Lord Cornwallis ought to 
do for fulfilling your Excellency's wishes, as we 
might try to influence his Lordship's manoeuvres, and 
endeavour to determine them towards a wrong point. 

Vessels are gone back to Portsmouth, it is thought, 
to fetch troops and cannon. Perhaps his Lordship 
does not choose to keep two distant posts. 

I Leg, my dear General, you will forgive the more 
than usual scribbling of this hasty letter; and have 
the honor to be, with a respect equal to my affection, 
my dear General, 

Your obedient servant and friend, 

Lafayette. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Head- Quarters, High HUls of Santee, 
6 August, 1781. 

Sir, 
Governor Rutledge arrived in camp a few days 
since, and informed me that a French fleet of twenty 
sail of the line, besides frigates, were to be on the 
coast by the 25th of this month, to cooperate with 
the American army for dispossessing the enemy of 
the several posts they hold in the United States; 
and that there are to come with the fleet from five 
to ten thousand troops, to facilitate operations. So 
great a naval and land force, aided by our own ex- 
ertions, cannot fail, if properly directed, of totally 
ruining the enemy in this country. As late and full 
information will be necessary to enable your Excel- 
lency to judge what objects to give the preference 
to, as well as what force may be necessary for each, 
I have taken the earliest opportunity to communicate 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 369 

the fullest intelligence I possess from tins quarter. 
And, as you may wish to make more inquiries, I 
have sent the despatches by one of my Aids, Lieute- 
nant-Colonel Morris, that you may not only be satis- 
fied in all matters respecting our situation, but that 
you may have a better opportunity of conveying such 
instructions in return as may be unsafe to write. 

Major Burnett, one of my Aids, who is much in- 
disposed, set out from this camp eight or ten days 
since for the northward. By him I wrote fully our 
situation, and I desired him to give your Excellency 
such information as I had omitted to mention in my 
letter. But, as this is a new matter, I thought it 
most advisable to send Colonel Morris, notwithstand- 
ing, I have received no letters from the Marquis for 
near a month, and none from your Excellency since 
the 1st of June, in which you informed me of the 
preparations making for an attempt upon New York. 
By this time I suppose the operations are in great 
forAvardness ; and, if the force from the islands arrive 
agreeably to the Ministers' expectations, the reduction 
of the place must be speedy and certain. New York, 
as a place of arms, and from the importance of its 
situation to harass and distress our people, may be 
considered as the greatest object on the Continent; 
and, in my opinion, every effort should be made for 
its reduction in preference to all others. If that 
place w\as reduced, and the enemy could not repos- 
sess it, I think it would lay the foundation for their 
evacuating all the possessions in the United States 
south of it. There would be no harbour for their 
shipping, except in Virginia, and no convenient place 
there for an army to winter in, which would neces- 
sarily oblige them to quit their possessions in that 
quarter. 



370 LETTERS TO AV A SHIN GT ON. 

The forces that the enemy have in Virginia under 
Lord Cornwallis, and at Portsmouth, from the best 
inform.ition I can get, amount to little more than five 
thousand men. The Marquis's regular force is not 
more than two to three ; but there is a large body 
of militia in the field, and it may be increased to al- 
most any number, if arms could be had. Twenty-five 
hundred regular forces, to be added to the Marquis's 
arm}^, besides what may be expected from Pennsyl- 
vania and Virginia, would oblige Cofnwallis to take 
a position and fortify himself; and if the supplies to 
his army could be cut off by water, which the fleet 
may easily effect, after the reduction of New York, 
lie would be obliged to surrender in a fortniiiht or 
three weeks at most, for want of provisions; for I 
believe he has none laid in at any point, nor in 
expectation of being obliged to act on the defensive. 
At least, I am persuaded he has no apprehension of 
having his water communication interrupted. After 
the reduction of New York, I should suppose the 
whole French fleet might enter the Chesapeake, and, 
all hopes of escaping by Avater being removed, it 
would greatly contribute to the speedy surrender of 
the enemy, from the terror and apprehensions it would 
raise among the troops. 

Charleston is the greatest object to the southward, 
as Avell from the strength of its garrison and depend- 
encies, as from the advantages the enemy derive from 
the trade of the place, and the distress it brings 
upon the people for w^ant of commerce, particularly 
in the article of salt. The place is strong, and diffi- 
cult to approach. Large shipping can be of no use 
in the reduction of it. Frigates are the largest size 
that can enter the harbour. The enemy have fortified 
none of the islands, nor have they added many works 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 371 

about the town. However, tliey have erected two 
laro-e new works in front of the old lines, that mount 
from twenty to thirty pieces of cannon each. These 
works have great command of the town, as well as 
the rivers. One other new work is nearly completed 
on the marsh, called Shute's Folly, on the harbour 
side of the town, and intended to defend the place 
against shipping. The enemy have, from the best in- 
formation I can get, in this State about four thou- 
sand infantry and four hundred horse, of regular 
troops. Besides these, they have near one thousand 
militia and Tories, who adhere to their interest. In 
addition to this, one thousand sailors, and four or five 
hundred negroes, may be calculated upon. Their col- 
lective strength will amount, in all probability, to be- 
tween six and seven thousand men of different cha- 
racters ; and the militia Tories, from their being such 
exceeding good marksmen, will not be the least use- 
ful. 

Our force in Continental troops will amount to lit- 
tle more than fifteen hundred men; from four to five 
hundred State troops, belonging to South Carolina; 
and, I imagine, from fifteen hundred to two thousand 
militia may be raised in North and South Carolina, 
to join in the reduction of Charleston. A greater 
force than this cannot be calculated upon, nor am I 
altogether certain so large a body of militia can be 
kept up during the siege ; but it is possible a much 
greater can be got out upon so important an occasion, 
and when things wear so flattering a face. To reduce 
Charleston with certainty and despatch, not less than 
ten thousand troops should be added to the force that 
may be expected here; but if this force cannot be 
had, I should think it should be attempted with less. 
The garrison will doubtless have provisions in plenty ; 



372 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

and I Ibelieve, if we can command the "svater, our army 
may be easily supplied, provided the operations are 
brought to an issue before the 1st of January, or by 
that time. I have inclosed some notes respecting the 
places the most proper for landing ; but General Lin- 
coln and General Duportail can give you more par- 
ticular information respecting this matter. If the 
operations cannot be carried on in Virginia and here 
at the same time, I think Charleston must have the 
preference, as the greatest object. 

New York and Charleston being taken, the enemy 
will most assuredly leave Virginia, should time fail 
us to effect the reduction of the whole, which I hope 
will not be the case. All the stores of every kind 
necessary for the siege must come with the fleet, as 
we have nothing here to prosecute one with. The 
reduction of Charleston will naturally produce the 
surrender of Savannah and Wilmington, especially as 
there is but little force at either ; not more than four 
hundred at one, and three hundred at the other. I 
think Charleston may be reduced in thirty days, after 
the troops effect a landing; and there can be no diffi- 
culty in this, as the enemy have no force at any of 
those places, nor will they venture to detach from 
town for the purpose. And it is not impossible, if the 
enemy should attempt to hold the upper country, a 
landing may be effected so speedily as to prevent 
their getting into town. This would greatly facilitate 
the reduction of the place, as well from the effect it 
would have upon the spirits of the garrison, as from 
the diminution of their force. 

I suppose the British fleet on this coast, on the 
arrival of the French fleet, will immediately take 
shelter in New York, and assist in the defence of the 
place, or run off to the West Indies. The flrst would 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 373 

be the most desirable, and is wliat I hope our good 
ally will oblige them to do. This would secure a 
superiority by sea during the whole campaign, which 
may be doubtful, should Admiral Rodney follow the 
French fleet from the West Indies, and effect a junc- 
tion with the force on this coast. But, if the French 
effect a junction of theirs first, and block up the Bri- 
tish in Xew York, so as to prevent a junction of 
their shipping, the enemy will not have it in their 
power either to raise the siege of the place or take 
off the garrison. But should the British fleet on this 
coast even run for the West Indies, there is the 
greatest probability of the two fleets missing each 
other on their passage, and still leave our allies mas- 
ters of the sea, at least until New York can be re- 
duced. But what I most wish is, that the force our 
ally means to employ upon this coast may be supe- 
rior to the enemy's collective strength, both from the 
West Indies and on this coast. This will insure us 
success at all events. 

As your Excellency is doubtless more fully inform- 
ed respecting the force of both fleets, and of the 
intentions of our ally, than I am, and also of the 
probable aid which we may expect either from Europe 
or elsewhere, and as that will altogether govern our 
operations, I shall wait your directions respecting our 
preparations in this quarter. The enemy have no 
fortified posts in this State except Charleston, or in 
Georgia except Savannah. But their army is upon 
the Congaree, near McCord's Ferry. The distresses 
of the country are so great, and their calamities in- 
crease so fast^ for want of salt and many other arti- 
cles, as well as from the ravages of the enemy, that 
I wish it may be in our powder, by the generous ex- 
ertions of our good ally, to effect something for their 
VOL. HI. 32 



374 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

relief, more than the little temporary respites arising 
from partial advantages, which are all we can hope 
or expect from our little force in this country. If 
Lord Cornwallis should find that his situation in Vir- 
ginia may expose him to the loss of his army, it is 
highly probable he will attempt to get back to 
Charleston by land or water. The first I shall en- 
deavour to guard against, and the last I hope our 
ally will be able to prevent, by sending a few fri- 
gates into the Bay, or stationing them off the Capes. 
The cavalry of Lieutenant-Colonel Washington's 
corps have taken, killed, and wounded, near forty of 
the enemy's cavalry since my last. The most consider- 
able attack was made by Captain Watts. He charged 
a party of twenty odd of the enemy, with an inferior 
force, took six, killed three, and wounded eight or 
nine more. The enterprise of our cavalry equals any 
thing the world ever produced. With the most per- 
fect respect and esteem, I am, 

Your Excellency's most humble servant, 

Nathaniel Geeene. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL JAMES CLINTON. 

Albany, 9 August, 1781. 

I have the honor to inform your Excellency, that 
this morning General Stark arrived here to take the 
command of this department, and I have communicat- 
ed to him such of your Excellency's instructions as 
may tend to the good of the service, and security of 
the frontier. He reports that the militia from the 
eastward are in a state of preparation, and he expects 
a detachment of them in town by the last of this 
week. The levies from this State are coming in fast. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 375 

More than one hundred have already arrived, so that 
it is probable that, by the time I am favored with 
your further orders, matters will be in such train that 
I can move down without any impediment. 

On Tuesday night, about ten o'clock, a most daring 
attempt was made by a party of the enemy, headed 
by a Captain Myers, to surprise General Schuyler in 
his house, at this place. With difficulty the General 
escaped into one of the upper chambers, and, by fir- 
ing a few shot out of the window, alarmed the city. 
They were prevented from following him by the ser- 
vants, who made every opposition in their power, 
against a decided superiority. Two of them (the 
servants) were taken off, with soldiers in 
and one wounded with a bayonet, also a quantity 
of plate, &c. Notwithstanding every exertion of the 
inhabitants, and of the troops in town, to intercept 
them, they made their escape, though I hope some 
of them may yet be taken, as the country through 
which they must pass is alarmed. 

By a prisoner, we learn that a detachment, consist- 
ing of near thirty, left Canada the 16th ultimo, and 
divided into six small parties on the frontier, with a 
design to take off some respectable characters. One 
party was taken by a Bennington scout, with a cer- 
tain Captain John Bleecker, and his negro, whom 
they were bringing off. 

Since the above was written, I have been favored 
with yours of the 5th instant, and shall wait here your 
Excellency's further orders. I have the honor to be, 
Sir, 

Your Excellency's most humble servant, 

James Clinton. 



376 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM CHRISTOPHER GADSDEN. 

Philadelpliia, 10 August, 1781 

Dear Sir, 

The bearer, Mr. Joliii Love clay, informs me that he 
hath had the honor to he recommended to an office 
in your Excellency's family, by some of your friends 
here. I cannot, in justice, deny him my testimony 
of his character. He has been Messenger of the 
Privy Council of our State four or five years, during 
which time he alwaj^s behaved with the greatest dili- 
gence, attention, and secrecy, and he is, your Excel- 
lency may be assured, a strictly honest man. He 
was taken by the enemy a few days before Charles- 
ton capitulated, trusted with some important messages 
from Mr. Rutledge; was immediately closely confined, 
and, when we were shipped off to Augustine, sent 
with us. He is a sober, prudent, discreet man, very 
firm and steady to the cause. 

Sixty-one of us, with our servants, arrived, in two 
small vessels, from Augustine, part about ten or 
twelve, and the remainder about five or six days 
since, thanks to Heaven, all in good health and spi- 
rits. We were in Augustine from the 15tli of Sep- 
tember to the 17th of last month, forty-two weeks of 
which I was confined in the Castle, and none of my 
friends permitted to see me, because I would not 
give another parole. I told them I had kept the 
first, as a gentleman ; defied, and do still defy them 
to prove the contrary; and was determined never to 
take a second, which would imply a breach of the 
first. Their treatment of me, when taken up the 
27th of August last, was much more severe and 
pointed than against any of my friends, which ap- 
pears to me more owing to tlie station I was in. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 377 

than as Mr. Gadsden (though I believe no favorite 
as such); and my not being mentioned in the capitu- 
lation gave them an opportunity to affect treating 
me with rigor and contempt. I thought it a duty 
I owed to the general cause to refuse, to the last, 
giving a second parole, that I might be as a standing- 
protest againt such outrageous, tyrannical conduct. 

When in the Castle, the officers were ordered, fre- 
quently, not to converse with me. However, many 
of them often did, and all of them behaved with de- 
cency. I never had the least insult offered me there. 
Once, indeed, there was an order against lighting a 
candle, in consequence of which I was without for 
two or three nights ; but the pitifulness of this they 
were soon ashamed of themselves. 

Mr. Ferguson and myself are waiting for our fami- 
lies, expected in a few days. As soon as we see 
them a little fixed, we shall set off for our State, 
as will most of the Carolina gentlemen here. We 
hope to be gone by the middle of next month, at 
farthest. I beg your Excellency's and the public's 
pardon, for taking up so much of your precious time ; 
and am, with the greatest esteem. 

Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 

Christopher Gadsden.* 



* Mr. Gadsden was a Delegate in the First Congress from South 
Carolina. On the IGth of September, 1776, he was appointed a Bri- 
gadier-General in the Continental service, having previously command-

of the attack on Sullivan's Island. Some time afterwards, he resigned 
his commission in the army.

For the three months which followed he was undisturbed ; but on

378 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 
(Private.) 

Philadelphia, 12 August, 1781. 

Sir, 
By a vessel from Cadiz last night, we are inform- 
ed that our Minister at the Spanish Court, as late 
as the 11th June, had made hut little progress in a 
negotiation "with them. They still appear friendly, 
but aim at cessions we cannot make. They give en- 
couragement respecting money at some times j again 
they are disappointed, and cannot promise any thing- 
certain. They have, however, given Mr. Jay liberty 
to accept bills to the amount of one hundred and 
fifty thousand dollars, but have no known funds ap- 
propriated for the payment. In short, their conduct 
appears rather insincere and mysterious. Our public 
despatches are intercepted, or obstructed, insomuch 
that a free correspondence is almost impracticable. 
Mr. Gardoqui was to set off from Madrid for Phila- 

accordingly taken in his own house by a file of soldiers, and put on 
board a vessel in the harbour. He knew not why he was taken up, 
nor what was intended to be done with him ; but supposed it was 
introductory to a trial for treason or rebellion, as the British gave 
out that the country was completely conquered. He was soon joined 
by twenty-eight compatriots, who were also taken up on the same day. 
He drew from his pocket half a dollar, and turning to his associates, 
with a cheerful countenance, assured them that was all the money 
he had at his command. The conquerors sent him and his compa- 
nions to St. Augustine, then a British garrison. On their landing, 
limits of some extent were offered to them on condition of their re- 
newing the parole they had given in Charleston, 'to do nothing in- 
jurious to the British interest.' When this was tendered to General 
Gadsden, he replied, ' that he had already given one, and honorably 
observed it; that, in violation of his rights as a prisoner under ca- 
pitulation, he had been sent from Charleston, and that, therefore, he 
saw no use in giving a second parole.' The Commanding Officer 
replied, ' he would enter into no arguments ; but demanded an ex- 
plicit answer, whether he would or would not renew his parole.' Ge-

clelxDhia some time in June ; but his intentions of com- 
ine: here have been so often announced, and the de- 
lay not accounted for, that Mr. Jay will say nothing 
about him hereafter, until he has actually sailed. 

France acts a truly friendly part. We shall cer- 
tainly obtain from her this year twenty millions of 
livres, four of which will be retained for Dr. Franklin 
to discharge the interest on Loan-Office certificates ; 
two supplied in military stores, &c., and the residue 
be subject to the directions of Congress. I have the 
strongest reason to believe, that Colonel Laurens is 
now on the ocean, and has with him two millions 
and a half of this money in specie. I pray most 
sincerely for his safe arrival. 

It is as yet more than probable that there will be 
a negotiation for a general peace some time this fall ; 
the Congress to assemble at Vienna. France has 
proposed that the United States of America shall 
have a Minister or Ministers Plenipotentiary at the 
Congress. The Emperor is afraid this proposition may 

neral Gadsden answered, with that high-minded republican spirit, which 
misfortunes could not keep down, — ' I will not ; in God I put my 
trust, and fear no consequences.' He was instantly hurried off to the 
Castle, and there confined for ten months in a small room, and in a 
state of complete separation from his fellow-prisoners, and in total 
ignorance of the advantages gained by his countrymen ; but with most 
ample details of their defeats, and particularly of the sequestration 
of his estate, with that of the other Carolina rebels." 

"In the course of 1781, the "victories of General Greene procured 
an equivalent for the release of all the prisoners belonging to Soufh 
Carolina. Mr. Gadsden was discharged from close confinement, and 
rejoined his fellow-prisoners. The reciprocal congratulations on the 
change of circumstances, and on seeing each other, after a ten months' 
separation, though in the same garrison, may be more easily conceived 
than expressed. They were all conveyed by water from St. Au- 
gustine to Philadelphia, and there delivered. On their arrival they 
were informed, for the first time, of the happy turn American affairs 
had taken subsequent to Gates's defeat. General Gadsden hastened 
back to Carolina to aid in recovering it from the British." Ramsay's

obstruct a measure he has much at heart. It has 
been suggested that, if the United States are heard 
by memorial, it would probably answer; but to this 
France does not seem to consent. The Emperor was 
expected in June or July at Paris, on a visit; the 
probable consequence of which is yet in duhio. 

Sweden and Denmark have refused to assist the 
Dutch with ships of war. Russia is undecided. Count 
Panin, the Prime Minister of Russia, is removed. 
Mr. Necker's resignation has been accepted by his 
most Christian Majesty. This great character was not 
agreeable to the Court of Spain, nor to the officers 
at Versailles. He is said to have conducted with too 
much Jiaideiir. 

Out of Admiral Rodney's thirty-four ships, laden 
with the plunder of St. Eustatia, M. Piquet has cer- 
tainly captured twenty-four ; and it is said that five 
more have been picked up by privateers. The escort, 
consisting of a seventy-four, one sixty-four, and two 
frigates, with five of the convoy, escaped by their 
swiftness in sailing. An expedition was in great for- 
wardness at Cadiz, to consist of eight sail of the line, 
besides frigates, &c., and eight or ten thousand land 
forces, the destination unknown. They were to sail 
in July, and conjectured to be for the West Indies 
or this Continent. 

By a letter from the Marquis de Lafayette, of the 
6th, from Pamunky, we have intelligence that Lord 
Cornwallis, with the fleet formerly mentioned, and an 
addition of whaleboats, carrying the greatest part of 
the British army, have arrived in York River, and 
landed at Gloucester and Yorktown, which they now 
occup}^ Your Excellency is probably acquainted with 
their situation. However, the Marquis describes the

FROM ROBERT MORRIS AND RICHARD PETERS. 

Camp, 13 August, 1781. 

Sir, 

The orders of Congress, which we have the honor 
to communicate, directing us to confer with your 
Excellency on the subject of the proposed numbers 
and arrangements of the army for the next campaign, 
not having pointed out the reasons inducing the mea- 
sure, we have the honor to lay before you our ideas 
on the subject, so far as we are acquainted with the 
matter from a conference, at which we were present 
in Philadelphia, had by a Committee of Congress, the 
subscriber, as Superintendent of Finance, and the Board 
of War, pursuant to a resolution of Congress, wdth a 
copy of which your Excellency has been furnished. 

After the full conversation with which we were 
honored the 12th ultimo, it is unnecessary to enter at 
large into those reasons, in order to urge the press- 
ing necessity of economizing our affairs, so as to 
make our revenues, in a great degree, meet our ex- 
penses. Your Excellency must be equally sensible 
with us of this necessity; and we are perfectly con- 
vinced you are equally disposed to assist in every 



382 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

measure tending to promote so desirable an object. 
You are also impressed with the impolicy of calling 
on the States for men and money in numbers and 
quantities so extensive as to alarm the timid, and to 
excite among men, the zealous and considerate, ideas 
of the impracticability of carrying on the war upon 
such terms. Demands of this nature, instead of ani- 
mating to exertions, are only productive of hopeless 
languor. Your mortifying experience of the inade- 
quate compliances heretofore with former demands, will 
explain the motives inducing to the expediency of 
moderating those demands, so as to render them pro- 
ductive, and, in case of failure, to leave the delin- 
quent State without excuse. 

Your Excellency has doubtless considered, that 
the class of men who are willing to become soldiers 
is much diminished by the war, and therefore the 
difficulties of raising an army, equal to former esta- 
blishments, have increased, and will continue to in- 
crease, and embarrass the States in their measures for 
filling up their quotas, should the mode of recruiting 
the army be continued in the line. You will also 
have considered that the enemy, proportionably debili- 
tated by the war, are incapable of opposing to us the 
force we originally had to encounter ; and therefore 
the necessity of such extensive levies as we formerly 
raised, seems to be in some measure superseded. In 
what degree the forces of these States should be de- 
creased, we do not pretend to determine, leaving this 
to your Excellency's better judgment. But from past 
experience, it should seem that the States are incapa- 
ble of bringing into the field an army equal to that 
called for by the last arrangement. Or, if all the de- 
mands of Congress on the States become merely pe- 
cuniary, it does not seem probable that they can, or 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 383 

will, furnish money for raising, equipping and support- 
ing, such an army. 

We should he happ}^, were we capable from any 
information we are possessed of, to assist your Excel- 
lency in the investigation of the subject, with respect 
to the probable designs or force of the enemy the 
next campaign. This must, in its nature, depend upon 
contingencies, at present even beyond conjecture. At 
this time, therefore, in our apprehension, the only 
solid ground of procedure is to consider what forces 
these States, under present circumstances, are capable 
of producing. 

Having thus in general mentioned the ideas which 
have arisen on the subject, we beg to leave the mat- 
ter to your Excellency's consideration, and take the 
liberty of proposing the following queries, after fur- 
ther mentioning that it has been conceived it would 
be expedient, in case of reform, to lessen the numbers 
of regiments, so as to make fewer commissioned offi- 
cers necessary, and to increase the numbers of non- 
commissioned officers and privates in those regiments. 
It has been supposed that a considerable saving would 
ensue from this measure, by not having so many offi- 
cers in full pay, wdth their horses, servants, baggage, 
and other consequential expenses in the field, or if 
they remain in quarters from want of command. We 
presume that gentlemen qualified for Staff-Oncers 
might be found among the retiring officers, and that 
artificers and other persons employed by the Staff 
department should not enter into the present calcula- 
tion, as the officers at the heads of those departments 
should be enabled to carry on their business w^ith- 
out taking men from the line; a practice introduced 
from necessity, very prejudicial to discipline, and pro- 
ductive of pernicious consequences by diminishing the 
effective force of the army. 



384 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

1st. Is a reduction of the number of officers and 
men, as fixed by the last arrangement of the army, 
expedient or proper? 

2d. How can this reduction be brought about, con- 
sistently with the good of the service ; and what ar- 
rangement should be made in consequence of this 
reduction ? 

The answers to the above queries will no doubt 
include the numbers of men necessary for the next 
campaign, and the organization of them, so as to de- 
signate the number of regiments and the numbers in 
those regiments, both of commissioned and non-com- 
missioned officers and privates, as well regimentally 
as by companies. The expediency of having fewer 
regiments of horse and artillery, and of consolidating 
the independent corps, will also, we presume, come 
under your Excellency's consideration. 

3d. What periods of enlistment, under present cir- 
cumstances, are most proper to be adopted? 

4th. What regulations can be made to modify the 
practice of taking soldiers from the line, as servants 
to officers ? 

On this head we beg leave to submit to your 
opinion a copy of a motion made in Congress on 
this subject. * 

5th. What is to be done with officers by brevet, or 
those who have no particular command ? Can they 
not be placed in the regiments, or retire on half-pay?

FROM PRESIDENT WEARE. 

Hamptx)ii Falls, 13 August, 1781. 

Sir, 
I am honored with the receipt of your Excellency's 
favor of the 2d instant, informing me of the defi- 
ciency of the levies for the Continental army, and 
that none of the militia had come in from this State; 
and the critical situation you are now in, which most 
sensibly affects me. I have the fullest conviction of 
the necessity of the army being filled up to their 
full complement at this critical period, and the pro- 
bable fatal consequences of a failure herein, or in 
their being properly supplied. And your Excellency 
may be assured, that no exertions have been want- 
ing on the part of the Executive of the State for 
procuring their full quota of men and supplies. Im- 
mediately on the act passing, orders were issued for 
raising the men to complete our quota of the Conti- 
nental army, and for raising four hundred of the mi- 
litia, to be held in readiness to march within one 
week after being called for, agreeably to your Excel- 
lency's recommendation in your letter from Wethers- 
field of the 24th of May. 

VOL. III. 33 



386 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

At that time Continental bills of the new emission 
had a full currency among us, and were the only 
medium we had. No provision was made for raising 
any specie, nor was there any circulating among us. 
Soon after that, from some unaccountable fatality, for 
what reason I cannot comprehend, the Continental 
bills were refused by the people in Massachusetts to 
be taken in payment for any thing, which was soon 
followed by the other neighbouring States, and they 
are now wholly rejected, and the smallest article of 
any kind cannot be purchased with them, so that we 
are wholly destitute of any medium. Hard money we 
have not, nor can we obtain any on any terms. Had 
it not been for this unaccountable and altogether un- 
expected destruction of our currency, the only one 
we had, I doubt not we should have been able to 
carry the acts fully into effect, excepting in that part 
of the State which, as I mentioned in my letter of 
the 23d of July, under pretence of joining with what 
they call Vermont, have refused to raise men or fur- 
nish supplies of any kind. So that there will be a 
deficiency on that account of more than a quarter 
part, both of men and supplies, until Congress, be- 
fore whom the matter lies, shall determine upon it 

I am not able to give a perfect account of the 
number of recruits that have been raised for fillino; 
up the army. The returns that have been made 
amount to three hundred and twenty, but I have 
had no returns for more than a month past. As to 
the militia, we had not received the least information 
at what time they were to march and join the army, 
until your letter of the 2d instant, by which it ap- 
pears you had given directions for their joining the 
army by the 15th of last month, which never came 
to hand. And now, by reason of the fatal rejection 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 387 

of the Continental currency, Ave find it out of our 
power to raise money sufficient to carry them to the 
army. So that the Executive find themselves brought 
to a full stop, unable to proceed any further; and 
thereupon have sent out orders for convening the 
General Assembly as speedily as possible, who are 
to meet on the 22d instant, to consult what measures 
are to be pursued in our present situation. 

It is with anxious concern that I am oblio-ed to 
give your Excellency this information of our present 
situation. I will still hope that some method may 
be found out to extricate us from our present embar- 
rassments, with respect to a medium. As our militia 
cannot march until the General Assembly meet, I 
wiU ask the favor of a line from you, as soon as 
may be, whether it will be of advantage to forward 
them at that late period. I have the honor to be, 
with every sentiment of respect. 

Your obedient and humble servant, 

]\Ieshecii WiLmE. 



FROM EDWARD RUTLEDGE. 

Philadelphia, 14 August, 1781. 

I feel a real satisfaction, my dear General, in hav- 
ing it once more in my power to address you with- 
out the restraints that are imposed by captivity, and 
assure you that neither absence nor misfortunes have, 
in the smallest degree, abated the attachment and 
friendship I have so long borne you. I will not 
Avound your humanity by a relation of the many 
hardships and unmanly insults we have sustained 
from British officers, and new-made subjects, during 
our confinement ; nor shall I lament that we have 



388 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

suffered, if our sufferings, and the firmness which I 
trust we have shown in the midst of apparent evils, 
can be converted into real blessings, by animating my 
countrymen to a sense of their duty, and convincing 
them that their only resource for happiness is in a 
freedom from British government. 

The Congress seem disposed to avail themselves of 
our late situation, and have desired that we will fur- 
nish them with an authentic account of the conduct 
of the enemy, from the surrender of Charleston to 
the time of our exchange, with a view, as we are 
told, of retaliating. But, to particularize one half of 
their cruelty and injustice, is beyond the reach of 
human labor. However, their most flagrant and atro- 
cious acts of violence and oppression will be pointed 
out J and if the Congress should retain their present 
sentiments, they will soon possess materials, not only 
to justify, but to require and exact (if I may use a 
British officer's expression) "retaliation with a ven- 
geance." Yet I imagine they have too much of the 
milk of human kindness in their composition to bear 
them through this painful, though necessary business. 
Indeed, warmed as I am by my own sufferings, and 
by what is of infinitely greater consequence, I mean 
the sufferings of my friends, I am persuaded I my- 
self shall not be able to do moderate justice to the 
injured. 

I find, by letters which were yesterday received 
from General Greene, that he is extremely anxious 
to have a civil government established in South Ca- 
rolina. It is certainly a desirable object, but I hope 
it will not be attempted until General Wayne shall 
arrive with his troops in that State. To proceed to 
an election, without enabling such of the militia as 
are in the field to attend, would give vast advantage 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 389 

to the clisafFected and timid; and to withdraw the 
friends of the State from the field would be to ex- 
pose the Continentals, whom I consider as the stami- 
na of the army, to essential injury. Indeed, our 
country is, and has so long been, in a disjointed con- 
dition, that I really believe we shall have the whole 
business of civil government to go over. However, 
we must take " perseverance " for our motto, our 
crest, and arms, and we shall soon see, I hope, an 
end of our labors. I myself shall not be able to go 
to the southward until the latter end of September, 
at soonest. A constitution, naturally feeble, has of 
late years received very many shocks. I would there- 
fore wish to remain in this part of the world until 
I could have a share of new health infused into it, 
as well on account of my country as of my friends 
and family. Yet, before I take a journey to my own 
State, I shall embrace the favorable opportunity which 
I possess, of paying my respects at head-quarters, 
and of assuring you, in person, how truly I am, my 
dear General, 

Your most affectionate friend and humble servant, 

Edward Rutledge. 



FROIM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Forks of York River, 21 August, 1781. 

My DEAR General, 

Your letter of the 15th has safely come to hand. 
I am going to give you an account of matters in 
this quarter. The greater part of the enemy are at 
York, which they do not as yet fortify ; but are very 
busy upon Gloucester Neck, where they have a pretty 
large corps under Colonel Dundas. They have at 

33* 



390 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

York a forty-four gun ship; frigates and vessels are 
scattered lower down. There is still a small garrison 
at Portsmouth. Should they intend to evacuate, at 
least, they are proceeding with alarming slowness. 

From the enemy's preparations I should infer that 
they are working for the protection of a fleet, and 
for a defence against another ; that in case they 
hold Portsmouth, the main body would he at York, 
and a detached corps upon Gloucester Neck, to pro- 
tect the water hattery. Their fortifications are much 
contracted. From the enemy's cautious and partial 
movements, I should conclude their intelligence is not 
very good, and they wish to come at an explanation 
of my intentions and prospects. We have hitherto 
occupied the Forks of York River, thereby looking 
both ways. Some militia have prevented the enemy's 
parties from remaining any time at or near Williams- 
burg, and false accounts have given them some alarms. 
Another body of militia, under Colonel Innes, has kept 
them pretty close in Gloucester town, and foraged in 
their vicinity. 

Upon the receipt of your orders, I wrote to the 
Governor that the intelligence of some plans of the 
enemy rendered it proper to have six hundred mili- 
tia collected upon Blackwater. I wrote to General 
Gregory, near Portsmouth, that I had an account the 
enemy intended to push a detachment to Carolina, 
which would greatly defeat a scheme w^e had there. 
I have requested General Wayne to move towards the 
southward, and be ready to cross James River at West- 
over. A battalion of light infantry, and our only one 
hundred dragoons, being in Gloucester county, I call 
them my van-guard, and shall take my quarters there 
for one or two days, while the troops are filing off 
towards James River. Our little army will conse- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 391 

qiiently again assemble upon the waters of the Chick- 
ahominy ; and should Jamestown Island be thought a 
good place for a junction, we shall be in a situation 
to form it, while we render it more difficult for the 
enemy to attempt a journey to Carolina. 

I shall to-day write to the gentleman. Nothing as 
yet has appeared. I will take measures that he may 
hear from me the moment he arrives ; taking what- 
ever is in the rivers, and taking possession of the 
rivers themselves, while the main body defends the 
Bay; forming a junction of land forces at a conven- 
ient and safe point ; checking the enemy, but giving 
nothing to chance, until properly reenforced. This is 
the plan I mean to propose. Some days ago I sent 
Washington to contrive the Maryland new levies out 
of their State. These Marylanders will be five hun- 
dred ; Virginians, four hundred ; Pennsylvanians, six 
hundred ; light infantry, eight hundred and fifty ; 
dragoons, one hundred and twenty. Such is the Con- 
tinental force ; and in the course of eight days the 
already called for militia will make three thousand. 
Every thing I put at the lowest estimate ; but we 
may depend upon two thousand five hundred Conti- 
nentals, rank and file, exclusive of artillery, and three, 
or, if more are wanted, four thousand miUtia. Mary- 
land would send six hundred militia at least. I have 
two hundred more dragoons and horses ready, and am 
waiting for accoutrements. 

There is such a confusion in affairs in this part of 
the world, that immense difficulties are found for a 
perfect formation of magazines. I have, however, 
strongly urged the matter. The moment I received 
your first letter, I sent Mr. McHenry to Richmond, 
who had long conversations about it with the Go- 
vernor and Council. I have recommended such plans 
as might answer your purposes. This State has a 



392 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

large quantity of beef, corn, some flour, very little 
rum. Maryland ouglit to be early called upon. Wa- 
ter transportation will, I hope, ease our difficulties. 
Had we any thing like money, matters would go on 
very well. The dry season has rendered most of the 
mills useless. We have no clothing of any sort ; no 
heavy artillery in order. Some arms will be wanting, 
some horse accoutrements, and a great deal of ammu- 
nition. Nothing but your own entreaties may have a 
sufficient quantity of those articles transported to 
the head of the Bay. In the present state of affairs, 
my dear General, I hope you will come yourself to 
Virginia, and that, if the French army moves this 
way, I shall have, at least, the satisfaction of behold- 
ing you myself at the head of the combined armies ; 
in which case I beg leave to recommend you may 
be accompanied by the heads of departments, which 
will save you an immense deal of trouble. The men 
we have here would not be equal to the task of a 
campaign upon so large a scale. 

In two days I will write again to your Excellency, 
and keep you particularly and certainly informed, un- 
less something is done the very moment, and it will 
probably be difficult. Lord Cornwallis must be at- 
tacked with a pretty great apparatus. But when a 
French fleet takes possession of the Bay and rivers, 
and we form a land force superior to his, that army 
must, soon or late, be forced to surrender, as we may 
get what reenforcements we please. Adieu, my dear 
General. I heartily thank you for having ordered me 
to remain in Virginia; and to your goodness to me 
I am owing the most beautiful prospect I may ever 
behold. With the most affectionate respect, I have 
the honor to be, my dear General, 

Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 

Lafayette. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 393 

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Head-Quarters, Camden, 26 August, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 

Since I -sYrote your Excellency, by Colonel Morris, 
nothing very material has taken place, except the 
hanging of Colonel Hayne, one of our militia Colo- 
nels, whom the enemy hung in Charleston, a little 
time since, as a traitor, as they call him. He was a 
man of a most amiable character, highly respected, 
and of a most extensive influence. This insult, offered 
to the good people of this country, and to the busi- 
ness of exchange, it being a most flagrant violation 
of the cartel, I am determined to retaliate ; and, as 
the enemy are indifferent about their militia officers, 
I mean to retaliate on the British officers, as the 
surest way of putting a stop to a practice that can 
only serve to gratify private revenge. 

General Marion and Colonel Lee have taken a few 
prisoners since I wrote before, in the whole between 
twenty and thirty, three or four of whom are officers. 
The rivers have been so high, owing to the great 
rains, as has prevented parties passing them with 
sufficient ease to attempt surprises. We are endea- 
vouring to draw a body of militia together at Fri- 
day's Ferry, and are on our march to that place to 
combine our forces, and make an attack on the ene- 
my at McCord's Ferry, if our force will authorize the 
attempt when we are collected. 

I am much at a loss, what are Lord Cornwallis's 
intentions in Virginia. I have directed the Marquis 
to govern his motions by the enemy's, and to detach 
here, if they detach largely from there, and not with- 
out. I am totally ignorant of what is going on at 



394 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

New York, having heard nothing from your Excel- 
lency since June, which induces me to believe your 
despatches are intercepted. I pray God the expedi- 
tion against New York may succeed, and prove the 
corner-stone of American independence, as it undoubt- 
edly would. I w\ait w^ith impatience for intelligence, 
by which I mean to govern my own operations. If 
things are flattering in the north, I will hazard less 
in the south ; but, if otherwise there, we must risk 
more here. With every wish for your Excellency's 
snfety, glory, and success, I am, with great esteem 
and regard. 

Your most obedient, humble servant, 

NatiianiVel Greenk 



FROM ROBERT MORRIS. 
Office of Finance, Philadelphia, 28 August, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 

Your favor of the 27th, from Chatham, lias just 
been delivered to me by Colonel Miles, and, in con- 
sequence, I have advised him to secure the assistance 
of the President and Council of this State, in case it 
should be necessary. But, as a preferable mode of 
procuring the craft, I advise his engaging to pay 
them in a short time after the service is performed; 
and, if needful, I shall join in this assurance, and 
finally see it performed. 

I directed the Commissary-General, immediately on 
my return from camp, to cause the deposit of three 
hundred barrels of flour, three hundred barrels of salt 
meat, and twelve hogsheads of rum, to be made at 
the Head of Elk, and pointed out the means of ob- 
taining them. For this purpose, he sent down a 



THE AMERICAN EEVOLUTION. 395 

Deputy some clays since, and I expect all will be 
ready there. I have written to the Quarter-master of 
Delaware and Maryland, Mr. Donaldson Gates, to ex- 
ert himself in procuring the craft. I am much more 
apprehensive on the score of craft in Delaware and 
Chesapeake. I have written to the Governor, and 
several of the most eminent merchants in Baltimore, to 
extend their assistance and influence in expediting this 
business. Foreseeing the necessity of supplies from 
Maryland and Delaware, I have written, in the most 
pressing terms, to the Governors and Agents, to have 
the specific supplies required of them by Congress in 
readiness for delivery to my order; and now that 
your movements must be unfolded to them, I shall 
still more strongly show the necessity, and stimulate 
their exertions by holding forth what is due to their 
own immediate interest and safety. But still I fear 
you will be disappointed in some degree as to the 
shipping, and that I shall be compelled to make pur- 
chases of provisions, which, if it happens, must divert 
the money from those payments to the army that I 
wish to make. I have already advised your Excel- 
lency of the unhappy situation of money matters, and 
very much doubt if it will be possible to pay the de- 
tachment a month's pay, as you wish. Therefore it 
will be best not to raise in them any expectation of 
that kind. Should it come unexpectedly, so much the 
better. I do not think it practicable to provide the 
salt provisions here, even if a disappointment happens 
in New England; but have particularly recommended 
attention to the article in Maryland, which is to fur- 
nish ten thousand five hundred barrels of beef and 
pork. 

No news here yet of the Count de Grasse ; but I 
have had occasion to lament that too many people 



396 LETTERS TO AVASHINGTON. 

have, for some clays past, seemed to know your Excel- 
lency's intended movements. This city is filled with 
strangers, so that Colonel JNIiles cannot procure private 
lodgings, and my family being chiefly at Springets- 
bury, affords me the opj)ortunity of appropriating my 
house in town to vour use. I believe we can accom- 
modate your Aids, &c., with mattresses, but our beds 
are chiefly in the country; and as what I have can- 
not possibly be appropriated to a better use, I beg 
your Excellency will consider and use my house, and 
what it affords, as your own. 

I have the honor to be, your devoted servant, 

Robert Morris. 



FROM COLONEL MILES. 

Philadelphia, 29 August, 1781. 

Sir, 
I had the honor of receiving your Excellency's 
favor of the 2Tth; and you may be assured that no- 
thing shall be left undone, that is within my power 
to accomplish, in the business you have committed to 
me. But I am sorry to acquaint your Excellency 
that all the river-craft and topsail vessels in this 
harbour that can possibly be got ready for sailing 
within the time limited, or for many days after, I 
much fear will fall short of your expectations. How- 
ever, I hope to have between twenty and thirty sail 
of river-craft, which will cany, on an average, one 
hundred men, or perhaps some more, at Trenton, by 
the 31st; and others shall follow as fast as possible. 
I have the honor to be 

Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

Samuel Miles. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 397 

FROM COLONEL BRODHEAD. 

Fort Pitt, 29 August, 1781. 

Dear General, 

Since my last, one man was killed by the Indians 
near the mouth of Cross Creek. I suppose this hath 
been done by some of the enemy's spies. The coun- 
try has taken the alarm, and several hundred men 
are now in arms upon the frontier. I hope to be 
able to repel the enemy. The Maryland corps was 
stationed at a post on the frontier of Westmoreland 
county, and have in a body deserted and crossed the 
mountains. Indeed, I am apprehensive the other 
corps will soon follow their example, if their suffer- 
ings are not speedily attended to. 

I have sent spies up the Alleghany, with orders to 
proceed to Presque Isle, and further, if it is prac- 
ticable, to discover the enemy, should they actually 
be on that route, and, if possible, to bring me a 
prisoner. Things here are in the utmost confusion ; 
some officers confessing me to be the Commanding 
Officer, and others. Colonel Gibson ; nor is it likely 
they will alter until your Excellency's pleasure is 
expressed, I have the honor to be, with the most 
sincere attachment and respect. 

Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

D.iNiEL Brodhead. 



FROM GOVERNOR LEE, OF MARYLAND. 

In Council, Annapolis, 30 August, 1781. 

Sir, 

We are honored by your Excellency's letter of the 
VOL. III. 34 



398 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

27tli; and we receive, with the greatest satisfaction, 
the intelligence of the approach of the fleet of our 
generous ally. You may rely. Sir, on every exertion 
that is possible for us to make, to accelerate the 
movements of the army on an expedition, the success 
of which must hasten the establishment of the inde- 
pendence of America, and relieve us from many of 
the calamities of war. 

Orders have been issued for the impressing of 
every vessel belonging to the State, and forwarding 
them without delay to the Head of Elk. But we are 
sorry to inform your Excellency that, since the enemy 
has had possession of the Bay, our number of sea- 
vessels and craft has been so reduced by captures, 
that we are apprehensive what remains will not trans- 
port so considerable a detachment. We have directed 
the State officers to procure immediately, by purchase 
or seizure, five thousand head of cattle and a large 
quantit}^ of flour. There is very little salt provision 
in the State, but what can be obtained we trust will 
be collected. Part of the provision will be deposited 
at the Head of Elk, Baltimore Town, and Georgetown. 
Most of the cattle will be kept in good pastures not 
far distant from the Bay and rivers, so that they 
may with ease be forwarded to any point where they 
may be required. We have directed sufficient quan- 
tities of forage to be laid in at the Head of Elk, 
Baltimore Town, and Georgetown, for the use of the 
army. The third regiment, consisting of about six 
hundred men, and under the command of Colonel 
Adams, marched from this city last Tuesday ; and 
about seven hundred of the new levies, now here, will 
move in a few days. Every aid that can be given 
Mr. Morris will be afforded with the utmost cheerful- 
ness and alacrity. We have the honor to be, with 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 399 

the highest personal respect and esteem, your Excel- 
lency's 

Most obedient and most humble servant, 

Thomas Sim Lee. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LINCOLN. 

Trenton, half past 5, P. M., 31 August, 1781. 

jMy dear General, 

I was honored with your favor of this date at half 
past one, at the Landing. We have put, and are put- 
ting on board the vessels, the ordnance, ordnance- 
stores, &c. I shall send, in the same vessels, the corps 
of artillery, corps of sappers and miners, and also 
General Hazen's regiment. By sending General Ha- 
zen's regiment, I suppose it will be unnecessary to 
send the hundred men you mentioned. I thought it 
was best to send whole corps, and not a detachment, 
as the former mode would fully comply with the 
spirit of your orders. The vessels, I expect, will leave 
this at about seven o'clock, so as to be down earlv 
in the morning. I have ordered them to wait on 
your Excellency for further orders. 

The light troops, the Jersey brigade, and Colonel 
Van Schaick, will leave this in the morning. As 
there are so many empty wagons, I think the troops, 
with their aid, will march with ease and despatch. 
This idea, and the necessity the French will have 
for the vessels, have induced me to send none by 
water, saving the invalids and those before mentioned. 
I shall detain one vessel to receive such of the stores 
as are in our rear with Colonel Cortlandt, and may 
not be exposed to rain. The other stores and the 



400 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

troops can go on in the same boats they have with 
them. Tlieir wagons will be made light, and sent 
round. The moment I have made the necessary ar- 
rangements, I will follow the troops, and wait on 
your Excellency at Philadelphia. I am, dear Gene- 
ral, 
With the greatest respect, yours, most obediently, 

Benjai\iin Lincoln. 



FROM THE MARQUIS DE L.VFAYETTE. 

Camp, Williamsburg, 8 September, 1781. 

My dear General, 

Your letter of the 2d instant is just come to hand. 
Mine of yesterday mentioned that the ships in York 
River had gone down. Inclosed is an account I re- 
ceive of an engagement off the Capes. What dis- 
position has been made for the internal protection 
of the Bay, I do not know. James River is still 
guarded, but we have not as yet received any letter 
from Count de Grasse, relative to his last movements. 
I hasten to communicate them, as your Excellency 
will probably think it safer to keep the troops at 
the Head of Elk until Count de Grasse returns. In- 
deed, unless the greatest part of your force is brought 
here, a small addition can do but little more than we 
effect. Lord Cornwallis will, in a little time, render 
himself very respectable. I ardently wish your whole 
army may soon be brought down to operate. 

AVe will make it our business to reconnoitre the 
enemy's works, and give you, on your arrival, the 
best description of them in our power. I expect the 
Governor this evening, and will again urge the neces- 
sity of providing what you have recommended. By 



THE AMERICAN EEVOLUTION. 401 

a letter from New York, I hear that two British 
frigates followed the French fleet, and returned after 
they had seen them out of the Capes, A spy says 
that two schooners, supposed to be French, have been 
seen landing, up York River. But we have nothing 
so certain as to insure your voyage, though it is pro- 
bable that Count de Grasse will soon return, 

I beg leave to request, my dear General, that in 
your answer to the Marquis de St. Simon, you will 
express your admiration at the celerity of their land- 
ing, and your sense of their cheerfulness in submit- 
ting to the difficulties of the first movements. In- 
deed, I should be happy something might also be 
said to Congress on the subject. Your approbation 
of my conduct emboldens me to request that, as Ge- 
neral Lincoln will of course take command of the 
American part of your army, the division I shall have 
under him may be composed of the troops which 
have gone through the fatigues and dangers of the 
Virginian campaign. This will be the greatest re- 
ward of the services I may have rendered, as I con- 
fess I have the strongest attachment to those troops. 
With the highest respect, I have the honor to be. 
Your most obedient and humble servant, 

Lafayette. 



FROM JAMES DUANE, IN CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 9 September, 1781. 

I need not tell you, my dear General, what I felt 
on the critical arrival of Count de Grasse's squadron. 
Accept my warmest congratulations. The most deci- 
sive advantages may reasonably be expected from 
this generous and formidable cooperation. But I will

not antici2)ate. The Financier has relieved my solici- 
tude for the New York line. A month's pay, how- 
ever inadequate to their claims, will raise their spi- 
rits ; at least, appease their discontent. 

I have this moment despatches from the north- 
ward, particularly from General Schuyler. The In- 
dians have, within a few days, revisited Cobus Kill 
and Schoharie, burned several houses, and captivated 
some of the inhabitants ; and there is reason to be 
apprehensive that they will destroy the grain, which 
is doubtless their principal object, in this incursion. 
General Schuyler mentions that there are not less 
than eighty or ninety thousand bushels of wheat at 
Schoharie alone, which he has in vain essayed to 
bring away. 

Since your Excellency's departure, we have thrown 
the solitary remnant of our Marine into the manage- 
ment of our Financier. It will save a capital expense, 
as the Admiralty, Navy Boards, and their subordinate 
offices, are dissolved. When the number of our ships 
and the circumstances of our Treasury justify it, the 
appointment of the Minister of the Marine will be 
seasonable. The Board of the Treasury, and its de- 
pendents, will, in a few days, undergo a similar re- 
form. I expect those measures will prove a fruitful 
source of invective against those who have intro- 
duced and pressed them ; and I am content to take 
my share. 

I have the pleasure to transmit this letter by 
Lieutenant-Colonel Laurens. In the execution of his 
late mission, he has acquired great honor and given 
entire satisfaction. From having his report under 
consideration, as a member of a Special Committee, 
I had an opportunity of minute inquiry; and I am 
convinced he has done every thing which could be 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 403 

expected, under delicate circumstances, from an able 
Minister. He has further increased his reputation by 
asldng leave, immediately after his report, to take 
the field, and by declining any recompense for his 
essential services ; a disinterestedness which forms a 
striking contrast between him and some other charac- 
ters. Congress have given him a testimonial of their 
approbation, which I do myself the honor to inclose. 
I wish it may be in your Excellency's power to dis- 
tinguish Colonel Laurens by a command. You may 
be assured that it will be highly pleasing to Con- 
gress. With every sentiment of affectionate attach- 
ment and respect, and the most sincere wishes for 
your glory and success, I have the honor to be, dear 
Sir, your Excellency's 

Most humble and most obedient servant, 

James Duane. 



Sir, 



FROM GOVERNOR TRUMBULL. 

Hartford, 15 September, 1781. 



"7 

Your letter of the 21st ultimo arrived on the 5th 
instant, whereupon my Council being convened, amidst 
various accounts of the movements and designs of the 
enemy in New York, and some apprehensions of their 
hostile attack upon or invasion of this State, every 
exertion was made and making for its defence, by 
ordering the militia to be reviewed, and detachments 
to be sent to the sea-coasts, and valuable effects 
there deposited to be removed to interior parts, &c. 

But unfortunately, before those preparations could 
be completed, namely, on the 6th instant, a party 
under the command of the infamous Arnold, made 
wanton destruction both of lives and property in New 



404 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

London and Groton, near the harbour. Though many 
material circumstances, relative to the tragical scene, 
are not yet obtainable with such a degree of preci- 
sion and certainty as might be wished, yet, according 
to the best intelligence I have been able to collect, 
it seems a number exceeding one and perhaps two 
thousand, chiefly of chosen British and foreign troops, 
landed in the morning on both sides of the harbour's 
mouth, whereof one division immediately marched up 
to, and soon took possession of the town and fortifi- 
cations of New London, which were evacuated on their 
approach, as being indefensible ; whilst, on the oppo- 
site shore, the fort on Groton bank, being attacked 
by six or eight hundred men, was nobly defended 
for a considerable time by about one hundred and 
fifty men, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel 
William Ledyard, who bravely repulsed the assailants 
until they suffered about one fourth part in killed 
and wounded. But, being overpowered by superior 
numbers, Colonel Ledyard, perceiving the enemy had 
gained possession of some part of the fort, and open- 
ed the gate, although he had only three of his men 
killed, thought proper to surrender himself with the 
garrison prisoners, and accordingly presented his sword 
to a British officer on the parade, who received the 
same, and immediately thrust it through that brave 
but unfortunate Commander ; whereupon the soldiery 
also pierced his body in many places with bayonets, 
and proceeded to massacre upwards of seventy of the 
officers and garrison, till, by the interposition of ji 
British officer, who entered the fort too late to rescue 
the gallant officers, &c., about forty of the defence- 
less survivors were made prisoners, and carried off, 
exclusive of about the like number, who were wound- 
ed, and many of them dangerously. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 405 

This heroic opposition on the part of the garrison, 
however, together with the increasing appearance of 
the militia, and small skirmishes between some scat- 
tering parties and advanced guards, prevented the en- 
emy from fully executing their savage plan, and occa- 
sioned them to retreat on board in the evening with 
precipitation, after having knocked off the trunnions 
of seven guns, and consumed by fire about seventy- 
one dwelling-houses, sixty-five stores, twenty-two barns, 
a church, court-house, and jail, together with a num- 
ber of vessels, lying unrigged, by the wharves. The 
rest of the shipping in the harbour was saved by 
running up Norwich River, and several valuable 
buildings, on each shore, preserved by quenching the 
flames. 

The loss of property by the conflagration was, how- 
ever, very great, and ruinous to many individuals, as 
also a sensible damage to the public. Yet, what is 
more to be regretted, is the unhappy fate of that 
worthy officer. Colonel Ledj^ard, and those brave men 
(many of w^iom sustained respectable characters, 
and were esteemed the flower of that town), w^ho so 
gallantly fought and unfortunately fell with him, vic- 
tims to British cruelty. I have given directions for 
procuring authenticated information of those transac- 
tions, as soon as the situation of the wounded and 
prisoners (some of whom are paroled) will admit ; 
which will be forwarded as soon as obtained. I have 
the honor to be, Avith every sentiment of esteem and 
consideration, your Excellency's 

Most obedient and very humble servant, 

Jonathan Trumbull. 



406 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Head- Quarters, High Hills of Santee, 
17 September, 1781. 

Sir, 

Your Excellency's letter, of the oOth July, I have 
had the honor to receive, before the receipt of which 
I had sent off two of my Aids to give your Excel- 
lency a very particular account of the Southern de- 
partment. 

By Colonel Morris, I wrote my opinion respecting 
the proper objects to operate against, should we be so 
happy as to be joined by our good ally. I presume 
he is with your Excellency before this, as the Mar- 
quis informs me you were to be at the Head of Elk 
the 8th of this instant, on your way to take command 
in Virginia, and that our good ally was in the Chesa- 
peake with a large fleet and a considerable land force. 
I Avish most devotedly that glory and success may 
attend you. I was in hopes that our force would 
have been equal to a serious attempt upon New York ; 
but, from your present plan of operations, I persuade 
myself that it is not the case. But, perhaps, cutting 
off the possibility of succour to New Y^'ork first, may 
be the most sure way of laying a foundation for its 
reduction. If Cornwallis falls, which I think nothing 
can prevent but his escaping through North Carolina 
to Charleston, Charleston itself may be easily reduced, 
if you will bend your forces this way. And it will 
afford me great pleasure to join your Excellency in 
the attempt ; for I shall be equally happy, Avhether as 
principal or subordinate, so that the public good is 
promoted. 

Since I wrote to you before, we have had a most 
bloody battle. It was by far the most ol)stinate fight 



THE AMERICAN llEVOLUTION. 407 

I ever saw.* Victory was ours ; and had it not been 
for one of those little incidents which frequently hap- 
pen in the progress of war, we should have taken the 
whole British army. Nothing could exceed the gal- 
lantry of our officers, or the bravery of the troops. 
I do myself the honor to inclose you a copy of my 
letter to Congress, and beg leave to refer you to 
Captain Pierce, one of my Aids, Avho is the bearer, 
and who will give your Excellency a full history of 
all matters in this department, both as to force and 
supplies. I am trying to collect a body of militia to 
oppose Lord Cornwallis, should he attempt to escape 
through North Carolina. And you may rest assured 
nothing shall be left unattempted, in my power, to 
impede his march, so as to give your army time to 
get up with him ; but my force is very small, and I 
am exceedingly embarrassed with numerous wounded. 
I have the honor to be, with great respect. 
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 

Nathanael Greene. 



FROM RICHARD HENRY LEE. 

Epping Forest, 17 September, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 

I had the honor of replying to your polite and 
agreeable letter of July the 15th, by my son Lud- 
well, whom I expected either to wait on you with it 
in Virginia, or to get the letter forwarded by the 
Marquis de Lafayette. Although I am at this time 
laboring under a severe fit of the gout, it is impos-

tember. 



408 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

sible to refrain from congratulating you, and rejoicing 
with our country on the present happy and glorious 
prospect before us. The very judicious and decisive 
step that you have taken in coming here, seems to 
put it out of the power of fortune to prevent the 
enemy in this State from falling into your hands. 
At least my mind can reach hut to two preventives — 
the coming of naval aid from Europe, which is hardly 
possible ; and the want of provisions for our good 
allies and ourselves, which cannot be probable. A 
proper watch will surely be kept upon marine mo- 
tions in Europe, to prevent the repetition of such 
scenes as the relieving of Gibraltar. And it is inad- 
missible that, in this land of abundance, so disgraceful 
a thing should happen as the dispersion of a force 
collected for our salvation, for want of provisions, 
which now the country abounds with. 

I assure you. Sir, the Commissaries' and Quarter- 
masters' departments in the State, so far as I have 
observed them, have in every thing been the reverse 
of right, insomuch that I have been well informed 
the fcAV troops with the Marquis have frequently felt 
distress for want of provisions. At present the land 
and sea force, which may come to lean on these 
broken staffs, will probably reach to forty-five or 
fifty thousand men. We have now a good character 
at the head of our State and War Offices, and I make 
no doubt but that he will exert all his powers with 
diligence. To prevent, however, the greatest of all 
misfortunes, want of success from want of provisions, 
can we not add some methods not destructive of the 
present plans, and which may aid their efficiency? 
Suppose immediate notice were given to the possess- 
ors of good merchant mills, that they should be paid 
with specie for the flour they brought to your army 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 409 

and the navy, and a better price for it the sooner 
it reached. And wherever a competent person would 
undertake in a reasonable time to deliver a proper 
quantity, let his mill and wagons have protection 
from the destructive talons of impressors. Upon these 
last, let me here make one observation for all. Their 
grip generally squeezes the best citizens, and leaves 
the rest, and is always executed for the greater ease 
and profit of the impressor, so that now the people 
in general are exerting their wits to elude and hide 
their property from these characters. To prevent this 
plan from being executed with partiality, and upon 
views of job, some men having knowledge of the 
country, of honor, integrity, and diligence, should be 
employed to ride through the upper counties and see 
as much flour despatched as possible. With regard 
to the hard money, I suppose that our allies will fur- 
nish a sufficiency for their own supply, which will 
leave no great matter for us ; and this, if we are 
rightly informed here, our Congress Financier might 
furnish, since the return of Colonel Laurens from 
France. 

The present mode of getting beef from the several 
circles would answer, if diligently executed. But to 
aid this, for health, as well as plenty, suppose that an 
active Justice of the Peace, first Militia Officer, and 
one of the Delegates in each county, or any two of 
the three, were immediately, by government, empow- 
ered and exhorted to proceed with diligence and take 
one half of the bacon and salt beef in possession of 
every famil}^, and despatch it in pressed wagons, 
carts, or vessels, immediately to the army. The sea- 
son now is, when persons in the country may find 
many resources beside salted meat to subsist upon. 
In short, victory must not be prevented by want of 
VOL. III. 35 



410 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

victuals, and these must be obtained at any rate. 
Although I have seen the baneful influence of these 
impresses, yet, upon this great and apparently final 
occasion, it seems admissible to extend a little under 
proper direction, not to destroy the present system. 
I mean in this exigence to aid, not to annihilate now, 
the old imperfect plan. I should suppose that if spe- 
cie pay were promised, the fleet might be well fur- 
nished with vegetables from the water-bound counties. 
I assure your Excellency that I should not have 
troubled you, or roused from my present state to 
make these observations, if it were not because of my 
great anxiety lest we should fail of the happy end 
before us for want of provisions ; and upon this prin- 
ciple I am sure of your pardon. But now that I am 
thus engaged, permit me to make a few observations 
upon the negroes now with the enemy, in case of 
the surrender of the latter. I have been told that it 
is fixed, but whether by civil or military power, I 
know not, that the owners, or any other person, may 
have the slaves on paying five pound specie into the 
public treasury for each. It would seem that the un- 
fortunate owners should be relieved on terms as easy 
as possible. The Admiralty has some regulations 
upon subjects taken within their Province ; but how 
they apply to this case, I see not. And I believe 
that the singular manner in which Great Britain has 
conducted this war against America, leaves no clue 
to direct us in former practice. Force, fraud, intrigue, 
theft, have all in turn been employed to delude these 
unhappy people, and to defraud their masters ! My 
brother William has lost sixty-five, among whom are 
about forty-five valuable grown slaves and useful ar- 
tisans. I would say nothing in his favor from his 
many other losses, or the personal injuries that have 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 411 

befallen tim. from his attacliment to his native coun- 
try. General systems will be applied to general sub- 
jects, and I shall be content with those that you es- 
tablish. I would only observe, that he is now upon 
the Continent of Europe, where he has been detained 
by the disagreeable consequences that might follow 
the committing his wife and children to the sea in 
these precarious times, and the necessity of his pre- 
sence with them in a foreign land, where he is suffi- 
ciently distressed for their support ; the profits of his 
estate here having all been put into the town offices, 
and his numerous debts in England not recoverable 
at present. He has now no day in their Court, and 
no lawyer has been found that would bring suits 
for him. Perhaps it will be thought equitable, if any 
salvage is demanded, to allow absentees a reasonable 
indulgence for payment. I have the honor to be, 
with the most perfect esteem. Sir, your Excellency's 
Most affectionate and obedient servant, 

Richard Henry Lee. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL MORGAN. 

20 September, 1781 

Sir, 
At a time like this, when your Excellency's every 
moment must be devoted to the grand business of 
America, I know you can have but little leisure for 
letters. If the feelings of my heart will not 
permit me to be silent, I cannot avoid congratulating 
your Excellency on the present favorable appearance 
of our affairs. I cannot avoid telling your Excellency 
how much I wish you success, and how much I wish 



412 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

that the state of my health woiikl permit me to af- 
ford my small services on this great occasion. Such 
has been my peculiar fate, that, during the whole 
course of the present war, I have never on any im- 
portant event had the honor of serving under your 
Excellency. It is a misfortune I have ever sincerely 
lamented. There is nothing on earth would have 
given more real pleasure, than to have made this 
campaign under your Excellency's eye; to have shared 
the dangers, and let me add, the glory too, which I 
am almost confident will be acquired. But, as my 
health will not admit of my rejoining the army im- 
mediately, I must beg leave to repeat to your Excel- 
lency my most earnest wishes for your success, and 
for your personal safety. I have the honor to be, 
with sentiments of the highest esteem. 

Your Excellency's obedient servant, 

Daniel Morgan. 



FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Camp, before York, 30 September, 1781. 

My DEAR General, 

You have so often been pleased to ask I would 
give my opinion upon any subject that may occur, 
that I will this day take the liberty to mention a few 
articles. I am far from laughing at the idea of the 
enemy's making a retreat. It is not very probable ; 
but it is not impossible. Indeed, they have no other 
way to escape, and since we cannot get ships above 
York, I should be still more afraid of a retreat by 
"West Point, than any thing else. The French hus- 
sars remaining here, our dragoons and some infant- 
ry might be stationed somewhere near West Point, 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 413 

rather on the north side. I see the service is much 
done by details, and, to use your permission, I would 
take the liberty to observe, that when the siege is 
once begun it might be more agreeable to the officers 
and men to serve, as much as possible, by whole 
battalions. 

Colonel Scammell is taken. His absence I had ac- 
counted for by his being officer of the day. I am 
very sorry we lose a valuable officer ; but though 
Colonel Scammell's being officer of the day has been 
a reason for his going in front, I think it would be 
well to prevent the officers under the rank of Gene- 
rals or Field-Officers reconnoitring, for the safety of 
their commands, from advancing so near the enemy's 
lines. There is a great disproportion between Hunt- 
ington's and Hamilton's battalions. Now that Scam- 
mell is taken, we might have them made equal, and 
put the eldest of the two Lieutenant-Colonels on the 
right of the brigade. 

I have, these past days, wished for an opportunity 
to speak with your Excellency on Count de Grasse's 
demand relative to M. de Barras's fleet. This busi- 
ness being soon done, we may tliink of Charleston, 
at least of the harbour; or of Savannah. I have 
long and seriously thought of this matter ; but would 
not be in a hurry to mention it, until we know how 
long this Avill last. However, it might be possible to 
give Count de Grasse an early hint of it, in case 
you agree with him upon the winter departure of the 
whole fleet for the West Indies. 

One of my reasons to wish troops, though not in 
great numbers, to be sent to Gloucester county, by 
way of West Point, is, that for the first days it will 
embarrass any movement of the enemy up the river, 
or up the country, on either side; and when it is in

414 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

Gloucester county it may be thought advantageous, 
by a respectable regular force, to prevent the ene- 
my's increasing their works there, and giving us the 
trouble of a second operation; and, at the same time, 
it will keep from York a part of the British forces. 
With the highest regard and most sincere affection, 
I have the honor to be, dear General, 

Your most obedient, humble servant, 

Lafayette. 



FROM FRANCISCO RENDON.* 

Philadelphia, 2 October, 1781. 

Sir, 
I have just now received a letter from Don Ber- 
nardo de Galvez, Commander of His Majesty's forces 
in the Province of Louisiana and Florida, acquainting 
me with his desire of employing the forces under his 
command in the most effectual manner against the 
common enemy, and of being able to favor, by his 
operations, those which the combined armies may un- 
dertake at the southward of this Continent. He de- 
sires me earnestly to keep well informed of the state 
and progress of military operations here, and of the 
measures which may be adopted for the recovery of 
such parts of the Southern States as are now invad- 
ed by the enemy. He recommends me to transmit 
him the information I shall be able to procure on 
this subject, with the greatest secrecy and despatch, 
that he may speedily determine on the ultimate plan 
of his operations ; and I am authorized to send him 
an advice-ship, if I can find no immediate oppor-

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 415 

tunity for the Havana. I have thought it indispensa- 
bly necessary to despatch immediately an express to 
your Excellency, to lay before you the dispositions 
of General Galvez, and entreat you to put it in my 
power to send him such intelligence as may enable 
him to form effectual plans to press the enemy on all 
sides, and bring them sooner to the terms of an hon- 
orable peace, which is a common object to us all. 

Inclosed I have the honor to transmit to your 
Excellency a copy of a letter from the same General 
to Admiral Count de Grasse, respecting the capitula- 
tion of Pensacola. I am happy thereby to have it in 
my power to convince you that the friendly disposi- 
tion of the Spanish towards America is by no means 
altered, and that they have at heart the success of 
these United States as much as their own. 

I beg your Excellency wdll detain the express as 
little as possible. I have the honor to be, with the 
greatest respect, Sir, your Excellency's 

Most obedient and most humble servant, 

Fr^incisco Rendon. 



FROM GOVERNOR RUTLEDGE. 

High HUls of Santee, 5 October, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 

I heartily congratulate your Excellency on the 
pow^erful aid which you have received from his Most 
Christian Majesty ; and, I doubt not, that the com- 
bined forces, under your command, will soon compel 
Lord Cornwallis to surrender himself and his whole 
army prisoners. Indeed, it seems almost impossible 
that they should escape. 

I wrote your Excellency about the 6th ultimo, by 



416 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

Colonel Morris, soliciting siicli aid as might be neces- 
sary for the recovery of Charleston, as soon as New 
York should fall. This I did upon a presumption 
that your first attempt would be against that garrison. 
However, the season was so far advanced before Count 
de Grasse's arrival, that I apprehend, considering how 
much time the operations in Virginia must necessarily 
consume, that the attack upon New York must be 
postponed for this year. 

No man can be more fully persuaded than my- 
self of your Excellency's unremitted attention to each 
of the United States (how distant soever from you), 
and of your earnest desire to rescue every part of 
them from the enemy. I should not, therefore, offer 
to intrude upon you, when every moment of your 
time must be engaged in matters of the utmost im- 
portance, was it not from a fear (which I hope is 
groundless, and proceeding only from my anxiety for 
the country) that the French forces will be desirous 
of returning to the West Indies, when their present 
immediate object is accomplished. Should this be 
their intention, I must entreat your Excellency to en- 
deavour to dissuade them, by the most powerful argu- 
ments, from such a measure. A siege of Charleston, 
by the force now in Virginia, cannot fail to succeed 
in three or four weeks. While such a French fleet 
as the present is on our coast, the British fleet Avill 
not leave New York; and while they remain there, 
the French have nothing to fear on account of the 
West India Islands. The recovery of the Southern 
States would probably occasion an immediate offer to 
America of the acknowledgment of her independence, 
and of an acceptable peace. 

On the contrary, at this juncture, when the hopes 
and expectations of our friends in the southernmost 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 417 

States are raised to the greatest lieiglitj and our ene- 
mies here, both foreign and domestic, are struck with 
the utmost terror, and justly think every thing on 
the brink of being irrecoverably lost, a desertion of 
these States, by the force of our ally, would produce 
the worst of consequences. Many people, seeing no 
reason for such unaccountable conduct, the very re- 
verse of what they have been led by authority to 
expect, will immediately begin to despond, and be 
induced to believe the report which, though ground- 
less, is constantly circulated by the enemy, that these 
States will be given up to Great Britain, if the inde- 
pendence of the rest can be obtained. The spirits of 
the disaffected wall be revived. The inhabitants of 
the country [will continue] in a miserable condition, 
destitute of every necessary supply, not having, 
while the enemy are possessed of our seaports, and 
command our inlets, the means of procuring them ; 
and certainly, while they hold what they now have 
in these three States (though they should not be 
able to increase their possessions, which however 
they might if reenforced, as without doubt they 
w^ould be), they will not incline to admit our inde- 
pendence, nor, on the other hand, will Congress give 
it up, though the war will be protracted, until these 
countries are totally recovered. But, if that event is 
not now effected, who can say wdien it will be, or 
wdien a period so favorable as the present will again 
offer ? 

These, and all other reasons, which may be adduced 
to influence the French Commanders to assist in an 
attack upon Charleston, will, I am persuaded, have 
already occurred to your Excellency. I have, there- 
fore, only to repeat my most earnest request, that 
you will prevail upon the principal officers of our 



418 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

ally not to suffer so glorious an opportunity that now 
presents itself to slip, without laying hold of what is 
almost within their reach ; and offer my most fervent 
wishes, that all your undertakings may he crowned 
with success. I have the honor to he, with the great- 
est esteem and respect, 

Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

John Pvutledge. 



FROM COLONEL PICKERING. 

Camp, 5 October, 1781. 

Sir, 

It may be proper that I report to your Excellency 
the circumstances and events of my late journey to 
Williamsburg. I was unable to leave camp the 2d 
instant until late in the afternoon, which prevented 
my reaching Williamsburg till the evening. 

I immediately waited on the Intendant with Count 
Chastellux's letter, reciting the agreement he had 
made with me respecting the future employment of 
the vessels, and desiring him to pay me two thou- 
sand dollars on account of their services. The In- 
tendant declined doing it, but proposed to see me 
the next morning, when he would get an interpreter, 
that we might fully understand one another. I met 
him at sunrise ; but, after a long conversation, he 
finally refused a compliance, in any respect, with the 
agreement of Count Chastellux. He observed, that 
neither Count Chastellux, as Major-General, nor Count 
Rochambeau, as Commander-in-chief, had a right to 
make any agreements obligatory on him ; that he had 
been constantly disappointed, in every undertaking of 
Government, from Hhode Island to Virginia ; that he 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 419 

was answerable with his head, if the King's army- 
were not duly supplied; that money insured supplies; 
and that he could depend on nothing but the direct 
application of it by his own agents. I Avas noAV 
fearful that the proposed plan must be wholly given 
up. But afterwards I concerted measures with Colo- 
nel Wads worth and Mr. Carter for prosecuting it, and, 
by their assistance, have been enabled to do it for 
the present. On my arriving at Trebel's Landing, I 
found many vessels unfit for service. These, exceed- 
ing twenty in number, I discharged. All the others 
that were unloaded were formed into squadrons for 
different ports, to bring supplies to the army. Most 
of them sailed yesterday morning. 

Commodore Barron arrived at Williamsburg just 
in time to go with me to the Landing ; yet, with his 
assistance, I was not able to arrange the vessels, 
finish the unloading of some, furnish them with pro- 
visions, and write their various orders, till yesterday 
morning. A competent number wdll call on the Count 
de Grasse to land the marines at the place your Ex- 
cellency directed, if this should not have been already 
effected ; for Commodore Barron informed that before 
he left the fleet, the Admiral intended to land them 
without delay. 

There is one vessel at the Landing, which came 
from Rhode Island with salted provisions, wdiich yet 
remain unloaded. I do not know the quantity she 
has on board, but I believe not above a hundred or 
a hundred and fifty barrels. If there be no material 
objection, I would have it landed, that the vessel 
might be discharged, or emploj^ed in transporting 
supplies. At present she serves only as a storehouse 
for that small quantity of provisions, at the rent of 
two thousand five hundred and fifty-five a year. 



420 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

I trouble your Excellency with this information, be- 
cause Colonel Stewart, some days since, suggested that 
it was your Excellency's desire, that this salted meat 
should be j)reserved for some special occasions, and 
that it was necessary to have it remain on board. I 
have the honor to be, with the greatest respect. 
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

Timothy Pickering. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GATES. 

Berkley County, 7 October, 1781. 

Sir, 

The secrecy and expedition of your Excellency's 
movement from the North River, defeated my wish to 
have paid you my compliments in person upon your 
route, as I never knew of your being upon the 
march until you had passed Alexandria. In this re- 
mote corner, I seldom see a newspaper; and though 
we ought to have a post once a fortnight, we are in 
that often disappointed. 

I hope your Excellency received my letter of the 
22d of May, from Philadelphia. I should have been 
happy to know j^our sentiments thereupon, but do 
most readily conceive the vast public business, with 
which you are constantly surrounded, has deprived 
me of that satisfaction. Ever willing to give my lit- 
tle aid to serve this, our much injured country, I 
should rejoice to be instrumental to your Excellency's 
success in any way you would please to command ; 
but I think you would not wish me to act under the 
stigma, that has been so ungenerously laid upon me. 

The bearer, Mr. Blue, a reputable farmer from the 
south branch of the Potomac, desires to contract for 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 421 

the delivery of three hundred beeves to your army. 
As I believe he is a person that will perform his 
promise, I recommend him to your Excellency. 

That the Supreme Disposer of events may crown 
your labors with a glorious and complete victory is 
the earnest request of, Sir, 

Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 

Horatio Gates. 



FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

(Private.) 

Philadelphia, 12 October, 1781. 

Sir, 

I had the honor of writing last to your Excellency 
on the 2Gth of September. Since that time we have 
had letters from Mr. Adams, at Paris, on the loth 
of July, and from Amsterdam on the 3d of August. 
They confirm what I wrote you last. 

On Monday, the rear of the fleet that sailed from 
England with Admiral Digby arrived at Sandy Hook. 
It consists of thirty-four transports, under convoy of 
a ship of forty guns and three frigates. No more, it 
is said, are expected. This information I received late 
last night, from Mr. David Forman, of Freehold. Ad- 
miral Graves will, it is believed, make a second at^ 
tempt to relieve Lord Cornwallis. He is making every 
preparation for that purpose, and it is thought will 
proceed for the Chesapeake immediately. It may be 
well to apprise Count de Grasse of this, without de- 
lay. 

Sir Henry Clinton sent off three boats with des- 
patches for Lord Cornwallis. One, named the Andre, 
carrying a brass six-pounder in her bow, eight blun- 
VOL. III. 36 



422 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

derlbiisses, and twenty men armed ■witli muskets, sail- 
ed on the 26tli of September last ; the second sailed 
on the 28th; and the third, on the 1st instant. We 
have taken the two last; and by means of a little 
address and a promise of pardon to a Tory, who was 
intrusted with one set of despatches, I found it was 
hid on the beach where he was taken. I have pro- 
cured three gentlemen of ingenuity and fidelity to 
proceed to Little Egg Harbour with the fellow, in 
quest of it. The beach is so extensive, and so many 
places like each other, that it is not yet found, 
though the man is believed to be perfectly sincere 
in his wishes to recover it. The gentlemen went 
from this on Sunday, and I expect their return to- 
morrow. You shall know the result as soon as they 
arrive. In the mean time, the boat w^hich first sailed 
should be looked for by the fleet. I have written to 
the Presidents of Delaware and the Eastern Shore 
of Maryland to watch for her. 

We shall be obliged to complete Colonel Arm.and's 
legion, and I despair of doing it with Americans, if 
all the Eield-Officers are French gentlemen. There is 
now a vacancy, by the resignation of the Major ; and 
if the Colonel would approve of Captain Allen Mc- 
Lean, who is now on half-pay, to be his Major, it 
would save the half-pay, oblige a very deserving 
officer, be a means of speedily filling his corps, and 
greatly tend to the public benefit. I should be happy 
if you and the Colonel were of this opinion. 

Captain Gilland is said to be arrived in the frigate 
Charlestown in Casco Bay. He has clothing. &c., 
for Congress, to the amount of ten thousand pounds 
sterling and upwards, and I believe a million and a 
half of livres. It is a fortunate arrival, and I sin- 
cerely congratulate you upon it ; for I now flatter 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 423 

myself your army will be well clothed and paid in 
future. 

The express delivered your favor of the 1st instant 
only last night; it shall be laid before Congress this 
morning. I have the honor to be, with the greatest 
esteem, Sir, 

Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

Thomas McKe^in. 



FROil RICHARD HENRY LEE. 

Chantilly, 12 October, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 

I had the honor of addressing you last, by my 
eldest son, who went to camp about four weeks ago. 
Since that, we have had the pleasure of hearing that 
your advances against York go successfully on. By 
this time, I hope his Lordship begins seriously to 
repent the Quixote part that he has been acting 
in America. Surely the rage of despotism must be 
cooled by the total defeat of those great hopes, which 
have been entertained of southern conquest; though 
really, in all the outrages of passion that history pre- 
sents, we see nothing equal to the tyrannous and 
senseless rancor of the British Iving and counsels 
against America. 

This disposition may continue a hopeless, ruinous 
war. I see that Arnold, in the true spirit of apos- 
tasy, is burning and wasting his native country. The 
malice of that man, his wickedness, and his avarice, 
render him a fit instrument for such employers. His 
former success in this State, liis restless search after 
gain, however obtained, and the general languor that 
will be found here after the present exertions are 



424 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

over, will most likel}^ be persuasives with General 
Clinton and himself, to cause the coming of this un- 
principled person, with his fifteen hundred or two 
thousand plunderers, to Virginia, when the fleet and 
army shall be gone. The learned and judicious Poly- 
bius was of opinion, that the principal inducing mo- 
tive of Alexander the Great for invading Persia, was 
the little resistance that the ten thousand Grecians 
met with in passing through that great empire. 
Weakness, joined with the possession of property, are 
certainly strong temptations to ambitious, avaricious 
men. 

How best to prevent Richmond from experiencing, 
in November, the same disgraceful visit that it did 
in January, your wisdom can best determine. Per- 
haps two strong frigates, under protection of a small 
and w^ell-fortified garrison, at the town of York, with 
General Spotswood's and Colonel Mead's legion, made 
complete by the addition of some regular soldiers, 
might operate to discourage such attempts, with the 
force that can be prudently spared from the garrisons 
of New York and Charleston ; or, if attempted, might 
be able, with militia aid, to repel the invaders. 

It is not easy to conceive the distress and injury 
that have been derived to this State from the number 
of piratical plunderers, that have infested the shores 
of this country since our galleys were laid down; 
and such have been the success and benefit attending 
this wicked practice, that we hear of small crews 
forming to go plundering along the shores. In the 
actual state of our aifairs, it will be long before we 
can build and fit vessels to stop these pernicious and 
disgraceful practices. But I should suppose, that our 
government might have credit enough to purchase, 
from among the captured armed vessels at York, 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 425 

some ready-fitted, swift-sailing cruisers, for the pur- 
pose of scouring our Bay and rivers, and suppressing 
these piratical proceedings. If such a plan should 
meet your Excellency's approbation, your recommend- 
ation of it will secure its adoption. I know there 
will be difficulty in getting seamen. But, since the 
security of our country renders marine defence indis- 
pensable, and since the single difficulty of getting 
seamen is far less than getting them and building 
and fitting vessels besides, it would seem prudent to 
get the vessels, and diligently apply at the ports of 
neighbouring States for a few good seamen, less than 
a third of which description, with the rest landsmen, 
would well answer our purpose. I cannot help think- 
ing that this method, aided by a well-conceived lav/ 
for the speedy capital punishment of such offijnders, 
would contribute to lessen greatly, if not to suppress, 
a practice extremely injurious to those who live near 
the water, and destructive to the commerce of the 
State. 

We are anxiously waiting for the rejoicing time to 
come, when Lord Cornwallis and his people will be 
your prisoners. I am, dear Sir, with particular es- 
teem. 

Your affectionate and obedient servant, 

BiCHARD Henry Lee. 



FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Camp before York, 16 October, 1781. 

My DEAR General, 
Your Excellency having personally seen our dis- 
positions, I shall only give you an account of what 

36 * 



426 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

passed in the execution. Colonel Gimat's battalion 
led the van, and was followed by that of Colonel 
Hamilton, who commanded the whole advanced corps. 
At the same time, a party of eighty men, under Colo- 
nel Laurens, turned the redoubt. I beg leave to re- 
fer your Excellency to the report I have received 
from Colonel Hamilton, whose well-known talents and 
gallantry were on this occasion most conspicuous and 
serviceable. Our obligation to him, to Colonel Gimat, 
to Colonel Laurens, and to each and all the officers 
and men, are above expression. Not one gun was 
fired; and the ardor of the troops did not give time 
for the sappers to derange the abatis; and, owing to 
the conduct of the Commanders and bravery of the 
men, the redoubt was stormed with an uncommon 
rapidity. 

Colonel Barber's battalion, which was the first in 
the supporting column, being detached for the aid of 
the advance, arrived at the moment they were get- 
ting over the works, and executed then* orders with 
the utmost alacrity. The Colonel was slightly wound- 
ed. The rest of the column, under Generals Muhlen- 
berg and Hazen, advanced with admirable firmness 
and discipline. Colonel Yose's battalion displayed to 
the left, a part of the division successively dressing 
by him, whilst a kind of second line was forming 
columns in the rear. It adds greatly to the charac- 
ter of the troops, that, under the fire of the enemy, 
they displayed and took their ranks with perfect 
silence and order. 

Give me leave particularly to mention Major Bar- 
ber, Division Lispector, who distinguished himself, and 
received a wound from a cannon ball. 

Li making the arrangement for the support of the 
works we had reduced, I was happy to find General 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 427 

Wayne and the Pennsylvanians so situated as to 
have given us, in case of need, the most effectual 
support. I have the honor to be, with the most per- 
fect respect. 

Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

Lafayette. 



FROM COLONEL PICKERING. 

Camp, 23 October, 1781. 

Sir, 

Agreeably to your Excellency's orders on the 19th 
instant to me, to take possession of the enemy's 
public stores pertaining to my department, I went to 
York myself, with my storekeeper, and at the same 
time desired Colonel Dearborn to go to Gloucester 
with an assistant of the storekeeper, for the purpose 
of receiving the stores. At Gloucester the dragoon- 
horses, with their accoutrements, and the wagon- 
horses and wagons, were delivered up that day, and 
the whole committed by Colonel Dearborn to militia 
guards. The same evening the dragoon-horses were 
driven out of Gloucester, and delivered to the care 
of the Duke de Lauzun's legion ; and, by the inclosed 
certificate and oath of Major Bay ton, it appears that 
no exchanges were made between the receipt of 
those horses from the British, and the delivery of 
them to the Duke's legion. 

On the 20th I sent over the superintendent of 
the horse-yard with a party of men, and a written 
order to take charge of the cavalry-horses ; but Co- 
lonel Sheldon told my assistant, Mr. Mix, that they 
should retain the horses till there was an order from 
your Excellency to deliver them up. So the super- 



428 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

intendent remained at Gloucester. During the 20th 
and 21st I had persons waiting at Gloucester to re- 
ceive every species of property pertaining to my 
department, with a party of men for fatigue and 
guards. As soon as the prisoners left their tents on 
the 21st, Mr. Mix applied to the officer of the French 
guard, and told him his orders and business ; but he 
refused to let him take a tent, unless he could pro- 
duce an order from your Excellency, Count Hocham- 
beau, or General Choisy. The time would not admit 
of an application to either. Night came on, and the 
tents were chiefly stolen. In two hours, the persons 
I had assigned for that service would have had them 
in store. Early that morning I sent Mr. Mix with a 
note to head-quarters, mentioning the embarrassments 
given me by the French and militia guards. But 
your Excellency was gone to the fleet ; though Mr. 
Trumbull said you had previously written to General 
Choisy on the subject. 

Colonel Dearborn informs me, that a large propor- 
tion of the public stores thus lost (tents particularly) 
were taken away by the soldiers and women in the 
British hospitals; so that of one hundred and ten new 
tents returned in the eightieth regiment, only four 
or five were left. This information he received from 
the Quarter-master to that regiment. Some French 
soldiers were yesterday found there, loading two boats 
with tents. Colonel Dearborn's coming probably pre- 
vented their completing their design ; but, in defiance 
of him, they carried off what they had got. 

The French have placed safeguards over the houses 
at Gloucester, where the British officers are quartered; 
so that no American officer on duty there can obtain 
any shelter, unless in the vilest hovels. I conceive it 
to be absolutely necessary that these, and the French 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 429 

guards over the stores, be removed, as well as the 
guards of militia ; their places to be supplied, as far 
as shall be found necessary, by Continental troops. 

I request to be fivored with your Excellency's di- 
rections, respecting the public stores and tents carried 
off by the people in the British hospital. Colonel 
Dearborn will present this, and explain more circum- 
stantially the proceedings at Gloucester. I have the 
honor to be, with great respect. 

Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

Timothy Pickering. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 
Head- Quarters, High Hills of Santee, 25 October, 1781. 

Sir, 
My last letter was dated at Charlotte, and forward- 
ed by Lieutenant-Colonel Lee ; since which I have 
received your Excellency's fiivor of the 28th of Sep- 
tember. I am happy to find the army under your 
command ready to commence operations against Lord 
Cornwallis ; but I am sorry to hear you tliink the 
issue somewhat doubtful. And it gives me great pain 
to find, that, whatever may be our success in Vir- 
ginia, the circumstances of our ally will not per- 
mit them to cooperate with us in an attempt upon 
Charleston. The great importance of their present 
services demands our warmest gratitude ; but it is 
much to be regretted, that we cannot improve the 
advantage which our signal success would give us, as 
the hopes of our people, and the fears of the enemy, 
w^ould greatly facilitate the reduction of Charleston. 
However, if you succeed in Virginia, it will enable 
you to support us more efiectually here, if these 



430 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

States derive no other advantage from the present 
exertions of our allies. I will not suffer myself to 
doubt of your success, though I cannot help, at times, 
being greatly agitated between hope and fear, which 
alternately prevail, from the many incidents that oc- 
cur in military operations, which may defeat the most 
flattering prospects ; and I find, by letters from Con- 
gress, as well as from your Excellency, that Sir Henry 
Clinton is making the most rapid preparations for 
some important blow. 

I mentioned, in one of my former letters, that I 
had been concerting with Governor Burke a plan for 
the reduction of Wilmington. General Rutherford is 
moving down towards that place with a considerable 
body of militia ; and I hear the enemy have left the 
place, and now occupy Brunswick, about thirty miles 
below; and, by preparations making in Charleston of 
small transports, I think it highly probable the ene- 
my intend to take off the garrison. But this is only 
conjecture. 

Since the battle of Eutaw, our troops have been 
exceedingly sickly, and our distress and difficulties 
have been not a little increased for want of medi- 
cines and hospital stores. The malignity of the fe- 
vers begins to cease as the weather grows cool. The 
enemy are all in the lower country ; and nothing 
material has happened since my last, except a num- 
ber of prisoners who have been taken by our light 
parties sent out by General Marion. 

Inclosed, I send your Excellency a return of our 
strength, by which you will see our weak state. We 
can attempt nothing further, except in the partisan 
way. Some riflemen have arrived in camp from the 
mountains ; more are expected, which will enable us 
to keep up pretty strong parties for a time. But I 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 431 

look forward with pain to December, when the whole 
Virginia line will leave us. I hope measures will be 
taken before that period to reenforce us. To arrive 
here seasonably, they must move soon. Colonel Lee 
and Captain Pierce, I hope, have given you a full 
state of matters in this quarter, to enable you to 
take your measures without loss of time. 

I transmitted, by Captain Pierce, copies of all the 
letters and papers that had passed respecting Colonel 
Hayne's execution, mentioned in some of my former 
letters ; and, as I had not paper to copy them for 
your Excellency, I desired Captain Pierce to break 
the covers on his arrival at your camp, to give you 
an opportunity to see them, and inform yourself re- 
specting the matter, as the business, in its consequen- 
ces, might involve the whole Continent, and particu- 
larly the military part ; and, therefore, would ulti- 
mately rest with you. Should he have omitted this 
matter, of which I gave him a particular charge, I 
will forward you copies by the first opportunity. I 
wrote to Lord Cornwallis on the subject, but have 
not got his answer. 

You have my warmest wishes for your success, and 
my hearty prayers for your safety. With sentiments 
of the greatest respect and esteem, I am 

Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 

Nathan AEL Greene. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL LINCOLN. 

Camp, near York, 2G October, 1781. 

My dear General, 
As Count de Grasse cannot aid us in our most 
favorite object, an expedition against Charleston, and 



432 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

if an attempt to reduce it is now made, it must be 
independent of a marine force ; and as 3'our Excellen- 
cy has asked my sentiments on the propriety or im- 
propriety of attempting it under these circumstances, 
I do, on the fullest reflection, give it as my opinion 
that it may not be done with a rational hope of suc- 
cess, and beg leave to subjoin the following reasons, 
on which I have founded my judgment. 

First. If we have no ships of force to cover us, and 
to possess the harbour, we shall be reduced entire- 
ly to a land operation, and must regularly approach 
the works of the town, in doing which, we must con- 
tend with a heavy train of artillery. This Avill make 
it necessary for us to carry forward one equal, at 
least, which, together with the necessary stores for 
a siege, if I may judge by the quantity brought here, 
and by what was used by the enemy in the reduc- 
tion of the place, will exceed, upon a moderate com- 
putation, twenty-five hundred tons. Add to that the 
baggage of the army, the stores in the Quarter-mas- 
ter's, Commissary's, and Hospital departments, and the 
whole will not be less than three thousand tons, to 
transport which it will be difficult, if not impossible, 
to provide teams. 

Secondly. As we must travel through a barren and 
a thinly inhabited country, where forage cannot be 
obtained but at a great distance, to remove which it 
would require a large additional number of teams 
(as three thousand bushels of corn will be necessary 
for each day's consumption, besides fodder), this also 
would be too great a demand for the country to 
bear, with others which would be increased by so 
large an army being in it. 

The removing such a force, with the necessaries for 
a siege, through an extent of country of four or five 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 433 

hundred miles, cut by many navigable rivers, unpro- 
vided with suitable boats for speedy transportation, 
would cause so great a delay as to shade, at least, 
every hope of success ; and especially if the har- 
bour of Charleston should remain open, during that 
time, for the reception of such supplies and reenforce- 
ments as should be thought necessary by the enemy 
to baffle our attempt. 

Other reasons might be added, such as the ease 
wdth which the enemy might shift their situation, 
should they find it necessary; the impossibility of 
bringing off the artillery and stores, should the ex- 
pedition fail; for a sufficiency of horses for this and 
other necessary purposes of the army could not be 
supplied. But I am confident I need not proceed. 

If the siege of Charleston should not be attempted 
this winter, the troops south of the Delaware will be 
such a reenforcement to General Greene as will put 
it in his power, with the present force of the enemy, 
to cover the country, and reduce the British to the 
lines of the town. The other troops will be refreshed 
by going northward to their winter-quarters, which 
will also cover that part of the country. By the 
French remaining in this State, they will hold a posi- 
tion convenient to give aid, either north or south, as 
circumstances shall demand. I have the honor to be, 
my dear General, with every sentiment of esteem, 
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

Benjamin Lincoln. 



VOL. m. 37 



434 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM COLONEL TILGHMiVN. 

Philadelphia, 27 October, 1781. 

Sir, 

I arrived at this place early on Wednesday morn- 
ing, although I lost one whole night's run by the 
stupidity of the skipper, who got over upon the Tan- 
gier Shoals, and was a whole day crossing, in a calm, 
from Annapolis to Rock Hall. The wind left me en- 
tirely on Sunday evening, thirty miles below Anna- 
polis. I found that a letter from Count de Grasse to 
Governor Lee, dated the 18th, had gone forward to 
Congress, in which the Count informed the Governor 
that Cornwallis had then surrendered. This made me 
the more anxious to reach Philadelpliia, as I knew 
both Congress and the public would be uneasy at 
not receiving despatches from you. I was not wrong 
in my conjecture, for some really began to doubt the 
matter. The fatigue of the journey brought back my 
intermittent fever, with which I have been confined 
almost ever since I came to town. 

A Committee, consisting of Mr. Randolph, Mr. Car- 
roll, and Mr Boudinot, were appointed to inquire of 
me the several matters of a particular kind, which 
were not included in your despatches. They not only 
went into these, but into the motives which led to 
the several articles of the capitulation. And I have 
the pleasure to inform you, that they w^ere perfectly 
satisfied wdth the propriety and expediency of every 
step which was taken ; and so, indeed, w^ere the whole 
body of Congress, except the South Carolinians, whose 
animosities carry them to that length, that they think 
no treatment could have been too severe for the gar- 
rison, the officers, and Lord Cornwallis in particular. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 435 

One of them, whose name I will mention when I have 
the pleasure of meeting your Excellency, made a mo- 
tion that the officers should be detained until the fur- 
ther order of Congress. This was unanimously reject- 
ed, as an affront upon you, a violation of the capitu- 
lation, a violation of our national honor, and that of 
our ally, whose Admiral and General were parties. 
Upon the whole, Sir, you may be assured that the 
capitulation is considered by every unbiased person, 
both in and out of Congress, as highly honorable to 
the arms, and beneficial to the interests, of both na- 
tions. 

I shall set out, as soon as I am well enough to 
ride, to Chestertown, at which place I propose waiting 
until I hear the route which your Excellency intends 
to take. You will, therefore, be good enough to let 
one of the gentlemen direct a line for me, to the care 
of Governor Lee, with a desire to send it immediately 
over to Rock Hall, where I will leave orders to have 
it forwarded to me. I can, by making use of this 
little interval, pay a short visit to my friends, and 
look into my private affairs, which much want my 
inspection. 

Whenever I am acquainted with your determination, 
I shall, without delay, join you. I am too much air 
tached, by duty and affection, to remain a moment 
behind, when I think my presence can render any 
service or assistance to your Excellency. I beg you 
to be assured that I am, with the utmost sincerity, 
your Excellency's 

Most obedient and most humble servant, 

Tench Tilghman. 



436 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM GOVERNOR TRUMBULL. 
State of Connecticut, Lebanon, 6 November, 1781. 

Sir, 

The very interesting and important news of the 
surrender of General Lord CornwalliS; with the British 
army, shipping, &c., &c., under his command, reached 
me on the 26th ultimo by a vessel from the Chesa- 
peake to Rhode Island ; and the full confirmation, a 
few days since by a letter from my son. My warm- 
est and most sincere congratulations await your Ex- 
cellency on an event so honorable and glorious to 
yourself, so interesting and happy to the United 
States ; — an event, which cannot fail to strengthen 
the impressions of the European powers in flivor of the 
great and good cause, in which you have so long and 
so successfully contended, and go far to convince the 
haughty King of Great Britain, that it is in vain to 
persevere in his cruel and infamous purpose of en- 
slaving a people, who can boast of Generals and ar- 
mies that neither fear to meet his veterans in the 
high places of the field, or pursue them to their 
strong-holds of security, and for whose help the arm 
of the Almighty has been made bare, and his sal- 
vation rendered gloriously conspicuous; — an event, 
which will hasten the wished-for happy period, when 
your Excellency may retire to and securely possess 
the sweets of domestic felicity and glorious rest from 
the toils of war, surrounded by the universal applaus- 
es of a free, grateful, and happy people. 

The very important assistance and powerful coope- 
ration afforded by the fleet and army of our illus- 
trious ally, the King of France, demand the most 
grateful acknowledgments. The gallant and intrepid 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 437 

conduct of the Commanders and Officers of both, has 
acquired them great glory, and entitles them and 
their army to the warmest thanks of America. 

Your Excellency has been made acquainted with 
the destruction lately committed upon New London 
and Groton, by a considerable force of the enemy 
under the infamous traitor, whose name and memory 
should rot. A force much more considerable has been 
kept there since. They have done much to repair 
the injury done to the fortifications; and particularly 
that on Groton side, which entirely commands the 
town and harbour, is already in much better condi- 
tion than before, and the work is still going on. 
And, as I take it for granted that part of the naval 
force of his most Christian Majesty will remain on 
the station through the winter, I would take leave 
to offer to the consideration of your Excellency, that 
they may be stationed at the port of New London, 
which I conceive would be attended with advantao-es 
superior, with respect to themselves and the country, 
to any place they could choose. The harbour is very 
sufficient to contain any number and size of ships ; 
is peculiarly safe from the injuries of wind or storms. 
Its immediate connection with the main renders it 
accessible by the militia in case of need; and, adjoin- 
ing to a country, through the favor of Providence 
at present abounding with every kind of provision 
they can want, will render their supplies much more 
easy and safe than at the Island where they last 
wintered, and where they received great part of their 
supplies by water from New London, exposed to loss 
and capture, and which actually did, and must al- 
ways, happen in some instances. 

I have very lately received a pressing request from 
his Excellency, the General of Martinico, for large 
37* 



438 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

supplies of fresh beef from this State, for the use of 
the garrisons and hospitals there. I purpose to per- 
mit and encourage private adventures to furnish it, 
which must be shipped from that port. The lying 
of a fleet there would greatly secure and protect the 
coasts, for a considerable distance, against the armed 
vessels of the enemy, who will doubtless get know- 
ledge of the design, and be engaged to intercept ves- 
sels with such cargoes. And, for their more effect- 
ual protection, I must also request a convoy of a 
frigate, armed sloop, or something adequate, for any 
number of vessels which may be ready to sail, and 
ask your Excellency's direction in that respect alsoj 
and on the assurance of which, I doubt not, a full 
and speedy supply might and would be afforded ; 
and without it I fear it will fall short. 

Permit me to add, in favor of the town which has 
so severely suffered, that a fleet stationed there would 
also afford relief and help to many of the distressed 
inhabitants, who have lost their all; and would be 
a protection to as much property, taken from the 
enemy, as perhaps is brought into any port standing 
in need of such protection. 

On the whole, I submit these and other reasons, 
which will readily occur to your Excellency's wisdom 
and candor. With every sentiment of esteem and 
consideration, I have the honor to be, your Excel- 
lency's 

Most obedient and very humble servant, 

Jonathan Teumbull.

FROM THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.* 

PhiladelpUa, 10 November, 1781. 

Sir, 

I have the honor of transmitting to your Excel- 
lency a copy of an Act of Congress of the 7th in- 
stant, for your information and satisfaction. Your 
Excellency's letters of the 27th and 31st ultimo have 
been received, and laid before Congress. 

As this is the first opportunity I have had of 
writing to your Excellency, since Congress were pleas- 
ed to elect me to the singular honor of being their 
President, and as a literary correspondence, from our 
natural situations, becomes indispensably necessary be- 
tween us, give me leave to assure you, Sir, that it 
will not only be a pleasure of a superior nature, but 
invariably my study, to render that correspondence 
as advantageous and agreeable as possible. Any in- 
telligence worth communicating, which first reaches 
me, shall be related with unreserved freedom, candor, 
and punctuality. And permit me to hope for a simi- 
lar treatment from your Excellency. Already my 
knowledge of your character leads me to anticipate 
infinite satisfaction. 

I cannot avoid mentioning, that the present aspect 
of our public affairs is particularly pleasing ; so much 
do we seem extricated from our perplexing difficul- 
ties, and such hope in the power and force of recent 
experience, that we shall not relapse into our former 
state of imbecility and distress. 

The events of the present campaign will no doubt 
fill the most brilliant pages in the history of America. 

* John Hanson, a Delegate from Maryland, Tvas elected President of 
Congress on the 5 th of November. 



440 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

May heaven still continue to smile on our efforts ! 
With the highest sentiments of respect and esteem, 
believe me to be, Sir, 

Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

John Hanson, President. 



FROM GOVERNOR CHITTENDEN. 
State of Yermont, Arlington, 14 November, 1781. 

Sir, 

The peculiar situation and circumstances, "svith which 
this State for several years last past has been attend- 
ed, induce me to address your Excellency on a sub- 
ject, which nearly concerns her interest, and may 
have its influence on the common cause of the States 
of America. 

Placing the highest confidence in your Excellency's 
patriotism in the cause of liberty, and disposition to 
do Cf^ual right and justice to every part of America, 
who have by arms supported their rights against the 
lawless power of Great Britain, I herein transmit the 
measures by which this State has conducted her po- 
licy for the security of her frontiers ; and, as the de- 
sign and end of it were set on foot, and have ever 
since been prosecuted, on an honorable principle (as 
the consequences will fully evince), I do it with full 
confidence that your Excellency will not improve it 
to the disadvantage of this truly patriotic, suffering 
State; although the substance has already been com- 
municated by Captain Ezra Heacock, employed by 
Major-General Lincoln, by your Excellency's particular 
direction, and who arrived here with the resolutions 
of Congress of the 7th day of August last, which ap- 
peared in some measure favorable to this State. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 441 

I then disclosed to Mm the measures this State 
had adopted for her security, which, I make no doubt, 
have by him been delivered to your Excellency ; and 
though I do not hesitate that you are well satisfied 
of the real attachment of the Government of this 
State to the common cause, I esteem it nevertheless 
my duty to this State, and the common cause at 
large, to lay before your Excellency, in writing, the 
heretofore critical situation of this State, and the 
management of its policy, that it may operate in your 
Excellency's mind as a barrier against the clamorous 
aspersions of its numerous, and in many instances 
potent adversaries. 

It is the misfortune of this State to join on the Pro- 
vince of Quebec and the waters of the Lake Chaplain, 
which affords an easy passage for the enemy to make 
a descent, with a formidable army, on its frontiers, 
and into the neighbourhood of the several States of 
New York, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts, who 
have severally laid claims in part, or in whole, to this 
State, and who have used every art which they could 
devise to divide her citizens, to set Congress against 
her, and finally to overturn the Government, and 
share its territory among them. The repeated appli- 
cations of this State to the Congress of the United 
States to be admitted into the Federal Union with 
them, upon the liberal principles of paying a just 
proportion of the expenses of the war with Great Bri- 
tain, have been rejected, and resolutions passed e:v 
parte tending to create schisms in the State, and 
thereby embarrass its efforts in raising men and money 
for the defence of her frontiers, and discountenancing 
the very existence of the State. Every article be- 
longing to the United States, even to pickaxes and 
spades, has been, by Continental Commissaries, order- 



442 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

ed out of tills State, at a time when she was erecting 
a line of forts on her frontiers. At the same time, 
the State of New York evacuated the post of Skenes- 
horough, for the avowed purpose of exposing this 
State to the ravages of the common enemy. 

The British officers in New York, being acquainted 
with the public disputes between this and the claim- 
ing States, and between Congress and this State, 
made overtures to General Allen in a letter, project- 
ing that Vermont should be a Colony under the Crown 
of England, endeavouring, at the same time, to draw 
the people of Vermont into their interest. The same 
day General Allen received this letter (which was in 
August, 1780), he laid it before me and my Council, 
who, under the critical circumstances of the State, 
advised that no answer, either oral or waitten, should 
be returned, and that the letter should be safely de- 
posited till further consideration, to which General 
Allen consented. A few months after, he received a 
second letter from the enemy, and the same Council 
advised that General Allen should send both letters 
to Congress, inclosed in a letter under his signature ; 
Avhich he did, in hopes that Congress would admit 
Vermont into the Union ; but they had not the desir- 
ed effect. 

In the fall of the year, 1780, the British made a 
descent up the Lake Champlain, and captured the 
Forts George and Anne, and appeared in force on the 
Lake. This occasioned the militia of this State, most 
generally, to go forth to defend it. Thus the militia 
were encamped against the enemy near six weeks, 
when General Allen received a flag from them, with 
an answer to my letter dated the preceding July to 
General Haldimand, on the subject of an exchange 
of prisoners. This flag delivered a letter to General 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 443 

Allen from the Commanding Officer of the enemy, 
who were then at Crown Point, with proposals for a 
trnce with the State of Vermont, during the nego- 
tiating the exchange of prisoners. General Allen sent 
back a flag of his to the Commanding Officer of the 
British, agreeing to the truce, provided he would ex- 
tend the same to the frontier posts of the State of 
New York; which was complied with, and a truce 
took place, which lasted about three weeks. It was 
chiefly owing to the military prowess of the militia of 
this State, and the including the State of New York 
in the truce, that Albany and Schenectady did not 
fall a sacrifice to the ambition of the enemy that 
campaign. 

Previous to the retiring of the enemy into winter- 
quarters, Colonel Allen and Major Fay were commis- 
sioned to negotiate the proposed exchange of prison- 
ers. They proceeded so far as to treat with the Bri- 
tish Commissioners on the subject of their mission, 
during which time they were interchangeably enter- 
tained with politics, which they treated in an affable 
manner, as I have been told. But no cartel was 
settled, and the campaign ended without the effusion 
of blood. 

The Cabinet Council, in the course of the succeed- 
ing winter, finding that the enemy in Canada were 
about seven thousand strong, and that Vermont must 
needs be their object the ensuing campaign, circular 
letters were therefore sent from the Supreme Execu- 
tive Authority of this State, to the claiming States 
before mentioned, demanding of them to relinquish 
their claims to this State, and inviting them to join 
in a solid Union and Confederation against the com- 
mon enemy. Letters were also sent to your Excel- 
lency, and to the States of Connecticul and Rhode 



444 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

Island. Each of these letters stated the extreme cir- 
cumstances of this State, and implored their aid and 
alliance, giving them withal to understand, that it 
was out of the power of this State to lay in maga- 
zines, and support a body of men, sufficient to defend 
this State against the force of the enemy. But to 
those letters there has been no manner of answer re- 
turned. 

From all which it appeared, that this State was 
devoted to destruction by the sword of the common 
enemy. It appeared to be the more unjustifiable, that 
the State of Vermont should be thus forsook, inas- 
much as her citizens struck the first offensive blow 
against British usurpation, by putting the Continent 
in possession of Ticonderoga, and more than two hun- 
dred pieces of cannon ; with Crown Point, St. John's, 
and all Lake Champlain; their exertions in defeating 
General Carleton in his attempts to raise the siege 
of St. John's ; their assisting in penetrating Canada ; 
their valor in the battles of Hubbardton, Bennington, 
and at the Landing, near Ticonderoga; assisting in 
the capture of General Burgoyne ; and by being the 
principal barrier against the power of the enemy in 
Canada ever since. 

That the citizens of this State have by nature an 
equal right to liberty and independency, with the 
citizens of America in general, cannot be disputed. 
And that they have merited it from the United States, 
by their exertions with them in bringing about the 
present glorious Revolution, is as evident a truth as 
any other, which respects the acquired right of any 
community. 

Generosity, merit, and gratitude, all conspire in 
vindicating the independence of Vermont. But not- 
withstanding the arguments, which have been exhi- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 445 

bited in sundry pamphlets in favor of Vermont, and 
which have been abundantly satisfactory to the im- 
partial part of mankind, it has been in the power of 
her external enemies to deprive her of union, confede- 
ration, or any equal advantage, in defending them- 
selves against the common enemy. 

The winter was thus spent in fruitless attempts to 
form alliances, but no advantages were procured in fa- 
vor of this State, except that Massachusetts withdrew 
her claim, on condition that the United States would 
concede the independence of Vermont ; but that, if 
they would not, they would have their snack at 
the south end of its territory. Still New York and 
New Hampshire were strenuously opposed to the in- 
dependence of Vermont ; and every stratagem in their 
power, to divide and subdivide her citizens, were ex- 
erted, imagining that their influence in Congress, and 
the certain destruction, as they supposed, of the in- 
habitants of this State by the common enemy, could 
not fail of finally accomplishing their wishes. 

In this juncture of affairs, the Cabinet of Vermont 
projected the extension of their claim of jurisdiction 
upon the States of New Hampshire and New York, 
as well to quiet some of their own internal divisions 
occasioned by the machinations of those two govern- 
ments, as to make them experience the evils of 
intestine broils, and strengthen this State against 
insult. The Legislature, accordingly, extended their 
jurisdiction to the eastward of Connecticut River to 
the old Mason line, and to the westward to Hudson's 
River; but, in the Articles of Union, referred the de- 
termination of tlie boundary lines of Vermont, and 
the respective claiming States, to the final decision 
of Congress, or such other tribunal as might be mu- 
tually agreed on by the contending Governments. 
VOL. III. 38 



446 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

These were the principal political movements of the 
last winter. 

The last campaign opening with a gloomy aspect 
to discerning citizens of this State, being destitute of 
adequate resources, and without any alliance, and 
from its local situation to Canada, obliged to encoun- 
ter the whole force of that Province, or give up its 
claim to independence and run away, — Vermont, be- 
ing thus driven to desperation by the injustice of 
those, who should have been her friends, was obliged 
to adopt policy in the room of poAver. And, on the 
1st day of May last, Colonel Ira Allen was sent to 
Canada to further negotiate the business of the ex- 
change of prisoners, who agreed on a time, place, and 
other particulars relating to the exchange. While he 
was transacting that business, he was treated with 
great politeness, and entertained with political matters, 
which necessity obliged him to humor, in that easy 
manner that might serve the interest of this State in 
its extreme critical situation, and that its consequences 
might not be injurious to the United States. The 
plan succeeded ; the frontiers of this State were not 
invaded ; and Lord George Germain's letter wrought 
upon Congress, and procured that from them, which 
the public virtue of this people could not. 

In the month of July last. Major Joseph Fay was 
sent to the British shipping, on Lake Champlain, who 
completed an exchange of a number of prisoners, who 
were delivered at Skenesborough in September last: 
at which time and place Colonel Allen and Major 
Fay had a conference with the British Commissioners. 
And no damage, as yet, had accrued to this or the 
United States from this quarter. And, in the month 
of October last, the enemy appeared in force at Crown 
Point and Ticonderoga ; but were manoeuvred out of 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 447 

their expedition, and are returned into winter-quar- 
ters in Canada, with great safety ; that it might be 
fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, "I will 
put my hook in their nose, and turn them back by 
the way which they came, and they shall not come 
into this city (alias, Vermont), saith the Lord." 

It remains that I congratulate your Excellency, and 
participate with you in the joy of your capturing the 
haughty Cornwallis and his army ; and assure your 
Excellency that there are no gentlemen in America 
who enjoy the glorious victor}'' more than the gentle- 
men of this State, and him who has the honor to 
subscribe himself your Excellency's devoted and 

Most humble servant, 

Thomas Chittenden. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Head-Quarters, 21 November, 1781. 

Sir, 
Your Excellency's letters of the 16th, 24th, and 
30th of October, containing an account of the opera- 
tions of the combined army, afford me the highest sa- 
tisfaction; and I beg leave to congratulate your Ex- 
cellency again upon this important and happy event. 
I contemplate its advantages with infinite satisfaction, 
and feel a relief upon the occasion that is difficult to 
express. Count Rochambeau's stay in Virginia, and 
the march of General St. Clair, if he arrives speedily, 
I am in hopes will place us upon an eligible footing. 
The reduction of Charleston is an event much to be 
wished ; but to be able to cover the country and 
confine the enemy to that place, will be a great ob- 
ject. However, I am not without my apprehensions 



448 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

that Sir Heniy Clinton will endeavour to push some 
vigorous operations in this quarter this "winter, to 
efface, if possible, their late losses, hoth here and in 
Virginia. General Leslie is arrived to take command 
here, and it is said reenforcernents are expected. I 
have sent one of my Aids to hasten the march of 
General St. Clair ; and, as Wilmington is evacuated, 
there is nothing to prevent an immediate junction. 
After which, if the enemv's reenforcernents are not 
very large, they shall purchase their advantages at 
an expensive rate. 

I would have made a return immediately of the 
prisoners of war in this department, but Major Hyrne, 
the Commissary of Prisoners, has lately met with an 
unhappy fall, which has disqualified him for business 
by disordering his understanding, from which I am 
not a little apprehensive he will never recover. As 
soon as it can be done by another hand, it shall be 
forwarded. But, before a general exchange is gone 
fully into, I wish something decisive may be done 
respecting Colonel Hayne. As retaliation necessarily 
involves the whole Continent, I wish your Excellen- 
cy's order, and the order of Congress, thereon. The 
latter have signified their approbation of the measures 
I took. But, as retaliation did not take place imme- 
diately, nor did I think myself at liberty on a mat- 
ter of such magnitude, but from the most pressing 
necessity, and as the enemy did not repeat the 
offence, I have been at a loss how to act with re- 
spect to the original, not having any officer of equal 
rank with Colonel Hayne in my possession. I am 
ready to execute whatever may be thought advisable. 
It would be happy for America if something could 
be done to put a stop to the practice of burning, 
both in the Northern States and here also ; and to 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 449 

prevent it liere, I wrote the enemy a letter on the 
subject, a copy of which I here inclose ; and, if they 
do not desist, I will put the war on the footing I 
mention. 

We are on our march for Four Holes. Colonel 
Mblark brought off upwards of eighty convalescent 
prisoners from one of the enemy's hospitals near Fair 
Lawn. These, and some small skirmishes of little 
consequence, and a few other prisoners, are all the 
changes which have taken place since my letters by 
Captain Pierce. I am happy that Wilmington is 
evacuated, as it leaves North Carolina perfectly at 
liberty to support this army and fill up their line. 
I am, with great respect and attachment, 

Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 

Nathanael Greene. 



FROM IklAJOR-GENERAL ST. CLAIR. 

Taylor's Feny, 26 November, 1781. 

Sir, 

On the 22d instant I arrived at Williamsborough, 
in North Carolina, to which place I had gone, in ad- 
vance of the troops (leaving them to be conducted 
from Petersburg by General Wayne), in order to 
settle the route it would be proper to pursue, and 
take the necessary measures for provisions. 

A report had prevailed for a day or two, that the 
enemy had evacuated Wilmington, and there I receiv- 
ed such information respecting it as left no manner 
of doubt of the fact, which happened on the 14th 
instant; two large ships, which lay in the mouth of 
Cape Fear River, having taken the garrison on board, 
which no doubt are gone to Charleston. This circum- 
38* 



450 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

stance leaves me at liberty to take the most direct 
way to join General Greene, whicli I shall do with 
as much expedition as possible, by Salisbury, Char- 
lotte, and Camden, which, though not absolutely the 
nearest route, is nevertheless, from the best informa- 
tion I have been able to procure, much the easiest 
and most plentiful, and by following which, time will 
be gained. As the eA^acuation would have taken 
place at all events, it is fortunate for the troops that 
it happened so early, as they would have been ex- 
posed to much difficulty in a march through a very 
barren country, intersected by many rivers that are 
not fordable. ^Vhether I should reckon it fortunate 
for myself or not, I am not so certain. But I am 
always satisfied with what produces any advantage to 
my country ; and another State being freed from the 
power of the enemy, is a circumstance of no little 
importance, at this juncture. It has also freed me 
from an uneasiness that hung upon my mind, that I 
might probably find them so posted as not to have 
it in my power to dislodge them, and be reduced to 
the alternative of an uncertain assault, or that of 
leaving them unmolested. 

Since I sat down to write, a letter has come to 
hand from Colonel Febiger, by which I am informed 
that I can expect no part of the Virginia troops, as 
they are not in a condition to be marched at present 
It also contains the copy of a letter, or memorial, 
from the officers to him, on their being made ac- 
quainted with the orders I had sent for immediately 
marching to this place all the men that were equip- 
ped, which I take the liberty to inclose. It is too 
true that they have reason for complaint; but it 
pains me that they should take such means and such 
an occasion to express it ; and I was much surprised 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 451 

to see Colonel Posey's name to the memorial. I have 
written to Colonel Febiger, and taken no notice of 
tlie receipt of his letter, desiring him to halt the 
detachment I had ordered, until the whole can be 
got in readiness to march together, as it is now too 
late for them to join me, and, from a change of cir- 
cumstances in North Carolina, not so necessary. With 
every sentiment of respect and esteem, I am. Sir, 
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

Arthur St. Clair. 



FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

29 November, 1781. 

My dear General, 

Inclosed you will find some numbers, a copy of 
which I have kept, and which contain some names 
that may probably occur in our correspondence. I 
need not tell you, my dear General, that I shall be 
happy in giving you every intelligence in my power, 
and reminding you of the most affectionate friend you 
can ever have. The goodness you had to take upon 
yourself the communicating to the Virginia army the 
approbation of Congress, appears much better to me 
than my writing to the scattered parts of the body I 
had the honor to command. Give me leave, my dear 
General, to recall to your memory the peculiar situa- 
tion of the troops, who, being already in Virginia, 
were deprived of the month's pay given to the others. 
Should it be possible to do something for them, it 
would give them great satisfaction. 

I will have the honor to write to you from Boston, 
my dear General, and should be very sorry to think 
this is my last letter. Accept, however, once more. 



* 

452 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

the homage of the respect and of the affection that 
render me forever, 

Your most obedient servant and tender friend, 

Lafayette.* 

P. S. I beg you will present my respects to Mrs. 
Washington, and my compliments to George and the 
family. Will you be so kind, my dear General, as to 
remember me to Mr. and Mrs. Morris ? 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL IRVINE. 

Fort Pitt, 2 December, 1781. 

Sir, 
At the time Congress directed me to repair to this 

* Lafayette had asked permission of Congress to return to France ; 
■whereupon the following resolves -were passed; — 

" Resolved, That Majoi'-General tha Marquis de Lafayette have per- 
mission to go to France, and that he return at such time as shall be 
most convenient to him; 

" That he be Informed, that, on a review of his conduct throughout 
the past campaign, and particularly during the period in Avhich he had 
the chief command In Virginia, the many new proofs which present 
themselves of his zealous attachment to the cause he has espoused, and 
of his judgment, vigilance, gallantry, and address In Its defence, have 
greatly added to the high opinion entertained by Congress of his merits 
and military talents ; 

" That he make known to the officers and troops, whom he com- 
manded during that period, that the brave and enterprising services 
with which they seconded his zeal and efibrts, and which enabled him 
to defeat the attempts of an enemy far superior In numbers, have 
been beheld by Congress with particular satisfaction and approbation ; 

" That the Secretary of Foreign AfHxIrs acquaint the Ministers Ple- 
nipotentiary of the United States, that it is the desire of Congress 
that they confer with the Marquis dc Lafayette, and avail themselves 
of his Information relative to the situation of public affairs In the Uni- 
ted States ; 

" That the Secretary for Foreign Affairs further acquaint the Minis- 
tcr Plenipotentiary at the Court of Versailles, that he will conform to 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 453 

place, I took for granted your Excellency would have 
information thereof through different channels ; and 
knowing how very particularly you were at that mo- 
ment engaged, I did not think proper to give unne- 
cessary trouble. This, I flatter myself, will excuse 
me to your Excellency for not writing sooner. Pre- 
vious to my arrival, Colonel Gibson had received 
your letter directing him to take the command, which 
was acquiesced in by Colonel Brodhead ; and things 
went on in the usual channel, except that the dis- 
pute occasioned Colonel Gibson's intended expedition 
against Sandusky being laid aside, and perhaps it 



the intention of Congress by consulting Avitli and employing the assist- 
ance of the IMarquis de Lafayette, in accelerating the supplies which 
may be alForded by his Most Christian Majesty for the use of the Uni- 
ted States ; 

" That the Superintendent of Finance, the Secretary for Foreign 
Affairs, and the Board of War, make such communications to the 
Marquis de Lafayette, touching the affairs of their respective depart- 
ments, as will best enable him to fulfil the jDurpose of the two reso- 
lutions immediately preceding ; 

" That the Superintendent of Finance take order for discharging the 
engagement entered into by the Marquis de Lafayette with the mer- 
chants of Baltimore, referred to in the act of the 24th of May last. 

" Ordered, That the Superintendent of Finance furnish the Marquis 
de Lafliyette with a proper conveyance to France; 

" That the Secretary for Foreign Affairs report a letter to his Most 
Christian Majesty, to be sent by the Marquis de Lafayette." 

When Lafayette was marching from the Head of Elk to Virginia, 
the citizens of Baltimore contributed very liberally to assist him in 
furnishing supplies of clothing to his troops. On the 24th of May, the 
following resolve, alluded to above, was passed; — 

" Resolved, That Congress entertain a just sense of the patriotic and 
timely exertions of the merchants of Baltimore, Avho so generously sup- 
plied the Marquis de Lafayette with about two thousand guineas, to 
enable him to forward the detachment under his command; 

"That the Marquis de Lafixyette be assured that Congress will take 
proper measures to discharge the engagements he has entered into with 
the merchants." 

See a letter from Lafayette, dated at Baltimore, April 18, 1781, in 
Washington's Writings, Vol. VUL p. 513. 



454 LETTERS TO AYASHINGTON. 

also prevented many other necessary arrangements. 
The examination of evidences, on the charoes aa;ainst 
Colonel Brodhead, are still taking, and I am informed 
will continue some weeks. 

Agreeably to my orders from Congress, to retain 
no more officers here than sufficient for the men, I 
have made the following arrangements. Reformed the 
remains of the late eighth Pennsylvania regiment into 
two companies, and call them a detachment from the 
Pennsylvania line, to be commanded by Lieutenant- 
Colonel Bayard. Baron Steuben had some time as-o 
directed Colonel Gibson to reform his regiment also 
into two companies, retaining with him the Staff of 
the regiment; and to send all the supernumerary 
officers dow^n into Virginia. The reformation w\is so 
made ; but the officers Avere so distressed, for want of 
clothing and other necessaries, that they were not 
able to proceed ; however they are now making exer- 
tions, and I hope will soon set out. I have ordered 
the supernumerary officers of the Pennsylvania line 
to repair forthwith to their proper regiments in the 
line. The whole of the troops, here, are thrown into 
four companies. I have been trying to economize ; 
but every thing is in so wretched a state, that there 
is very little in my power. I never saw troops cut 
so truly a deplorable, and at the same time despica- 
ble, a figure. Indeed, when I arrived, no man would 
believe, from their appearance, that they were sol- 
diers ; nay, it w^ould be difficult to determine whether 
they were ivldte men. Though they do not yet come 
up to my wishes, they are somewhat better. 

As it does not rest with me to decide on the pro- 
priety or impropriety of any person's conduct, I shall 
only make a few general observations. The consump- 
tion of public stores has, in my opinion, been enor- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 455 

mous ; particularly military stores. And I fear the rea- 
sons given for it will not be justifiable ; namely, that 
the militia would all fly, if they had not powder and 
lead given them, not only when in service, but also 
to keep in their houses. It is true, the County Lieu- 
tenants, and others who are called responsible men, 
have promised to be accountable; but I am certain, 
that not an ounce can ever be again collected. I 
find, by the returns, that near two thousand pounds 
of powder, and four thousand pounds of lead, have 
been issued to the militia since the dispute com- 
menced between Colonels Brodhead and Gibson, chiefly 
by orders of the former, beside arms, accoutrements, 
&c., and not a man called into actual service. The 
magazine is nearly exhausted. There is not now as 
much remaining as has been issued since the first of 
last September. 

I presume your Excellency has been informed by 
the Governor of Virginia, or General Clark, of the 
fiilure of his expedition. But lest that should not 
be the case, I will relate all the particulars that have 
come to my knowledge. Captain Craig, with the de- 
tachment of artillery under him, returned here the 
26th instant. He got up with much difficulty, and 
great fatigue to the men, being forty days on the 
way, occasioned by the lowness of the river. He 
was obliged to throw away his gun-carriages, but 
brought his pieces and best stores safe. He left 
General Clark at the Bapids ; and says the Ge- 
neral was not able to prosecute his intended plan 
of operation, for want of men, being able to collect, 
in the whole, only about seven hundred and fifty, 
and the buffalo meat was all rotten; and adds, the 
General is apprehensive of a visit from Detroit, and 
is not without fears the settlement will be obliged to 



456 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

break up, unless reenforcements soon arrive from Vir- 
ginia. The Indians have been so numerous in that 
country, that all the inhabitants have been obliged to 
keep close in forts, and the General could not venture 
out to fight them. 

A Colonel Lochrey, Lieutenant of Westmoreland 
county, in Pennsylvania, with about one hundred men 
in all, composed of volunteers, and a company raised 
by Pennsjdvania for the defence of said county, fol- 
lowed General Clark, who, 'tis said, ordered Lochrey 
to join him at the mouth of Miami, up which river 
it had previously been agreed on to proceed. But 
General Clark, haidng changed his plan, left a small 
party at Miami, with directions to Lochrey to pro- 
ceed on to the Falls after him, with the main body. 
Sundry accounts agree that this party, and all Loch- 
rey's, to a man, were waylaid by Indians and regulars 
(for it is asserted they had artillery), and all killed 
or taken. No man, however, escaped either to join 
General Clark or return home. When Captain Craig 
left the General, he could not be persuaded but that 
Lochre}^ with his party had returned home. These 
misfortunes throw the people of this country into the 
greatest consternation and almost despair, particularly 
Westmoreland county, Lochrey's party being all the 
best men of that frontier. At present they talk of 
flying early in spring to the eastern side of the 
mountain, and are daily flocking to me to inquire 
what support they may expect. 

I think there is but too much reason to fear that 
General Clark's and Colonel Gibson's expeditions fall- 
ing through, will greatly encourage the savages to 
fall on the country with double fury, or perhaps the 
British, from Detroit, to visit this post, which, instead 
of being in a tolerable state of defence, is in fact 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 457 

nothing but a heap of ruins. I need not inform 
your Excellency that it is, at best, but a bad situa- 
tion for defence. I have been viewing all the ground 
in this vicinity, and find none equal for a post to 
the mouth of Shirter's Creek, about four miles down 
the river. This was pointed out to me by Captain 
Hutchins before I left Philadelphia, who says there 
is no place equal to it anywhere Avithin forty miles 
of Fort Pitt. 

I think it best calculated on many accounts. First, 
the ground is such that works may be constructed to 
contain any number of men you please, from fifty to 
one thousand. It is by nature almost inaccessible on 
three sides, and on the fourth no commanding ground 
within three thousand yards. Secondly, as it would 
effectually cover the settlement on Shirter's Creek, 
the necessity of keeping a post at Fort Mcintosh 
will of course cease. In case of making that the 
main post. Fort Pitt should be demolished, all except 
the north bastion, on which a strong block-house 
should be built. A small party in it would as effect- 
ually keep up the communication with the settle- 
ments on Monongahela, as the whole garrison now 
does; for the necessary detachments to Fort Mcin- 
tosh, Wheeling, &c., so divide the troops, that no one 
place can ever be held without a large bod}^ of troops. 
Indeed, I do not like Fort Mcintosh being kept a 
post in the present situation of things. 

If the enemy from Detroit should take into their 
heads to make us a visit, that would be an excellent 
place for them to take by surprise; from whence 
they could send out Indians and other partisans to 
lay the whole country waste before we could dislodge 
them. We have (I think idly) too much of our 
stores there. I have been making efforts to bring 
VOL. III. 39 



458 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

up the greater part; but, thougli it is almost in- 
credible, yet 'tis true that, of all the public boats 
built here, not a single one was there to be found 
when I came here, except one barge and one flat. I 
expect two boats up, loaded, this day. It is, I be- 
lieve, universally agreed that the only way to keep 
Indians from harassing the country, is to visit them. 
But we find, by experience, that burning their empty 
towns has not the desired effect. Thev can soon 
build others. They must be followed up and beaten, 
or the British, whom they draw support from, totally 
driven out of their country. 

I believe, if Detroit was demolished, it would be 
a good step towards giving some, at least tempo- 
rary, ease to this country. It would take at least a 
whole summer to rebuild and establish themselves ; 
for, though we should succeed in reducing Detroit, I 
do not think there is the smallest probability of our 
being able to hold it; it is too remote from supplies. 
I have been endeaA'ouring to form some estimates; 
and, from such information as I can collect, I really 
think that the reduction of Detroit would not cost 
much more, nor take many more men than it will 
take to cover and protect the country by acting on 
the defensive. If I am well informed, it would take 
seven or eight hundred regular troops, and about a 
thousand militia; which number could pretty easily 
be obtained for that purpose, as it appears to be a 
favorite scheme over all this country. The principal 
difficulty would be to get provision and stores trans- 
ported. As to taking a heavy train of artillery, I 
fear it would not only be impracticable, but an in- 
cumbrance ; two field-pieces, some howitz, and perhaps 
a mortar. I do not think, especially under present 
circumstances, that it would be possible to carry on 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 459 

an expedition in sucli ti manner as to promise snccess 
by a regular siege. I would therefore propose to 
make every appearance of sitting down before the 
place, as if to reduce it by regular approaches ; as 
soon as I found the enemy fully impressed with tliis 
idea, attempt it at once by assault. 

I mean to write Congress for leave to go down the 
country in January, to return in March, if they make 
a point I should continue here. I can scarcely think 
they will wish me to remain with four companies of 
men. The power of calling out the militia of this 
country, is more ideal than real, especially till the 
lines between Virginia and Pennsylvania are deter- 
mined, and actually run. Neither civil nor military 
law will take place till then. Whether I am to be 
continued here or not, I am pretty certain it might 
be of use for me to go down, in order the better to 
concert measures proper to be taken, either with your 
Excellency or Congress ; for, as matters now stand, it 
is clear to me this country must be given up. The 
militia, however, promise pretty fair, and I have had 
no ground for differing with them yet. There is no 
provision laid in, nor is there even sufficient from day 
to day. The contract made by Mr. Morris for sup- 
plying this post, has not been fulfilled on the part of 
the contractor in any tolerable degree ; nor would the 
contract answer here, even if complied with. How- 
ever, as I must write particularly to the Board of 
War on this subject, and have exceeded moderate 
bounds for a letter, I fear I have already tired, and 
taken up too much of your Excellency's time. I have 
the honor to be, Sir, your Excellency's 

Most obedient and most humble servant, 

William Irvine. 



460 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

P. S. I have been told of three persons who were 
prisoners with the enemy, and have hitely made their 
escape. I have sent in search of them, hut coukl not 
find them out. The Lieutenant of Washington coun- 
ty has promised to bring one of them to me as soon 
as possible. If they have any material accounts, I shall 
inform your Excellency the earliest possible. They 
haA'e come from different places, and I am told all 
agree that great preparations are making to attack 
this country, at several places, at the same time. 
Speaking of prisoners, leads me to beg your Excel- 
lency's opinion or instructions respecting an exchange 
in this quarter, or a negotiation carried on with the 
Commander at Detroit. I find numbers of poor peo- 
ple are taken in this district ; some were taken at 
the commencement of the war, and are yet languish- 
ing in prison, in Canada, for they send all down to 
Quebec or JMontreal. I cannot learn that any attempt 
has ever been made, on either side, to exchange them. 

John Hynds and Myndat Fisher have both been 
confined here a whole year, and are under sentence 
of a Court-Martial. I request your Excellency's orders 
respecting them. I am informed the proceedings of 
the Court were sent to head-quarters a considerable 
time since. W. I. 



FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Alliance, off Boston, 21 December, 1781. 

My dear General, 

I am sorry to think we are not yet gone, and there 
remain still some doubts of our going to-morrow. 
This delay I lament, not so much on private accounts, 
as I do on the account of our next campaign, in the 
planning of which your opinion, as I shall deliver it, 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 461 

must be of the greatest use to the common cause. 
As to the department of Foreign Affairs, I shall be 
happy to justify the confidence of the Congress, by 
giving my opinion, to the best of my power, when- 
ever it is asked for. But the affair of finances will, 
I fear, be a difiicult point for the American Minister, 
in which, however, I shall be happy to help him with 
my utmost exertions. The moment I arrive in France, 
I will write to you minutely how things stand, and 
give you the best accounts in my power. 

I have received every mark of affection in Boston, 
and am much attached to this town, to which I owe 
so many obligations j but, from public considerations, 
I have been impatient to leave it and go on board 
the frigate, where I receive all possible civilities, but 
where I had rather be under sail than at anchor. 

I beg your pardon, my dear General, for giving 
you so much trouble in reading my scrawls ; but we 
are going to sail, and my last adieu I must dedicate 
to my beloved General. Adieu, my dear General. I 
know your heart so well, that I am sure that no 
distance can alter your attachment to me. With the 
same candor, I assure you that my love, my respect, 
my gratitude for you, are above expression ; that, at 
the moment of leaving you, I felt more than ever 
the strength of those friendly ties that forever bind 
me to you, and that I anticipate the pleasure, the 
most wished-for pleasure, to be again with you, and, 
by my zeal and services, to gratify the feelings of 
my respect and affection. AVill you be pleased to 
present my compliments and respects to Mrs. Wash- 
ington, and to remember me to General Knox and 
General Lincoln. Adieu, my dear General. • 
Your respectful and tender friend, 

Lafayette.

462 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM PHILIP SCHUYLER. 

Albany, 15 January, 1782. 

Dear Sir, 

Agreeably to your Excellency's order in August 
last, Brigadier-General Clinton left me a guard of one 
sergeant, one corporal, and eleven privates, chiefly 
aged and infirm men. He has lately ordered these 
to he reduced to a corporal's guard. It is now a 
notorious fact, that three parties have been expressly 
sent from Canada to take or put me to death. Cap- 
tain Brownson, lately returned from Canada, a Mr. 
Shephard, of Tryon county, a Mr- Mott of Sara- 
toga, and others who have made communications to 
the Commissioners for detecting conspiracies, all agree, 
that the British are determined to get me into their 
possession. The imprudence of the Commissioners for 
detecting conspiracies, to whom, in order to save a 
person em^Dloyed by me, I was under the necessity 
of communicating some secret matters, which have 
been divulged, has rendered the enemy's inveteracy 
still greater ; and I am persuaded that, even with my 
former guard, I shall run some risk both in person 
and property, and that, without such a one, I must 
remove myself and family to a place of greater secu- 
rity. I have, therefore, to entreat your Excellency 
the favor of an order to General Clinton, to recom- 
plete the guard, as he left it in August last. 

Yesterday, I received advice that the people on 
the Grants had generally assembled in town meet- 
ings, had declared their apprehensions that a criminal 
intercourse prevailed between some of their people 
and the British, and determined on an examination 
of the conduct of the suspected persons; and had, by 
a great majority of the towns, voted that a relin- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 463 

quisliment should be made of tlieir late extended 
claim, both on the east and west. The latter part of 
this intelligence is this moment confirmed to me, in 
such a manner that I have not a doubt remaining of 
its truth; and I have reason to believe that the for- 
mer part is not without foundation. With every wish, 
which affection and esteem can inspire, 

I am, my dear Sir, your obedient servant, 

Philip Schuyler. 



FROM GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Pouglikeepsie, 21 January, 1782. 

Dear Sir, 

Although you were pleased, on your leaving the 
State, to express a desire of hearing from me, I 
could not think myself justifiable in troubling your 
Excellency with a line during the campaign, when I 
was sensible every moment of your time must have 
been occupied in matters of the greatest moment, and 
more especially as my letters, in point of information, 
could have been little more than a repetition of what 
I was persuaded you must receive from the Com- 
manding Officer of the department, whose attention, I 
was convinced, would lead him to make the earliest 
communications. 1 flatter myself that my silence will 
not be imputed to want of respect, and that your 
Excellency will believe, that no one was more anx- 
iously concerned for your personal safety, and the suc- 
cess of your operations, than I was, or enjoys with 
greater pleasure the event so distinguishedly honora- 
ble to the allied arms. 

Induced by the situation of a number of the citi- 
zens of this State, who had been captured on the 



464 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

frontiers by ravaging parties of the enemy, and car- 
ried into Canada, I last spring addressed a line to 
Governor Haldiman, on the snbjeet of their liberation. 
I have lately been favored with his answer; and as 
in it he has taken occasion to introduce his objection 
to the exchange of prisoners taken in arms, I con- 
ceive it my duty to transmit to your Excellency co- 
pies of this correspondence, which you will find in- 
closed, in hopes, while in Philadelphia, your Excel- 
lency may be able to have such measures adopted as 
will obviate the difficulties which stand in the way 
of the exchange of our friends in that quarter, many 
of wdiom have already suffered a long and rigorous 
confinement. 

I lately transmitted to Congress two affidavits, prov- 
ing a traitorous correspondence between the leaders 
on the New Hampshire Grants, and the enemy ; and 
one of them, that an actual league of amity was set- 
tled between them ; which, I presume, have been com- 
municated to your Excellency. There are many other 
circumstances tending to establish the facts contained 
in those affidavits, which would be too tedious to re- 
late. The well-affected in this State, and I believe I 
may venture to say in some of the neighbouring 
States, begin to be exceedingly alarmed at their con- 
duct. Add to this, the violent and oppressive mea- 
sures pursued by them against some of the most re- 
spectable citizens, to support their late extension of 
jurisdiction, will, I am persuaded, before the opening 
of spring, occasion our having recourse to arms to op- 
pose their usurpations. I have the honor to be, with 
the highest respect and esteem. 

Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

Geokge Clinton. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 465 

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Head- Quarters, St. Paul's Parish, 21 January, 1782. 

Sir, 

Since I wrote your Excellency on the 9th of De- 
cember, I have been favored with your despatches 
of the IGth of November, 15th and 19tli of Decem- 
ber. My letter to Congress, a copy of which I in- 
close, will inform your Excellency "of the arrival of 
General St. Clair, with the Pennsylvania and Mar}^- 
land troops. The Virginia officers protested against 
marching until they got their pay, and are still in 
Virginia. Your Excellency's apprehensions were very 
right respecting the diminution of General St. Clair's 
command. The Virginia line left us at tlie same time 
the other came up, which leaves us little stronger 
than we were before. Some reenforcements have ar- 
rived lately from York ; it is said, near four hundred 
men. 

Through a good channel of intelligence I got in- 
formation of troops expected, both from Cork and 
New York. I was so alarmed at it, that I sent off 
Captain Ragsdale to Virginia, and Lieutenant-Colonel 
Stewart to North Carolina, to try to hasten on sup- 
port, and wrote to Count Rochambeau for a thousand 
men of his command. But, if more convenient, and 
consistent with the plan you and he had concerted, 
it would be still more agreeable for him to move 
with his whole force this way. Since I sent off those 
despatches, the Cork fleet arrived, without troops, ex- 
cept about sixty artillerymen. I am still under great 
apprehension of troops coming from New York, not- 
withstanding the flattering accounts your Excellency 
gave me. We are in a poor situation to contend with 



466 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

a very superior force. Our men are almost naked for 
want of overalls and shirts, and the greater part of 
the army harefoot. We have no rum, or prospect of 
any; none within four hundred miles of us, and little 
or none providing in Virginia ; and if there were 
ever so much there, the difficulty of transportation 
would prevent our getting it, as we were four weeks 
without ammunition since we have been in the lower 
country, and a plenty of this article waiting at Char- 
lotte for the means of transportation. Had the ene- 
my got knowledge, and availed themselves of our 
situation, they might have ruined us. 

I shall, agreeably to your Excellency's direction, 
transmit to the respective States an exact return of 
their troops; and I wish your representation may 
have the desired effect. But the States here have 
been so tardy as to regard representations little more 
than an idle dream or Eastern tale. Nor have I the 
least hopes of our difficulties lessening upon this 
head, until the powers of Congress are more exten- 
sive, and the subordination of the States better ac- 
knowledged. When any State can be made to feel 
an inconvenience from disobeying a requisition of 
Congress, then, and not till then, can we hope our 
measures will have vigor, and a combination of our 
force take place. We may write till we are blind, 
and the local policy of the States in perfect secu- 
rity, will counteract our wishes. From this very same 
source, I apprehend it impossible to establish matters 
of finance upon such a footing as to answer the pub- 
lic demands. If such of the States as refused or 
neglected to comply with the Congressional requisi- 
tions, were deprived of the liberty of trade, either 
foreign or domestic, out of their own State, it might 
serve to fix a little obligation to effect a compliance. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 467 

I perfectly agree "svitli your Excellency, that we 
should improve every moment this winter, to be in 
readiness to open the campaign to advantage. To be 
well prepared for war, is certainly the most likely 
way of procuring peace. I have recommended to 
this State to raise some black regiments. To fill up 
their regiments with whites is impracticable, and to 
get reenforcements from the northward, precarious, 
and at least difficult, from the prejudices respecting 
the climate. Some are for it, but the far greater 
part of the people are opposed to it. The Assembly 
are now sitting at Jacksonborough, four miles from 
our camp, on the other side of the Edisto. I am, 
with great respect, 

Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 

Nathanael Greene. 



FROM ROBERT MORRIS. 

Office of Finance, 26 January, 1782. 

Sir, 

I take this earliest opportunity of acknowledging 
your Excellency's letter of the 25th, which I received 
last evening, and in which you request me to have 
ready my letters to the officers you are sending to 
the Eastern States, so as that they ma}' go by the 
next post. I would willingly comply with your Ex- 
cellency's desire most literally, but I have rather 
wished to transmit my sentiments to you, that you 
may send them to the gentlemen, either in the whole 
or in part, as you shall think proper, and with such 
observations as may occur to you. 

Recruiting the army is certainly of importance, 
and ought therefore to be urged upon the several 



468 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

States ; but, sliould it be necessary to expend money 
for that purpose, it must not be considered as a part 
of the quota called for by Congress for the service 
of the current year. I shall make an application on 
this subject to Congress, and endeavour to have cer- 
tain principles established, by which those States who 
exert themselves to bring their quota of troops early 
into the field may have full justice done them, and 
those States which are negligent be charged in pro- 
portion to that negligence. I mention these things, 
Sir, to obviate mistakes, which might be productive 
of very evil consequences. You who, being on the 
spot, and knowing my situation and arrangements, are 
better informed than any person how necessary it is 
that the money called for from the several States 
be punctually i3aid, without any deduction whatever; 
you are, I am sure, convinced, that if my measures 
are obstructed, j^our own designs must prove abortive. 
And therefore you will, I am persuaded, take care to 
prevent an application of those funds to the recruit- 
ing service, which are necessary to the support and 
operation of those who are already enlisted. But as 
it ma}^ obviate those doubts, which are too apt to 
start in the minds of such gentlemen as compose the 
respective Legislatures, I repeat to jonv Excellency 
my assurance, that I will exert myself to have full 
justice done to those States who may bring their 
proportion of men into the field at an early period. 

Should you send officers who are now with the army, 
I expect that they will be able to give full informa- 
tion, from what they have seen of the benefits which 
result from the present mode of administration ; and 
I am sure that you are fully convinced of the supe- 
rior cheapness with which supplies are obtained from 
what they were formerly. In order, then, that the 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 469 

army may be well and cheaply maintained, it is ne- 
cessary that the States grant money. 

In considering the situation of the army, and com- 
paring the wants Avith the means of satisfying them, 
it became necessary for me to arrange those wants so 
that the relief in my power might be properly ex- 
tended. Feeding the army appeared to be an object 
of the first necessity ; clothing them was almost, if 
not altogether, as indispensable. After feeding and 
clothing them, the equipment for service demands at- 
tention, under which head must be classed the arms, 
ammunition, military stores, tents, camp equipage, and, 
in short, the whole of the Quarter-master's department. 
To the equipment for service succeeds the attention 
which is to be paid to the sick and wounded, an ob- 
ject in which justice and humanity combine most for- 
cibly together. The pay of the army must, of neces- 
sity, be placed last in this list j but though last, it is 
by no means least, in my mode of contemplating it. 
Your Excellency knows so well my solicitude on this 
subject, that it is unnecessary to mention it here. 
But I should ill deserve the high trust reposed in 
me, if I permitted any consideration to divert me 
from that line which reason points out as my duty 
to walk in. 

The officers you may employ on the present occa- 
sion, will. I am sure, be men of good sense and can- 
dor. They will, therefore, judge properly of my rea- 
sonings, and give them their due weight to others. 
I may, perhaps, have misarranged the w^ants of our 
army ; but I think not. It is, however, proper to ob- 
serve, that under the head of clothing I comprehend 
those means for clothing the officers, which I have 
now in contemplation, and had the honor of mention- 
ing to your Excellency. If I am right in my ideas 
VOL. III. 40 



470 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

as to what is the proper mode of applymg the pub- 
lic money, then every prudent officer will, instead of 
urging the States to grant a little money for the pur- 
pose of paying them, urge the grant of so much as 
■will support and equip the army, and still leave a 
sufficiency for the pay. To increase the means of 
payment by retrenching every other expenditure, is 
my constant object ; to increase the means of pay- 
ment by grant of money, the States alone are com- 
petent to. I hope, therefore, that the gentlemen you 
employ will join me in urging such grants, with all 
their force and abilities. 

It is from the same conviction which you feel of 
the advantages which must result to our country from 
an early and vigorous campaign, that I have spent 
money and stretched my credit to the utmost extent 
which I dare, in order that you might take the field 
at an early hour, and in a respectable manner. I 
have confided in the States, and the consequences of 
being deceived will be such that it is better you 
should conceive than I describe them. If they do 
not grant the sums called for by Congress, I cannot 
give that aid to 3'our operations which I know to be 
indispensably necessary. But if they do grant me 
those sums, I pledge myself to support you fully in 
all your views; and you shall then have the pleasure 
of seeing your brave troops as regularly paid as they 
are now fed; — and then, knowing them to be well 
appointed, and in all respects fit for service, you will 
be enabled to accomplish those plans for the defence 
and salvation of our country which lie nearest your 
heart. That this may be speedily the case, is the 
most fervent wish of your Excellency's 

Most obedient and humble servant, 

Robert Morris. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 471 

FROM COUNT DE ROCHAJVIBEAU. 

Williamsburg, 5 February, 1782. 

Sir, 

The legion of Lauzun had begmi to march, when 
very cold weather came on, and the ground was 
covered with snow six inches deep. As, by the intel- 
ligences I had from your Excellency, and those I got 
from the flag, it appears that the reenforcement from 
New York for Charleston does not exceed thirteen 
hundred men, I have not judged this rapid movement 
of the legion quite necessary, when, in these melted 
snows, all its equipments, both of horse and foot, 
would have been utterly spoiled; and therefore have 
ordered it into its quarters again, until the weather 
be milder. In the mean time, I hope I shall receive 
your Excellency's answer. 

The news I had from New York by the flag are, 
that all the men-of-war under sixty-four are gone, a 
month since, to join Admiral Hood ; that there re- 
main only at New York the Lion, commanded by 
Digby, some fifty and forty-gun ships, and several 
frigates. That is quite sufficient to keep the Romu- 
lus in awe. They brag, likewise, at New York, of an 
immediate large reenforcement from Ireland, with the 
same particulars of two regiments of dismounted dra- 
goons. Though I have not the least faith in it, I 
believe it would be necessary, before we come to 
any resolution, to know whether this storm will take 
its direction to the northward or towards the south. 
It is the same report which was spread in Charleston, 
and which has alarmed General Greene. 

As your Excellency's answer might be long coming, 
by reason of the rivers being full of floating ice, and 
of our not having had any intercourse with the North-

ern States this fortnight past, I have resolved to send 
back to New York all the convalescents, which it 
will be possible to assemble, that they may be ex- 
changed against our convalescents of the West India 
brigade, taken in the Bonetta. I believe it will be 
better for both to return among their countrymen, 
there to receive the assistance they stand in need of 
I am, with respect and personal attachment. Sir, 
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 

Le Compte de Hochambeau. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL IRVINE. 

Pbiladelpbia, 7 February, 1782. 

Sir, 

The present strength of the garrison at Fort Pitt 
is two hundred and thirty. At least thirty of these 
are unfit for field duty, and several, even garrison 
dut}^ From this number, detachments are made to 
garrison Forts Mcintosh and Wheeling, the first dis- 
tant thirty miles, the latter eighty. Fort Pitt is in a 
bad state for defence ; Fort Mcintosh, pretty easily re- 
paired. • If Fort Pitt were in the best state, the work 
is too extensive for less than a garrison of at least 
four hundred and fifty men, to make a tolerable de- 
fence. Fort Mcintosh would take one hundred and 
fifty to defend it properly, and be able to send pa- 
trolling parties towards Wheeling. 

Wheeling should have twenty-five or thirty men, 
and an equal number at some intermediate post. From 
Fort Pitt to the Laurel Hill, northwards, it woukl take 
two hundred men in actual service, from the first of 
April to the last of October, to guard that quarter 
from the incursions of the savages. By this arrange- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 473 

ment, it would take nine liundred and fifty men to 
act on the defensive tlie whole of the summer season. 
The number of militia in Washington county is said 
to he two thousand; in Westmoreland, one thousand. 
The inhabitants are dispirited, and talk much of mak- 
ing their escape early in the spring to the east side 
of the mountain, unless they see a prospect of sup- 
port. 

The Indians have all left us, except ten men ; and, 
by the best accounts, are preparing to make a stroke 
in the spring, either against General Clark, at the 
Rapids, or on Fort Pitt; which, my informant could 
not with certainty say, but was positive one or the 
other was intended. I am apprehensive, from the 
steps taken by the Commandant at Detroit, that some- 
thing serious is intended. First, thirteen nations of 
Indians have been treated with, in th« beo-innino- of 
November; at the conclusion, they were directed to 
keep themselves compact, and ready to assemble on 
short notice. Secondly, the Moravians are carried in- 
to captivity, and strictly watched, and threatened with 
severe punishment, if they should attempt to give us 
information of their movements. Thirdly, part of five 
nations are assembled at Sandusky. The Shawanese 
and lowas have settled nearer Detroit than formerly. 
There is no magazine of provision laid in at any of 
our posts, to hold out a siege ; ammunition exhausted ; 
no craft to transport materials for repairing the fort, 
or to keep up a communication with Fort Mcintosh 
or Wheeling, or to supply these posts with provision 
or stores, in case of exigence. 

To carry on an expedition against Detroit would 
take two thousand men, to give a tolerable certainty 
of success ; the time would be three months, and the 
best season to march from Fort Pitt, the 1st of Au- 

40=:=

gust. Then the waters are low; morasses, and soft, rich 
meadows dried up ; by land totally, preferable to any 
part by water, the enemy having entire command of 
the lake with armed vessels ; the navigation of rivers 
uncertain ; besides, the number of boats, and waste of 
time, would make it more expensive than land car- 
riage. Pack-horses to carry provision would be better 
and more certain than wagons ; but, as a road must 
be cut for artillery, the ammunition and military stores 
would be transported with greater facility and more 
safety in wagons. One thousand horses would carry 
flour for two thousand men for three months. Beef 
must be driven on foot. Twenty-five wagons would 
carry military stores sufficient for the train, which 
should consist of two twelve-pounders, two sixes, one 
three-pounder, one eight-inch howitzei", and one royal. 
At least one half should be regular troops. If it is 
necessary to keep half the number of troops to act 
on the defensive that it will to act offensively, and 
three months are sufficient to complete the expedition, 
then the only difference in the expense will be trans- 
portation of provision and stores; as acting on the de- 
fensive, seven months will be the least, and the same 
quantity of provision will be consumed, and ammuni- 
tion wasted. If we act offensively, it will draw the 
whole attention of the enemy to their own defence, 
by which our settlements will have peace; and such of 
the militia, as do not go on the expedition, will have 
time to raise crops. On the contrary, continual alarms 
will keep them from these necessary duties. The gar- 
rison at Detroit is three hundred regular troops, the 
militia (Canadians), from seven hundred to one thou- 
sand ; the number of Indians that could assemble in 
ten days' notice, to a certain point, about one thou- 
sand. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 475 

Query. Should we be able to take Detroit, shall 
we hold it ? If not, what advantage will the bare 
reduction of the place be of, if immediately evacuat- 
ed ? 

Answer. The reduction of Detroit, in the fall of 
the year, will prevent an intercourse with the Western 
Indians for a whole year, as it would be late in the 
succeeding summer before the British could reestablish 
themselves, during which time we might either open 
a trade with such savages as would ask for peace, or, 
by frequently penetrating into, and establishing posts 
in their country, oblige them to retire to such a dis- 
tance as would put it out of their power to harass 
the back inhabitants. It would be attended with 
great expense, and vast risk, to support a garrison at 
Detroit, as long as the British possess the lower part 
of Canada, and have the command of Lake Erie. 

The present garrison is too weak to repair the fort, 
and perform other necessary duties ; no cash to pay 
artificers ; the troops in bad temper for want of pay ; 
under very bad discipline; too long in one station, as 
they have formed such connections as make them te- 
nacious of the rights of citizens, while they at the 
same time retain all the vices common to a soldiery. 
What is contained in the foregoing report, is all that 
occurs to my memory at present, necessary to trou- 
ble your Excellency with. I have the honor to be, 
with perfect respect. Sir, 

Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

William Irvine. 



476 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 
Head Quarters, St. Paul's Parish, 7 February, 1782. 

Sir, 

Your Excellency's letter of the 29th of December, 
came to hand yesterday. The reenforcement you 
mention has not arrived, and I hope they are gone 
to another quarter. I got intelligence of the prepara- 
tion making in New York, and of the opinion of their 
being destined to Charleston. But whether they went 
to some other quarter, or the small reenforcement 
mentioned in my last was what gave rise to the re- 
port, I am unable to say. 

In your Excellency's instructions to correspond with 
Count Rochambeau, you did not tell me whether 
I was to request aid of him in cases of emergency. 
However, my apprehensions were so great, and the 
consequences appeared to me so fatal to this country, 
I made application, without hesitation ; and I should 
be glad to know your mind on the subject, by which 
I shall govern my conduct in future. I see little pros- 
pect of getting any reenforcements from Virginia, as 
will appear by the Governor's letter. The State con- 
ceive themselves ill-treated, and, however groundless 
it may be, it will operate greatly to our prejudice 
for a time. Colonel Carrington is gone to Congress, 
to represent several matters, which claim immediate 
attention. I Avish no disagreeable disputes may hap- 
pen from the present uneasiness and discontent pre- 
vailing in Virginia, from a persuasion that the North- 
ern States are treated with more delicacy than she 
is. I fear the Financier-General will have a hard 
task to steer clear of suspicions of partiality. Colo- 
nel Carrington will represent to your Excellency our 



THE AMERICAN EEVOLUTION. 477 

appreliensions of fixing the laboratory at Richmond, 
and our wishes for having it at New London. 

Inclosed are the returns of the Pennsylvania line, 
agreeably to your Excellency's direction. Those of 
Maryland and Delaware are transmitted to the Gover- 
nors of those States. That of Virginia shall be also 
sent, as soon as it can be had. The absence of Co- 
lonel White's regiment of dragoons in Georgia is the 
reason of its delay; however, the infintry of that 
State with this army amount to not more than sixty 
men. In a very few days I will have the honor of 
transmitting to you exact returns of the operating 
force serving under my command in the Southern de- 
partment. I am, with the greatest regard, 

Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 

Nathanael Greene. 



FROM COLONEL PICKERING. 

riiiladclphia, 8 February, 1782. 

Sir, 
I am honored with your Excellenc3^'s letter of this 
date respecting the preparations to be made for the 
next campaign. The reason of my stay at the North 
River I mentioned in my letter from thence. As 
soon as I obtained the returns in that quarter, I 
came away. A general return is forming, which, from 
the multiplicity of articles, will be voluminous; but, 
as soon as possible, I will complete and lay it before 
your Excellency. In the mean time, I beg leave to 
submit to your consideration some things which need 
not wait the completion of the return, but on which, 
from their nature and capital importance, an early 
decision seems requisite. 



478 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

On considering the mode most proper to be adopted 
in providing ox-teams for the ensuing campaign, the 
Secretary of War* and I were decidedly in favor of 
purchasing them. I have since formed the inclosed 
estimate, number One, showing the comparative ex- 
penses of hiring and purchasing the necessary num- 
ber of ox-teams, in which your Excellency will see 
on what foundation our opinion rested. Tents being 
the most expensive and essential articles of camp 
equipage, I extracted from the returns, then in my 
hands, the numbers on which we might rely for the 
ensuing campaign. The Secretary of War, on a cur- 
sory view, supposed these numbers would be suffi- 
cient. The same extract, a copy of Avhich, number 
Two, is inclosed, shows the state of the knapsacks, 
canteens, &c., at the times mentioned therein. On 
comparing this with my estimate of last year, I think 
nothing more needs be purchased, at least for the pre- 
sent, except knapsacks, canteens, and camp-kettles. 
I was apprehensive that the canteens at Boston, in 
September, might afterwards have been transported to 
Claverack, and they are an article so frequently lost 
and broken, I concluded with the Secretary of War, 
that six thousand more should be procured in Massa- 
chusetts, to be brought on by the teams raised for 
the army ; and I sent orders accordingly to my de- 
puty there by him. 

Number Three, is a return of the public boats in 
the North River. On the back of it I have noted 
the number and species of private vessels on the same 
river, and the amount of their tonnage. But, as they 
have run during the winter, and been ill-prepared, 
probably not more than half of them will be fit for 

* General Lincoln had been chosen Secretary of War, on the SOtli 
of October. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 479 

service tlie ensuing season. I procured this informa- 
tion, as I thought it might be of use, if a question 
should arise, whether the gun-boats and other public 
vessels there should be repaired. 

Number Four contains the terms on which Mr. 
Sheafe, the superintendent at Wappen's Creek, will 
perform the ship and boat\Yright's work therein men- 
tioned. Number Five is an estimate of a company 
of artificers, which I apprehend will be necessary in 
the main army the ensuing campaign. Should the 
operations of the army in the State of New York re- 
quire a greater number, I persuade myself it will 
be easy to engage them for the occasion. On the 
terms stated, I find the company can be raised. I 
left orders with the Commissary of Forage to form a 
magazine sufficient for the posts in the Highlands 
until the first of May, which, if the snow continues, 
I expect will be done. I have contracted with the 
smith at Newburg for all the smiths' work necessary 
for the main army during the next campaign, if I 
choose to continue the contract so long. Its continu- 
ance will, of course, depend on the aid which can be 
derived from the Superintendent of Finance. The 
terms are lower than any smiths in this city will en- 
gage on. It was the desire of the Secretary at War, 
that your Excellency's determination relative to the 
ox-teams, might be by me communicated to him be- 
fore he should leave Massachusetts. I have the honor 
to be, with the greatest respect, 

Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

Timothy Pickering. 



480 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM COLONEL LAURENS. 

Jacksonburg, 12 February, 1782. 

Dear General, 

I liave written a letter of this date to Cong-ress, 
inclosing one to me from Mr, Moses Young, my 
father's secretary, by which it appears that our Mi- 
nister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Versailles had 
not, so late as the 28th of tSeptemher, received offi- 
cial notice of the resolve of Congress for exchanging 
General Burgoyne. 

I likewise inclosed a letter from General Cornwal- 
lis, in which he assures me that all his influence will 
he exerted to effect an exchange between him and 
my father, provided I transmit to him an official pa- 
per, authorizing it on the part of Congress. I claim 
your Excellency's jDromise to interest yourself in a 
business, in which I feel so many powerful public 
and private motives. Your Excellency's friendship 
becomes the more necessary, as I am informed that 
the exchange of Cornwallis has been represented in 
Congress as impolitic, at the present juncture, on ac- 
count of his talents and influence. TJie former can 
excite no apprehension in my mind, while the Ameri- 
can army continues under its present auspices. With 
regard to the latter, which some allege would extend 
to securing a reenforcement and a continuance of 
the war, it appears to me that the credit of no 
one individual would tempt the British Ministry, at 
the present period, to carry their views beyond a 
vigorous effort for the recovery of Georgia and South 
Carolina. This appears to me to be the best plan 
they can propose to themselves, and in the execution 
of it they must employ all their means, let who will 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 481 

command their army. Their most sanguine hopes 
cannot lead them beyond a truce or a treaty upon 
the footing of uti possidetis, they retaining the two 
States above mentioned. As this object will require 
all the military exertions they can possibly make, 
and the aid of every political intrigue, I do not 
think one General OjQQcer would bring out a larger 
reenforcement than another. 

These being my sentiments, I apply with confidence 
to your Excellency, and beg leave to solicit, in the 
most earnest terms, your friendly attention to my 
father's circumstances. The continuance of a loath- 
some imprisonment, in which he is excluded from the 
converse or correspondence of his friends, and labors 
under every illiberal restriction that his mean-spirited, 
tyrannical persecutors can invent, may, at his ad- 
vanced age, prove fatal. Considering the perseverance 
of the British Ministry in their absurd pretensions, it 
is probable that an exchange w"Ould be more readily 
effected under your immediate authority than by the 
intervention of Congress ; and perhaps there are other 
officers, besides Cornwallis, whom the British would be 
glad to receive in exchange for my father. 

I entreat your Excellency's pardon for troubling 
you with this tedious epistle; but my distress for a 
parent, whom I love almost to adoration, and your 
Excellency's goodness, will form an excuse for me. 
I beg your Excellenc}^ will accept the sincere and 
repeated assurances of veneration and attachment with 
which I am invariably, dear General, 

Your most obedient servant, ' 

John Laurens.

482 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM GOVERNOR HARRISON. 

Richmond, 15 February, 1782. 

My dear Sir, 

My sincerest thanks to you for your friendly con- 
gratulations on my promotion to the Government. 
Indeed, my friend, if you knew my true situation, 
and that of this country, you would rather condole 
with me. When I accepted the appointment, I knew 
I had innumerable difficulties to encounter; yet I un- 
dertook the task with the hope of surmounting them, 
not with a view of serving myself For there is no- 
thing to be got by it in the best of times; but in 
these, certain loss will attend it. I meant to serve 
the State, and the common cause. I had vanity 
enough to think I could do this better than those 
who were opposed to me. But my hopes and ex- 
pectations are all blasted by the conduct of the As- 
sembly. What powers there were in the Executive 
are done away, and restrictions substituted in their 
room. Much is required of me, and no means left 
of doino" even little. The eves of the world are fixed 
on me ; it knows not my situation and embarrass- 
ments, and therefore expects much. When disappoint- 
ment takes place, what reputation I had gained, I 
may say by a life of public services, will be lost ; nay 
more, I shall be brought even into contempt. I feel 
this in every nerve ; it tingles in every vein, and al- 
most destroys the very faculty of thinking, whenever 
I begin to contemplate the subject. 

As this is a melancholy theme, at least to me, I 
will quit it, but not before I tell you, however situ- 
ated, I will not let despondency overwhelm me; but 
will endeavour to merit applause if I cannot attain 
it. The Assembly had risen long before your favor 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 483 

got to hand, and they will not meet again till the 
first Monday in May next. My endeavours shall not 
be wanting to stimulate them to raise the men re- 
quired by Congress. I think they may be had, with 
money and clothes. But as to the money demanded, 
assure yourself it is absolutely impossible ; there is 
not half the sum in the State. 

I have adopted a mode of my own to endeavour 
to procure men, by calling on the principal persons 
in each county to open a subscription for a sum to 
furnish the bounty, for which they are to have cre- 
dit in their taxes, with an allowance of interest at 
the rate of ten per cent, per annum for the time it 
shall be advanced. I expect some good from it, 
though, I confess, not a great deal. When I was in 
Philadelphia, I negotiated a loan to the State of a 
variety of clothing, &c., with the Chevalier Luzerne. 
The King of France has nobly complied with my re- 
quest, and I expect we shall have them in three or 
four months. But, as the regulations of Congress now 
stand, if we put them on the backs of our soldiers, 
we are not to have credit for them out of the monev 
demanded from us. This I think strange, and wish 
an alteration ; but would not desire, by any means, 
that Congress should be made acquainted with the 
circumstances of the loan. I suppose I shall be told, 
if I deliver them to the Financier's order I shall get 
credit ; but this I never can agree to, as, in that 
case, our poor fellows would never see them. I think 
they have not received any thing of the kind from 
the Continent since they went to the southward, as 
about three or four hundred of them returned, the 
other day, almost naked. This has so frequently been 
the case, that I am confident it is one great cause of 
the difficulty we find in raising men; for, when the 



484 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

subject of clothes is mentioned to a young fellow, he 
instantly points out several that have returned almost 
naked. 

How comes it about that I see contracts advertised 
for, to feed the troops from Boston to Maryland, in- 
clusive, and no attempt of the sort made to the 
southward ? Scan this matter, my friend, and tell me 
if there is not partiality in this. You may depend, 
if the same steps are not taken here that are taken 
in other States, it will create great disturbance. This 
Government has not the means of furnishing troops, 
and, therefore, must be assisted till it can. You will 
see, by the inclosed, the situation of the British sick 
in Gloucester. ' We have taken no step in it yet, nor 
can do any thing till we see the Continental Com- 
missary. I expect he will tell us he has no means, 
and I am sure we have so little that much cannot 
be expected. I, from my heart, pity the poor fellows, 
and will do what I can for their relief General Nel- 
son's resignation was occasioned by ill health ; at least 
this was the reason he gave, though I think this was 
not the only one. He met with very unmerited treat- 
ment in many instances. I am, my dear Sir, with 
every sentiment of esteem and friendship, 

Your most obedient and most humble servant, 

Benjamin Harrison. 



FROM COLONEL PICKERING. 

Philadelpliia, 23 February, 1782. 



Sir, 

I was yesterday honored with your Excellency's 
letter of the 21st, to the several directions in which 
I shall pay due attention. Yesterday I received a 



THE AMERICAN KEVOLUTION. 485 

letter from Major Clairborne, dated the 12th instant, 
informing me that the two expresses, stationed at 
Bowling Green, had left it some days for want of 
supiDort. As Colonel Carrington had comprehended, in 
his estimate for Virginia, one charge for expresses, I 
have desired him to ask Mr. Morris for authority to 
engage actual payment, and then immediately to write 
Major Clairborne to replace and firmly fix the ex- 
presses, W'hom Colonel Carrington will pay on his re- 
turn to Virginia. I will also apply for the INIaryland 
district, and enable Mr. Yeates to keep his chain 
complete. 

Your Excellency advised that the ox-teams should 
be assembled by the middle of May last year. I 
would request your direction for the present year on 
this head. The longer their assembling is delayed, 
consistent with the expected operations, the better, 
on account of the pasturage, which, by the middle of 
May, is hardly sufficient for the support of the cattle. 
It is of importance, too, to preserve, as long as possi- 
ble, all the forage in the vicinity of the army. I 
have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, 
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

Timothy Pickering. 



FROM COUNT DE ROCHAMBEAU. 

Williamsburg, 27 February, 1782. 

Sm, 

I have received your Excellency's letter of the 9th 
instant, brought by Colonel Robert Dillon. The le- 
gion de Lauzun by this time must be arrived at 
Charlotte Court-House. It will be needful that it 
stay there some time, because the men are almost 



486 



LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 



quite naked, and I shall forward them their clothing 
which I expect from Boston, as well as that of all 
the army, as soon as possibly can be done after its 
arrival. In these circumstances, I have not thought 
fit to empower M. de Choisy to proceed further, be- 
cause, on one part, I feared that the requests for that 
movement might not be absolutely necessary, and on 
the other part, I knew too well the ardor and desire 
of going forward, and to be detached from the main 
bod}^, which is natural to our nation. I am here at 
hand to send them orders relative to the intelligence, 
w^hich they will send me from General Greene's ar- 
my, if the circumstances were so urgent as to render 
their march absolutely necessary. About eight days 
ago, several detachments of different southern regi- 
ments, amounting to five hundred men, marched to- 
wards that army. In a little excursion I made in 
the heart of the State, I have seen Colonel Ar- 
mand's legion, at Charlottesville. It will be ready in 
a month, if sixty horses, which he expects from Phila- 
delphia, arrive. If your Excellency does not hurry 
the assembling of the reenforcements, which this 
State is to furnish to General Greene's army, I think 
I ought to let you know, that the Assembly has 
broken up without resolving any thing, or furnishing 
the means of recruiting ; so that it should seem, that 
Virginia, the present moment, looks on itself as in 
possession of peace. 

The privateers are become very bold since the loss 
of the Diligente ; some are entered the Bay. The 
Sybille is gone out to chase them. I presume that, 
before long, we shall receive from France a plan of 
next campaign. In that case, I think it would be 
very necessary that we should have a conference to- 
gether. I am confident your Excellency would not 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 487 

be against seeing Mount Vernon, your agreeable seat. 
If convenient, it should be our place of rendezvous, 
as the most suitable place, 

I am very sensible to your Excellency's attention 
about the engraving of the field-pieces which you 
destine for me. I do not look upon them as very 
urgent to be delivered ; and I think it would be most 
'suitable to keep them at Philadelphia, whence Mr. 
Morris might send them to France when peace is 
made. They might be transported to Nantes, whence, 
by going up the river as far as Tours, I would get 
them carried to Rochambeau, which is only twelve 
leagues distant from that city. I am, with respect 
and personal attachment. Sir, 

Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 

Le Compte de Rochambeau. 

P. S. I think the Chevalier de la Luzerne must, 
by this time, be on the road to come here ; if he is 
not, I beg you would tell him to have no uneasiness 
about the privateers, because M. de la Villebrune will 
take care to see him carried safely over. 



FROM COLONEL HAMILTON. 

[Philadelphia, 1 ]\Iarch, 1782.] 

Sir, 
I need not observe to your Excellency, that re- 
spect for the opinion of Congress will not permit me 
to be indifferent to the impressions they may receive 
of my conduct. On this principle, though I do not 
think the subject of the inclosed letter of sufficient 
importance to request an official communication of it. 



488 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

yet I should be happy it might in some way be 
known to the members of that honorable body. 

Should they hereafter learn that, though retained on 
the list of their officers, I am not in the execution of 
the duties of my station, I wish them to be sensible 
that it is not a diminution of zeal which induces me 
voluntarily to withdraw my services, but that I onh' 
refrain from intruding them, when circumstances seem 
to have made them either not necessary or not de- 
sired, and that I shall not receive emoluments with- 
out performing the conditions to which they were 
annexed. I also wish them to be apprised upon what 
footing my future continuance in the army is placed, 
that they may judge how far it is expedient to per- 
mit it. I therefore take the liberty to request the 
favor of your Excellency to impart the knowledge of 
my situation in such manner as you think most con- 
venient. I have the honor to be, with perfect re- 
spect, your Excellency's 

Most obedient and humble servant, 

Alexander Hamilton. 



FROM COLONEL HAMILTON. 

Philadeli^liia, 1 March, 1782. 

Sir, 
Your Excellency will, I am persuaded, readily ad- 
mit the force of this sentiment, that though it is the 
duty of a good citizen to devote his services to the 
public, Avhen it has occasion for them, he cannot, 
with propriety or delicacy to himself, obtrude them, 
when it either has, or appears to have, none. The 
difficulties I experienced last campaign in obtaining 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 489 

a command, will not suffer me to make any further 
application on that head. 

As I have many reasons to consider my being em- 
ployed hereafter in a precarious light, the bare possi- 
bility of rendering an equivalent will not justify to 
my scruples the receiving any future emoluments 
from my commission. I therefore renounce, from this 
time, all claim to the compensations attached to my 
military station during the war, or after it. But I 
have motives which will not permit me to resolve on 
a total resignation. I sincerely hope a prosperous 
train of affairs may continue to make it no inconve- 
nience to decline the services of persons whose zeal, 
in worse times, was found not altogether useless; but, 
as the most j)romising appearances are often reversed 
by unforeseen disasters, and as unfortunate events 
may again make the same zeal of some value, I am 
unwilling to put it out of my power to renew my 
exertions in the common cause in the line in which 
I have hitherto acted. I shall accordingly retain my 
rank while I am permitted to do it, and take this 
opportunity to declare, that I shall be at all times 
[ready] to obey the call of the public, in any capa- 
city, civil or military (consistent with w^hat I owe to 
myself), in which there may be a prospect of my 
contributing to the final attainment of the object for 
which I embarked in the service. I have the honor 
to be, very respectfully. 

Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

Alexander Hamilton. 



490 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Head-Quarters, Ponpon, 9 March, 1782. 

Sir, 

I wrote your Excellency the 8th of February, since 
which I am without your favors. In my last, I in- 
formed you that I had written to Count Rochambeau 
for reenforcements. Inclosed is his answer. I am 
persuaded he must have mistaken your intentions. I 
find nothing is to be expected from that quarter. I 
am sorry the legion was put in motion, as it may 
raise the enemy's apprehensions, and bring upon us 
reenforcements, which might not have been otherwise 
sent, at least so soon. 

Your Excellency will see by the King's speech, and 
other measures taking in Great Britain, the enemy 
are determined to prosecute the warj and from the 
Dean of Gloucester's plan of pacification, and other 
Parliamentary debates, there can hardly be a doubt 
of the operations being principally to the southward. 
You will also see, by the returns inclosed, how in- 
competent our force is to any great operation. The 
country is naturally weak, and greatly reduced by the 
ravages of intestine disputes between the Whigs and 
Tories. We are remote from support and supplies of 
every kind; no large bodies of militia can be hastily 
called together here, nor can supplies of any kind be 
had but with the greatest difiiculty. We have three 
hundred men now without arms, and twice that num- 
ber so naked as to be unfit for any duty, but in 
cases of desperation. Not a rag of clothing has ar- 
rived to us this winter. Indeed, our prospects are 
really deplorable. It is true we get meat and rice, 
but no rum or spirits. Men and officers without pay, 



THE AMEKICAN REVOLUTION. 491 

in this situation, cannot be kept in temper long. I 
will not trouble you with a detail of all our diffi- 
culties. They would be too troublesome to enumerate; 
but I cannot but apprehend for a country so badly 
supported, and naturally so weak and helpless. I 
persuaded the Legislature to raise black regiments, 
but could not prevail; not because they objected to 
the expense (for they give a most enormous bounty 
for white men, and pay in slaves), but from an ap- 
prehension of the consequences. 

It has always been my opinion that, if we could 
support the extremes of the Confederation, the middle 
States would always support themselves. Upon this 
principle, I have ever been anxious to get a force to 
the southward, so formidable as to discourage the ene- 
my from attempting their reduction. There is no 
way to effect this, but to render their subjection so 
difficult and expensive as to make the value less 
than the trouble and expense. All the Southern 
States look to you for support. I will do all I can, 
and you know me too well to suppose I shall shrink 
at small difficulties. But how feeble are the best 
intentions, and hoAV vain an obstinate perseverance 
against a very unequal force ! 

The enemy have been out latel}^, in considerable 
force, in St. Thomas's. They routed General Marion's 
command, and killed, took, and wounded, upwards of 
twenty men. They have not ventured out on our 
side, although the Assembly have been sitting within 
thirty miles of town, and the enemy a much greater 
force than we have, which induces me to believe they 
have orders not to risk a general action. General 
Waj^ne has burnt all the enemy's forage, close under 
their noses at Savannah. I am improving every mo- 
ment in disciplining and managing the troops, that 



492 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

tliey may be in the best condition for whatever may 
happen. But, alas ! we no sooner get our men to- 
lerably well acquainted with their duty, than their 
term of service expires, and they leave us, and often 
without others to supply their places. I am, Avith 
gi'eat respect. 

Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 

Nathanael Greene. 



FROM GOVERNOR CHITTENDEN. 

Arlington, IG March, 1782. 

Sir, 

I had the honor to receive your Excellency's fa- 
vor of the 1st of January by express. I am not in- 
sensible that the delicacy of your station in the em- 
pire renders it ineligible for you to address me in 
my public character. Your noticing us, therefore, in 
your private capacity, under our circumstances, I beg 
leave to esteem as the strongest mark of your mag- 
nanimity and friendship. 

While we receive with gratitude the resolves of 
Congress, of the 7th and 21st of August last, it af- 
fords us great satisfaction that your Excellency is 
willing to consider them as implying the right, which 
Vermont claims, to be a State, within certain describ- 
ed bounds. And, as the dispute of boundary is the 
only one that hath prevented our union with the Con- 
federacy, I am very happy in being able to acquaint 
your Excellency that that is now removed on our 
part, by our withdrawing our claims upon New Hamp- 
shire and New York, and by confining ourselves sole- 
ly, or very nearly, to that tract of country which is 
described in the resolve of Congress of the 21st of 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 493 

August last. Since, therefore, we have withdrawn our 
jurisdiction to the confines of our old limits, we en- 
tertain the highest expectations that we shall soon ob- 
tain what we have so long been seeking after, an 
acknowledgment of independence and sovereignty. 
For this we have appointed Commissioners, with ple- 
nary powers to negotiate an alliance with the Con- 
federated States, and, if they succeed, to take seats 
in Congress. 

Should Heaven prosper the design of their negoti- 
ation, we please ourselves much that we, who are of 
one sentiment in the common cause, and who have 
but one common interest, shall yet become one nation, 
and yet be great and happy. The glory of America 
is our glory, and with our country we mean to live 
or die, as her fate shall be. 

I have no need to acquaint your Excellency, that 
our local as well as our military (not to say political) 
situation, as an extended frontier, awfully exposeth 
these infant plantations to the power and fury of the 
common enemy. Might we be so happy as to draw 
the attention of our country, we hope to be favored 
with your particular exertion. I have the honor to 
be. Sir, with great respect. 

Your most obedient and humble servant, 

Thomas Chittenden. 

P. S. This will be delivered by one of our agents, 
to whom I beg leave to refer your Excellency for 
the more particular situation of this State, with re- 
gard to military preparations and state of defence. 



VOL. III. 42 



494 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM THOMAS PAINE. 

Philadelpliia, 17 Marcli, 1782. 

Sir, 

You will do me a great deal of pleasure, if you 
can make it convenient to yourself to spend part of 
an evening at my apartments, and eat a few oj^sters, 
or a crust of bread and cheese ; for, besides the favor 
you will do me, I want much to consult with you on 
a matter of public business, though of a secret nature, 
which I have alread}^ mentioned to ]Mr. Morris, whom 
I likewise intend to ask, as soon as yourself shall 
please to mention the evening when. 

Though it is impossible to find out what the Bri- 
tish will do by finding what they ought to do, yet 
I have been turning over in my mind the circum- 
stances connected with the probable evacuation of 
Charleston, in order to come at their line of policy 
on that measure ; and, as it is a rainy morning, with 
no inducement to go out, and I am sitting at leisure, 
I will take the liberty of communicating them to you. 

First. The foundation of the measure, as well as of 
the (now) general opinion, is, that, if they cannot re- 
enforce, they must evacuate. 

Secondly. That being a Ministerial post. General 
Clinton must wait either for positive or discretionary 
orders. 

Thirdly. That, as it is now a losing game, I am 
much inclined to believe the Ministry will only give 
discretionary orders. 

Fourthly. That, as Clinton sees the Ministry are 
pushing the matter o£f their own shoulders on him, 
he has likewise pushed it from himself upon a Coun- 
cil of War; and this I take to have been the subject 
of debate, and not whether New York or Charleston 



THE AMERICAN EEVOLUTION. 495 

should be evacuated, as mentioned in General Heath's 
information. 

Fifthly. That orders to prepare for evacuation have 
been sent, and probably have been accompanied with 
instructions not to do it till further orders, unless the 
Commanding Officer at Charleston sees necessity. 

Sixthly. But, Avhile these matters were acting, a 
new circumstance has arisen, not at that time known, 
which is the miscarriage of Count de Guichen (whose 
sailing probably produced, in a principal degree, the 
discretionary instructions from the Ministry), and the 
sailing of Admiral Rodney, by which he will be first 
in the West Indies ; and as Charleston will, from these 
two events, be safe for a longer time, I think it is 
probable that the evacuation will be delayed. 

Now all this reasoning may be wrong, because they 
act without reason. I am your Excellency's 
Obliged and obedient, humble servant, 

Thomas Paine.='='

American cause, as appears by the following agreement.

of considerable utility to the common cause by several of his publica-

United States, that Mr. Paine be engaged in their service for the pur- 
poses above mentioned. They have thei'cfore agreed that Mr. Paine be 
offered a salary of eight hundred dollars per annum, and that the same

496 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL KNOX AND GOUVERNEUR MORRIS.* 

Elizabethtown, 29 March, 1782. 

Sir, 

Colonel Smith delivered your Excellency's letter 
of the 28th, between four and five yesterday after- 
noon. You mention having had intimations that, un- 
der the idea of the cessation of hostilities, a number 
of people . intend to come over from New York to 
our lines ; and express your particular desire, that 
no persons coming from the enemy may be permit- 
ted to land, except the Commissioners and those im- 
mediately connected with them. The bad weather 
of yesterday prevented those gentlemen from coming 
hither, and we expect them to-day. We have de- 
sired Captain Dayton to suffer no persons to land, 
except those who come in the vessel with the Com- 
missioners ; presuming that this is the best line of 
distinction wdiich can at present be drawn. 

We are much inclined to doubt the truth of the 
information your Excellency has received. The situa- 
tion of the enemy is such as would naturally induce 
caution in permitting persons to come hither, whose 
discretion, as well as fidelity, they are not perfectly 
assured of And when our relative circumstances are 
considered, it must be evident that a reciprocal com- 
munication would probably preponderate in our favor. 
Facts, as far as they have come to our knowdedge, 
justify this reasoning; and there is an additional force 

* General Knox and Mr. Morris were appointed Commissioners for 
tlie purpose of agreeing upon an exchange of prisoners, and settling the 
accounts with the enemy for the support of prisoners. They were to 
meet British Commissioners at Elizabethtown. See their instructions in 
Washington's Writings, Vol. VIII. p. 249. The British Commissioners 
were General Dalrymple and Mr. Andrew Elliot.

derived to it, from the consideration that they have 
had, and (until regulations are made, which neither 
Congress nor their servants are entirely competent 
to) will have, a constant intercourse with this coun- 
try, while we cannot derive that benefit from it which 
we now may, by having here characters in whom we 
can confide, such as Colonel Ogden. 

There are several persons, whom we may perhaps 
see here, and whom it is of infinite importance to 
see ; but who would be suspected on admittance, 
after a strong line of discrimination had been drawn. 
We have, for instance, a strong probability of gaining 
some of the enemy's pilots. One of the best of them, 
whose name is JNIorris, was unfortunately taken pri- 
soner the day before yesterday, and will come from 
Brunswick this day. On the whole, we beg leave to 
submit it to your Excellency, whether it might not 
be better to wink at an intercourse from which we 
may now derive benefit, and which will at other times 
subsist to our prejudice. If, however, your Excel- 
lency should be of a different opinion, we will rigidly 
comply with your wishes as far as possibly we ca,n. 
We shall write to your Excellency upon the other 
subjects of your letter by Colonel Smith, who will 
wait here for the purpose. We have the honor to 
be, with great respect, your Excellency's

LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 



Sm^ 



FROM THE CHEVALIER DE LA LUZERNE. 

(Translation.) 

Philadelphia, 13 April, 1782. 



I embrace the first moment after my return from 
Virginia; to comply with the request of the principal 
officers of our army in tendering you their sincere re- 
spects. I have already forwarded to your Excellency 
a letter from Count de Rochambeau. On my return 
here, I found letters from my Court, dated in Febru- 
ary last. They do not announce any thing pacific on 
the part of our enemies. No progress is made in the 
mediation of the Courts of Vienna and Petersburg ; 
and the Court of London seems determined to risk 
the event of another campaign, in which they will 
employ all the strength they have left. The j)lan 
for the campaign was not yet finally decided ; it de- 
pending on some arrangements which were yet to be 
made with the Court of Madrid, and on some advices 
which were expected from the Antilles. It neverthe- 
less seemed to be the intention to act vigorously for 
the assistance of the United States; and thougli no 
particular assurances could be given me on this head, 
yet, from what they write me, it is probable that 
New York or Charleston, or perhaps both, will be 
the object of their efforts next campaign. 

I think it, however, proper to inform you that, at 
the same time they announce to me their general 
views, they observe that it is an unhappy circum- 
stance that the American army is so weak as it is ; 
and they seem to fear that it will not be in a con- 
dition to second their efforts, when it shall be neces- 
sary to strike a decisive stroke, or to undertake ope- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 499 

rations in wliicli such extensive means are required 
as in a siege. 

I beg your Excellency would enable me to give 
my Court the necessary information on a matter so 
important as this is. I am not curious to know any 
of the particular details relative to your army, which 
it may be necessary to keep secret j but the mili- 
[tary operations of France and America are so inti- 
'mately connected, that it is indispensable for us to 
know what is the actual force and means which you 
have, in order to calculate, with any degree of pro- 
bability, what enterprises can be undertaken. Our 
ignorance in this respect cannot but be very prejudi- 
cial to our affairs, because if, from false information, 
we consider your army as weaker than it really is, 
it will prevent our forming plans which it would be 
possible to execute ; and if, on the contrary, we 
are led to believe it stronger than it really is, we 
run the risk of forming plans impracticable in their 
execution. It is from these considerations that I beg 
you to confide to me such information on this head 
as you may think proper, both with respect to the 
actual force you have at the different parts of the 
Continent, and what it will probably be in the course 
of the campaign. It is equally interesting to know 
the force of the enemy, both in regulars and militia. 
I beg you to rest assured of the discretion with 
which I shall make use of these communications. 

I cannot refuse myself the pleasure of communicat- 
ing to you the sentiments with which our Court and 
the nation at large are inspired, from the reports of 
the French officers, respecting your Excellency, on 
their return to Versailles. Their testimony could 
add nothing to the universal opinion of the great 
services you have rendered your country j but to the 



500 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

esteem and admiration of the French, is now added a 
sentiment of affection and attachment, which is the 
just return for that attention our military experienced 
from you, and the progress they made in their pro- 
fession by serving under your orders. I have the 
honor to be, with sentiments of the most respectful 
and inviolable attachment, Sir, your Excellency's 
Most humble and most obedient servant, 

Luzerne. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL KNOX AND GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

Ellzabetlitown, IG April, 1782. 

Sir, 

General Forman, who is now on his way to you 
with a representation on the hanging of Captain Bud- 
dy by the refugees, will have the honor of deliver- 
ing your Excellency this letter. Previous to the Ge- 
neral's arrival, we had heard of this matter, although 
not so particularly. We mentioned it to General 
Dalrymple and Mr. Elliot. They seemed to be sur- 
prised and wounded at the information, and assured 
us of their conviction that the deed had been perpe- 
trated, not only without the order of Sir Henry Clin- 
ton, but without his knowledge. We should now 
make a representation on the subject in form, but are 
induced to think, that, as it will have far greater 
weight, so it will come with more propriety from your 
Excellency to General Clinton. 

We have not, in any instance, made a direct and 
formal written inquiry, as to the Board of Refugees, 
conceiving that the event of the business committed 
to us would have rendered it unnecessary. In con- 
versation, however, they have been often mentioned. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 501 

They are, it seems, appointed by, and correspond 
with, the British Mnistry. Their agents are com- 
missioned by Sir Henry Clinton. They act by their 
own authority, under sufferance of the British Com- 
mander-in-chief, but subordinate to his authority, if he 
pleases to exert it. 

We did expect that our business would have ter- 
minated yesterday, but it seems that they have some- 
thing to propose this day. Should we not finish im- 
mediately. Colonel Smith will go hence to-morrow 
morning and carry our proceedings. Should we finish 
this day or to-morrow, we shall make up our report 
as soon as possible, and transmit it by the Colonel. 
We have the honor to be, with great respect. Sir, 
your Excellency's 

Most obedient and humble servants, 

Henry Knox.

FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL IRVINE. 

Fort Pitt, 20 April, 1782. 

Sir, 

I arrived here the 25th of March. At that time 
things were in greater confusion than can well be 
conceived. The country people were, to all appear- 
ance, in a fit of frenzy. About three hundred had 
just returned from the Moravian towns, where they 
found about ninety men, women, and children, all of 
whom they put to death, it is said, after cool delibe- 
ration, and considering the matter for three days. 
The whole were collected into their church, and tied 
when singing hymns. On their return, a party came 
and attacked a few Delaware Indians, who have yet 



502 



LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 



remained with us, on a small island close by this 
garrison, killed two who had Captain's commissions in 
our service, and several others ; the remainder effected 
their escape into the fort, except two who ran to the 
woods, and have not since been heard of. There was 
an officer's guard on the island at the same time, but 
he either did not do his duty, or his men connived 
at the thing; which, I am not yet able to ascertain. 
This last outrage was committed the day before 1 
arrived ; nothing of this nature has been attempted 
since. 

A number of wrong-headed men had conceived an 
opinion, that Colonel Gibson was a friend to Indians, 
and that he must be killed also. These transactions, 
added to the then mutinous disposition of the regular 
troops, had nearly brought on the loss of this whole 
country. I am confident, if this post w^as evacuated, 
the bounds of Canada would be extended to the Lau- 
rel Hill in a few weeks. I have the pleasure, how- 
ever, to inform jouv Excellency that things now 
wear a more favorable aspect. The troops are again 
reduced to obedience, and I have had a meeting, or 
Convention, of the County Lieutenants and several 
Field-Officers, with whom I have made arrangements 
for defending their frontiers, and who promise to ex- 
ert themselves in drawing out the militia, agreeably 
to law, on my requisitions. The few remaining In- 
dians, chiefly women and children, are exceeding trou- 
blesome to us, as they dare not stir out of the fort ; 
not one of the warriors wdll even venture on a re- 
connoitring party. I think they would be better in 
some more interior part of the country, where they 
could be both cheaper fed and clothed. Besides, it 
is not only inconvenient, but improper, to have them 
among the troops, who are, without them, crowded in 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 503 

dirty, bad barracks. I beg your Excellency's instruc- 
tions how to dispose of them. Their Chief, Killbuck, 
has a son and brother at Princeton College, whom he 
is anxious to see. 

Captain Springer, of the Virginia line, marched, 
some time since, with three Indians and as many 
Avhite men, towards Sandusky, for the purpose of 
gaining intelligence ; but the Indians proved too timid 
for him to venture to go all the way. He of course 
returned, without being able to accomplish any thing. 
I thought it too great a risk, but it was by his re- 
quest, and that of the Indians, who were very solicit- 
ous. It was proved on one of the party, named 
Eells, that he intended betraying Captain Springer, 
and all the party, into the hands of the enemy. I 
directed a Board of Officers to inquire into his con- 
duct, who were of opinion he should suffer death. I 
ordered him executed ; he Avas shot on the 12th in- 
stant, seemingly much to the satisfaction of the other 
Indians. 

Civil authority is by no means properly established 
in this country, which I doubt proceeds in some de- 
gree from inattention in the Executives of Virginia 
and Pennsylvania. Not running the boundary line 
is, I think, a proof of this, which is at present an 
excuse for neglects of duty of all kinds, for at least 
twenty miles on each side of the line. More evils 
will arise from this neglect, than people are aware of 
Emigrations and New States are much talked of 
Advertisements are set up, announcing a day to as- 
semble at Wheeling, for all who wish to become 
members of a new State on the Muskingum. A cer- 
tain Mr. Johnson is at the head of this party ; he is 
ambitious, restless, and some say disaffected. Most 
people, however agree, he is open to co|*ruption ; he 



504 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

has been in England since the commencement of the 
present war. ShoukI these people actually emigrate, 
they must be either entirely cut off, or immediately 
take protection from the British, which I fear is the 
real design of some of the party, though I think a 
great majority have no other views than to acquire 
lands. As I apprehended taking cognizance of these 
matters would come best from the civil authority, I 
have written to the Governors of Virginia and Penn- 
sylvania on the subject, which I should not have 
done, till I had first acquainted your Excellency there- 
of, but for this consideration, namely, that the 20th 
of May is the day appointed for the emigrants to 
rendezvous ; consequently a representation from you 
would be too late, in case the States should think 
proper to take measures to prevent them. I am 
much embarrassed by the scanty and irregular sup- 
ply of provision. I intend to write to Mr. Morris on 
this head. I have the honor to be. Sir, 
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 

William Irvine. 



FROM GOVERNOR LmNGSTON. 

Trenton, 14 May, 1782. 

Sir, 
I now do myself the honor of particularly address- 
ing myself to answer your Excellency's letter of the 
6th instant. While the whole world must applaud 
your Excellency's resolution of retaliating for the bar- 
barous murder committed upon Captain Huddy, which 
is in favor of humanity, by its tendency to prevent 
the like cruelties, this State, of which he was a good 
citizen and a brave soldier, is particularly obliged to 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 505 

your Excellency for your zeal and exertions upon 
that occasion. 

Utterh'- divesting myself of- all local attachments, 
and of every possible prejudice in favor of New Jer- 
sey, I really do not recollect that the militia of this 
State, or any other of its citizens, have ever commit- 
ted against a prisoner of war any act of cruelty, or 
treated such prisoner, in any instance, contrary to 
the laws of arms. Sure I am that I should discoun- 
tenance the practice to the utmost of my power; and 
all that prevents me from issuing the most positive 
orders against it is, that such orders would either im- 
ply the previous practice, or be ranked with the folly 
of a Legislator, who should enact laws for punishing 
a crime that had never been committed. If the ene- 
my complain of any cruel treatment from our militia 
towards their prisoners, they ought, like all other ac- 
cusers, to produce their proof, and then, I am per- 
suaded that they will not complain in vain, as they 
well know that we have done to this very moment. 

Respecting your Excellency's inquiry concerning 
the circumstances of the capture of Hatfield and 
Badgely, and the causes of their detention, I inclose 
a copy of Chief Justice Brearley's letter to me on 
that subject; and have the honor to be, with the 
greatest esteem, your Excellency's 

Most humble and very obedient servant, 

William Livingston. 



FROM COLONEL LAURENS. 



Bacon's Bridge, South Carolina, 19 May, 1782. 

My dear General, 

I am much obliged to you for honoring my bill in 
VOL. m. 43 



506 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

favor of General Lincoln. It includes the whole sum 
expended, on your account, in France. The plan, 
which brought me to this country, was urged with 
all the zeal which the subject inspired, both in our 
Privy Council and Assembly ; but the single voice 
of reason was drowned by the bowlings of a triple- 
headed monster, in which prejudice, avarice, and pu- 
sillanimity were united. It was some degree of con- 
solation to me, however, to perceive that truth and 
philosophy had gained some ground ; the suffrages in 
favor of the measure being twice as numerous as on 
a former occasion. Some hopes have been lately 
given me from Georgia; but I fear, when the ques- 
tion is put, we shall be outvoted there with as much 
disparity as we have been in this country.* 

The reports of the prompt evacuation of Charleston 
I always thought groundless, and should have much 
sooner inferred the probability of such an event from 
the lano-uase of the debates in the British Parlia- 
ment than from the conduct and arrangements of 
General Leslie. The late disaster of the Count de 
Grasse, in the West Indies, makes me more incredu- 
lous on the subject than ever. General Leslie con- 
fines himself to the most circumspect defensive con- 
duct, which he is not likely to change, as he recently 
detached the nineteenth and thirtieth regiments to 
Jamaica. This renders the campaign perfectly inact- 
ive here, and, above all, insipid to the light troops, 
which I at present command. 

I presume your Excellency has not yet determined 
your plan for the ensuing campaign, and that it must 
depend on the cooperation of our allies. I earnestly

executed, and to be near your Excellency on all oc- 
casions in which my services can be acceptable. The 
pursuit of an object which, I confess, is a favorite 
one with me, because I always regarded the interests 
of this country and those of the Union as intimately 
connected with it, has detached me more than once 
from your family; but those sentiments of veneration 
and attachment with which your Excellency has in- 
spired me, keep me always near you, with the sin- 
cerest and most zealous wishes for a continuance of 
your happiness and glory. Give me leave to say 
that I am ever, my dear General,

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Head- Quarters, 19 May, 1782. 

Dear Sir, 
Fortune seems to smile upon the perseverance of 
Great Britain. Count do Grasse's defeat, mentioned 
in my official letter, appears to be much more im- 
portant than I expected. Since I wrote, I have seen 
Admiral Rodney's letter. Count de Grasse is a pri- 
soner, and has lost six ships of the line; and I fear 
the rest of the fleet are so shattered as to be inca- 
pable of attempting any thing for a long time. This 
misfortune will put it out of the power of our ally 
to cooperate with us in these States or to the north- 
ward. I expect the enemy, from finding it impracti- 
cable for the French to cooperate with us, and from 
having again the command of the sea, will detach 
from New York to this quarter to prosecute farther 
operations. However, this will depend upon the force 



508 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

they have at New York. All that "will he necessary 
there, will he a good garrison. They cannot have 
offensive operations in view there. Their force is 
unequal to it; but, by detaching a part to this quar- 
ter, they can improve it to advantage, and leave New 
York in perfect security. 

I have always been of opinion that farther at- 
tempts would be made for the subjugation of this 
country, should fortune favor them in the West In- 
dies. I can see no other reason for having held 
footing in it so long. Should Count R-ochambeau be 
ordered to this quarter for offensive operations, I 
hope your Excellency will also come yourself; for it 
will not be for the honor of America that a foreigner 
command an American department. If this cannot 
take place, I could wish the American force could 
act independent of his command, and only act by 
conjunction. I believe my rank will give several 
French officers a right to command me ; but, if the 
honor of the nation was not connected with it, I 
should have no objection. However, I shall be per- 
fectly satisfied with whatever you may think neces- 
sary for the good of the service. My desire to be 
useful is so much greater than my wish for com- 
mand, that there are no conditions to which I will 
not cheerfully submit, that are not personally dis- 
graceful, to promote the interest of this country. 

I fear Virginia wiU do little, while the French 
army is in that State, either for herself or the Union. 
As far as I can learn, little or nothing has been done 
for seven months past; nor can I learn that any de- 
cisive measures are pursuing for the purpose. What- 
ever may be your Excellency's intentions with re- 
gard to the French army, it would not be amiss to 
inform the Governor that they may expect that army 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 509 

to leave them shortly, and that great exertions are 
necessary for their own security. It may serve as a 
spur, and the genius of America often requires spur- 
ring. 

I wish to know your Excellency's intentions in this 
quarter, as early as possible. Many measures will be 
requisite to accommodate matters to your views, if 
you have any thing offensive in view. Could the 
French army have arrived in this country by the 
middle of this month, I am confident we could have 
obliged the enemy to have evacuated it. Reports say 
here your Excellency had a narrow escape through 
the Clove. Mrs. Greene joins me in respectful com- 
pliments to yourself and Mrs. Washington. 

With esteem and affection, I am, &c., 

Nathanael Greene. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL IRVINE. 

Fort Pitt, 21 May, 1782. 

Sir, 
A number of the principal people of this country 
made application to me, about two weeks since, for 
my consent to their collecting a body of volunteers 
to go against Sandusky, which I agreed to on these 
express conditions; — that they did not mean to extend 
their settlements, nor had any thing in view but to 
harass the enemy, with an intention to protect the 
frontier, and that any conquests they might make 
should be in behalf and for the United States; that 
they would be governed by military laws as militia; 
that they must collect such numbers as might pro- 
bably be successful ; and, lastly, that they would equip

themselves and victual at their own expense. They 
are accordingly assembling this day at the Mingo 
bottom, all on horseback, with thirty days' provision. 
They have asked of me only a few flints, and a small 
supply of powder. 

As they will elect their officers, I have taken some 
pains to get Colonel Crawford appointed to command, 
and hope he will be. He left me yesterday, on his 
way down to the place of rendezvous. He does not 
wish to go with a smaller number than four hundred; 
whether this number will assemble, I cannot say. He 
pressed me for some officers. I have sent with him 
Lieutenant Rose, my Aid-de-camp, a very vigilant, 
active, brave, young gentleman, well acquainted with 
service ; and a surgeon. These two are all I could 
venture to spare. Several were solicitous for my go- 
ing, but I did not tliink myself at liberty, consistent 
with the spirit of your Excellency's instructions ; nor 
are we in such a situation that I could take a single 
Continental soldier along, particularly as the volun- 
teers are all mounted. If their number exceeds three 
hundred, I am of opinion they may succeed, as their 
march will be so rapid they will probably, in a great 
degree, effect a surprise. 

I cannot find a man in tliis country, who has a 
tolerable knowledge of the road to Niagara. There 
are numbers who are acquainted to the heads of Alle- 
ghany; from thence I think the people of the State 
of New York are better acquainted than any this 
way. I have the honor to be, with perfect respect, 
Sir, your Excellency's 

Most obedient and most humble servant, 

WiLLiAiM Irvine. 

P. S. The volunteers have sent requesting my in- 



THE AMEllICAN REVOLUTION. 511 

structions (which I will send) for the officer who may 
be appointed to command. The troops behave re- 
markably well, since a few examples have been made. 



FKOM COLONEL PICKERING. 

Philadelpliia, 29 May, 1782. 

Sir, 

I haA^e been favored with your Excellency's letter 
of the 15th instant, Avhich would have been acknow- 
ledged by the subsequent post, had I not been made 
to expect a small supply of money the same week, 
by the bearer of which I meant to write to your 
Excellency. But in this expectation also I w^as disap- 
pointed. My long continuance here has distressed 
me exceedingly, but it appeared to me that the ser- 
vice would be promoted by it. I had, from time to 
time, sent orders to Colonel Hughes to prepare every 
thing that was to be provided in his department for 
the ensuing campaign, and to the Commissary of Fo- 
rage to procure his supplies, assuring them, agreeably 
to the encouragement I had myself received, that I 
would furnish them with money to fulfil their engage- 
ments, every necessary estimate for these purposes 
having been laid before the Superintendent of Finance, 
and the necessity of the supplies admitted. 

These services being undertaken in full confidence 
that I should bring with me the requisite sums 
of money, I did not dare to return without them. 
While the Financier held up to my view the pros- 
pect of supplies, I presented the same to Colonel 
Hughes and at my own office, and thereby kept alive 
the hopes of the public creditors, who, had I returned 



512 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

moneyless, would have been reduced to absolute de- 
spair, and all business and supplies have ceased. But 
I am now more unhappy than ever ; for I cannot 
continue to mention even a prospect of fulfilling my 
engagements. Until I was led to expect supplies of 
money to carry on the business of the department, I 
cautiously avoided making any positive engagements, 
thinking the j)iiblic creditors had been too long abus- 
ed by faithless promises to admit of any further de- 
ception to the public advantage; and the making of 
promises, without a well-grounded prospect of fulfil- 
ling them, being totally opposed to my disposition. 

I have at last reduced my immediate demand of 
money "not to the articles necessary and lest to be 
provided now, but to those, for which unless money 
can be furnished, the credit of the department will 
be irretrievably lost." But I can obtain nothing at 
present. The principal causes of this disappointment 
your Excellency is probably informed of The same 
causes prevent the completing the purchases of ox- 
teams. The sum I received for those purchases was 
in Mr. Morris's notes, and amounted only to about 
three fifths of the sum requisite for that service -, and 
whether any purchases could be made with them at 
the eastward, was a matter of uncertainty, from which 
no information from my deputies there has relieved 
me. But, if they have succeeded, it is in such a way 
as forbids the Financier giving me any more of them ; 
for these notes are not received there as cash, but 
only as pledges, which are bought up by speculators, 
who make a run upon the funds assigned for their 
redemption. 

My stay here goads me Avith perpetual anxiety. 
To return empty, would be mortifying in the highest 
degree, and expose me to infinite vexation. To ask 



THE AMERICAN EEVOLUTION. 513 

a credit of anybody, after tlie deceptions with "uliich 
I shall be charged, and before the engagements al- 
ready made are fulfilled, would be deemed a piece of 
effrontery, and nothing could be obtained without re- 
curring to the odious and expensive mode of impress. 
Thus embarrassed and distressed, I have represented 
my situation to the Secretary at War, who will there- 
on have some communications with the Superintend- 
ent of Finance; and by their opinion or your Excel- 
lency's orders I shall be governed. I have the honor 
to be, with the greatest respect. 

Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

Timothy Pickering. 



FROM COUNT DE ROCHAMBKiU. 

Williamsburg, 8 June, 1782. 

Sir, 

In the moment I was writing to your Excellency 
I received a confirmation of the result of the en- 
gagement on the 12th of April, which, by all the 
reports from the Cape, Port au Prince, and all the 
intelligence from New York and Jamaica, seems very 
bad for us.'-' 

I was proposing to jon that, as there was not as yet 
any plan for the campaign decided at our Court, and 
as I waited, with the greatest impatience, for the ar- 
rival of the Duke of Lauzun, I thought that it was 
suitable to march the corps towards New York, that, 
jointly with jouy army, we might hinder the enemy 
from sending any forces to the aid of Jamaica. These 
bad news quite overthrow that military speculation, 
so that I see no more reason for that march of the 

* The defeat of Count de Grasse, in the West Indies. 



514 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

French corps to join you, unless there be political 
ones, which I must submit to vour reflection and to 
your order. 

The Captain of a flag, arrived yesterday from New 
York, assures that he had sailed with thirty-six trans- 
ports, escorted by three ships of war, going to Charles- 
ton and Savannah. They are empty, and it is believ- 
ed they are going to evacuate those places. If that 
be the case, all their forces being assembled there, 
there is nothing more for us to do. If the army 
moves that way, we must assure a protection to 
New York and West Point, where will stay our navy 
and heavy artillery, by a body of militia which Vir- 
ginia must furnish, to which I would add five [regi- 
ments of] French troops; and, considering the resolu- 
tion of the British Parliament not to carry on an 
ofiensive war on the Continent, I cannot see any good 
proceeding from the march of the French troops on 
NeAv York. On the contrary, I think it might en- 
gage Carleton to send a detachment and make some 
undertaking against our ships, when the army would 
be at a great distance, as he might undertake against 
the French without deviating from the resolution not 
to carry on any longer an ofiensive war on the Con- 
tinent, to endeavour to reduce America by force. 
Such, Sir, are my observations. I communicate them 
to the Chevalier de la Luzerne, and submit them to 
the reflections and orders of your Excellency. I am, 
with respect and personal attachment. Sir, your Ex- 
cellency's 

Most obedient and humble servant, 

Le Compte de Kochambeau. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 515 

FROM COLONEL LAURENS. 

12 June, 1782. 

Dear General, 

The approaching session of the Georgia Legislature, 
and the encouragement given me by Governor IIow- 
ley, who has a decisive influence in the counsels of 
that country, induce me to remain in this quarter for 
the purpose of taking new measures on the subject 
of our black levies. The arrival of Colonel Baylor, 
whose seniority entitles him to the command of the 
light troops, affords me ample leisure for pursuing 
the business in person ; and I shall do it, with all 
the tenacity of a man making a last effort on so in- 
teresting an occasion. 

The sterility of the present campaign affords no- 
thing worthy to be detailed to your Excellency. Our 
operations have been confined to inconsiderable skir- 
mishes, and some little partisan strokes on our part, 
which were brilliant, and served to amuse us in de- 
fault of better employment. 

My last letter was closed and despatched a moment 
before Mr. Leslie's letter arrived, to General Greene, 
to feel his pulse on the subject of an armistice, and 
administer every political opiate that could be contriv- 
ed. The General's answer was obvious. Since that, 
peace has been the prevailing topic in Charleston ; 
the terms of it founded in conjecture, and framed by 
the interests and passions of different individuals. The 
wisdom and virtue of Congress have no doubt given 
the proper repulse to the sounders, who have ap- 
proached them. It is more and more to be lamented, 
that the French force, under Count Rochambeau, has 
not been applied to assist in opening the trenches 



516 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

before Charleston, and that the idea of an evacuation 
of that post has been so successfully propagated. 
The expulsion or capture of the British garrison 
there, would infinitely abridge negotiation. I renew 
my wishes for a continuance of your Excellency's 
happiness and prosperity; and am. ever, dear General, 

Your faithful aid, 

John Laurens. 

P. S. My letter will be delivered to your Excel- 
lency by Mr. Lovell, of the partisan legion. He is 
an officer of merit, and as such I take the liberty 
of presenting him to your Excellency. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL IRVINE. 

Fort Pitt, 16 June, 1782. 

Sir, 
In my letter of the 21st of May, I mentioned to 
your Excellency that a body of volunteer militia were 
assembling at the Mingo Bottom, to go against San- 
dusky. The inclosed letters, one from Colonel Wil- 
liamson, second in command, and the other from 
Lieutenant Rose, my Aid-de-camp, contain all the par- 
ticulars of this transaction which have yet come to 
my knowledge. I am of opinion, had they reached 
the place in seven days, instead of ten, which might 
have been done, especially as they Avere chiefly mount- 
ed, they would have succeeded. They should also 
have pushed the advantage evidently gained at the 
commencement of the action. They failed in another 
point, which they had my advice, and indeed positive 
orders for, namely, to make the last day's march as 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 517 

long as possible, and attack the place in the night; 
but they halted in the evening, within nine miles, and 
fired their rifles at seven in the morning, before they 
marched. These people now seem convinced that 
they cannot perform as much by themselves as they 
some time since thought they could. Perhaps it is 
right that they should put more dependence on regu- 
lar troops. I am sorry I have not more, to afford 
them assistance. I have the honor to be. 
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 

William Irvine. 



FROM HENRY BROCKHOLST LIVINGSTON.* 

Elizabethtown, 16 June, 1782. 

Sir, 

Considering the various and important objects of 
your Excellency's constant attention, it is with the 
greatest reluctance I prevail upon myself to engage 
it a single moment by any thing not of some im- 
mediate public consequence. Yet such is my present 
situation, that I flatter myself your Excellency will 
pardon my freedom in requesting your attention to it. 

On the 11th of March last, I sailed from Cadiz, 
and was taken by an English frigate on the 25th of 
the month following. At New York, I was committed 
to the Provost, and continued in it until the arrival 
of Sir Guy Caiieton, who liberated me on parole. 
Having been absent from America on furlough, with- 
out exceeding the term thereof, and having a Lieu-

518 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

tenant-Colonel's commission in my pocket, I did not 
think there could be any impropriety in signing a 
parole as such, and in being exchanged accordingly. 
But on perusing the journals of Congress, I find, by 
resolutions passed the 31st of December, 1781, and 
21st of January, 1782, that I am among those offi- 
cers ^vho are considered as retiring from service on 
half-pay the first day of the present year. Those re- 
solves your Excellency will readily believe I must 
have been a perfect stranger to, at the time of my 
capture, neither of them having had time to reach 
Madrid when I came away, which was on the 7th of 
February last. This circumstance will, I trust, excul- 
pate me from any censure, and will induce your 
Excellency to permit me to be considered as a Lieu- 
tenant-Colonel in any future exchange, agreeably to 
the tenor of my parole. 

I cannot conclude, without taking notice of that 
part of Sir Guy Carleton's first letter to your Excel- 
lency, in which he appears to make a merit of my 
enlargement, and to think himself entitled, therefor, 
to some return on the part of your Excellency. Lest 
this circumstance may induce a suspicion that some 
part of my conduct, while in confinement, may have 
given the enemy reason to believe that I considered 
my liberation in the light of a favor, or took impro- 
per steps to obtain it, I think it incumbent on me to 
lay before your Excellency a narrative of what passed 
on that occasion. 

Immediately on landing at New York, JNIr. Sproat 
informed me, on the part of General Robertson, that 
I was to be confined in the Provost, and Mr. Chief- 
Justice Smith was sent thither to apologize for my 
being treated in that manner. I told Mr. Smith, that 
throwing a person into a common jail, merely on 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 519 

suspicion of his being the hearer of important de- 
spatches, appeared to me an unprecedented and a 
very extraordinary measure ; hut that, as it could 
answer no purpose to enter into an altercation with 
him, I should write to General Robertson himself on 
the subject. And, on pen, ink, and paper being 
brought me, I wrote him a letter of which the in- 
closed is a copy. 

In answer thereto, the General sent me a polite 
message by Major Wemyss, the purport of which 
was, that "reasons of state rendered my confinement 
necessary, but that I might rest assured it would be 
of very short duration." The Major concluded by 
apologizing for my not receiving a written answer, 
the General's time being wholly engrossed by very 
pressing business. Major Wemyss had scarcely re- 
tired, when Captain Cunningham, the Provost-Marshal, 
mentioned to me, for the first time, Lippencott's situ- 
ation, and what had passed between your Excellency 
and Sir Henry Clinton on that subject. He did not 
seem to speak from authority, but gave me to un- 
derstand, as politely as he could, that it might be 
well for me to interest myself on the occasion, as it 
was impossible to say to what lengths retaliation 
might be carried, in case your Excellency should 
execute the threat you had thrown out. I was not 
then apprised of all the circumstances relative to 
the murder of Captain Huddy; but, had I been a 
total stranger to your Excellency's character, Cun- 
ningham's own state of the matter must have con- 
vinced me of the perfect propriety of your requisi- 
tion. I told him so, and (after laughing at the idea 
of any interest of mine or of my friends being suffi- 
cient to induce your Excellency to recede from so 
just a demand) promised to comply wdth his request, 



520 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

provided he would first engage to transmit to your 
Excellency whatever I might think jDroper to write 
on the matter. He replied, General Robertson must 
first see it. This convinced me it would be useless 
to write, from a certainty that my letter would not 
correspond with his wishes, and, of course, not be 
forwarded. I sat down, however, and wrote what is 
inclosed to my father. 

I had now determined to make no further applica- 
tion to General Robertson ; nor did I hear any thing 
more from head-quarters until the arrival of Sir Guy 
Carleton, who sent for me Avithout my applying to 
him, either verbally or by letter. On being intro- 
duced to his Excellency, he informed me, in the pre- 
sence of Mr. Smith, of his being much surprised at 
hearing of my confinement, and very happy to have 
it in his power so soon to put a period to it. With- 
out leaving time to reply, he acquainted me with his 
intention to send his Secretary with a complimentary 
letter to Congress ; and begged of me, in order to fa- 
cilitate Mr. Morgan's journey, to accept of a seat in 
his carriage. After thanking him for his attention, I 
asked whether Mr. Morgan had permission from Con- 
gress or your Excellency to proceed to Philadelphia; 
and, on being answered in the negative, told him 
that I recollected Mr. Ferguson's having been stopped 
on a like errand for want of such passport, and that 
Mr. Morgan would probably be obliged to return, 
should he undertake the journey without one. He 
said, the idea was perfectly new to him. He did not 
conceive any necessity of a flag's being furnished 
with a passport; and, if so in Mr. Ferguson's case, 
my going with his Secretary must supersede that 
necessity in the present one. I observed to him, that 
his Excellency must allow that there was a wide 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 521 

difference between sending a military flag to an out- 
post of our army, and sending a person, in Mr. Mor- 
gan's character, through so great a part of the coun- 
try, to Philadelphia; and that without such a pass 
I must beg leave to decline the pleasure I should 
otherwise derive from travelling in that gentleman's 
company. 

Sir Guy then proposed that the Secretary and my- 
self should go together; and, in case of the former 
being stopped, I was to proceed with his despatches 
to Congress. This also I refused, telling him that, as 
it was probable liis letters contained some overtures, 
I could not consent to charge myself with them, un- 
less his Excellency would assure me they contained 
an acknowledgment of our independence, or a pro- 
mise to withdraw their fleets and armies ; that these 
were the only terms on which Congress had agreed 
to open a treaty in' 1778, and that it was not pro- 
bable they would listen to any thing short thereof 
now. He seemed somewhat surprised, and, after a 
little hesitation, assured me, upon his honor, that he 
was vested with no such powers; that his intended 
letter to Congress was a matter of mere compliment; 
but if there was any danger of Mr. Morgan's meet- 
ing with difficulties, he would postpone his journey 
until he could hear from your Excellency on the 
subject. 

This closed our conversation for that day. The 
next morning, agreeably to his desire, 1 waited on 
Mm again. He received me very politely, talked 
much of the King's pacific dispositions, of his own 
earnest desire of an honorable peace, of his wishes to 
carry on the war, while it did prevail, more consonant 
to the dictates of humanity than heretofore. He was 
persuaded of meeting with corresponding sentiments 

44 -.i: 



622 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

in 3^our Excellency; that both countries were inte- 
rested in supporting the British character; that; if 
England and America must separate, it would be 
their mutual interest to part like men of honor, and 
in good humor with each other. After a great deal 
more, to the same purpose, he informed me a barge 
was ready to take me to Elizabethtown. He then 
put into my hands a letter for my father, some Eng- 
lish prints, with a few copies of the Bill, and of the 
votes of the House of Commons, which he said should 
be transmitted to your Excellency by another flag. 
After signing a parole, I took my leave. 

I hope your Excellency will forgive my having 
been so very prolix on this occasion, as nothing but 
an idea of its being my duty has led me to be cir- 
cumstantial in every thing that passed between the 
Commander-in-chief and myself during my captivity 
in New York. I have the honor to be, with the 
highest respect, your Excellency's 

Most obedient and very humble servant, 

Henry Brockholst Livingston. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENT;RAL IRVINE. 

Fort Pitt, 11 July, 1782. 

Sir, 
Dr. Knight, a surgeon I sent with Colonel Craw- 
ford, returned the 4th instant to this place. He brings 
an account of the melancholy fate of poor Crawford. 
The day after the main body retreated, the Colonel, 
Doctor, and nine others, were overtaken, about thirty 
miles from the field of action, by a body of Indians, 
to whom they surrendered. They were taken back to 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 523 

Sandusky, where they all, except the Doctor, were 
put to death. The unfortunate Colonel, in particular, 
was burned and tortured in every manner they could 
invent. 

The Doctor, after being a spectator of this distress- 
ing scene, was sent, under guard of one Indian, to the 
Shawanese Town, where he was told he would share 
the same fate next day; but fortunately found an op- 
portunity of demolishing the fellow, and making his 
escape. The Doctor adds, that a certain Simon Girty, 
who was formerly in our service, and deserted with 
McKee, and is now said to have a commission in the 
British service, was present at torturing Colonel Craw- 
ford, and that he, the Doctor, was informed by an 
Indian, that a British Captain commands at Sandusky; 
that he believes he was present, also, but is not cer- 
tain; but says that he saw a person there who was 
dressed and who appeared like a British officer. He 
also says the Colonel begged of Girty to shoot him, 
but he paid no regard to the request. A certain Slo- 
ver has also come in yesterday, who was under sen- 
tence at the Shawanese Town. He says a Mr. William 
Harrison, son-in-law to Colonel Crawford, was quarter- 
ed and burned. Both he and the Doctor say they 
were assured, by sundry Indians they formerly knew, 
that not a single soul should in future escape torture ; 
and gave, as a reason for this conduct, the Moravian 
affair. A number of people inform me, that Colonel 
Crawford ought to be considered as a Continental offi- 
cer, and are of opinion retaliation should take place. 
These, however, are such facts as I have been able 
to get. Dr. Knight is a man of undoubted veracity.*

Head-Quarters, Ashley River, South Carolina, 
11 July, 1782. 

Sir, 

My letter of the 7th ultimo, covering the returns 
of the army, I hope has been safely delivered. Since 
which I have been duly honored with your Excel- 
lency's favors of the 23d of April and 22d of May. 
The troops have been so badly clothed, and the sea- 
son is so very hot, that many of the soldiery have 
been seized with fevers, which renders them unfit for 
service, although it has by no means proved mortal. 
I have procured, with the aid of the Executive of 
this State, materials for a check shirt, a pair of over- 
alls, and a coatee, for each of them, which will alle- 
viate their distress until the supplies from Philadel- 
phia arrive. 

On the 7th instant, I changed the position of the 
army, in hopes of finding one more healthy. I have 
taken post on the south side of Ashley River, seven 

Cra-wford. He had been a prisoner among the Indians during the last 
war, and was well acquainted with the country beyond the Ohio. The 
Indian who is said above to have been " demolished " by Dr. Knight, was 
not killed. He was severely wounded, but made his escape, and was 
seen by Slover after his return to one of the Indian towns.

miles below Bacon's Bridge, and fifteen from Charles- 
ton. The ground is high and dry ; the water is good ; 
and it has the appearance of the most healthy place 
this country affords. We have been daily in expecta- 
tion of hearing of the evacuation of Savannah. It ic 
an event which I believe has been determined on for 
some time past. The people of this country have 
their expectations raised, and are sanguine in their 
hopes that Charleston will be speedily abandoned. 
.There are some preparations on which their opinions 
are founded ; but I must confess, they seem to be 
rather contractino; their works than abandonino; the 
place. The situation of their troops at the Quarter- 
house, they find so very unhealthy, that they will be 
under the necessity of leaving it. They have ad- 
vanced their works one mile on the neck, to which 
they will retire. 

The enemy are so well informed of the want of 
energy and exertion in the States, that I am appre- 
hensive they will withdraw part of their troops, leav- 
ing a small garrison to be held in constant readiness 
to evacuate, whenever they find a combined attack 
meditated against them. 

Mrs. Greene joins me in returning the most sincere 
thanks for your and Mrs. Washington's attention, and 
we beg you will accept our best wishes for your hap- 
piness. I have the honor to be, with the most perfect 
esteem and respect your Excellency's 

Most obedient and very humble servant, 

Nathanael Greene. 

P. S. The copy of a letter from General Wayne, 
and the returns of the army, will accompany this 
letter. 



526 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM COUNT DE ROCHAMBEAU. 

Philadelphia, 17 July, 1782. 

Sir, 

I had the honor to write to your Excellency that, 
at my departure from York in Virginia, I would 
leave in that place a detachment of four hundred 
French troops, which were to he joined by a corps 
of the Virginian militia, to assure the possession of 
that harbour to the French navy now there, and that 
may arrive in future. At the moment of my leaving 
that place, the American militia were just beginning 
to arrive ; and I have left M. de Lavalette, Briga- 
dier-General, with four hundred French troops. I 
have expressly recommended to him the American ar- 
tillery, which remained there after the siege of York, 
with orders to place it upon West Point, to join it 
to our siege artilleiy, in case superior land and sea 
forces should oblige him to retreat on West Point, 
with the King's navy. I think that the quantity of 
American artillery left at York is much greater than 
is necessary for the conservation of that post, and 
that at least one half may be taken aAvay, whenever 
your Excellency shall think fit. 

One battery of eight pieces at York, and another 
of six at Gloucester, will be sufficient to protect the 
harbour ; and I am of opinion that General Lincoln 
will do very well to send his orders that the rest, 
amounting to thirty pieces and upwards, according to 
the best of my knowledge, may be removed. This is 
my opinion. Sir, in answer to the letter which you 
did me the honor to write me on that object yester- 
day. I am, with respect and personal attachment. 
Sir, your Excellency's 

Most obedient and humble servant, 

Le Compte de Rociiambeau. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 527 

P. S. I send to your Excellency my answer to 
Sir Guy Carleton, which I beg you would read, and 
send by the first occasion to New York. 



FROM JAMES MONROE. 

Richmond, 15 August, 1782. 

Dear Sir, 

You wdll pardon the liberty I take in writing to 
you upon a subject, which has no relation to the 
public interest, when I inform you I am induced 
thereto merely from a principle of gratitude, to make 
acknowledgment for the personal service I have re- 
ceived from your Excellency. The introduction you 
gave me some time since to this State, for the pur- 
pose of attaining some military appointment, to place 
me in the service of my country, in a line with those 
worthy citizens with whom common hardsliip and 
danger had nearly connected me, although it failed in 
that instance, has availed me in another line. 

Upon relinquishing my military pursuits, which I 
did with reluctance, and returning to those studies in 
which I had been engaged previous to my joining 
the army, till of late I have been literally a recluse. 
Having gone through that course, which, in the opi- 
nion of Mr. Jefferson, to whom I submitted the di- 
rection of my studies, was sufficient to qualify me in 
some degree for public business, in my application to 
my country in the first instance, and in the subse- 
quent appointment of the Assembly to the Executive 
Council of the State, I have had the pleasure to ex- 
perience your friendly letter in my favor, of essential 
service to me. If, therefore, I was so fortunate in 
the management of my conduct more immediately un- 



528 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

der your eye, as to gain your good opinion and es- 
teem, I flatter myself that, in the discharge of the 
duties of my present ofBce, and a faithful observance 
and attention to the confidence reposed in me by my 
country, I shall take no step which ^vill entitle me 
to forfeit theirs, or give you cause to repent your 
prepossession in my favor. A consciousness that I 
had, in some degree, merited your approbation, and 
that of the gentlemen of the army with whom I had 
the honor to associate, gave me a consolation and a 
pleasure in my subsequent retirement (though wounded 
and chagrined at my disappointment from the State), 
which I could not have derived from any other 
source. If, in the line of my present appointment, 
fortune should put it in my power to pay attention 
to, or obey in any instance, your Excellency's com- 
mands, believe me she could not confer a favor on 
me I should receive with greater pleasure from her 
hands. 

With every sentiment of respect and esteem, with 
which your great and unwearied service to your 
country, and your kind and friendly attention to me, 
can fill my breast, I have the honor to be, your 
Excellency's 

Most obedient and most humble servant, 

James Monroe. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GATES. 

 Philadelphia, 17 August, 1782. 



Sir, 

General Lincoln has, in his letter of yesterday, ac- 
quainted me that it is your Excellency's desire to 
know if I wish to take command in the army this 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 529 

campaign. I beg your Excellency to believe, that I 
am always ready to obey your commands, and shall 
be most happy when I can execute them to your 
satisfaction. I have but to entreat, that no attention 
to me, or my rank, may interfere, or break in upon 
any part of your Excellency's arrangements. My 
zeal for the public interest makes me exceedingly 
anxious to be present at the great concluding stroke 
of this war. 

I intend to proceed immediately to Berkley, and 
prepare myself for taking the field. I brought no- 
thing with me here ; neither did I settle my domes- 
tic matters before I left home. Tliis will ' take up 
but a few days ; when finished, I shall hold myself 
constantly ready to obey your orders. I earnestly 
request your Excellency will be assured of my invio- 
lable attachment, and that no time or circumstance 
shall ever shake that resolution. In consequence of 
my application to Congress upon my arrival here, 1 
have received the inclosed resolve, in a very affec- 
tionate letter from my worthy friend, General Lin- 
coln.* With sentiments of the greatest esteem and 
respect, I am, Sir, your Excellency's 

Most obedient and most faithful, humble servant, 

Horatio Gates.

ago, Lieutenant-Colonel Laurens has been killed in an 
action on the Combahee River, about fifty miles south 
of our camp. The enemy made a detachment into that 
quarter, with a number of armed vessels, empty sloops 
and schooners, with about five hundred infantry, to 
collect rice. General Gist, with the light troops, in 
Avhich Lieutenant-Colonel Laurens held a command, 
w^as detached to oppose them. Inclosed is a copy of 
General Gist's letter containing an account of the 
different operations. Colonel Laurens's fall is glori- 
ous ; but liis fate is much to be lamented. Your Ex- 
cellency has lost a valuable Aid-de-camp, the army a 
brave officer, and the public a worthy and patriotic 
citizen. 

The enemy made a descent upon Santee, some 
little time since, to collect rice, in which they were 
but too successful. The situation in which it lay, 
prevented General Marion from giving them any con- 
siderable interruption. The rivers of this country are 
very flivorable for this kind of enterprises ; but I am 
in hopes the enemy will get but little by their pre- 
sent expedition. 

It is said that Admiral Pigot is on this coast with 
near thirty sail of the line, to take off the garrison 
of New York. A part of the fleet is to take post 
at Beaufort, to take off the garrison of Charleston. It 
is said the enemy, within a few days past, have been 
meditating an attack upon us. I have the honor to 
be, with great respect. 

Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 

Nathanael Greene. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 531 

FROM COUNT DE ROCHAMBEAU. 

Princetou, 7 September, 1782. 

Sir, 

I have the honor to send to your Excellency a 
letter, which the Chevalier de la Luzerne begs you 
would send by the dragoons established on the road 
to Boston for carrying on the correspondence. It 
contains a generous offer made by Congress to the 
King of a seventy-four gun ship.'^ 

The news which I have here of the British fleet, 
are that Admiral Pigot is got into New York with 
very few ships, himself in a bad state of health, and 
that Admiral Hood, with the greatest part of the 
fleet, has sailed for Halifax. If your Excellency has 
the same intelligence confirmed, I beg you would 
send my letter to M. de Vaudreuil. It is, however, 
certain that M. Dumas, Deputy Quartermaster-General, 
has seen yesterday a great part of the fleet under 
sail before the Hook. I expect that I shall arrive, 
with the first division, on the 14th, at Ilaverstraw. 
The second division will arrive on the loth; and I 
promise to myself a great pleasure in embracing your 
Excellency. I am, with respect and personal attach- 
ment. Sir, your Excellency's 

Most obedient and humble servant, 

Le Compte De Rochambeau.

on this occasion to his Llajesty the sense they entertain of his gene-

532 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM THOMAS PAINE. 

Bordentown, 7 September, 1782. 

Sir, 

I have the honor of presenting jou with fifty co- 
pies of my last publication for the amusement of the 
army ; and to repeat to you my acknowledgments 
of your friendship. I fully believe we have seen our 
worst days over. The spirit of the war, on the part 
of the enemy, is certainly on the decline, full as 
much as we think for. I draw this opinion not only 
from the difl&culties we know they are in, and the 
present promiscuous appearance of things, but from 
the peculiar effect which certain periods of time have, 
more or less, upon all men. 

The British have accustomed themselves to think 
of the term of seven years, in a manner different 
from other periods of time. They acquire this partly 
by habit, by religion, by reason, and by superstition. 
They serve seven years' apprenticeship • they elect 
their Parliament for seven years ; they punish by 
seven years' transportation, or the duplicate, or tripli- 
cate of that term; their leases run in the same man- 
ner; and they read that Jacob served seven years for 
one wife, and seven years for another; and the same 
term likewise extinguishes all obligations, in certain 
cases, of debt or matrimony. And thus this parti- 
cular period, by a variety of concurrences, has obtain- 
ed an influence in their minds superior to that of 
any other number. 

They have now had seven years' war, and are not 
an inch farther on the Continent than when they be- 
gan. The superstitious and the popular part will 
conclude that it is not to be; the reasonable part will 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 533 

think they have tried an unsuccessful scheme long 
enough, and that it is in vain to try it any longer; 
and the obstinate part of them will be beaten out, 
unless, consistently with their former sagacity, they 
get over the matter at once by passing a neAV Declara- 
tory Act, to hind Time in all cases whatsoever, or declare 
him a rebel. 

I observe that the affair of Captain Asgill seems 
to die away. It has probably been protracted on the 
part of Clinton and Carleton to gain time enough to 
state the matter to the Ministr}^, where, following 
close on that of Colonel Hayne, it will create new 
embarrassments; and I strongly believe that a sus- 
pension of his fate, still holding it in terrorem, will 
operate on a greater quantity of their passions and 
vices, and restrain them more than his execution. 
However, the change of measures that seems to be 
taking place, gives a new cast to former designs; 
and if the case, without the execution, can be so 
managed as to answer all the purposes of the latter, 
it will look infinitely better hereafter, when the sen- 
sations that now provoke, and the circumstances that 
would immediately justify his exit, shall be forgotten 
or but faintly remembered. Wishing your Excellency 
every happiness and prosperity, I remain 

Your obliged and obedient, humble servant, 

Thomas Paine. 



FROM BRIGADIER-GENERAL STARK. 

Derryfield, 23 September, 1782. 

My dear Sir, 
Since my arrival at New Hampshire, I have been 
exercised with almost every perplexity, pain and trou-

ble, that a shattered constitution could entail. Dur- 
ing the course of the winter, and greater part of the 
spring and summer, I was scarce able to ride five 
miles; but, as the autumn begins to advance, I find 
my health gradually returning, and had thoughts of 
taking a ride to camp, in case I could have found 
cash enough in the State to defray my expenses. 
But, after repeated applications for a sum voted me 
by Congress in the month of September, 1781, I am 
at length informed (trifling as the sum is) that the 
money is not in the Treasury of the State, and no 
immediate prospect of matters being in a better situ- 
ation. In this case, I would beg your Excellency's 
advice. Money I have none, and my private fortune 
scarce competent to the support of a numerous off- 
spring, which Heaven has been pleased to bestow. 
Congress undoubtedly expected that the State would 
pay me what they voted, and the requisition the 
General Assembly agreed to accept ; but the Treasury 
is empty, and no money in the State to replenish it. 
However, should your Excellency think my presence 
at any place in the army necessary for the good of 
my country, I will endeavour, upon the shortest notice, 
to prepare myself to comply with your commands. 

This State has exceeded all expectations in raising 
their recruits ; yet there is still a number deficient, 
which probably may not be got very soon. And, 
indeed, it is not surprising that the affairs of this 
State should be very irregular, during its present 
complicated, unsettled form of government. 

The General Assembly, sensible of the impractica- 
bility of paying the tax for this year in cash, have 
resolved the same be paid in the different species 
of the produce of the country; in consequence of 
which, a considerable number of beef-cattle has been 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 535 

collected, and many more will no doubt be soon rais- 
ed, for the use of the army. 

Most sincerely wishing you success, that your path 
on the theatre of glory may still continue to shine 
with its usual splendor, and that you may soon be 
able to restore to your country a safe, honorable, 
and lasting tranquillity, is the ardent desire of your 
most obedient, 

Most devoted, and very humble servant, 

John Stark. 



FROM MAJOR-GENERAL GREENE. 

Head- Quarters, Ashley Hill, 4 October, 1782. 

Sir, 

I am much obliged by your Excellency's long and 
communicative letters of the 9th of July and 6th of 
August. Since my letter of the 26th of August, the 
evacuation of Charleston is reduced to a certainty. 
The following disposition, it is said, is to be made 
of the troops in garrison. 

Lord Rawdon's corps, which is put upon the British 
establishment as the one hundred and fifth regiment, 
is going directly to Ireland. Governor Martin's corps 
is drafted into the North Carolina volunteers, which, 
with the South Carolina royalists, and the King's 
Carolina rangers, and the refugees, are going to St. 
Augustine, to relieve the British troops at that place. 
The Georgia loyalists are incorporated with the King's 
Carolina rangers. It is said these troops are to sail 
on Sunday. After these troops are gone, there will 
remain in Charleston; the residue of the guards the 
seventeenth, twenty-third, thirty-third, and seventy-first 
regiments; five companies of the eighty-second; the 



536 LETTEKS TO WASHINGTON. 

flank companies of tlie eiglitj-fourth ; a detachment of 
British artillery, the third, sixty-third, and sixty-fourth 
regiments ; the Hessian corps of A Dittforth, 

and Bening; a detachment of Hessian artillery and 
Yagers ; with the American corps, the New York vol- 
unteers, the King's American regiment, the Prince of 
Wales's regiment, the first and second battalions of 
Delancey's, and the second battalion of New Jersey 
volunteers. These are to join the troops at New 
York; but whether at that j)lace, or on their passage 
to some other port, is uncertain, as it seems to be 
a matter fully established here that New Y'ork is to 
be evacuated. 

What is the object of the British Ministry, or the 
British Commander, in drawing off the troops from 
this country, is difficult to tell. I confess it looks 
like an approaching peace ; and yet I cannot but 
have my doubts. Reports say that Sir Guy Carleton 
is to go to Canada, and that Lord Cornwallis is to 
command in the West Indies. This disposition is 
equivocal, as it points both to war or peace, only upon 
a different plan. Could Great Britain humble the 
pride of France by some lucky stroke, I should not 
be surprised to find them forming new attacks upon 
us. But if they cannot reduce the navy of France, 
they may embrace a peace, as least ruinous to their 
affairs, however mortifying to their pride. 

I wrote your Excellency on the 12th of August a 
pretty full state of all matters in this quarter, and 
wish your final determination with respect to the dis- 
position of the troops to the southward. I find, by a 
resolution of Congress, no State is to be credited for 
troops not enlisted agreeably to the resolutions of 
Congress on that subject. Whether those men, draft- 
ed in North Carolina for eighteen months, will be 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 537 

brouoht into service under these circumstances, I can- 
not determine. They ought to have been in camp 
long since, if they had marched agreeably to my or- 
ders ; but I have not heard of one man being on 
the march. On the contrary, reports say the State 
will not permit them to come. Should these troops 
not come forward, and the others march northwardly, 
it will leave the Southern States exceedingly defence- 
less, and much exposed even to the inroads of the 
troops in East Florida and the attacks from the In- 
dians. 

On our possessing Charleston, the fortifications will 
come under consideration. My object would be to 
render it sufficiently strong to protect its trade 
against sudden descents of three or four thousand ; 
but, when a force invades it that is superior to the 
natural strength of the country, it must fall ; and to 
incur a large expense in the fortification, and sacri- 
fice the garrison only to protract its fall for a few 
days, will be neither wise nor prudent. I should re- 
commend, therefore, w^henever there appears a force 
sufficient to possess the town by regular approaches, 
to abandon it, and to have the principal magazine of 
the country at Camden. 

To leave the town wdthout any fortifications, will 
render trade so unsafe as to be highly injurious to 
the public finances ; besides, the perpetual alarms to 
which the inhabitants will be constantly exposed, will 
render their situation exceedingly disagreeable. All 
the Southern States are in a deplorable situation, and 
will require a great deal of nursing and care to es- 
tablish good government and give a proper spur to 
agriculture and commerce. At present there are no 
Courts of Justice in any of the States, and it is dan- 
gerous travelling in almost every part of the country. 



538 LETTEKS TO WASHINGTON. 

from the great number of robbers and private plun- 
derers that infest the roads. From these circumstan- 
ces your Excellency can judge how feeble must be 
the efforts of a people in this situation, reduced to 
poverty by continual depredations. 

I have received orders from the Secretary of War 
to collect the minds of the officers for the reform of 
the army, agreeably to the resolution of Congress of 
the 7th of August. I have taken the sentiments of 
the officers here, and forwarded them to the respect- 
ive States, to have the business completed. That part 
of the plan which proposes filling the Staff from the 
retiring officers, I fear will not be found eligible. 
The consideration proposed is by no means a sufficient 
encouragement to induce suitable characters to engage ; 
and if the appointments are confined to the retiring 
officers alone, it may be difficult to find suitable cha- 
racters. Good Staff-Officers facilitate the operations 
and business of an army greatly, and the want of 
such embarrasses it exceedingly. I am not certain 
that I comprehend the intentions of Congress fully, 
and therefore can say little on the subject. 

This army has been exceedingly sickly in the 
months of August and September, and remains so 
still, as your Excellency will see by the returns. 
The enemy have been equally so. After I wrote to 
you of the enemy's operations to the southward, 
General Gist took one of their galleys. Major Fra- 
zer attempted a surprise upon General Marion, but 
was repulsed, with the loss of one officer killed, two 
wounded, and ten or twelve dragoons killed and 
wounded. These are all the military occurrences 
which have happened since that period. I have the 
honor to be, with great respect, your Excellency's 
Most obedient and most humble servant, 

Nathanael Greene. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 539 

FROM GOVERNOR CLINTON. 

Poughkeepsie, 20 October, 1782. 

Sir, 

I was this morning honored with your Excellency's 
letter of the 19th instant. When I transmitted the 
affidavits, &c., inclosed in my last, I was sensible of 
the delicacy entertained by your Excellency respect- 
ing 3'onr interference with the internal police of the 
French army ; but, as the persons concerned in the 
dispute were Americans, I should have had great re- 
luctance in making the application to Count Rocham- 
beau. I was in hopes, too, that the mere knowledge 
of your Excellency's having been applied to on the 
subject, would have induced the parties to have com- 
promised the matter, which I still hope will be the 
case. 

I very candidly confess I am of opinion with your 
Excellency, that nothing extraordinary is to be ap- 
prehended from the late accounts we have had of 
the collection of the enemy's forces at the Isle-aux- 
Noix and Oswego. And this sentiment I expressed 
to Lord Stirling, in the first communication I made 
to him of the intelligence I had received ; though I 
thought it my duty, as I mentioned to your Excel- 
lency, to order a part of the militia to be held in 
readiness. I learn, however, that the frontier inhabit- 
ants are much alarmed at those hostile appearances ; 
and I am therefore very apprehensive that, if any 
part of the troops on the northern and western fron- 
tiers were to be removed before the season is some- 
what farther advanced, and thereby even the possi- 
bility of the enemy's visiting them with large parties 
be removed, it might create great uneasiness among 



540 LETTEllS TO WASHINGTON. 

them, and perhaps induce the more exposed to aban- 
don their settlements, and remove into the interior 
parts of the State ; which woukl be exceedingly dis- 
tressing to themselves, and injurious to the public. 
Indeed, if it might be consistent with your Excellen- 
cy's views, I should conceive that the continuing of 
a small regular force to the northward during the 
winter, might be attended with good consequences, 
especially as they may be comfortably accommodated. 
I have the honor to be, with the highest respect and 
esteem, 

Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

George Clinton. 



FROM COUNT DE ROCHAMBEAU. 

Hartford, 30 October, 1782. 



Sir, 



At the moment of my departure for Boston this 
morning, I received a letter from M. de Yaudreuil, 
saying that he is sorry to have appointed the 8th 
of next month for my arrival with my troops at 
Boston, because the men-of-war at Portsmouth are 
not yet ready, and he does not believe that he will 
be in readiness to set sail before the 20th of No- 
vember. In consequence of which, I have resolved 
to stay here four days longer ; then to go as far as 
Providence, by very short journeys, where I shall 
stay until the fleet be ready. By these means I 
shall have more time to receive intelligence from 
your Excellency concerning the motions of the ene- 
my, and to know, first, if Admiral Pigot is really 
gone with a part of the fleet to the West Indies ; 
secondly, if the counter order for the non-evacuation 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 541 

of Cliaiieston lias really been sent as it is reported; 
thirdly, if this counter order is arrived timely enough 
to hinder the evacuation; on which three objects I 
beg of your Excellency to inform me, as you know 
that on these objects depends the embarkation of the 
troops, or their not embarking. 

I shall leave two hussars at Boston, and two at 
Voluntown, to bring me your Excellency's letters at 
Providence. I am, with respect and personal attach- 
ment. Sir, 

Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 

Le Compte de Rochambeau. 



FROM MAJOR-GENER.\L GREENE. 

Head- Quarters, Asliley Hill, 10 December, 1782. 

Sir, 

I doubt not your Excellency expected to hear of 
the evacuation of Charleston long before this. The 
enemy are not yet gone, although now just upon the 
eve of their departure. In two days more, the town 
will be free. 

Your letter of the 23d of September I just ac- 
knowledged in November, with a promise to give it 
a more full answer at a future day. The Minister at 
War sent me an order for incorporating and arrang- 
ing the troops of the several States, agreeably to the 
resolution of Congress of the 7th of August. I have 
formed one complete regiment out of the Pennsylva- 
nia troops, and one out of the Maryland troops, and 
sent the remainder belonging to both States home. 
Few of those of the Pennsylvania line have longer to 
serve than January next ; the Maryland troops have

most of them a longer time to serve. I have sent 
home also the Delaware troops, and shall send the 
detachment of the fourth regiment of cavalry, under 
Captain Gill, to Virginia, to join the rest of the regi- 
ment in that State. I believe, as soon as the enemy- 
are gone, I shall send the legion to Virginia. The 
first and third regiments being incorporated, will af- 
ford sufficient protection to this country from present 
appearances. I have not fully determined how to 
dispose of the legion, nor can I, until I am better 
satisfied with respect to the force at St. Augustine, 
to which place all the Provincial corps contained in 
the inclosed list are gone. The British troops that 
were there have joined those at Charleston. 

By one observation in your Excellency's letter, re- 
specting offensive operations, it appears a doubt with 
you whether you have authority to order an enter- 
prise against St. Augustine. As there is a doubt 
on the matter, I shall remain quiet until I am more 
fully instructed. But if we had orders to undertake 
it, the thing would be impracticable without a con- 
voy to convey the provisions and stores by water, if 
not the troops also. But more of this, hereafter. As 
to an Indian expedition, I perfectly agree with your 
Excellency that there is nothing to apprehend from 
them after British influence once fails ; and by all 
I can learn, the savages are generally inclined to 
peace, except a few of the more restless and en- 
terprising young men, who are ambitious of military 
honors. 

By intelligence from Charleston, the British troops 
are going to the West Indies. The Hessians, and such 
of the Provincial corps as remain, are going to New 
York, Avhich is not to be evacuated till spring; nor 
do I believe it will then, if the war continues. I

am afraid the Southern States can produce but few 
men in the fiekl, by any possible exertion in their 
power. South Carolina and Georgia I am sure can- 
not. The force that North Carolina will have in the 
field, after a few days, will not exceed seven hun- 
dred men. There is a detachment of Virginians here, 
which had better be completed from the troops levy- 
ing in Virginia to a regiment, or march from here, 
Srud join those in the State. I shall wait your orders 
on the subject. 

Whatever disposition you intend to make with the 
troops in this department, I could wish to bo made 
acquainted with it as early as possible, to be in rea- 
diness to carry your orders into execution as early 
and as fully as possible. South Carolina and Georgia 
have not more than one small battalion of troops, and 
those not of the best kind. The enemv's force at 
St. Augustine is not contemptible, which, aided by 
the savages, and the militia, now numerous from its 
being a place of resort for the Tories, may make a 
serious impression upon Georgia. The State, without 
a considerable force to protect it for some time, can- 
not recover from the ravages it has felt, or even 
prosecute any trade or agriculture. Charleston will 
be stripped, and left defenceless, until new fortifica- 
tions can be raised, and cannon provided. In this 
situation, and being altogether uncertain of the ene- 
my's future plan of operations, I hope it will not be 
thought that I have detained too many troops for the 
present. I am, with great respect and perfect esteem, 

Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant, 

Nathanael Greene. 



544 LETTEKS TO WASHINGTON. 

FROM COLONEL PICKERING. 

Newburg, 18 January, 1783. 

Sir, 

Your Excellency had but just left my quarters this 
evening, when a Deputy-Sheriff of Ulster arrested me. 
He showed me a writ, of which I beg leave to in- 
close a copy. To prevent any injury to the public, 
by taking me from my office, I gave bail, and have 
wrote to an attorney to defend the suit. 

I thought it my duty to apprise your Excellency 
of this event. The plaintiff is a Melancthon L. Wool- 
sey. I do not know him, nor ever heard his name 
before ; but a gentleman, who happens to be at my 
office, tells me that he is a trader at Poughkeepsie, 
who has been purchasing up specie certificates (signed 
by me, and issued pursuant to an act of Congress of 
the 23d of August, 1780), at a very great discount. 

The suit, therefore, is doubtless grounded on such 
certificates. But, on the same ground, some thou- 
sands of suits may be brought against me in this 
State alone. 

Congress, by an act of the 19th of March, 1782, 
recommended to the several States to pass laws to 
exempt public officers from such suits. Some com- 
plied with the recommendation. This State deliberat- 
ed upon it, and a bill passed the Assembly; but the 
Council of Revision offered objections, and it was 
dropped. To subject public officers to such actions, 
is doubtless cruel oppression. At the same time, 
the community is burdened with a great expense. If 
such suits be multiplied, and the numerous public 
creditors have all as just cause of action, they cannot 
even benefit the prosecutors ; for the property of pub- 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 545 

lie officers, compared with the vastness of the public 
debts, is but as the small dust of the balance. There 
is but one class of people who can derive advantage 
from such prosecutions. They, indeed, will reap a 
rich harvest, if all, or a majority of the public credit- 
ors, become equally unreasonable with the few that 
have hitherto commenced such suits. With the writ, 
the Sheriff presented me a letter from Mr. Benson, of 
which the inclosed is a copy. 

I am singularly unfortunate in being subjected to 
suits on specie certificates ; for it was at my instance 
that Congress passed the act authorizing me to issue 
them. My motive was to do the best possible jus- 
tice to the public creditors, by fixing their dues in 
specie, and allowing them the interest of their money, 
which I saw it was impossible for the public promptly 
to pay. I am, with the greatest respect. 

Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

Timothy Pickering. 



FROM THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE. 

Cadiz, 5 February, 1783. 

My DEAR General, 

Were you but such a man as Julius Ccesar, or the 
King of Prussia, I should almost be sorry for you at 
the end of the great tragedy where you are acting 
such a part. But, with my dear General, I rejoice 
at the blessings of a peace where our noble ends 
have been secured. Remember our Valley-Forge 
times ; and, from a recollection of past dangers and 
labors, Ave shall be still more pleased at our present 
comfortable situation. What a sense of pride and 
46* 



546 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

satisfaction I feel, when I think of the times that 
have determined my engaging in the American cause ! 

As for you, my dear General, who truly can say 
you have done all this, what must your virtuous and 
good heart feel, on the happy instant when the re- 
volution you have made is now firmly established ! 
I cannot but envy the happiness of my grandchild- 
ren, when they will be about celebrating and wor- 
shipping your name. To have one of their ancestors 
among your soldiers, to know he had the good for- 
tune to be the friend of your heart, will be the eter- 
nal honor in which they shall glory ; and to the 
eldest of them, as long as my posterity will last, I 
shall delegate the fiivor you have been pleased to 
confer upon my son George. 

At the prospect of a peace, I had prepared to go 
to America. You know me too well, my dear Gene- 
ral, not to be sensible of the j)leasure I anticipated 
in the hope to embrace you, and to be reunited to 
my fellow-soldiers. Never did any thing please me 
so much as the delightful prospect I had before me. 
But, on a sudden, I have been obliged to defer my 
darling plan; and, as I have at last been blessed 
with a letter of yours, I know you approve of my 
lengthening my furlough upon political accounts. The 
inclosed copy of a letter to Congress, and my official 
letter to Mr. Livingston, which I request him to com- 
municate to you, will fully inform you of the reasons 
that urge me to post off to INIadrid. From there it 
will be better for me to go to Paris; and in the 
month of June I will embark for America. Happy, 
ten times happy, shall I be in embracing my dear 
General, my father, my best friend, whom I love 
with an affection and a respect, which I too well feel 
not to know it is impossible to me to express it. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 547 

In my letters to Congress you -will also see, that, 
independent of the plans I had been permitted to 
propose to you, in the execution of which we were 
to have an immense naval and land force, it had 
been at last obtained I should enter Canada. I had 
my hopes to embrace you at Montreal, or at least to 
be met there by a detachment from the army. The 
necessity of a diversion was the ground upon which 
we had obtained the Eling of Spain's consent. But 
now those schemes are over, and we must rejoice in 
the happiness of those you have rescued from the 
hands of British tyranny. 

Now, my dear General, that you are going to en- 
joy some ease and quiet, permit me to propose a 
plan to you, which might become greatly beneficial 
to the black part of mankind. Let us unite in pur- 
chasing a small estate, where we may try the experi- 
ment to free the negroes, and use them only as te- 
nants. Such an example as yours might render it a 
general practice ; and if we succeed in America, I will 
cheerfully devote a part of my time to render the 
method fashionable in the West Indies. If it be a 
wild scheme, I had rather be mad this way, than to 
be thought wise in the other task. 

I am so anxious to hear from you, my dear Gene- 
ral, and to let you hear from me, that I have sent 
my own servant with a vessel, upon which I have 
prevailed to set him ashore on the Maryland coast. 
Before I leave France, I hope I may receive your 
answers, and I will be directed where to find you on 
my arrival. Upon that intelligence I depend to re- 
gulate my course, and if you are at home, 1 shall 
steer for the Bay of Chesapeake. 

Your influence, my dear General, cannot be better 
employed than in inducing the people of America to 



548 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

strengthen their Federal Union. It is a work in 
which it behooves you to be concerned. I look upon 
it as a necessary measure. Depend upon it, my dear 
General, that European politics will be apt to create 
divisions among the States. Now is the time when 
the powers of Congress must be fixed, the boundaries 
determined, and articles of confederation revised. It 
is a work in which every well-wisher to America 
must desire to be concerned. It is the finishintr 
stroke, that is wanting to the perfection of the tem- 
ple of liberty. 

As to the army, my dear General, what will be its 
fate ? I hope their country will be grateful. Should 
the reverse be the case, I should indeed feel very 
unhappy. Will part of the army be kept together ? 
If not, I hope we shall not forfeit our noble titles of 
officers and soldiers in the American army ; so that, 
in case of danger, we may be called upon from every 
quarter, and reunite in the defence of a country, 
which the army has so effectually, so heroically serv- 
ed. I long to know what measures will be taken. 
Indeed, my dear General, I depend upon your good- 
ness for a very minute letter, not only on public ac- 
counts, but also because I want to be acquainted 
with every one of your personal concerns. 

Adieu, adieu, my dear General Had the Spaniards 
got common sense, I could have dispensed with that 
cursed trip to Madrid; but I am called upon by a 
sense of my duty to America. I must go, and defer 
the happy voyage. My best, most affectionate re- 
spects wait upon Mrs. Washington. Now we are go- 
ing to quarrel ; for I must urge your returning with 
me to France. Her accompanying you there, is the 
best way I know of to compromise the matter; and 
so she will make Madame de Lafayette and me per- 
fectly happy. 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 549 

I request your Excellency will please to present 
my compliments to Tilghman, George, and all the 
family. Remember me to all my friends in the army. 
I am so hurried in sending the vessel away, that I 
will Avrite to them by other opportunities. They know 
my love to them, and I have a grateful sense of their 
friendship. Be so kind, my dear General, as to re- 
member me to your much-respected mother. Her 
happiness I heartily partake. Adieu, once more, my 
dear General. With every sentiment of love and re- 
spect, I am forever. 

Your most devoted and affectionate friend, 

Lafayette. 



FROM ALEXANDER HAMILTON, IN CONGRESS.'-' 

Philadelphia, 7 February, 1783. 

Sir, 
Flattering myself that your knowledge of me will 
induce you to receive the observations I make, as 
dictated by a regard to the public good, I take the 
liberty to suggest to you my ideas on some matters 
of delicacy and importance. I view the present junc- 
ture as a very interesting one. I need not observe 
how far the temper and situation of the army may 
make it so. The state of our finances was perhaps 
never more critical. I am under injunctions, which 
will not permit me to disclose some facts that Avould 
at once demonstrate this position; but I think it pro- 
bable you will be possessed of them through another 
channel. It is, however, certain that there has scarcely 
been a period of the revolution which called more for 

* Colonel Hamilton had taken his seat in Congress, as a Delegate 
from the State of New York, on the 25th of November, 1782. 



550 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

wisdom and decision in Congress. Unfortunately for 
us, we are a body not governed by reason or fore- 
sight, but by circumstances. It is probable we shall 
not take the proper measures; and, if we do not, a 
few months may open an embarrassing scene. This 
will be the case, whether we have peace or a con- 
tinuance of the war. 

If the war continues, it would seem that the army 
must, in June, subsist itself to defend the couiitr//. If 
peace should take place, it tvill subsist itself to pro- 
cure justice to itself. It appears to be a prevailing 
opinion in the army, that the disposition to recom- 
pense their services will cease with the necessity for 
them ; and that, if they once lay down their arms, 
they part with the means of obtaining justice. It is 
to be lamented that appearances afford too much 
ground for their distrust. 

It becomes a serious inquiry, What is the true line 
of policy ? The claims of the army, urged with mo- 
deration, but with firmness, may oj)erate on those 
weak minds which are influenced by their apprehen- 
sions more than by their judgments, so as to produce 
a concurrence in the measures which the exigencies 
of affairs demand. They may add weight to the ap- 
plications of Congress to the several States. So far 
a useful turn may be given to them. But the diffi- 
culty will be to keep a complaining and suffering 
army within the bounds of moderation. 

This 3^our Excellency's influence must effect. In 
order to it, it will be advisable not to discountenance 
their endeavour to procure redress, but rather, by the 
intervention of confidential and prudent persons, to 
take the direction of them. This, however, must not 
appear; it is of moment to the public tranquillity 
that your Excellency should preserve the confidence 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 551 

of the army without losing that of the people. This 
will enable you, in case of extremity, to guide the 
torrent, and to bring order, perhaps even good, out 
of confusion. It is a part that requires address, but 
it is one which your own situation as well as the 
welfore of the community points out. 

I will not conceal from your Excellency a truth, 
Avhich it is necessary you should know. An idea is 
propagated in the army, that delicacy, carried to an 
extreme, prevents your espousing its interests with 
sufficient warmth. The falsehood of this opinion no 
one can be better acquainted with than myself; but 
it is not the less mischievous for being false. Its 
tendency is to impair that influence which you may 
exert with advantage, should any commotions unhap- 
pily ensue, to moderate the pretensions of the army, 
and make their conduct correspond with their duty. 

The great desideratum at present is the establish- 
ment of general funds, which alone can do justice to 
the creditors of the United States (of whom the array 
forms the most meritorious class), restore public cre- 
dit, and supply the future wants of Government. 
This is the object of all men of sense ; in this the 
influence of the army, properly directed, may coope- 
rate. 

The intimations I have thro^vn out will suffice to 
give your Excellency a proper conception of my sen- 
timents. You will judge of their reasonableness or 
fallacy ; but I persuade myself you will do justice to 
my motives. I have the honor to be, with great re- 
spect. 

Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 

Alexander Hamilton. 

P. S. General Knox has the confidence of the

safely made use of Situated as I am, your Excel-

vations. 



FROM ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.'"' 

Philadelphia, 26 February, 1783. 

Dear Sir, 

In compliance with the directions of Congress, con-^ 
tained in the inclosed resolution,-}- I have the honor 
to inform your Excellency that our last despatches, 
dated in October, announced a disposition in the bel- 
ligerent powers to terminate the war by a general 
peace. The Court of London, whose sincerity was 
most suspected because it Avas to make the greatest 
sacrifices, appears to have smoothed the way, by the 
commission to Mr. Oswald, which your Excellency 
has seen, empowering him to treat with the Thirteen 
United States of America. Mr. Hayneval, brother to 
Mr, Gerard, having been sent from France to sound 
the intentions of the British Ministry, returned per- 
fectly satisfied of their sincerity, 

A little before our despatches were closed, our Mi- 
nisters had delivered three j^i'opositions to the Court 
of London. They consisted of three general heads, 
which comprised our right to the fisheries, the extent 
of our territories, and commercial objects. Though

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 553 

these propositions contained all we could ask, under 
each of these heads, yet Mr. Oswald gave our Minis- 
ters reason to conclude that they would be granted; 
which I am inclined to believe they have been, in 
their fullest extent, from the lead which our Ministers 
have taken in signing Provisional Articles. 

France, Spain, and Holland had made their propo- 
sals, so that the King of Great Britain was perfectly 
apprised of their demands before he met his Parlia- 
ment. There is little room, therefore, to doubt, when 
these facts are compared with the speech of His Bri- 
tannic Majesty, that, unless some unforeseen event 
should arise, a general peace will be concluded be- 
fore the opening of the next campaign. 

I was honored by your letter of the 18th, and 
have delivered the one inclosed to Mr. Jefferson, who 
is detained, by order of Congress, till they receive 
more certain advices as to the issue of the negotia- 
tion. I should also acknowledge the receipt of your 
favor of the 8th of January, which I found here on 
my return from the country. I think with you, that 
the British Administration will choose to take the ad- 
vice of Parliament on the terms of peace, before they 
agree to them. Yet they have gone every length 
with respect to us. In this, however, they are per- 
fectly safe ; as the opposition have, all along, dictated 
that measure, so that, on tliis quarter, they are se- 
cure from their attacks. More circumspection will be 
necessary in adjusting the Articles with the other 
belligerent powers. To this cause we may probably 
attribute the delays that the business still seems to 
struggle with. 

Be pleased. Sir, to accept my compliments, and 
those of my family, who join me in returning our

best respects to Mrs. Washington. I have the honor 
to be, dear Sir, with great respect and esteem, 
Your most obedient, humble servant,

FROM JOSEPH JONES, IN CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, 27 February, 1783. 

Dear Sir, 

Your favors of the 14:th of December last and the 
11th instant, have been duly received. A series of 
ill health through the fall and the greatest part of 
the winter, which, until very lately, rendered my at- 
tendance in Congress seldom, and very irregular, 
must be my apology for suffering the first to remain 
so long unanswered. 

Congress have been, for some time past, almost 
wholly employed in devising some general and ade- 
quate funds for paying the interest, and in time sink- 
ing the principal, of the public debt, as well as to 
provide for future loans, should the continuance of the 
war render borrowing necessary. Difficulties, appa- 
rently insurmountable, presented themselves in almost 
every stage of the business, owing to the different 
circumstances of the several States, and the necessity 
that the subjects, selected for taxation to form the 
funds, should operate throughout them all, generally 
and equally, or nearly so, to make them acceptable. 

After opening and discussing a variety of questions, 
no object has been yet discovered to which so few 
objections lie, as the impost duty formerly recom- 
mended to the States, and which, with some alter- 
ations from the former plan, to obviate the objections 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 555 

that have been raised, has been agreed to in a Com- 
mittee of the Whole, and will, I think, be finally 
adopted. AVhat this duty, when granted by the 
States, will amount to annually, is very uncertain. 
In time of peace, there can be no doubt but it will 
be considerable, and for years prove an increasing- 
fund ', but it is thought by no means adequate to the 
payment of the interest, and sinking the principal, 
of the national debt. Other means have, therefore, 
been considered in aid of the impost duty, land, polls, 
salt, wine, spirits, tea, &c. ; these last, being what are 
called luxuries, it is thought may bear a small tax in 
addition to the impost dut3^ I fear, at present, few 
of them will go down; and that we shall be obliged, 
at last, to rest the payment of the public debt upon 
the mode prescribed by the Confederation (requisitions 
proportioned on the States according to the value of 
land, buildings, &c., a plan for obtaining which scale 
of proportion has been digested, and agreed upon in 
Congress, and will immediately go on to the States), 
and the produce of the five per cent, duty, if grant- 
ed. A small poll-tax, did not the constitution of 
Maryland stand in the way, might probably succeed, 
as it would operate more equally, perhaps, than any 
other, and may be adopted, allowing Maryland to sub- 
stitute some other adequate and productive fund in 
its room. 

A short time will bring to a conclusion our efforts 
on this business, which I am in hopes will terminate 
in the adoption of such measures as may be accepta- 
ble to the States, and produce the granting such 
funds as will restore public credit, give value to the 
great mass of depreciated certificates, and enable Con- 
gress to render to every class of the public creditors 
ample justice. Congress have the purest intentions 



556 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

towards the public creditors, and will use their best 
exertions in obtaining from the States the means to 
do them speedy and complete justice. 

Such is their opinion of the merit and services of 
the army, that, did it not wound the sense of justice, 
they want not the inclination to give them the pre- 
ference to any other class of creditors ; but equity 
and sound policy forbid discrimination and partial 
distinctions. One ground of discontent in the army, 
and on which they found the opinion that justice is 
not intended to be done to them, is the delay in 
complying with their requests ; but, with those ac- 
quainted with the deliberations of public bodies, and 
especially with so mixed a body as that of Congress, 
allowances will be made for slow determination. Every 
class of public creditors must know the inability of 
Congress to pay their demands, unless furnished with 
the means by the several States; and the exertions 
of that body have not been wanting, heretofore, to 
obtain the means, though they have not produced the 
desired effect. The measures now digesting will, there 
is good reason to expect, prove more efficacious for 
obvious reasons. 

Reports are freely circulated here, that there are 
dangerous combinations in the army ; and, within a 
few days past, it has been said, they are about to 
declare they will not disband until their demands are 
complied with. I trust these reports are not well 
founded, and that the army will exercise, awhile 
longer at least, that patient forbearance, which hath 
hitherto so honorably distinguished them. To you it 
must be unnecessary to observe, that when once all 
confidence between the civil and military authority 
is lost, by intemperate conduct, or an assumption of 
improper power, especially by the military body, the 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 557 

Rubicon is passed, and to retreat will be very diffi- 
cult, from the fears and jealousies that will unavoid- 
ably subsist between the two bodies. To avoid, there- 
fore, the adoption by the army of any hasty and 
rash measure, should employ the attention, and draw 
forth the exertions of every worthy officer in it ; for 
from these alone can opposition be expected. 

The ambition of some, and the pressure of distress 
in others, may produce dangerous combinations, found- 
ed on the pretence that justice is delayed and will 
be refused to them. The pretext is plausible and en- 
snaring, and may draw into engagements the unsus- 
pecting, honest soldier, from which it will be difficult 
to extricate himself, even when he sees the dangers 
they lead to. If there are men in the army who 
harbour wicked designs, and are determined to blow 
the coals of discord, they will gradually endeavour to 
hurt the reputation of those averse to their projects, 
and by sinister practices lessen their weight and in- 
fluence among the soldiery. I have lately heard 
there are those who are abandoned enough to use 
their arts to lessen your popularity in the arni}^ ; in 
hopes, ultimately, the weight of your opposition will 
prove no obstacle to their ambitious designs. If this 
be true, and they are likely to succeed, I own it 
will prove a bad prognostic of the future. I shall 
be among the number of those who entertain fears 
of the army, and doubt that peace will not be fol- 
lowed by its usual blessings to America. Whether to 
temporize, or oppose with steady, unremitting firm- 
ness, what is supposed to be in agitation of danger- 
ous tendency, or that may be agitated, must be left 
to your own sense of propriety, and better judgment. 

With respect to the business of Vermont, I think 
you need not be uneasy from apprehensions that the

558 LETTERS TO WASHINGTON. 

army, or any part of them, Y/ill be employed to en- 
force a compliance with the act of the 5th of De- 
cember last, should the people of Vermont refuse a 
compliance with that demand ; at least for some time 
to come, if ever. To go into detail upon this mat- 
ter would be prolix, and rather improper for the 
scope of a letter. It cannot be denied, that the act 
of Congress of the 20th of August [1781], opened the 
prospect to Vermont of an acknowledgment of their 
independence, and admission into the Union. Al- 
though it gave ground of hope, it Avas not conclu- 
sive ; and the Legislature of Vermont, absolutely re- 
jecting the offer, and recommending to the people an 
inviolable adherence to their union and encroachments 
on the adjoining States, as well as other unwarrant- 
able acts they have unjustly concealed from the pub- 
lic in their remonstrance, released Congress from their 
offer, and left them at liberty afterwards to accept or 
refuse, as they saw fit, when Vermont, repenting of 
her conduct at a future period, complied. 

A particular state of things produced the act of 
Congress ; a change of circumstances afterAvards dic- 
tated the delay in determining on their proposition, 
and the report of a Committee, to whom it was re- 
ferred. This report authorizes observations I decline 
to make. This proceeding in Congress they style 
a violation of the compact entered into with them. 
There always has been a strong opposition to the 
claims of Vermont, and their admission into the 
Union. Virginia has generally been among the num- 
ber of her opponents, not so much, perhaps, upon 
the question of independence, as the impolicy of her 
admission into the Union while several very import- 
ant questions of local concern remained undetermined; 
and, until these great points are settled, the consent 



THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. 559 

of Virginia, I expect, will be withheld, and, if before 
obtained, it will be a sacrifice of her opinion to the 
peace and common weal of the United States. 

If Vermont confines herself to the limits assigned 
to her, and ceases to encroach upon and disturb the 
quiet of the adjoining States, at the same time avoid- 
ing combinations, or arts, hostile to the United States, 
she may be at rest within her limits, and, by patient 
waiting the convenient time, may ere long be admit- 
ted to the privileges of Union. The influence Ver- 
mont has gained in 'the army, and in some of the 
States that espouse her cause, do little credit to the 
parties concerned; and to this influence is in a great 
measure to be ascribed the variable, indecisive con- 
duct of Congress respecting the claims of that people. 
The remonstrance states the receipt of official letters 
recommending a comj)liance with the act of Congress, 
and intimates yours to be of the number; and that 
these communications influenced them to comply. 
The assertion is wrong as to yours, and may be 
equally false as to others, and is one proof, among 
a variety of others, of the disingenuity and want of 
candor in Vermont. It exhibits, also, very little re- 
spect to this body, when they ascribe their com- 
pliance to other motives than the recommendation of 
Congress. 

Seven States have voted five years' whole pay as 
the commutation for the half-pay to the officers; but 
the resolution has not passed the House, being post- 
poned, for the present, from an opinion prevalent with 
many, that the consent of nine States is necessary 
to give it validity. Delaware and Georgia are absent; 
were they represented, probably the vote would be 
sufficient. 

That we shall have peace soon, is almost reduced

to a certainty; but my fears are, it will not be 
attended with those blessings generally expected. 
There are so many great questions, very interesting 
to particular States, unsettled, which require speedy 
determination to preserve quiet, that it is difficult to 
avoid uneasy impressions for their consequences. The 
present conjuncture, perhaps, above all others America 
has experienced, calls for good dispositions in the 
States, and moderation and wisdom in their counsels. 
May the spirit of Union govern them, is the earnest 
wish of, dear Sir, 

Your affectionate, humble servant, 

Joseph Jones.
