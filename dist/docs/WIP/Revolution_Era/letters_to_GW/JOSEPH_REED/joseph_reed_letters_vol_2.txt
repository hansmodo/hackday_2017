</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have received your favor of the 16th instant, 
directing the march of the city light-horse, for which 
the necessary orders will be given, and they will 
proceed with all possible despatch. Upon the new 
plan of our militia, there are light-horse attached to 
the troops of every county. The short time since 
the plan has been adopted has not permitted a 
thorough execution; but, if your Excellency should 
be of opinion they would be specially useful, I shall 
endeavour to have them completed as soon as may 
be. The troop of the county of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> is already well mounted, armed, and in uniform. I do 
assure your Excellency every stimulus has been used 
to forward the recruits. According to information, 
they are chiefly selected, and only wait a proper 
equipment; but, as I found this was tedious in the 
country, I directed them to be sent hither, and they 
are now coming in. I am of opinion, if your Excellency could spare a few officers, say five or six, prudent and discreet, who could bear with the oddities 
and humors of the persons with whom they will 
have to do, it might forward the men; and, as it 
is proposed to set about a voluntary additional enlistment, as soon as this is over, we are sanguine enough to believe some men might be had. For 
this purpose some clever sergeants would be of great 
service. 
</p><p>
The spirit, which your Excellency seems to wish, 
I think, is recovered beyond expectation. The loss 
of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, like many other seeming misfortunes, 
may perhaps (heavy as it now appears) prove a real 
blessing to America, A measure has been set on 
foot here to establish a bank, which, from the unanimity with which it is espoused, seems likely to produce considerable advantages, and supplies to the 
army. It was at first constructed upon so narrow a 
scale as to meet with difficulties; but, being since 
enlarged, I hope will prove a more fruitful source of 
supply than the occasional expedients from time to 
time adopted. Whatever measure promotes the public good, shall have my aid and concurrence, from 
whatever quarter it proceeds. 
The ladies of the place have also caught the happy contagion, and, in a few days, Mrs. Reed will have 
the honor of writing to you on that subject. It is expected she will have a sum equal to one hundred 
thousand pounds, to be laid out according to your Excellency's direction (in the absence of Mrs. <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>) in such a way as may be thought most 
honorable and gratifying to the brave old soldiers who have borne so great a share of the burden of 
this war. I thought it best to mention it in this way to your Excellency, for your consideration, as it 
may tend to forward the benevolent scheme of the donors with despatch. I must observe, that the ladies 
have excepted such articles of necessity as clothing, &c., which the States are bound to provide. 
</p><p>
We have just heard that Mrs. <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> is upon 
the road to this city, so that we shall have the benefit of her advice and assistance here, and, if necessary, refer afterwards to your Excellency. I am, with 
the greatest respect and regard, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and very humble servant,

<p>
In Council, <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city origin'>Philadelphia</a>, <a rel="day origin" value="24">24</a> <a rel="month origin" value="11">April</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1779' rel="origin">1779</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's letter of the 20th instant has 
been laid before the Board, informing us that a 
Court-Martial will be held at camp on the 1st of 
May instant, "for the trial of <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>General Arnold</a> on the 
first, second, third, and fifth charges exhibited against 
him by this Board." 
</p><p>
We apprehend there must have been some mistake 
in the mode of transmitting this business to your Excellency, as we never exhibited any other charge 
against <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>General Arnold</a> to Congress, than that of appropriating the public wagons of the State to private 
uses, and that only that he might remain to answer. 
Nor do we think it by any means consistent with 
the duty we owe the State to be considered in the 
light of parties, as thereby we may establish a principle, under which we may either submit silently to 
injuries and insults, or follow military Courts into 
any part of the country, wherever the service may 
require the army to be. 
</p><p>
The light in which we have ever considered ourselves, and which we would wish to be considered 
by your Excellency, is as a public body, the representatives of the freemen of Pennsylvania, expressing our opinion of <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>General Arnold</a>'s conduct, founded 
upon facts disclosed to us, and answering to our own 
knowledge, asking nothing of Congress but that he 
should not continue to command in this State. The 
history of this country affords many instances of this 
proceeding in the cases of oppressive Governors, and 
it is a right which we hold independent, and unaccountable to any other power. No one doubts the 
right of a public body to praise, and this shows very 
strongly they have a power to censure, it only operating as an opinion, unaccompanied with any punishment. 
</p><p>
In the present instance, <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>General Arnold</a> refused to 
give any explanation of his conduct, though civilly 
requested, or ever offered to disprove the facts alleged ; of course we were obliged to exercise our judgments upon the evidence and proofs we had. 
At the same time we perfectly approve the trial, being of opinion, that <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>General Arnold</a>'s conduct deserves some military reprehension; and we doubt not 
the officers of the army will impartially weigh the 
duty they owe to the country, as well as the person 
charged ; and if the facts are proved, let the palliating circumstances, if there are any, operate on the 
sentence, not on the nature of the transaction. Such 
is the dependence of the army upon the transportation of this State, and such the feelings of the people upon this sort of duty, that, should the Court 
treat it as a light and trivial matter, and found an 
opinion upon any other grounds than the innocence 
of the charge, we fear it will not be practicable to 
draw forth wagons in future, be the emergency what 
it may, and it will have very bad consequences. 
</p><p>
We could have wished your Excellency had appointed a later day, or we could have had earlier 
notice. Your letter is dated the 20th instant, and 
was not received till the 22d; and, considering the 
distance of some of the witnesses, we fear it will not 
be possible to give them notice, much less to procure 
their attendance, and we presume no ex paric testimony ought to be received by the Court, Our view 
of the matter was, and it was so considered by the 
Joint Committees, that we should transmit the papers 
to your Excellency, and inform you of the names of 
the witnesses to prove the several points ; that then 
your Excellency, by your own authority, or that of 
Congress, would have procured the attendance of the 
witnesses. Two officers of Congress, not in any respect under our control, are material witnesses, of 
which we informed Congress, requesting they might 
not proceed to Carolina till their testimony could be 
had. No notice was taken of it, and they set off 
about a week ago, and, as we have reason to think, 
with a view to be absent till the trial is over. 
Colonel Fitzgerald, who is also a material witness, 
we suppose is in Virginia. 
</p><p>
As substantial justice, not a mere formality, is undoubtedly your Excellency's object on this occasion, 
we submit to your judgment whether a competent 
time for the attendance of those witnesses, at least, 
who are within reach, and the adjustment of some 
previous points, will not make a further delay necessary. These points are, at whose expense and by 
whose procurement are the witnesses to be had ; and 
whether the service will not admit of the sitting of 
the Court at some nearer point than camp. If that 
cannot be, we must rely upon your Excellency to 
give further directions for the accommodation of the 
persons who may attend in behalf of the prosecution. 
As the idea expressed in your Excellency's letter 
does not correspond with the resolve of Congress 
transmitted to us, and differs from that entertained 
by the Joint Committee of Congress, Council, and Assembly, in which it was expressly declared that this 
Board was not to be considered as a party, we trust 
the proceedings in this business will conform to this 
idea ; otherwise, besides the inconvenience above mentioned, we shall be liable to a charge of inconsistency 
not well founded. We are, Sir, with every sentiment 
of respect and regard, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servants, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jor" rel="me">JOSEPH REED</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. By the time this will reach your Excellency, there will remain but three days, so that we shall 
be glad to have as early an answer as possible ; for 
we beg leave to assure you, that no other delay is 
sought but what is necessary to proceed to business 
with effect.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's favor of the 5th instant was 
duly received, and, though it was and is the universal opinion, that the number of men under <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> is greater than can be fed, when he proceeds a little further on the expedition, yet we gave 
early and peremptory orders to the companies of 
rangers to join him, as soon as they were completed 
to any tolerable number. We also directed the militia of the adjoining counties to give all possible aid, 
as we were resolved that, should the expedition fail 
of success, no imputation should justly fall upon the 
State of Pennsylvania, Our prospects of raising these 
men were very flattering, the success in recruiting, 
for a little time, having equalled, or rather exceeded, 
our expectations ; but the Quarter-master's department having occasion for a number of bateau-men, 
and offering forty-five pounds per month, and a ration 
and a half per day, were terms so superior to what 
we had to offer, that the service has languished ever 
since, and it is very doubtful whether they will, or 
can be completed. 
</p><p>
It is a general opinion, that the boatmen might 
have been procured upon more favorable terms ; but, 
as it was a necessary service, and well meant, we 
can only wish better information had been had. 
Every State and country is limited in its powers, 
and if its resources are drawn off in one service, 
they cannot be had in another. Five hundred are engaged in this boat service, all of this State, besides 
which, the deputies, assistants, and helpers, amount 
to a great number. "We would not infer from this 
that they are unnecessary, but to account for the deficiencies of these companies, which otherwise would 
have been very complete. 
</p><p>
We beg leave to refer your Excellency to the in 
closed letter, which will show that no orders have 
been wanting on our part, and that there is every 
disposition in the officers under us to execute them, 
as far as they can. 
</p><p>
It is much to be wished that, instead of troubling 
your Excellency with this circuitous mode of application, <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a> would address himself directly 
to us. We have assured him that we will endeavour to give him every aid and assistance in our power, 
and, when it cannot be done, we shall, at least, be 
able to give him sufficient reasons. We have not 
had a line from him since he left Easton; and, though 
we know from other advices that these companies 
had not joined, we had not any information on the 
subject from the General himself. 
</p><p>
We are very sensible, Sir, that this expedition has 
received all possible aid from you. It has also been 
fostered and cherished by this State. We have drawn 
off our wagons at four pounds ten shillings per day, 
which will not pay the drivers and shoe the horses. 
We have stopped a great number of ploughs. The 
encouragement of one hundred dollars, by Congress, 
was so small, that the State added shoes, shirts, leggings, blankets, and arms, amounting to triple the sum. 
Our orders and measures since, would show your Excellency our anxiety on the subject in so striking a 
view as to exclude any supposition that any thing 
is omitted, in our power, to procure the desired sucss. But we cannot change the course of things 
and order of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, to advance <a href='/results.php?tla=jsu' rel='colleague'>General Sullivan</a>'s views, be they ever so apparently salutary ; and 
we hope his recollection of past periods, wherein ho 
has seen you rise superior to disappointments and 
deficiencies far more important, will strengthen his 
mind to obviate those which may occur to him. With 
perfect esteem and respect, I have the honor to be, 
your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient, and very humble servant,

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Your kind and truly obliging favor, of the 28th 
ultimo, came safely to hand, and, the oftener I pe 
ruse it, the more fully sensible I am of the justice 
and importance of its contents. I do not know by 
what means the expected assistance from France has 
been procured; but it will certainly give a complex 
ion to the alliance in future, according to the reception it meets with here. I should be very apprehensive, from the different state of improvement of the 
two countries, and perverseness of human nature, 
which often leads us to expect more than can be obtained, and be chagrined at the disappointment, that, 
with all possible attention and care, difficulties will 
arise, and that it will greatly add to the burden laid 
upon you. But, if they should want necessaries, when 
the country abounds in them, we shall justly forfeit 
any pretensions to respect and friendship, and be 
come contemptible, not only to them, but to the 
world, and even to ourselves. Our difficulties lie 
with the rich, and not with the poor. While the war was conducted with emissions, the aid of the former 
was not wanted; that of the latter was to be had, 
and may be had now, upon the same terms, that is, 
giving them a support for their labors; but to fight 
and starve, or work and starve, are equally impracticable. 
</p><p>
In my opinion we have, in some degree, miscalculated the abilities of the country, and entirely the 
disposition of the people to bear taxes in the necessary extent. The country, not immediately the seat 
of either army, is richer than when the war began; 
but the long disuse of taxes, and their natural unpalatableness, have embarrassed the business exceedingly; and Tories, grumbling Whigs, and party, have 
all thrown in their aid to increase the discontent. 
These circumstances, which it was impossible to fore 
see in their full extent, made a foreign loan a matter of great importance, and even of indispensable necessity; and, if any thing has been omitted to obtain it, which we may yet retrieve, I should hope no 
time will be lost. 
</p><p>
The failure of the Eastern States to supply beef 
will be attended with some disagreeable effects here ; 
for all the money we had, or expected soon, has 
been furnished to procure this article, and, of course, 
our means of procuring flour proportionably diminished. The State made an effort, on this account, 
which no other has equalled, as they mortgaged an estate, belonging to the public, in the neighbourhood 
of this city, for the special purpose of supplying the 
army, leaving the taxes for the general use of the 
United States. But this money, though secure in 
every other event than that of our failing in the 
contest, and drawing an interest, has met with embarrassments and opposition, partly from interested 
and partly from other motives, which have very much 
delayed the supplies. We have, at length, got in 
motion, and, I hope, shall be able to get a supply of 
flour for the summer ; but the shock paper money 
has received, subjects all our resources to the ca 
price of interested or perverse individuals, more than 
is consistent with our safety or honor. 
</p><p>
The address of the Committee, accompanied with a 
letter from yourself, came at a seasonable moment, 
just as the House of Assembly was about to rise. 
They immediately passed a law for raising two men 
out of every company of militia, which I had endeavoured, but in vain, to effect last spring. This 
will produce about one thousand men from the whole 
State, about six hundred of which will go to fill 
up the ranks of the Continental army. The remainder we must endeavour to throw upon the fron 
tiers, or some of our oldest and most established 
counties are in danger of becoming a frontier. In 
short, there is no pacifying them without a body of 
troops, though experience has long decided how in 
adequate a defensive war is for support against the 
Indians. 
</p><p>
The representation of the distress for want of meat, 
produced an immediate exertion, of which I hope the 
benefit must be felt by this time. It is true, many 
of the cattle are not fit for slaughter, but they are 
the best we have. It was thought best to continue 
this business, at least for some weeks, in order to 
have a stock in possession, and of consequence they 
will be continued for some time; proceeding to camp 
upon this principle, that, if you have none better, 
these must serve, and if you have, the season of the 
year will admit their being kept till they are better. 
</p><p>
We had proceeded thus far, and there seemed to 
be a very good disposition in all to advance the necessary measures, with as much expedition as deliberative bodies usually do, or are capable of. The 
vesting extraordinary powers in the Executive was 
not so well relished, and it was too delicate a subject to be much pressed by me, especially as there 
appeared some reluctance on this point; and, it is 
probable, the House would have adjourned without 
touching upon it, had it not been so forcibly urged 
in your private letter. I was extremely embarrassed ; 
I did not see any chance of its being done, but by 
letting them know that it was deemed by you a 
matter not of mere importance, but of indispensable necessity. This was done in a manner the most 
guarded and confidential, and had the desired effect, 
as they have vested the Executive with the power 
to declare martial law, so far as they shall deem necessary? ftftd which gives us a power of doing what 
may be necessary, without attending to the ordinary 
forms of law. I have the pleasure to observe, the 
measure is generally satisfactory; and as we shall endeavour to exercise it with prudence and moderation, 
I hope it may be productive of the good effects expected from it. 
</p><p>
The loss of <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, with its garrison, and stores, 
which I think a very probable event, notwithstanding 
the sanguine hopes of some, and doubts of others, 
will, it must be presumed, rouse us from the insensibility with which we have hitherto carried on the 
war since <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>. And yet the scene is so distant, 
and the danger apparently remote, that I am not 
certain of this effect. The arrival of a few vessels 
from Statia, or capture of as many, seems to be an 
event more interesting, than an advantage gained or 
lost by the enemy, however considerable. And our country friends find their patriotism abate, as their 
interests are affected by duties or taxes. I am inclined to think some stroke of adverse fortune necessary, and that lasting good may flow from it ; for, 
pretend what we may, the country is so much re 
moved from the distress of the war, and really has 
the three requisites of war, men, provisions, and iron, 
if not in abundance, in sufficiency for all our wants, 
our only difficulty is to draw them forth. And for 
this, two things are essentially necessary; namely, 
union among the States, generally and particularly. 
The parties in Congress have weakened the influence and lessened the weight of that body, and the 
internal divisions have had the like effect on the Governments ; so that every measure, however necessary 
for the general good, has been timid, feeble, and languid, each fearing to give his adversary some advantage ; while the disaffected and mercenary have raised 
their heads, with an astonishing degree of insolence, 
to the great discouragement of the Whigs, especially 
in the middling and lower classes of life, who, having 
been distressed by their attachment to our cause, and 
their minds neither feeling, nor perhaps capable of 
feeling, what is called liberality of spirit towards an 
enemy, have been mortified to find themselves no 
way distinguished, but by their sufferings. It is clear that the Royal cause, both in this State and Mary, 
land, derives great advantage from the division of 
the Whigs ; for, in the rage and discontent of party, 
auxiliaries are so acceptable, that we are not apt 
to scrutinize their motives and principles too narrowly. Upon these considerations, I have ever thought 
it a most necessary duty to sacrifice, as far as I am 
capable, any smaller resentments, and, far from declining the paths of peace, to seek them. I have 
made more advances than one. The exposing my 
life to save that of my principal enemies, when they 
would otherwise have fallen a collective sacrifice to 
their own imprudence and to popular resentment, 
though an act of duty in my station, might have 
been evaded on many plausible pretexts. But it 
seems to be the allotment of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, that, in this 
respect, I am to be unhappy. 
</p><p>
Conceiving it a proper time to write, and make a 
great and general effort for our national safety and 
honor, a few days before I was favored with your sentiments on this subject, waiving all sorts of punctilio, I made a direct overture. I can only say, it 
was not accepted ; but it was of so explicit and unequivocal a nature, as to leave no farther ground, unless time and a change of circumstances should produce it. I am, however, happy to find, that I have 
met your opinion in this respect, and beg you to 
believe, not only that I was sincere on that occasion, 
but that, as the public good and your ease appear connected in some degree with it, I shall embrace 
any favorable opportunity to renew it. 
</p><p>
I feel, exceedingly feel, for the peculiarity of your situation, my dear Sir, and also fear that your health 
may suffer in the conflict. But when I consider what 
just conceptions you have of the importance of the 
prize for which we contend, the progress already, and 
the abounding affection and confidence of the country, I cannot but believe you may draw great consolation and support, that the present difficulties will 
lay a foundation for some system of solid supply, 
and a just consideration of the army, which has been 
too generally viewed through a very mistaken medium. For myself, I shall only add, that the same 
motives which led me to leave domestic enjoyments 
and lucrative ease, in <a href='/results.php?year=1775'>1775</a>, and partake your early 
exertions, now strengthened by more knowledge and 
warmer attachment, will induce me to strain every 
nerve, and run every risk, to promote the public service, as the most acceptable testimony I can give 
you of the truth of these professions. And if there 
is any particular case or occasion, which, from want 
of knowledge or information, I may be likely to 
overlook, I shall esteem it a particular favor to be 
honored with a few lines, to which I shall pay the 
most special and animated attention. 
I think it very happy, that Major Lee's corps is 
in the vicinity of this place; as, in case of emergency, they may be wanted to execute measures which, 
though necessary, are unpalatable, and often ill executed, where the feelings of acquaintance and personal friendship operate against the public measures. 
They are in exceeding good quarters, on the best terms with the inhabitants, and, I presume, must be 
far too late to render any assistance to our friends 
in the south. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Heed, who is pretty well recovered, returns 
her respectful regards and thanks to Mrs. Washing 
ton and yourself for your polite attention, in which I 
beg leave to include mine; and am, with the most 
unfeigned respect and esteem, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your obliged and most obedient humble servant,
