DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Agreeably to your Excellency's directions, I have 
consulted some of the General Officers who I thought 
most capable of advising upon the proper steps to 
take in our present circumstances. They say that 
they can by no means advise for or against an attack. 
They are fully convinced that General Howe has his 
whole force with him ; that, if your Excellency thinks 
your force sufficient to cope with his, they are willing to risk their lives and fortunes with you in the 
attempt. They say, further, that General Howe is 
possessed of very strong grounds at present, and, even 
if he was not, he would have sufficient time to post 
himself strongly before you could reach him, as your army must have a march of two days before they 
could come to action. They think if an attack is 
made on his left with success, he can retreat with 
ease ; if on his right, he must be ruined ; but, should 
you fail in the latter, your army must be pushed into 
the Schuylkill. 
</p><p>
They, upon the whole, think that the attempt will 
be exceeding hardous, and the success doubtful ; 
that, if you fail, the people who are now so fond of 
censuring, will change their clamor, and censure you 
for not attacking him when he was within a mile 
of you, and your army more numerous and in better 
condition than at present. They say they are free for attacking him, if he, by his advances this way, 
shows an intention of attacking us ; but cannot ad 
vise to marching the army to attack him where he 
now is, unless your Excellency is fully convinced of 
your superiority in numbers. 
</p><p>
These are the sentiments of the gentlemen whom I 
have consulted, and, though I think they have much 
weight, I am so weary of the infernal clamor of the 
Pennsylvanians, that I am for satisfying them at all 
events, and risking every consequence in an action. 
Possibly we may be successful; if not, they may be 
satisfied, and even Congress itself may gain experience, and learn to censure with more caution. Possibly a defeat may have this good effect, and a victory will bring with it its own reward. I am, there 
fore, clearly for risking every consequence in an action, and, among others, most cheerfully, the life and 
fortune of 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant.

MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Nothing can be more painful to me, than the repetition of a request, which is known to be disagreeable to a Commander, to whom America in general, 
and myself in particular, stand so much indebted. 
After so polite a refusal as I have once had, I should 
have remained forever silent upon the subject, did 
not pure necessity, which knows no law, compel me 
to repeat my request. I sincerely lament my being 
compelled to discover my situation and my feelings, 
and hope that a long silence upon the subject will 
be looked upon by your Excellency rather as evidence of patience, than as a mark of my having the 
gift of complaining without cause. I shall repeat 
facts. 
</p><p>
When Britain first began to send troops to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, 
I began, at great expense, to manoeuvre troops as well 
in the eastern part of Massachusetts as in our own 
State. This not only occasioned a loss of time, but 
the loss of money was inevitable. I then served the 
public part of two years in Congress. Between the 
sessions of Congress I undertook to dismantle the 
fort at Piscataway. The Continent have received and 
used the cannons, small arms, powder, &c., which were, 
at my expense, removed into the country, at the distance of a number of miles, for which I have never 
had the least reward, nor have I the least probability 
of it. Since I have been in the service I have been 
rather unfortunate. I have been robbed at Long Is 
land, <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, New Rochelle, and at <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>. The 
last of these losses I never suspected, till I was on 
my return from New England, and had arrived within a mile of the place. I lost, at those several times, ten 
suits of clothes complete, a large quantity of linens, 
all my camp equipage, a valuable military library, 
&c. &c. I have, notwithstanding, weathered out the 
campaign, but have neither clothes nor equipage to 
begin another, or money to purchase. I have lost 
three horses in the service, which I am not able to 
replace ; and though one of them was killed in action, 
and the others in different service, Congress will 
make no recompense. 
</p><p>
Under these circumstances, I have but two ways 
left. One is to quit the service entirely, and the 
other, to quit it for a season, to prepare myself for 
greater fatigue and losses. I need not mention to 
your Excellency how inadequate the eight 
allowed by Congress, is to the support of an officer; 
my first letter has hinted it ; I am sure your Excellency can see the justice of the hint. I have mentioned two ways of relief for myself. My first letter 
has shown the necessity, as well as a letter I wrote 
to Colonel Harrison, from <a href='/results.php?city=princeton' rel='city'>Princeton</a>, in June last. 
Could I be permitted to have my choice, it would be 
the former, as I have suffered too much and received 
too little for the fatigue I have endured. If this 
can be procured without trouble to your Excellency, 
and without my incurring your Excellency's censure, 
it will much oblige, dear General, him that is, with 
every sentiment of gratitude and respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I should have long since wrote your Excellency, 
was there any thing in this quarter worth engaging 
your attention. I found, upon my journey home, That there was not the least probability of the enemy's 
attempting to rescue <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a> and army. I therefore went to New Hampshire, where I tarried 
about twelve days. Upon my arrival there, I found 
no troops worth mentioning, and, by the inclosed re 
turn, your Excellency will see we are little better 
now. Connecticut has not sent us a man; Massachusetts, but fifty ; New Hampshire, owing to my pushing the matter, have theirs principally on the roads. 
</p><p>
The three last-mentioned regiments will leave me 
to-morrow; their time expires this night. When your Excellency has viewed this return, you will be surprised at the indolence of the enemy. They are 
three thousand six hundred strong, of British and 
Hessians, besides a small regiment of Greencoats, 
made up of deserters and refugees from us. This 
regiment consists of one hundred and twenty-seven, 
and is commanded by one Whitmore. They have 
drafted none from Rhode Island, this year, except 
fifty-four to join the light infantry of their Grand 
Army. Those sailed with Lord Howe. The enemy 
are busy in fortifying the Island, and are much afraid 
that we are about to attack them. I wish the deception may continue. Captain Whipple, in the <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> frigate, passed their shipping, with a strong gale of wind, the night of the 30th ultimo, under a 
severe fire, which he warmly returned, and got safe 
to sea. 
</p><p>
We have nothing new in this quarter, save that 
General Pigot politely requested nie to disperse his 
handbills among the people, which I refused, and delivered them over to the Assembly.* I since hear, 
that while I was viewing the sea-coast below the 
enemy, the populace rose and burnt them under the gallows. When any thing worth your Excellency's 
notice occurs, I shall give you the earliest intelligence. Interim, I have the honor to be, dear General, with the highest sentiments of gratitude and esteem, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL,
</p><p>
In my last I had the honor to inform you of my 
being in possession of the enemy's works on the 
north part of Rhode Island, and of the arrival of the 
British fleet the moment we had landed; as also of 
the sailing of <a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='colleague'>Count D Estaing</a> in quest of them. As 
this unfortunate circumstance deprived us of the assistance we promised ourselves from the French troops, 
I waited on the ground till the 10th, at night, when, 
finding my numbers had increased sufficiently to warrant my advancing to the town, without waiting the 
return of the fleet, I issued orders for the army to 
march the 11th, at six in the morning. But fortune, 
still determined to sport longer with us, brought on a storm so violent that it last night blew down and 
almost ruined all the tents I had. The arms, of 
course, were rendered useless, and almost the whole 
of our ammunition ruined. The much greater part 
of the army have no kind of coverings, nor would 
tents, if they had them, prove a sufficient security 
against the severity of the storm. My men are 
mostly lying under the fens, half covered with 
water, without ammunition, and with arms rendered 
useless. 
</p><p>
The communications between us and the main are 
cut off by the violence of the wind, which will scarcely permit a whaleboat to pass. Should the enemy 
come out to attack us, our dependence must be upon 
the superiority of our numbers and the point of the 
bayonet. How our militia may behave on such an 
occasion, I am unable to determine. To retreat is 
impossible; therefore we must conquer or perish. 
Perhaps, under such circumstances, an attack upon 
us might be of great advantage. Several men have 
perished from the severity of the weather, and I expect more will, as I see no probability of the storm 
ceasing. All our hopes of assistance from the French 
fleet are at an end, as this storm must have driven 
them far off from tin's post, and, I am very apprehensive, quite off the coast. To combat all these mis 
fortunes, and to surmount all these difficulties, require's a degree of temper and persevering fortitude, which I 
can never boast of, and which few possess in so ample a manner as your Excellency. I will, however, 
endeavour, by emulating the example, to rise superior 
to the malevolence of fortune and my present lament 
able situation, as quick as possible; and, if Heaven 
will cease to frown, endeavour to gratify your Excellency's desires. I am sorry your Excellency's letter, respecting the enemy's burning their shipping, 
did not arrive till they had burnt and sunk the whole 
of their vessels of war, and sunk almost all the other 
vessels, to block up the channel. 
</p><p>
The letter of your Excellency, inclosing that to the 
<a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='colleague'>Count D Estaing</a>, did not arrive till after he had sailed. The intelligence from the Council of Massachusetts, informing that Admiral Byron, with thirteen 
large ships of the line, was spoken with off the Western Islands, also arrived the day after he sailed. This 
account says that Byron was spoken with on the 29th 
of June. The fleet which arrived here, and the Count 
was in pursuit of, was Lord Howe's fleet, among which 
were only five sail of the line. The rest, smaller vessels of war, and transports. They landed no men 
here. 
</p><p>
I was apprehensive that some such event as this 
might happen to deprive me of the Count's assistance. This induced me to call for more men than I 
should otherwise have done. The numbers of the 
enemy are nearly thus : 
</p><p>
Two Hessian regiments, GOO each, . . 1,200 
Two Anspach, 500 each, . . . 1,000 
Brown and Fanning, . . . . 600 
22d, 38th, 43d, and 54th British, 400 each, 1,600 
Two Hessian regiments, 500 each, . . 1,000 
Whitman's regiment, . . . . 100 
</p><p>
5,500 
To these we may add one thousand seamen, 1,000 
</p><p>
6,500 
My numbers on the Island are about nine thou 
sand, rank and file. Deserters come out in great 
numbers. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be ; my dear General, &c.,

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
The Fates have decreed that you shall receive no 
thing but disagreeable intelligence from this quarter. 
Major-<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> and the Marquis returned, the 
night before last, from the French Admiral. My letter, their entreaties, and <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>'s written remonstrance, drawn up on board the Languedoc, have 
only produced the letter which I inclose. It seems 
that the Captains of the French fleet are so incensed 
at the <a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='colleague'>Count D Estaing</a>'s being put over them, he being but a land officer, that they are determined to 
prevent his doing any thing that may redound to his 
credit or our advantage. The Count himself wished 
to come in, but his Captains were, to a man, for leaving us. I then drew up a letter, in behalf of all the 
officers of the army, and sent on board ; but he, though 
the wind was not fair for <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, put oil to sea night 
before last. This letter was followed by the inclosed 
protest, both of which I have ordered after him, in ;i 
fast-sailing privateer. I am, however, well persuaded 
that nothing will alter the determinations of the Captains, and that he will follow their counsel, though ho 
knows they wish his ruin. 
</p><p>
This sudden and unexampled procedure renders my 
situation exceeding delicate. The enemy have twice 
attempted to relieve the place by reinforcements ; the 
last fleet had four thousand troops on board. Should 
they make another attempt, they must succeed. They 
will then have near ten thousand troops on the Is 
land, and the command of the water on every side of us, as we have been obliged to dismantle our forts 
at Bristol and Tiverton to forward our operations 
against the town. 
</p><p>
I inclose to your Excellency a copy of the questions proposed by me to the General Officers and 
Commandants of brigades this day. I also inclose to 
your Excellency a copy of the protest sent after the 
<a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='colleague'>Count D Estaing</a>. As my situation, at present, can 
promise nothing to advantage, except from a sudden 
attack, I wish the opinions of the officers may justify 
me in making this last effort. I have the honor to 
be, my dear General, 
</p><p>
Yours, most affectionately, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jsu" rel="me">JOHN SULLIVAN</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I offered the Count, in my letter, to make 
the attack the moment he would land the troops, and 
put them in the boats I had prepared for them. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> and the Marquis assured him that 
we would not require the stay of his fleet and troops 
more than forty-eight hours. But nothing could induce him to assist us with either, a single moment.

Mr DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I had last night the honor of receiving your Excellency's favor of the 1st instant, and impatiently wait 
your Excellency's sentiments on the steps I have 
taken since the 29th ultimo, an account of which has 
been transmitted by Major Morris. 
</p><p>
The justice of the observations, in your Excellency's letter, respecting the departure of the French 
fleet, are so obvious, that, if a consciousness of my 
duty to yield implicit obedience to your Excellency's 
commands did not ever make that obedience a plea 
sure, the reasoning alone must have pointed out 
the part I have to act. I have the pleasure to in 
form your Excellency, that, though the first struggles 
of passion on so important a disappointment were 
scarcely to be restrained, yet, in a few days, by taking advantage of the subsiding passion, I found means 
to restore the former harmony between the American 
and French officers of the army. The <a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='colleague'>Count D Estaing</a> 
and myself are in the same friendship as heretofore. 
The reason of the protest has been explained to him, 
and he is now perfectly satisfied. He has offered to 
come on with his land forces, and do every thing 
which I may request of him and his troops ; but this 
step has become unnecessary. 
The reason of drawing the protest was this; The 
Count himself wished to remain with us, but was, by 
his Captains, overruled in Council. As deviating from 
the voice of his Council would be attended with ill 
consequences to him in case of misfortune, it was 
supposed that the protest might justify his deviating 
from the voice of his Council, and acting a part 
agreeable to his own sentiments, and those of the co 
operating army. Prudence dictated it as our duty to 
keep it secret from all but him, your Excellency, 
and the Congress ; and no publication of it was ever 
thought of on our part ; and your Excellency may 
rely on my exertions to prevent it. Every thing in 
my power shall be done for repairing the injury sustained by the French fleet. 
</p><p>
The fleet off <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> harbour, of which I gave your Excellency an account yesterday, are eight ships of 
the line, ten frigates, one sloop, and a schooner. 
There can be no doubt of its being Lord Howe's fleet, 
watching the motions of the French fleet, to facilitate 
the relief of Rhode Island, and perhaps to cover the 
retreat of the British army from Rhode Island and 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, to other places where they are more 
needed. Those ships were out of sight yesterday 
morning at eight o clock, but I hear they afterwards 
hove in sight again. The report here is, that six 
thousand troops have arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=newport' rel='city'>Newport</a>. I know 
they are numerous, but cannot as yet ascertain the 
number. Your Excellency will please transmit a copy 
of this letter to Congress ; and believe me to be, with 
every sentiment of gratitude, respect, and esteem, 
your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and very humble servant,

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
As your Excellency has honored me with an 
appointment to command the intended expedition - I 
must beg leave to lay my sentiments before you in 
writing ; as words used in conversation may vanish 
in air, and the remembrance of them be lost, while 
writing will remain, either to justify my opinion, 
or to prove that it was erroneous. The variety of 
reasons, which I urged yesterday, for passing with 
the main body up the Mohawk River, and down by 
Wood Creek to the Cayuga Lake, still have their 
weight in my mind ; but, as <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a> writes 
that they cannot be supplied with provisions, the 
plan must be given up, and that of passing with 
the main body up the Susquehanna adopted. 
</p><p>
The force which I have requested for that quarter, is three thousand effective men, after all proper 
deductions are made for guards at the several posts, 
for boatmen, hospital guards, tenders, &c. &c. That 
these should be collected before we enter the Indian 
country, appears to me essentially necessary, as it 
is supposed that the principal opposition we shall 
meet will be between Wyoming and Tioga. Should 
this be the case, as seemed to be the general opinion in Council yesterday, we can derive no advantage from the party on the Mohawk River, as they 
are not to join us until we have established a post 
at Tioga. Should they attempt to join us before, 
they must be defeated in passing down the Susquehanna ; and, should our numbers be such as to 
admit of a defeat before we arrive at Tioga, as we 
can have no communication with the other party, 
and they are to regulate themselves by a plan fixed 
before we march, they will remain ignorant of our defeat, and of course proceed at the time appointed, 
and in all probability fall into the hands of the 
enemy. If we are to expect the principal opposition 
before we arrive at Tioga, it is absurd to reckon, 
for part of our force, troops who are not to attempt 
joining us before we have passed the principal danger. 
</p><p>
Indeed, I have no great dependence upon the 
advantages to be derived from so small a party in 
that quarter. It was yesterday said, that we might 
expect fourteen hundred Indians to oppose us in our march. Your Excellency will permit me to say, that 
fourteen hundred Indians, perfectly acquainted with 
the country, capable of seizing every advantage which 
the ground can possibly afford, perfectly acquainted 
with the use of arms, inured to war from their youth, 
and, from their manner of living, capable of enduring every kind of fatigue, are no despicable enemy, 
when opposed to three thousand troops, totally unacquainted with the country and the Indian manner of 
fighting, and who, though excellent in the field, are 
far from having that exactness with fire-arms or that 
alertness in a wooded country, which Indians have. 
As so many facts have contributed to prove this, it 
will be unnecessary for me to say more upon the 
subject. If I was not a party concerned in this expedition, and my opinion was asked of the force necessary to insure success, I should give it, that the 
force of each party should be equal to the highest estimate of the enemy's force in that country, that 
they might be able to form a junction at all events, 
and put the matter beyond possibility of doubt; and, 
after that, they would be enabled to detach and conquer the country in an eighth part of the time that 
they would, if obliged, for their own safety, to keep 
in a body. I know that the estimated force of the 
Indians is small ; but, when I consider that under 
rating the number of the enemy has been a prevailing error with us since the commencement of the 
war, that we have had persons from among them, both 
inhabitants and deserters, and have had the proceedings, debates, and calculations of Parliament before us, 
and yet have frequently mistaken their number more 
than one half, I cannot suppose but that we are still 
liable to fall into the same error, where we can have 
no evidence, and every thing told us respecting them 
is a mere matter of opinion. In addition to this, let 
me repeat what I observed yesterday, which is the 
probability of a force being sent from Canada by 
way of Lake Ontario. I also beg leave to observe 
that, when our advancement upon the Susquehanna is 
known, it will probably be conjectured that our intention is against Niagara, which will induce the 
enemy strongly to reenforce that post. This they 
may do in a fortnight, as it is but one hundred and 
ten miles from Montreal to Oswegachie, and their 
vessels can take troops from thence to Niagara in 
three or four days; and, when they find that our intention is against the Indian settlements, those troops 
will undoubtedly join them. From these considerations it must appear that the demand I have madeis far from being unreasonable, even exclusive of 
the party sent on their flanks. I well know that 
Continental troops cannot be spared for this purpose, 
but good militia should undoubtedly be called for. 
The expedition is undertaken to destroy those Indian 
nations, and to convince others that we have the 
power to carry the war into their country, whenever 
they commence hostilities. Should we fail in the at 
tempt, the Indians will derive confidence from it, and 
grow more insolent than before. 
</p><p>
I beg leave further to mention, that, in my opinion, the troops selected for this expedition are by no 
means equal to those they must expect to encounter ; 
especially the Pennsylvania troops, as they are principally made up of old countrymen, who are totally 
unacquainted with that kind of fighting, which they 
must adopt. I have conversed with <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague'>General St. Clair</a> 
upon this head, who is fully of my opinion. The 
best troops, in my opinion, for this expedition, are 
General Poor's brigade, who are all marksmen, and 
accustomed to the Indian mode of fighting. I think 
the Jersey troops good ; the York troops I know nothing of; the other broken corps I can say nothing 
about., only that, when they come to act in a body 
with others, much cannot be expected from them. 
</p><p>
Thus have I submitted my sentiments to your Excellency, and trust that my reasoning upon the subject must prove, that three thousand good and effective men, at least, will be necessary to march from 
Tioga, exclusive of those which your Excellency may 
think proper to direct to operate on the other flank 
of the enemy. I have the honor to be, with the 
most lively sentiments of esteem and respect, 
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I am now moving to <a href='/results.php?city=pompton' rel='city'>Pompton</a>, agreeably to your Excellency's orders of yesterday. I find that the 
whole of the Rhode Island army is encamped on Staten Island, in addition to the troops before stationed there ; that they are making preparations for an excursion somewhere, and it is generally conjectured 
that they intend a descent upon the Jersey shore. 
This conjecture seems to be strengthened by the 
light-horse being sent on to the Island, and the preparations they are making in the boat way. If the 
forage is their object, will our troops at <a href='/results.php?city=pompton' rel='city'>Pompton</a> be 
within sufficient distance to give a timely opposition? 
May not the magazines at Pluckamin be an object? 
I see the disadvantage which may arise from this di 
vision of the army being sent at too great a distance 
from the others, and beg pardon for the above hints, 
which are only intended to express my wishes to be 
in such a situation as may enable me effectually to 
answer your Excellency's wishes. The place which 
will best answer this purpose, your Excellency can 
best determine. I have the honor to be, with the 
most perfect respect, dear General, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jsu" rel="me">JOHN SULLIVAN</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I have not a horseman, or any thing in place 
of one, for expresses, or any other purpose.

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I am sorry to inform your Excellency, that I am 
under the painful necessity of leaving a service to 
which I am, by principle and interest, attached ; and, 
among the variety of mortifications I must suffer in 
quitting it, that of being deprived the pleasure of 
serving under your Excellency, stands among the 
foremost. My health is too much impaired to be re 
covered but by a total release from business ; and, 
though the physicians give me encouragement that 
this will restore me, I am myself convinced of the 
contrary, and fear that I must content myself with 
enjoying the reflection of having used my utmost to 
serve my country, as the only thing I shall receive 
in exchange for a constitution sacrificed in endeavouring to promote its interest. 
</p><p>
Should there be a probability of <a href='/results.php?tla=cde' rel='colleague'>Count D Estaing</a>'s 
arrival, I would willingly wait, to give the little assistance in my power to extirpate the enemies of 
this country ; but, should this not be likely to happen, and the season be too far advanced, I must 
beg your Excellency's leave to retire as soon as 
possible, that I may take every measure in my 
power to restore my health in some degree, or at 
least to live in such a manner as will not tend to 
put it beyond a possibility of being restored, which a longer continuance in the service undoubtedly will. 
I have the honor to r be, most respectfully, my dear General, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and very humble servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Perhaps there was never more justice in any ad 
vice than that given by the philosopher to his prince, 
namely, "Always beware of the man that flatters you, 
and appears to coincide with your sentiments on all occasions." 
</p><p>
I am confident that I have never appeared to your Excellency in this character; nay, I have studied to 
avoid even the appearance of being a flatterer. I 
knew, at the same time, that your Excellency, as 
well as all others in high office, had those animals 
constantly courting your favors ; and, I confess that 
I have sometimes felt an uneasiness, lest my neglect 
of expressing those sentiments of esteem and affection which I really felt should be construed into a 
want of cordial esteem for that Commander, to whom 
America stands so much indebted. Conscious, how 
ever, of my own sincerity, I contented myself with 
yielding a cheerful obedience to all orders your Excellency was pleased to honor me with; not doubting 
that some future period might discover in whose 
bosom the most lively sentiments of friendship and esteem were lodged. But, as my present state of 
health almost forbids me to hope for the honor of 
serving again under your command, your Excellency 
will excuse me in declaring that I have ever felt 
those exalted sentiments of esteem and affection for 
you, that even your sincerest friend can boast. My 
public and constant declaration has been, and I now 
repeat, that, in my opinion, you are the saviour of 
this country ; and that to your fortitude, bravery, and 
steady perseverance, do we owe the independence and 
freedom we enjoy. 
</p><p>
This I say, to remove any doubts that may have 
arisen respecting my friendship and affection ; and I 
should now have avoided it, did not my own feelings 
too strongly indicate that I can never have the plea 
sure of again serving under your Excellency's command. 
</p><p>
You will please to pardon this long and (I dare-say) to you tedious introduction to something more 
interesting. Permit me, then, to inform your Excellency, that the faction raised against you in <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>, 
into which General Conway was Unfortunately and 
imprudently drawn, is not yet destroyed. The members are waiting to collect strength, and seize some 
favorable moment to appear in force. I speak not 
from conjecture, but from certain knowledge. Their 
plan is to take every method of proving the danger 
arising from a Commander who enjoys the full and 
unlimited confidence of his army, and alarm the people with the prospect of imaginary evils; nay, they 
will endeavour to convert your virtues into arrows, 
with which they will seek to torment you. 
</p><p>
This plan was adopted the last winter ; and, if you 
will take the trouble of reading Mr. Tudor's oration, 
delivered at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> in March last, you will find every line calculated to answer this purpose. The words 
are Tudor's, but the thoughts are borrowed. I heard 
them thrown out long before they were by him laid 
before the public. 
</p><p>
Here I cannot help digressing to congratulate your Excellency on your compelling them to attack your virtue, and not putting it in their power to point out a single vice. 
</p><p>
The next step is to persuade Congress that the 
military power of America should be placed in three or four different hands; each having a separate quarter of the Continent assigned him ; each commander 
to answer to Congress only for his conduct. This, 
they say, will prevent an aspiring commander from 
enslaving his country, and put it in the power of 
Congress, with the assistance of the other commanders, to punish the attempt. This is a refinement in 
politics, and an improvement on public virtue, which 
Greece or Rome could never boast. 
</p><p>
The present time is unfavorable to their design. 
They well know, that the voice of citizens and soldiers would be almost unanimously against them. 
But they wait a more favorable opportunity, which 
they will certainly improve. I am well convinced 
that they cannot succeed; yet I thought it my duty, 
in the moment of my departure, to give your Excellency this notice, that you may not only be on your guard, but avoid intrusting those in matters where 
your interest and honor are nearly concerned. appearances may deceive even an angel. Could you 
have believed, four years since, that those adulators, 
those persons so tenderly and so friendly used, as 
were Gates, Mifflin, Reed, and Tudor, would become 
your secret and bitter, though unprovoked enemies? 
If we view them now, we cannot help lamenting the 
want of sincerity in mankind. I persuade myself 
that your Excellency's steady and prudent conduct 
will baffle every attempt, and I feel happy in having 
discharged my duty to the best of commanders ; and 
only beg leave to assure your Excellency, that, in 
whatever station fortune may place me in future, no 
man will be more ready to bestow the rewards due 
to your Excellency's disinterested zeal, bravery, fortitude, and perseverance, than, dear General, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and devoted servant,
