Sir, 
</p><p>
The Committee appointed by Congress to quiet the 
disturbances of the Pennsylvania line, &c., think it 
proper to inform your Excellency that they arrived 
at this place last night, after dark; and that President Reed, who acts in concert with us, has proceeded to the neighbourhood of <a href='/results.php?city=princeton' rel='city'>Princeton</a>, at which 
place those troops are now posted. We are happy to inform your Excellency, that some favorable appearances of a speedy and honorable, as well as a 
safe, accommodation have appeared in their conduct 
this morning, as they have given an earnest of their 
sincerity and intentions, by no means equivocal, by 
seizing a negotiator, sent to them from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, 
together with his conductor, both of whom they delivered up to <a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel='colleague'>General Wayne</a>, and have sent them 
out, under a guard, with their papers. They are actually now in the hands of President Reed; and we 
do ourselves the honor of sending your Excellency a 
copy of the terms offered them, in writing, by those 
emissaries. Should your Excellency have any communications to make to Congress relative to the present state and temper of the army, we request that 
you will be pleased to make them through us, and 
direct them to this place. I am, with the highest 
and the most sincere esteem and regard, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jsu" rel="me">John Sullivan</a>.

Barclay's House, near <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city origin'>Trenton</a>, 8 o'clock, evening; 	<a rel='day origin' value='10'>10</a> <a rel="month origin" value="1">January</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1781' rel="origin">1781</a>.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
We are happy to inform your Excellency, that the 
terms offered to the Pennsylvania troops are at length 
finally, and, as we believe, cordially and satisfactorily, 
agreed on ; and, to-morrow, we expect the Pennsylvania line will be arranged in its former order. Constitutionally, no concession has been granted them, 
that the critical situation of our affairs did not warrant, and justice dictate. 
</p><p>
As an earnest of their sincerity, they have this 
night sent to us, under a strong guard, the two spies 
sent out by Sir Harry Clinton, with offers of terms 
to them, who are now in this house, under a guard 
of the <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> light-horse; and a Court, consisting of Generals Wayne and Irvine, and Colonels Butler, Stewart, and Major Pishbourn, are at this moment 
determining their fate. Several other emissaries have been sent out by Sir Harry, who have more prudently delivered their credentials to us; whether more 
honestly, time will determine. In short, the whole progress of this affair, except the first tumult, has 
been conducted, on their part, with a consistency, firmness, and a degree of policy mixed with candor, that must astonish every theorist on the nature of the 
American soldiery, and cover Sir Harry with shame and confusion, if not stigmatize him with the appellation of the Prince of Blunderers, for having so illy succeeded in essays of this kind. 
</p><p>
Commissioners appointed by the Committee of Congress, consisting of Colonel Atlee, General Potter, 
Mr. Blair, McClaneghan, and Captain Morris, of the 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> light-horse, will proceed to-morrow to adjust their claims. 
</p><p>
January Wtli, 8 ddoch A. M. The British Emissaries are condemned, and will be executed this morning, at nine o'clock. The Commissioners are now 
sitting to determine which of the troops ought to be 
discharged, and which to remain; and we trust this 
day will complete the business. I have the honor to 
be, most respectfully, dear General, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
John Sullivan, Chairman. 
</p><p>
By order of the Committee.

Dear General, 
</p><p>
You will, I doubt not, forgive m} neglect in not 
writing you, when I assure you that I have had 
nothing to communicate which could give you pleasure, or avoid giving you pain ; and, that I was unwilling to add to the pressure which your mind has 
been so long accustomed to. To enumerate the evils 
which have flowed from party spirit, from inattention. 
and from other sources, would fill a volume in folio. 
We are now struggling to extricate ourselves from 
those difficulties into which our folly or our prejudices have thrown us. Perhaps we may succeed. 
Some advances have been made toward a reformation ; many more will shortly be attempted. 
</p><p>
The army is arranged, I hope, agreeably to your 
Excellency's wish. The officers have half-pay for 
life ; the States are called upon for men and specific 
supplies ; loans are demanded ; the several departments are arranging ; the expensive Naval and other 
Boards will be demolished, economy introduced, and, 
I trust, specie will relieve paper bills from the task 
of deceiving mankind, and yield to every man his 
just demand. Party spirit, though not annihilated, is 
compelled to hide its head ; and jealousy of the army, 
which has long obstructed salutary measures, dare not 
appear in public. I know it is late for a reformation to commence, but I hope not too late. I lament 
exceedingly the distresses of our army, and will 
cheerfully contribute every thing in my power to relieve them, or so lighten that burden which I know 
your Excellency must feel, provided I could have the 
honor of a line from you, pointing out the evils, and 
the mode you would have adopted for redress. 
</p><p>
I feel, very sensibly for the Southern States, and 
fear either a conquest by force, or a defection, which 
will bring about a base submission. We are informed 
that Clinton is about to embark, with great part of 
his army, for Virginia. Should this event take place, 
I fear the loss of the four Southern States will be 
the consequence. 
</p><p>
To prevent this, I beg leave to submit to your 
Excellency's consideration, whether it would not be 
prudent to order the French fleet to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, where 
they may lie in safety, and call the French army to 
head-quarters. Will not this cause Sir Henry to 
tremble for <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and diminish the force, if not 
totally prevent, the blow meditated against the Southern States ? These are only hints, which arise from 
my zeal to save the Southern States, and which, 
however unmilitary and injudicious they may appear, 
I flatter myself your Excellency will readily pardon. 
I have the honor to be, &c., 
</p><p>

Dear General, 
</p><p>
I was duly honored with your Excellency's favor of the 4th of February, and omitted writing since upon 
a supposition that you had gone to Rhode Island. I 
am happy to find your Excellency entertains the same 
sentiments of the virtues and abilities of Colonel 
Hamilton, as I have ever done myself After I wrote your Excellency, I found the eyes of Congress turned on <a href='/results.php?tla=rom' rel='colleague'>Robert Morris</a>, of this city, as Financier. I did 
not therefore nominate <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='colleague'>Colonel Hamilton</a>, as I foresaw 
it would be but a vain attempt. I shall this day 
nominate him as Secretary of Foreign Affairs, in 
which, I think, I shall meet. the approbation of most 
of the States. 
</p><p>
The choice of a Minister of "War is postponed to 
the first of October. This was a manoeuvre of Samuel 
Adams and others from the north, fearing that, as I 
was in nomination, the choice would fall on me, who, 
having apostatized from the true New England faith, 
'by sometimes voting with the Southern States, am 
not eligible. They were not, however, acquainted with 
all the circumstances. I was nominated against my 
will, and, if chosen, should not have accepted. <a href='/results.php?tla=alm' rel='colleague'>General McDougall</a> is appointed Minister of Marine. The 
plans of finance and all other matters go on so slowly, that I tremble at the consequences. I am mortified at the useless harangues, which consume our time 
to no purpose. I am now endeavouring to obtain an 
adjournment of Congress, and for leaving a Committee 
to transact the business, as the only way of having 
the public business done with propriety and despatch. 
I fully agree with your Excellency, that Congress 
ought to have more power; but I also think that the 
old members should be in Heaven, or at home, before 
this takes place. 
</p><p>
The traffic carried on with the enemy is alarming, 
as it not only serves to furnish them with necessaries, 
but tends to reconcile our citizens to the idea of renewing their connection with Great Britain, and of 
course disaffects them to our government. 
</p><p>
Since <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a>'s letter of the 15th of February, we have received advices from <a href='/results.php?tla=thj' rel='colleague'>Governor Jefferson</a>, and divers others, that Cornwallis is retreating, that 
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> crossed the river in pursuit of him 
the 21st, and that the militia had collected all round 
him. I hope it is not a manoeuvre to bring <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> to an action. 
</p><p>
I have been settling my accounts with the TreasuryBoard, and find I stand charged with money received 
at <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>, to pay the bounty to the New Hampshire recruits in <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. All my papers were lost at 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, and I can remember little of the matter. 
This I am sure of, that I never received any public 
money, but what I immediately applied to the use 
intended. Perhaps Colonel Harrison has some papers 
which will settle the matter. I also am charged with 
the money paid for the troops engaged at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, 
in December, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. I remember the whole of this 
was settled at <a href='/results.php?city=morristown' rel='city'>Morristown</a> about two months after, and 
I received a receipt in full, which is in New Hampshire. Perhaps your papers may save me the trouble 
of sending for it. I have the honor to be.

With the highest esteem, dear General, yours, &c.,
