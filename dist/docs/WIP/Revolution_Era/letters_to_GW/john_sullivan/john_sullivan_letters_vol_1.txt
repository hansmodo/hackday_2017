MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY, 
</p><p>
I arrived here in about twenty-four hours after I 
left you; have collected powder, so as to make up 
near thirty barrels, and have since been preparing to 
set an example to the other seaports, by setting the 
fleet at defiance. Upon my arrival, I was surprised 
to find that the boom, so much talked of, was not 
prepared ; that the bridge intended for crossing from 
the main to the islands, whereon stands the principal fort (called Fort Washington), had nothing 
more done than one pier sunk ; that there was not 
a foot of the parapet, over which a man might 
fire, or even see his enemy ; that the embrasures 
at the foot were horizontal, as well as the top of 
the parapet; and, in short, not a moment's defence 
could be made, or annoyance given to the enemy, 
either with cannon or small arms. 
</p><p>
I immediately collected a number of gondolas, 
moored them head and stern, laid pieces from one 
to the other, and plank across, and soon completed 
the bridge. I then turned my attention to the 
boom, and in two days got it across, but found it 
could not stand the rapidity of the tide ; it soon 
broke, and W T C have again fixed it, so that I hope 
it may hold; but lest it should deceive us, I have 
taken a number of ships, and moored them above, 
with a great quantity of combustible matter in 
them, and shall to-morrow have them chained together, and, in case the boom should give way, 
set those vessels in flames. I have also a great 
number of fire-rafts, ready to let loose upon them. 
</p><p>
I have altered the works, and I trust made them 
fit for defence, and I doubt not will, in two or 
three days more, be completely prepared. I am 
extremely thankful to your Excellency for the rifle 
men sent to our assistance ; it has indeed filled 
our people with gratitude ; and that my coming 
down was equally agreeable, your Excellency will 
see by the inclosed letter from their Committee 
of Safety. 
</p><p>
I have seen some men that were on board the 
fleet after the destruction of Falmouth. Captain Mowat showed his orders, which were, to burn all 
the seaports east of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. When he departed 
from Falmouth, he told them that he must go to 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and take a recruit of shells, carcasses, &c., 
and then would visit <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>. I expect him 
daily, but in case he does not arrive in a few days, 
shall despair of his coming. I must beg your Excellency to give me intelligence of any movement 
of their ships, with any orders you may think proper with respect to my conduct while here. I shall 
give the earliest intelligence of any thing material; 
and remain, with great esteem, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

</p><p>
P. S. I inclose a letter from the eastward, which was inclosed in one to me, signed by one Major Goodwin, of Pownalborough. That infernal crew of 
Tories, who have laughed at the Congress, despised 
the friends of liberty, endeavoured to prevent fortifying this harbour, and strove to hurt the credit of the Continental money, and are yet endeavouring 
it, walk the streets here with impunity, and will, with a sneer, tell the people in the streets, that all our liberty-poles will soon be converted into gallowses. I must entreat your Excellency to give 
some directions, what to do with those persons, as I 
am fully convinced, that if an engagement was to 
happen, they would, with their own hands, set fire 
to the town, expecting a reward from the ministry 
for such hellish service. Some, who have for a long 
time employed themselves in ridiculing and discouraging those, who were endeavouring to save the 
town, have now turned upon me, and are flying 
from one street to another, proclaiming that you 
gave me no authority to take the ships to secure 
the entrance of the harbour, or did any thing more 
than send me here, to see the town reduced to 
ashes, if our enemies thought proper. Sir, I shall 
wait your directions respecting these villains, and 
see that they are strictly complied with.

MUCH RESPECTED GENERAL, 
</p><p>
Agreeably to your order, have again waited on 
Major Rogers, and strictly examined him. Have 
seen his several permits, and think them genuine, 
and in every respect agreeable to the copy sent you. 
He says he left <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> about the 10th of October, being ill with the fever-and-ague, was ten days 
in getting to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> ; that there, and at the place 
called Stone Arabia, he tarried ten days more ; he 
then passed through Iloosick, Standford, Draper, and 
Hinsdale, in his way to his brother, who lives in 
Kent ; he was three days in performing this route, 
and tarried with his brother five or six days more ; 
he was then three days in going to Westminster, and 
in his way passed through by Dartmouth College, 
and saw Mr. Wheelock ; from thence he went to his 
farm, in Pennicook, where he tarried six or eight 
days ; from thence he went to Newbury, and from 
thence to <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, and, after tarrying there some few days, laid his permit before the Committee of Safety. 
</p><p>
He owns every thing in Mr. Wheelock's letter except that of his having been in Canada, which he 
warmly denies, and says lie can prove the route he 
took, and prove himself to have been in the several 
towns at or near the days he has mentioned. I 
asked him why he came to the camps, as he had 
no business with any particular persons, and had no 
inclination to offer his service in the American cause; 
to which he replied, that he had voluntarily waited 
upon the Committees of several Colonies, as he thought it a piece of respect due to them, and would 
probably prevent his being suspected and treated as 
a person unfriendly to us ; that he likewise thought 
it his duty to wait on your Excellency, and acquaint 
you with the situation of his affairs, and, if he could, 
to obtain your license to travel unmolested. 
</p><p>
These, Sir, are the facts as handed to me by him. 
What may be his secret designs I am unable to say, 
and what steps are most proper to be taken respecting  him, your Excellency can best judge. I am far 
from thinking that he has been in Canada ; but, as he 
was once Governor of Michilimackinac, it is possible 
he may have a commission to take that command, 
and stir up the Indians against us, and only waits 
for an opportunity to get there ; for which reason I 
would advise, lest some blame might be laid upon 
your Excellency in future, not to give him any other 
permit, but let him avail himself of those he has ; 
and, should he prove a traitor, let the blame centre 
upon those who enlarged him. I beg pardon for intruding my opinion; and subscribe myself 
Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I had wrote a letter to Congress, and expected to 
have the honor of writing one to you before the 
Commissioners departed ; but, as I found them going 
off before I could possibly finish one to you, I 
sealed that, and begged Mr. Chase to desire your 
Excellency to open and read it, which contained the 
purport of what I intended to write your Excellency. 
I have, since that, been to Montreal, and find almost 
every person agreed to depart, without even seeing 
the enemy. 
</p><p>
General Thompson writes, that about eight hundred 
of the enemy had arrived at Three Rivers, forty-five 
miles below <a href='/results.php?city=sorel' rel='city'>Sorel</a>, where he is. This he has by report only. I find that all the heavy baggage is sent away, with the intrenching tools, &c. On that account I have ordered them back, and am this moment embarking for <a href='/results.php?city=sorel' rel='city'>Sorel</a>, where I hope to arrive 
by daybreak, and meet them with all the force I 
can make. I am far from fearing eight hundred men 
against such a force as I can muster. I have desired all the general officers to be with me there, 
who seem well satisfied to go on. Want of time 
prevents my writing more fully on the state of 
affairs here at present, which I shall not forget to do 
as soon as possible. In the interim, I am, dear General, with great respect, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure to inform you, that I arrived 
here at a very critical moment with my brigade. 
General Thompson was left but with very few men 
to defend this important post, the troops being scattered about in a most shocking manner. I had is 
sued orders for all the well men to follow me, as, 
upon departure of <a href='/results.php?tla=daw' rel='colleague'>General Wooster</a> and the death of 
General Thomas, the command devolved upon me. 
</p><p>
Having given these orders, I proceeded, with the 
troops I brought with me, to join General Thompson, 
who was in the greatest distress. As General Carleton's fleet had passed the <a href='/results.php?city=sorel' rel='city'>Sorel</a>, and was coming up 
the river with a fair wind (as was reported in all 
quarters), a retreat seemed in all parts to be agreed 
upon; and the heavy baggage and most of the artillery were removed to St. John's and <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>. This 
caused the Frenchmen to curse our cowardice, and 
lament their folly in favoring a cause which we had 
so poorly defended ; but, upon my coming with a 
large force, ordering all the troops to follow, and the 
cannon to be returned, I found joy in every countenance, except some very few Tories. It really was 
affecting to see the banks of the <a href='/results.php?city=sorel' rel='city'>Sorel</a> lined with 
men, women, and children, leaping and clapping their 
hands for joy to see me arrive ; it gave no less joy 
to General Thompson, who seemed to be wholly forsaken, and left to fight against an unequal force, or 
retreat before them. 
</p><p>
Upon my arrival I was surprised to hear that, 
notwithstanding all we have read about the <a href='/results.php?city=sorel' rel='city'>Sorel</a>, 
our people had not thrown up as much work as I 
could do with a hundred men in two days, and that 
extremely ill done. There were three cannon, and 
three only, mounted in all the works. I set all the 
men at work, and have this day almost inclosed the 
encampment, and completed a battery on the north 
side of the river, with three cannon. General Thompson says, and I believe with great truth, that more 
work was done here this day than has been done in Canada since the surrender of St. John s. 
</p><p>
June Qt/i, This morning two expresses arrived from 
Three Rivers, which were sent to observe the motions 
of the enemy ; one of them was a friendly Canadian, 
who lived at Three Rivers, and passed among the 
fleet, the other one of our officers. They agree that 
the number of vessels are as follows, namely, one ship, 
one brig, and eight sloops and schooners. They both 
say that the troops there amount to no more than 
three hundred, who are intrenching themselves at the Three Rivers. I have detached General Thompson, with about two thousand of your best troops, to at 
tack them. A copy of his orders is inclosed, which I hope will be approved by your Excellency. 
</p><p>
Our affairs here have taken a strange turn since 
our arrival. The Canadians are flocking by hundreds 
to take a part with us. I am giving them commissions, agreeable to the inclosed form, which I hope 
will not be thought an unnecessary assumption of 
power. I really find most of them exceedingly friendly. I have sent out for carts and teams, &c. They 
have come in with the greatest cheerfulness ; and, 
what gives still greater evidence of their friendship 
is, that they have voluntarily offered to supply us 
with what wheat, flour, &c., we want, and ask nothing 
in return but certificates. -They begin to complain 
against their priests, and wish them to be secured ; 
I shall, however, touch this string with great tenderness at present, as I know their sacerdotal influence. 
</p><p>
I really find, by the present behaviour of the Canadians, that the only reason of their disaffection was 
because our exertions were so feeble that they doubted much of our success, and even of our ability to 
protect them; but the face of our affairs seems to be 
changed; and, in the midst of our pleasing prospects, 
an express arrives from <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>, with six 
teen hundred and sixty-two pounds one shilling and 
three pence, Pennsylvania currency, in specie, with the 
spirited resolves of Congress. This gives new life to 
our Canadian friends, and added spirit to our troops. 
</p><p>
I was extremely happy to find, that I had anticipated the wishes of Congress, and had, through every 
embarrassment, pressed downward toward the import 
ant posts they wished; for it was my fixed determination to gain post at Dechambeau, which I mean 
to fortify so as to make it inaccessible. This commands the channel, secures the country, destroys the 
communication, and affords a safe retreat, if we are 
obliged to make one. General Thompson was embarking for that purpose, when the resolves arrived. 
The ships are now above that place ; but if General 
Thompson succeeds at Three Rivers, I will soon remove the ships below Richelieu Falls, and after that 
approach towards Quebec as fast as possible ; and, according to the present appearance of affairs, may Exceed in number the Hanoverians, &c., which we are 
threatened with. I have no doubt of the general attachment of the Canadians, though I suppose some 
unprincipled wretches among them will always appear against us; but a vast majority will be for us, 
and perhaps as many, according to their numbers, 
are really in our favor as in some other Colonies 
upon the Continent. Many of them are with General Thompson in this expedition, and great numbers are 
here, ready equipped, waiting my orders. 
</p><p>
I may venture to assure you and the Congress 
that I can, in a few days, reduce the army to order 
and, with the assistance of a kind <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, put a 
new face to our affairs here, which a few days since 
seemed almost impossible. General Thompson and 
the Baron de Woedtke have done every thing in 
their power to assist me. <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>General Arnold</a> has not 
joined me, being, as you may see by his letter, 
which I inclose to you, much engaged at Montreal, 
upon affairs of importance. The post at La Chine, 
which he mentions, I can by no means consent to 
afford such a large body of men to defend against a 
petty number of savages, little else than a mob. I 
have, therefore, ordered a small fortification to be 
thrown up by Colonel Dehaas's party, consisting of about nine hundred men ? and made inaccessible, at 
least to savages, and garrisoned it with two hundred 
men ; the rest to return to me, as all our operations 
ought to be down the river, where, if we are successful, the insurrection there will die, of course. I 
have ordered a month's provision to be lodged there, 
lest an excuse of surrendering, for want of provision, 
before we can relieve it, should take place, as at the 
Cedars. I do not think it a post of great importance, or, indeed, any in our rear, except St. John's 
and <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>, which will ever secure a retreat, and 
to these I will pay particular attention. 
</p><p>
I hope, dear General, to give you, in a few days, 
some agreeable intelligence ; while I remain, with the 
most profound respect, 
</p><p>
Your Excellency's obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jsu" rel="me">JOHN SULLIVAN</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I shall soon obtain proper returns of our 
scattered army, and will forward them, with return 
of stores, &c. ; after which you may expect them 
weekly. I have, for your diversion, inclosed to you 
one which is similar to what the other Colonels must 
make, if called upon. I inclose to your Excellency a 
letter from Colonel Duggan. I have appointed a 
Court of Inquiry into the accusation against him. I 
am informed, by General Thompson, Mr. Bromfield, 
and others, that the accusation is false, and that he 
is a very useful man. He has, at my request, since 
he wrote the above letter, raised and armed upwards 
of two hundred men for us. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be your Excellency's most 
obedient servant, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jsu" rel="me">JOHN SULLIVAN</a>. 
</p><p>
As I have not time to write the Congress, I beg 
your Excellency to forward to them a copy of this.

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
At three quarters after eleven o clock this fore 
noon, I received a letter from General Thompson, of 
which the inclosed is a copy. I find that he has 
proceeded in the manner proposed, and made his at 
tack on the troops at Three Rivers, at daylight ; for 
at that time a very heavy cannonading began, which 
lasted, with some intervals, to twelve o clock. It is 
now near one, P. M. ; the firing has ceased, except 
some irregular firing with cannon, at a considerable 
distance of time one from the other. At eight o clock, 
a very heavy firing of smallarms was heard, even 
here, at the distance of forty-five miles. The distance 
might have rendered it doubtful, had not the boats 
down the bay, which have since arrived, confirmed it, 
and declared that they distinctly heard the smallarms 
for a long time. I am almost certain that victory 
has declared in our favor, as the irregular firing of 
the cannon for such a length of time after the small-arms ceased, shows that our men are in possession of 
the ground. 
</p><p>
I should immediately set off to join General 
Thompson, with Colonel Dehaas's detachment; but 
by some strange kind of conduct in <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>General Arnold</a>, 
directly contrary to repeated orders, lie has kept that 
detachment dancing between this and Montreal ever 
since my arrival. Some of the officers, this moment 
arrived, inform me that he let them come within 
eighteen miles of this place, and ordered them back 
again. He has now permitted them to pass to <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>, and I expect them here this evening, when I shall immediately set off with them to join General Thompson. I am now informed, by Mr. McCarty, that <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>General Arnold</a> has abandoned Montreal, and gone to <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>, with all the troops. I hope this report is 
not just, as the step must, in every light, be imprudent and injudicious ; it leaves that quarter entirely 
without a check, and gives our enemies liberty to assemble and form any mischievous designs they please, without interruption. 
</p><p>
I hear that the report at Montreal, yesterday, was, 
that the enemy had passed us at <a href='/results.php?city=sorel' rel='city'>Sorel</a>, and were 
passing up the river. This gave them the alarm, 
and caused them to abandon the city. I wish it 
may not prove true ; but, as it is so much of a piece 
with former conduct, I cannot help giving it some degree of credit. Notwithstanding the weakness of this 
post, occasioned by the strange delay of Colonel De-haas, I have sent Colonel Winds, with his regiment, 
to reenforce General Thompson. This I did this 
morning, at eight o clock. They have joined him be 
fore now, I trust. I hope soon to follow, with more 
force, to maintain the ground which, I dare say, our 
troops have won. We hear no firing now, except a 
few cannon at a great distance of time between, 
sometimes half an hour's space at least. This, with 
many other circumstances, induces me to believe our 
troops are victorious. I am anxious to know the 
event, which God grant may be fortunate. However, 
if our party have been, or should be, defeated, I am 
determined not to leave Canada, but to make vigi 
lance and industry supply the want of numbers. I 
am determined to fortify and secure the most important posts, and hold them as long as one stone is 
left upon another. 
</p><p>
It is a serious truth that our army is extremely weak. Colonel Greaton is with me, without a single man, all under inoculation- Colonel Bond, with all 
his regiment ; in the same situation ; Colonel Patter 
son has six only; Colonel Stark, about forty; Colonel 
Reed's and Colonel Poor's nearly in the same situation. Poor is at St. John's ; Reed at Chaniblee. <a href='/results.php?tla=aab' rel='colleague'>Colonel Burr</a>ell's return I sent in my last, and the other 
regiments are most of them in the same situation; 
for this Colony, it seems, has of late been considered 
the general hospital of America. The party with 
General Thompson, and that with Colonel Dehaas, 
contain the flower of our army at present. Some 
regiments are nearly out of the smallpox, and will 
be fit for duty in a few days. Our numbers will be 
daily increasing. I should rejoice, however, to see 
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> here, with his brigade, if he can be 
spared from JS T ew York. 
</p><p>
June 12, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>. I could not close the foregoing 
letter, till I could get some certain intelligence of 
General Thompson and his party, most of which, 
after being unfortunately repulsed, are now returned ; 
but the General himself, with Colonel Irvine, Dr. McKenzie, Mr. Currie, Mr. Bird, Mr. Edy, and Parson Colley, are unluckily fallen into the hands of our 
enemies. A flag has arrived this night for their bag 
gage, by which he writes that he and the other Gentlemen are treated with the greatest politeness by 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>, who commands at Three Rivers. 
The officers suppose they had about twenty-five killed, and we find missing in the whole about a hundred and fifty, some of which we expect in yet, as 
some have arrived this evening, and say more will 
be in. The General was taken, after the retreat, by 
some Canadian militia, summoned in by Caiieton. I 
have also a number, which I have summoned in to 
take part with us, under the Baron de Woedtke. 
Our people say that the Canadians were, in general, 
very kind to them, upon their retreat, and gave them 
every assistance in their power. 
</p><p>
The unfortunate defeat of General Thompson and 
his detachment happened in this manner; namely, 
the repeated accounts from Three Rivers of the smallness of their numbers induced General Thompson to 
detach <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague'>Colonel St. Clair</a> to attack them with seven 
hundred men, "before my arrival. This not being put 
in execution, and St. Clair remaining at Nicolet, and 
the account of their weakness being confirmed, the 
General solicited the liberty of attacking them, which 
I granted, giving the orders which I inclosed in my 
last. He crossed from Nicolet to Three Rivers in 
the night, but being led into a morass by his guides, 
was obliged to return back near two miles; in which 
time the day broke, he was discovered, the ships be 
gan to cannonade, and continued while he marched 
through a swamp, which took near an hour and a 
half. The people came up to the attack, but, unluckily for them, twenty-five vessels had arrived that 
evening with troops, which they landed, while he 
marched on, and, being well prepared, gave them so 
warm a reception that the troops soon broke and 
quitted the ground. The cannonading and all the 
firing after that was a mere random firing, which answered very little purpose. When they found our 
troops began to give way, they detached a party of 
six hundred by the side of the river, to attack them 
in flank, and secure our bateaux. The bateaux were 
preserved by Major Woods, who brought them off. 
One bateau only was taken, with four barrels of powder, and nothing else on board; the men escaped. 
</p><p>
This, dear General, is a state of this unfortunate 
enterprise. What you will hear next, I cannot say. 
I am every moment informed of the vast number of 
the enemy which have arrived. Some, indeed, say 
that great numbers have arrived from England, and 
all the troops from Halifax. This I do not believe ; 
but I apprehend their numbers now are very great. 
I have here only two thousand five hundred and thirty-three, rank and file. Most of the officers seem 
discouraged, and, of course, their men. I am employed, day and night, in fortifying and securing my camp, 
and am. determined to hold it as long as a person 
will stick by me. I have heard nothing of Colonel 
Dayton s, or the residue of Colonel Wayne's regiment, 
or of the others ordered here. Sure I am that they 
are much wanted. There are some regiments all down 
with the smallpox; not a single man fit for duty. 
This will be remedied in time, unless the enemy make 
a sudden push, which, indeed, we expect every hour. 
If so, we must, with the numbers we have, sustain 
their efforts, and I hope repulse them. 
</p><p>
Dear General, I am, with much regard, your most devoted, humble servant,

P. S. Our old friend Colonel Louis, of the Caghnawagas, has this moment arrived express from that tribe. He says all the Indians have made peace, 
even the Canasadagas, and those tribes which joined Captain Forster at the Cedars, except the Roundorks. These have refused in council, and say they will take 
arms for the King, and have sent to General Carleton to let him know it. This tribe consists of fifty warriors only. The Caghnawagas and other tribes desire we should send up some other tribes, which they will join with, to extirpate them. This they would do themselves, but are apprehensive that some few French, through the influence of their priests, will join them. Indeed I can but illy spare the force; but it is a matter of too much importance to be neglected. I must, therefore, send some force under the command of an experienced officer.

I have the honor to be, your Excellency's most obedient servant,

MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
It is with the greatest pain I inform you, that, 
after our retreat from Canada to this place, of which 
I have given your Excellency an account through 
<a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>, and after I had determined to 
make a stand here till I received your Excellency's 
order, I find myself under an absolute necessity of 
quitting this Island for a place more healthy- other 
wise the army will never be able to return, as one 
fortnight longer in this place will not leave us well 
men enough to carry off the sick, exclusive of the 
public stores, which I have preserved thus far. The 
raging of the smallpox deprives us of whole regiments in the course of a few days, by their being 
taken down with that cruel disorder. But this is not 
all. The camp disorder rages to such a degree that, 
of the regiments remaining, from twenty to sixty in 
each are taken down in a day, and we have nothing to give them, but salt pork., flour, and the poisonous waters of this Lake. I have, therefore, determined, 
with the unanimous voice of the officers, to remove to Isle-la-Motte, a place much more healthy than this, where I have some hope we shall preserve the 
health of the few men we have, till some order is taken respecting our future movements. 
</p><p>
I think it would be by far the best to remove to 
Crown Point, fortify that, build row-galleys to command the Lake, and by scouting parties to defend 
our frontiers, as the savages have already begun upon 
us. They have made two attacks upon our men, 
killed and taken near twenty, among whom are some 
officers. These officers went on shore unarmed, when 
I was gone to reconnoitre Point-au-Fer. The other 
party went on shore at river Lecot to buy milk. 
They were in boats loaded with flour, which they 
brought off, but had some men killed. The whole of 
our loss, in killed and taken, amounts to about twenty. This happened in both cases for want of that 
care which should ever be taken in an enemy's country. I hope it will be a warning to our people in future. 
</p><p>
I hear, from all quarters, that the enemy arc very 
numerous in Canada. Their shipping is also numerous, and it cannot be doubted that all the Canadians 
and all the Indians in this quarter will be compelled 
to bear arms against us. This I know they would 
gladly have avoided ; but, finding that we are not 
able to afford them that protection we promised, they 
are obliged to make their peace, in the best manner 
they can. I think it is now past a doubt, that the 
neglect and inattention to this department has not 
only lost us Canada, but involved us in a war with 
all the blacks and whites in this quarter; and to check their progress I know of no better method 
than to secure the important posts of <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> 
and Crown Point, and, by building a number of 
armed vessels, command the Lakes ; otherwise the 
forces now in Canada will be brought down upon us 
as quick as possible, having nothing now to oppose 
them in that Colony. 
</p><p>
They have a number of bateaux framed, which 
they brought from Three Rivers. They will doubt 
less construct some armed vessels, and then endeavour 
to penetrate the country toward <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. This, I 
am persuaded, they will attempt, but am sure they 
can never effect, unless we neglect to secure the important posts now in our power. I have written to 
<a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>, and wait with impatience for his answer, as I know that no time ought to be lost in 
fortifying this place or Crown Point. If I attempt 
to fortify here, and afterwards am ordered to leave 
it, I shall strengthen the enemy, by preparing a 
work for them, which I would not willingly do. If 
I am to tarry and fortify here, I should be glad to 
know it as soon as possible, that I may put the order in execution ; but I must say that, unless our 
men grow much more healthy, our army here will be 
no kind of check upon the enemy after remaining in 
this low marsh for a few weeks longer. 
</p><p>
I inclose your Excellency a general return, drawn 
from the returns made the day before yesterday; 
since which I suppose a quarter part have been taken 
down with the camp disorder. This, however incredible it may seem, is a real fact. For instance, Colonel Wayne has sixty, out of one hundred and thirty-eight, taken down since. Colonel Dehaas and all 
his field-officers, with a number of his men, are since 
taken clown. This seems to run through the whole, no corps being exempt from it. I am shocked to re late, but much more to see, this dreadful havoc among the troops. 
</p><p>
I inclose your Excellency a return of the ordnance 
and stores at St. John's on the 12th instant. The 
whole could not, in our confused state, be procured. 
As to the provisions, some are on board the armed 
vessels, some at this place, and some at Isle-la-Motte, 
which were never brought further down. I can make 
no accurate return at present. I will have one made 
as soon as possible and forward it, and send regular 
returns in future. I do not despair of getting this 
army yet into some kind of order and regulation ; but 
T must confess that it is a work of time and trouble, as order and regularity seem to have been 
strangers in this northern army. 
</p><p>
I received your Excellency's favor of the 13th instant. I am extremely sorry it was not in my power 
to fulfil your Excellency's wishes, by leading on our 
troops to victory. The reasons for my not being able 
have doubtless long since reached you in my letters 
giving an account of the strength of the enemy, the 
weakness of our army, and the unhappy defeat of 
General Thompson at Three Rivers, as also the result of our Council of War in Canada, I think we 
shall secure all the public stores and baggage of the 
army, and secure our retreat, with very little loss. 
Whether we shall have W 7 ell men enough to carry 
them on, I much doubt, if we don t remove quickly, 
unless Heaven is pleased to restore health to this 
wretched army, now, perhaps, the most pitiful one 
that ever was formed. 
</p><p>
There is no return of Colonel Patterson's regiment, 
as he has but five men here fit for duty, whom I 
this day ordered to Crown Point to join the rest of the regiment, who are all sick there. You may as 
sure yourself, my dear General, that nothing shall be 
wanting, on my part, to restore order among the 
troops here and to recover their health, as also to 
throw every stumblingblock in the way of the enemy, that lies in the power of your Excellency's 
Most affectionate, humble servant,

DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
This morning at daybreak, I received your Excellency's favor of the 16th instant; am extremely mortified to find that every thing here has turned out 
contrary to my expectations, and your Excellency's 
wishes. This was not owing to my being deceived 
with respect to the enemy on the ground at the 
time I wrote, but to the sudden arrival of such a 
number under <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>, the night before 
the battle of Three Rivers, of which I have given 
a full and perfect account in former letters. I 
am conscious of having done every thing in my 
power to gain the ground our troops had lost, and 
to secure the retreat of the army, when I found our point could not be carried. I imagine that <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met'>General Schuyler</a> forgot to inclose the return, as I think -it 
went from me at the time; "but I am not clear whether it did not go in a separate letter. I dare say 
it has reached you before this. I now inclose an 
other which I wish safe to hand, and hope to have 
a more complete and , perfect one in a few days, 
which I shall forward to your. Excellency. 
</p><p>
I am well convinced of the necessity of a good 
understanding being kept up among the officers of 
the army. This has been remarkably the case since 
my arrival. I have not seen an instance to the contrary, except some few reflections which seemed to 
take place between the northern and southern troops, 
which I hope I have sufficiently cured by calling 
upon the officers of every corps, and requesting them 
to suppress a thing, which, if continued, must weaken, 
if not destroy, the army. They all agreed to join 
heartily in putting an end to this dangerous behaviour among the troops, which I am convinced they 
did, as I have heard nothing of it since, and find 
that harmony takes place among the troops in a surprising manner. In all our difficulties there seemed 
a unanimity of sentiment among all the officers. 
Indeed, I have not known the least dispute among 
them. The unfortunate General Thompson, the Baron de Woedtke, and myself were at <a href='/results.php?city=sorel' rel='city'>Sorel</a>. Never did 
greater harmony and friendship exist. <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague met'>General Arnold</a> was at Montreal, and kept up the most friendly 
intercourse and correspondence with us, and we with 
him. It is true, I thought the keeping Colonel De-haas from <a href='/results.php?city=sorel' rel='city'>Sorel</a> was wrong, but only supposed it an 
error in judgment, as I did that of his keeping the 
forces in too great numbers at the posts up the country. This I communicated to him in the most friendly manner, which he accounted for in a way 
that convinced- me that he acted not without some 
foundation ; though I think it would have been better 
had it not been done. Assure yourself, my dear 
General, that I will exert myself in cultivating harmony and friendship among both officers and soldiers 
in the army, and that I am, with the most profound 
respect, your Excellency's 
</p><p>
Most devoted, humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jsu" rel="me">JOHN SULLIVAN</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. The Brigade-Major and Adjutant of the day 
have this moment informed me, that, while they 
were parading the main guard, four men dropped 
down under arms, and appear like dead men. I am 
almost distracted with the thought of losing so many 
men as daily go off by sickness. I shall, to-day, remove from this infectious place to Isle-la-Motte, 
which I should have done before now, had not too 
many of our bateaux gone forward with the sick to 
Crown Point.

MY DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
I have called on <a href='/results.php?tla=alm' rel='colleague'>General McDougall</a>, and informed 
him, confidentially, of the state of our army. He says 
there are about six hundred Continental troops here, 
with two Massachusetts militia regiments. He is of 
opinion, that the Continental troops here should be 
sent forward, and that this State should garrison this 
post, for which purpose he will call on <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel='colleague'>Mr. Jay</a>, and 
consult with him upon the most effectual measures to 
bring it about. 
</p><p>
Dear General, since I left the army I have been 
informed that <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague'>General St. Clair</a> is to take the command at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> the ensuing campaign. Though 
I never wish to complain, I cannot help the disagree 
able feelings, so common to mankind, when they find 
themselves slighted and neglected. When I had completed the disagreeable retreat from Canada, I was 
with circumstances of indignity. Since which, 
and before, every Major-General, except myself, has 
had the honor of commanding posts, separated from 
the main army. <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague'>General Putnam</a> has commanded at 
New r York and <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>; <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague'>General Gates</a> at Ticonderoga and <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>; <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>General Greene</a> in the Jerseys, when the army was at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>; General 
Spencer at Rhode Island ; and <a href='/results.php?tla=wih' rel='colleague'>General Heath</a> the 
forces in this State. I have never yet been thought 
worthy to intrust with the command of a separate 
post. I have felt those things most sensibly, and 
wish to know, to what it is owing. If it be to my 
want of prudence, resolution, or whatever other cause, 
I wish to know it, that I may rid the Continent of 
an officer who is unworthy to trust with command. 
</p><p>
I once had the command in Canada by an act of 
<a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> ; and even malice itself cannot censure my 
conduct. I was soon deprived of the command, and 
rewarded with disgrace for saving the army and 
stores in that country. I know that <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a> will 
become an important object with the enemy. They 
must try for it, and therefore he that has the command there will have the post of honor. I do there 
fore humbly claim it as my right, and as the first 
separate post intrusted to my care; and cannot think 
of the command being given to a younger officer, 
without conceiving myself a second time treated with 
neglect, which I well know my conduct has not deserved. 
</p><p>
I wish your Excellency to forward me a line by 
the post upon this subject, which will be gratefully 
acknowledged by 
</p><p>

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
You are to march as soon as possible with Colonel Irvine's 
and Colonel Wayne's regiments, together with those of <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague'>Colonel St. Clair</a> now remaining at this place, . and join <a href='/results.php?tla=arc' rel='colleague'>Colonel St. Clair</a> at Kicolet, and take command of the whole party; and 
unless you find the number of the enemy at Three Rivers to 
be such as would render an attack upon them hazardous, you 
are to cross the river, at the most convenient place you can, 
and attack them. You will pay particular attention to the preservation of your bateaux, keeping them at a convenient distance 
above the shipping, which lies at or near the Three Rivers. 
I would by no means advise to an attack, if the prospect of 
success is not much in your favor, as a defeat of your party 
at this time might prove the total loss of this country. 
</p><p>
Sir, as I have (without flattery) the highest opinion of the 
bravery and good conduct of yourself and the officers you command, I forbear attempting particular instructions, being well 
assured, that neither prudence nor resolution will be wanting to 
answer the great purpose we have in view. I have the highest opinion of the bravery and resolution of the troops you command, and doubt not but, under the direction of a kind providence, you will open the way for our recovering that ground, 
which former troops have so shamefully lost. Wishing you the 
greatest success and safety, I am, dear Sir, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
DEAR GENERAL, 
</p><p>
By a strange reverse of fortune we are driven to the sad 
necessity of abandoning Canada. I had the most sanguine hopes 
of collecting our army together, and driving the enemy below 
Dechambeau, in which I doubt not I should have succeeded, 
had not Burgoyne, with a strong party, arrived in Canada, and readied the Three Rivers the night before our people made 
the unfortunate attack upon that place under General Thompson. The particulars of this engagement I have not before had 
in my power to give you. I find our loss to amount to about a hundred and fifty. Colonel Wayne sustained the greatest, as 
his men began the attack, and behaved with great bravery, as did the Colonel himself. In short, all the officers behaved with 
great spirit, except some few of low rank ; and had not the number of the enemy been so superior, I doubt not the point Avould have been carried, in which case I should have pushed for Dechambeau, which, if secured, would have given us the 
command of the country. But this defeat convinced us that we came too late for the important purpose. 
</p><p>
I was determined, however, to hold <a href='/results.php?city=sorel' rel='city'>Sorel</a>, as it seemed the 
pleasure of Congress. But, after taking unwearied pains to fortify that post, and to collect the main body of the army to 
defend it, I found but twenty-five hundred at that place, and 
about a thousand more at the other garrisons, most of the latter being under inoculation, and those regiments, which had not 
the smallpox, expecting every day to be taken down with it. 
At the same time the British Heel, to the amount of thirty-six sail, had advanced into the Lake near us, and sixty-six lay 
at Three Elvers. The encampment of the enemy was, to appearance, very large, and every account proved their number to 
be exceedingly superior to ours. The Canadians, too, as far as 
the enemy advanced, were obliged to take arms or be destroyed. 
In this state of affairs I was much embarrassed, yet was determined to hold my ground at all hazards. 
</p><p>
But, to my great mortification, I found myself at the head 
of a dispirited army, iilled with horror at the thought of seeing  their enemy. Indeed, I was much surprised to see the 
scattered remains of this army, when I had them collected together. The smallpox, famine, and disorder, had rendered them 
almost lifeless. The flight from before Quebec, the fate of those 
at the Cedars, and the total loss of Sherburne's party, had, be 
fore my arrival with my brigade, destroyed all spirit among 
these troops ; but, upon our arrival, their spirit seemed to return. But, when they found this party defeated, and the number of the enemy increasing, I found a great panic again taking  place among both officers and soldiers. I had no less, I 
believe, than forty officers, who begged leave to resign their 
commissions upon the most trivial pretences, and this even Extended to Field-Officer?. The prevailing opinion was, that the 
enemy, instead of attacking our works, would get round us, and 
cut off our communication with the upper country, and destroy 
our retreat. This, indeed, they had completely in their power, 
as we had not force to dislodge them. I soon found, that how 
ever strongly I might fortify <a href='/results.php?city=sorel' rel='city'>Sorel</a>, my men would in general 
leave me upon appearance of the enemy. 
</p><p>
In this state of affairs I called a Council of all the Field-Officers, with the Baron de Woedtke, and they were almost 
unanimously for quitting the ground. <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>General Arnold</a> was not 
present, but his opinion you have, as well as that of Colonel 
Hazen and Colonel Antill, in the inclosed letters. I then immediately decamped, taking with us every article, teven to a 
spade. The enemy, having a fair wind, was at our works in an 
hour after we left them. Our guards at Bertier, not coming in 
at the time they were ordered, were met by the enemy, forced 
to leave nine bateaux, and take to <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a> by land. This 
was all the loss we sustained. We retreated as far as <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>. This post not being tenable, we removed our bateaux 
over the rapids, with all the baggage and stores, except three 
pieces of cannon, which were too heavy to bring over the rapids, and indeed they were but bad pieces of ordnance at best. 
I then proceeded to St. John s, where every thing arrived in 
safety. We burnt the garrison at <a href='/results.php?city=chamblee' rel='city'>Chamblee</a>, with the gondolas 
and vessels there, leaving nothing but ruin behind us in the 
fort. We pulled up all the bridges in our way to St. John s. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>General Arnold</a> did the same in the other road from Montreal, 
from which place he made a very prudent and judicious retreat, 
with an enemy close at his heels. 
</p><p>
When we got to St. John s, another Council was held, where 
it was unanimously agreed, that to attempt holding St. John's 
would be to expose the whole army to inevitable ruin, as our 
communication might be easily cut off, and the whole army fall 
a sacrifice. Previous to this, I received the resolves of Congress 
for six thousand militia, which I laid before the Council. They 
were all of opinion, that this would rather weaken than strength 
en our army, and further, that they could not possibly arrive in 
season to save us from a powerful army close at our heels. 
They were fully of opinion that, in the present unhealthy state 
of the army, it would be best to move to Crown Point, fortify 
that post, and build armed vessels to secure the navigation of the 
Lake. Upon this we immediately stripped the garrison of every article, took our bateaux, and retreated to this island. Further 
than this I could not go, without your or General <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>'s 
orders, or the directions of Congress. I therefore send on the 
sick, the looks and numbers of which will present you with the 
most dismal spectacle ever furnished from one army in this quarter of the globe. I have sent on <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>General Arnold</a> to give direction. at Crown Point, and receive your orders. The men, who 
are fit for duty, I shall retain here, ready to execute any orders 
you will please to communicate. 
</p><p>
Thus, dear General, I have given you an imperfect account 
of my unfortunate campaign. Claiming no merit, except in making  a safe and regular retreat, and although driven to it by inevitable necessity (as the Grand Post was lost before my arrival, and put beyond my power to regain), and although it was 
before an army much more powerful than mine, yet I am sufficiently mortified, and sincerely wish I had never seen this fatal 
country, unless I had arrived in season to have done some good 
to my country, and answered the expectations of Congress. Dear 
General, believe me to be, with the greatest respect, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant,
