Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I entertained the pleasing hope of meeting you at 
this place ; on no better authority, indeed, than report, and yet I feel the disappointment in proportion 
to my affection for your person, my gratitude for 
your public services, and the kind attention with 
which you have always indulged me. Be pleased to 
take in good part the address which I have the honor to transmit, with the freedom of our city in a 
golden box. It can add nothing to your glory ; but 
we flatter ourselves it may not be unacceptable as 
a permanent testimony of the esteem and gratitude 
of citizens, who, of all others, have been most distinguished by your care and solicitude. 
</p><p>
I once flattered myself that the dignity of our Government would have borne some proportion to the 
illustrious achievements by which it was successfully 
established ; but it is to be deplored that federal attachment, and a sense of national obligation, continue 
to give place to vain prejudices in favor of the independence and sovereignty of the individual States. I 
have endeavoured, in pursuance of the great motive 
which induced me to continue in public life, to inculcate more enlarged and liberal principles ; but the 
spirit of the times seems opposed to my feeble efforts, 
and I have lost credit with our Assembly ; though, I 
hope, not with the world. If opportunity offers, I 
shall take the liberty to submit to your perusal 
the judgment pronounced in the Court where I preside, which has produced the censure promulgated in 
the papers ; in effect, " that we had the presumption 
to control the operation of an act of the Legislature, 
from a respect to the treaty of peace and the law 
of nations." I trust you know me too well to think 
that I can be otherwise concerned for this event than 
as it may injure the reputation of my native State, 
of which I have so long been a faithful and confidential servant. <a href='/results.php?tla=joj' rel=''>Mr. Jay</a>, Mr. Dickinson, and other 
great men, from public considerations, have honored 
us with the highest approbation. Their comments are 
calculated for the public eye, and will appear when 
they can do the greatest good. 
</p><p>
I have too long been indulged in writing to you 
with unreserved freedom and confidence, to suppress 
this detail ; and, if it was ever so immaterial, your 
goodness would pardon it. 
</p><p>
Do me the honor to make my most respectful 
compliments acceptable to Mrs. Washington, and to 
assure her that, in the circle of her numerous friends, 
there are none who remember her with more sincere 
regard than Mrs. Duane and all the branches of our 
family. With every sentiment of the most perfect 
and affectionate attachment, 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, &c., &c., 
</p><p>
