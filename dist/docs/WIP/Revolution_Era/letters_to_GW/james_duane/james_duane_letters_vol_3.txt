</p><p>
Dear General, 
</p><p>
Yesterday I had the honor of your Excellency's 
very friendly letter of the 4th instant, for which be 
pleased to accept my warmest thanks. 
</p><p>
Before this reaches jour hands, you will have received the new arrangement of the army. Submitted, 
as it is, to your opinion, it is only to be considered 
as an essay, open to such alterations as you may 
suggest. The idea of a majority of Congress was 
clear, that it would be too hazardous to risk the defence of America on the practicability of drawing an 
army for the war into the field by the first of January. The alternative, therefore, as you will find it 
guarded, was thought necessary, though all admitted 
a permanent force to be most desirable. I saw and 
explained the danger of an alternative, however cautiously expressed. The States may think they do 
enough if they comply with either of the injunctions; 
and while men who make arms a profession have a 
prospect of being annually retained for high premiums, they will hardly tie themselves at once for 
the war. 
</p><p>
In the original proposition there was another alternative, — for the war, or for three f/ears ; besides that 
which gives your Excellency so much and such just 
apprehension. This last was rejected by a majority, 
perhaps unfortunately, as, in The opinion of many, it 
strengthened the reasons for the annual supply by 
drafts. I do not think it too late to correct this error, if pointed out with the force that every thing 
falls from your pen. The manner of reduction is, 
I am confident, liable to great objection, and I have 
no doubt but you will suggest a rule, or principle, 
or any thing you may think better, which will avoid 
the difficulty you suggest, and meet with approbation ; for I do not conceive that a single member 
will be tenacious of the provision on this article. Indeed, I am persuaded that your Excellency's representations, on this and every subject, will have as much influence as you can wish; and that, on this 
particular occasion, nothing hut a clear conviction of 
impracticability will induce Congress to overrule your opinion. 
</p><p>
A false estimate of the power and perseverance of 
our enemies was friendly to the present revolution, 
and inspired that confidence of success, in all ranks 
of people, which was necessary to unite them in so 
arduous a cause. You cannot forget the opinions 
which were current on this floor, at the first and 
second Congresses, and how firmly they established 
this error. We seem to part with it with reluctance; 
it still hangs heavy upon us, and has produced the 
indecision, the expedients, and the debility of which 
you complain. I hope misfortunes and distresses will, 
at length, rouse us to just sentiments and vigorous 
exertions, and, with your Excellency, I pray God, 
that the fatal delusion which has marked our conduct, may end here. 
</p><p>
When the enemy turn their eyes to the southward, 
they see too much imbecility not to be encouraged 
to attempt to extend their conquest, and improve 
advantages which they have derived, in no small 
degree, from our own temerity and misconduct. I 
believe we shall not want men to oppose them, Virginia having made efforts, the expensiveness of which 
is incredible, and North Carolina being equally disposed to act vigorously, though not so capable to 
raise their quota, for a fixed and certain period. I 
wish we may have it in our power to provide the 
necessary supplies. Your Excellency too well knows 
and feels our difficulties and embarrassments, and that 
they are only to be surmounted by great exertions. 
I flatter myself that you do me no more than justice 
in believing that duty and inclination equally demand 
my assiduous endeavours to correct our past errors, 
and draw forth our resources. 
</p><p>
I am much obliged to your Excellency for your 
account of the interview at <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a>; and beg you 
to believe, that no man can be with greater affection 
and personal attachment than I am, &c.,

</p><p>
My dear General, 
</p><p>
I should not so long have restrained the expressions of a heart flowing with the most affectionate 
and respectful attachment, if care had not been taken 
to communicate our intelligence officially. In the 
mean time, I have never found it so necessary to devote my attention to the public business. Amidst 
pressing distresses, it will give your Excellency pleasure to be assured that Congress have deliberated 
with unanimity, and decided with firmness, and that 
every thing, within their powder, is nearly accomplished for vigorous efforts in the course of the next year. 
If the States will draw forth their resources ; if our 
ally will seriously cooperate, by assuming a naval 
superiority in the American seas ; if we are seasonably furnished with the clothing, arms, and ammunition which we have reason to expect ; and obtain the 
aid of money, which we have once more attempted to 
borrow ; — if these circumstances in any tolerable degree combine, your Excellency will at last see a prospect, under the Divine blessing, of finishing the war 
with glory. 
</p><p>
But it is obvious that we have many difficulties 
to encounter. Government, instead of possessing the 
confidence and the dignity necessary to enforce its 
counsels, is surrounded bv clamorous creditors and 
insidious speculators; and, what is worse, the intemperance of our friends conspires with the malice of 
our enemies to render it odious. Congress may err; 
they are not exempt from State and personal prejudices ; they are liable to be deceived. But nothing is 
more certain than that, in the common cause, their 
intentions are pure, their zeal, their cares, their pains 
unbounded; and the time will come when, if their 
measures are not admired, they will be approved. Indeed, Sir, an honest and disinterested patriot requires 
uncommon fortitude to render himself responsible, in 
an hour of such intolerable licentiousness. Those 
who placed their happiness in reputation retire from a 
theatre, where, while they are tortured by public distresses, they are in danger of disgrace. The intrigues 
of speculators are more and more alarming. Our paper money lately suffered a convulsion, without any 
apparent cause, which threatened its total dissolution. 
Not contented with the infinite evils which they 
have entailed on their country, they have practised 
their arts on the Cabinet of France, and with such 
success, that one of our Ministers received a formal intimation that the <a href='/results.php?tla=cdl' rel='colleague'>Chevalier De La Luzerne</a> would be 
instructed to remonstrate against the act of the 18th 
of March, as a violation of public faith, and an injury 
to the trading part of that nation, which ought to be 
repaired. <a href='/results.php?tla=jod' rel='colleague'>Mr. Adams</a> has acquired applause by a 
memorial to Count de Vergennes on this subject, full 
of good sense and dignity. The necessity and the 
justice of that memorable system are vindicated by 
reasons and facts which force conviction. The capital 
figure which the French factors made in drawing on 
the depreciation, and their avarice in striving to exact 
specie for the nominal sums of the bills, when it is 
notorious that they raised the price of their commodities in proportion to the current exchange, are exposed ; and it is demonstrated, that, instead of suffering, they greatly profited by that national calamity. 
Nor is the proper inference neglected, that a Government capable, in a free country, of executing a plan 
SO disgusting to the self-interested, must possess unlimited confidence, and be established on the firmest 
basis. I am persuaded that this seasonable representation will remove ever} prejudice, and prevent the 
effects of an attempt big with ruin. 
</p><p>
Another great difficulty which embarrasses us, is 
the absolute dependence which we are compelled to 
place on the exertions of the States individually. A 
failure in one may draw upon us insupportable distress. If the supplies of provisions should be punctually furnished, the transportation alone is an expense of such magnitude that I never think of it 
but with anxiety, especially when we consider how 
deeply pecuniary taxes are anticipated, by certificates 
in the hands of the farmers. There is a remedy; 
but whether we have a sufficient degree of public 
spirit to apply it, can only be known by experiment. 
Why should not the opulent contribute the whole or 
a large proportion of their plate ? Why should not 
the farmer break in upon his capital, if his annual 
produce is incompetent ? Nothing is clearer than 
that this would be the truest economy, as a foundation would be laid to terminate the war by a great 
and decisive effort. These are resources in the power 
of every Legislature; and I shall think them inexcusable, if, seeing the necessity to be so urgent, they 
shrink from the burden. A duty on imports, exports, and prizes, will be strongly recommended by 
Congress ; and, if approved by the States, it must 
produce a considerable revenue. 
</p><p>
We have made an estimate of the national expense 
for a year from next January. Except the Quartermaster's branch, it is tolerably accurate. I should be 
happy if our means to defray it were certain and 
adequate ; but This is not to be relied on, unless we 
are effectually roused by a sense of our common danger, and the necessity of concluding, with glory and 
expedition, a war of devastation. Every liberal hand 
must be opened; every patriotic heart must be animated ; every public and private effort must be exerted to strengthen and support our army, to give 
weight to our national counsels, and secure them obedience at home and reputation abroad. Without the 
first, the courage, perseverance, and military accomplishments of our General must be frustrated ; without the last, it would be madness to hope for credit, 
alliance, or respect from foreign powers. 
</p><p>
After a studied contempt of the power of our 
enemy, which has marked the progress of our contest, too great a dependence on foreign succour claims 
a rank in our political errors. I speak of the public 
opinion, exempting Congress, as I ought, from a share 
in this folly. Charmed with a revolution so friendly 
to the rights of human nature, and so humbling to 
the insolence of Britain, the people were too apt to 
imagine that the coffers of Europe would be emptied 
into our lap without reserve. But, to say nothing 
of the Dutch, experience has shown that the Spaniards, on whom we principally relied, are not to be 
moved by disinterested considerations. That Cabinet 
does not imitate the French in liberality. They view 
the contiguity of those States to the source of their 
treasures, and their rising greatness, with a sufficient 
degree of jealousy. They are cautious of our alliance, 
unless they can acquire solid advantages. They are 
courted by England, and tempted by offers which, 
though they cannot accept without sacrificing their 
honor, their flimily compact, and the esteem of the 
northern powers, they yet seem to countenance, as a 
means to lead us to concessions, of which we cannot think without reluctance. On no other principle is 
Cumberand's residence at Madrid, or the dilatoriness 
which has accompanied the treaty, to be reconciled. 
With respect to a loan, if their inclination was ever 
so prompt, it appears to me either that their funds 
are not productive, or that their economy is even 
worse than our own. They might, however, interpose 
their responsibility, as they have already done for 
the bills which we have drawn and for the clothing which they have supplied; and it would afford us 
essential relief These hints will open another field 
of embarrassment, the extent of which your Excellency will fully perceive. 
</p><p>
I shall only add to the catalogue, that we have 
advice that Sir Henry Clinton has written to his 
Court for a strong reenforcement, or leave to retire 
from his command ; that he has received an approbation of his conduct in flattering terms, and a promise 
of support; and that orders are accordingly issued for 
raising a regiment of cavalry and nine of infantry. 
</p><p>
But, while we are called upon to examine our own 
circumstances with candor, lest we should be deceived by a false estimate, our enemies, it is evident, do 
not repose on a bed of roses. They continue to be 
disturbed by the spirit of independence which pervades Ireland. The Commons of that kingdom lately 
hesitated to agree to a duty, amounting to a prohibition on raw sugars from England. Yelverton, their 
patriot, declared that the Irish trade should, in all 
respects, be upon a perfect equality with the British. 
He rejected the idea of a disparity between the sister kingdoms with contempt, and threatened the courtiers that, if they persisted in their opposition, he 
would put himself at the head of the associators, and 
establish the freedom of commerce by arms. This is 
an argument which carries conviction. Strange that 
in Ireland it should be consistent with loyalty, and 
in America be branded with the appellation of rebellion, and under that absurd idea serve to color over 
every species of inhumanity and vengeance. 
</p><p>
In the West Indies, from the late destructive hurricane, and on the ocean, by a train of capital losses, 
the enemy have suffered most severely, and in the 
tenderest point, their trade, the source of their wealth 
and credit. Their internal dissensions, which, instead 
of being extinguished, are only smothered by the 
vigor which the temerity of Gordon threw into the 
scale of their Government, is a malady which hangs 
heavy upon their Administration. The Convention of 
the neutral maritime powers, which has aimed a fatal 
blow at the sovereignty of the British flag, and the 
imminent danger of their being involved in a war 
with Russia, Denmark, Sweden, and Holland, if they 
persist in a claim so odious, and of drawing down 
the resentment of their own subjects and universal 
contempt, if they relinquish it ; the late insult, offered 
them by Portugal, in shutting their ports against 
their ships of war and prizes ; the impracticability of 
their raising more troops in Germany; the favorable 
light in which our independence is viewed throughout Europe, and the evident satisfaction it gives even 
the princes, on whom they most relied, to see the 
British dominion, commerce, and naval strength circumscribed; their disappointment in not being able, 
by the most disgraceful sacrifices, to detach Spain 
from the war; their failure in ways and means the 
present year; the immensity of their national debt 
and current expenditures; — all these circumstances, 
combined with the necessity of renewing their preparations to oppose the belligerent powers at the very moment they looked for submission from America, are more than sufficient to form a contrast between us and our enemies, by no means to our disadvantage ; nor does it seem presumptuous to think 
that, if we endeavour to deserve the blessing, peace, 
liberty, and independence must, before long, crown 
our wishes. 
</p><p>
I have drawn this letter to an immoderate length. 
Ascribe it to a desire of possessing you of my own 
view of our public affairs, as far as I am at liberty. 
</p><p>
I will only add that the visit of the French noblemen has given pleasure. The Chevalier, particularly, 
recommends himself by his agreeable manners and 
literary accomplishments. Be pleased to pay my 
most respectful compliments to Mrs. Washington. I 
was greatly mortified at her passing through this 
town without my knowledge, as I wished to have 
done myself the honor of attending her to <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>.

P. S. Your Excellency has remarked that the 
communications, with which you honored me on the 
arrangement of the army, hospitals, &c., have had 
their effect.

I need not tell you, my dear General, what I felt 
on the critical arrival of Count de Grasse's squadron. 
Accept my warmest congratulations. The most decisive advantages may reasonably be expected from 
this generous and formidable cooperation. But I will not anticipate. The Financier has relieved my solicitude for the <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> line. A month's pay, however inadequate to their claims, will raise their spirits ; at least, appease their discontent. 
</p><p>
I have this moment despatches from the northward, particularly from <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a>. The Indians have, within a few days, revisited Cobus Kill 
and Schoharie, burned several houses, and captivated 
some of the inhabitants ; and there is reason to be 
apprehensive that they will destroy the grain, which 
is doubtless their principal object, in this incursion. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague'>General Schuyler</a> mentions that there are not less 
than eighty or ninety thousand bushels of wheat at 
Schoharie alone, which he has in vain essayed to 
bring away. 
</p><p>
Since your Excellency's departure, we have thrown 
the solitary remnant of our Marine into the management of our Financier. It will save a capital expense, 
as the Admiralty, Navy Boards, and their subordinate 
offices, are dissolved. When the number of our ships 
and the circumstances of our Treasury justify it, the 
appointment of the Minister of the Marine will be 
seasonable. The Board of the Treasury, and its dependents, will, in a few days, undergo a similar reform. I expect those measures will prove a fruitful 
source of invective against those who have introduced and pressed them ; and I am content to take 
my share. 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure to transmit this letter by Lieutenant-<a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleage met'>Colonel Laurens</a>. In the execution of his 
late mission, he has acquired great honor and given entire satisfaction. From having his report under 
consideration, as a member of a Special Committee, I had an opportunity of minute inquiry; and I am 
convinced he has done every thing which could be expected, under delicate circumstances, from an able 
Minister. He has further increased his reputation by asking leave, immediately after his report, to take 
the field, and by declining any recompense for his essential services ; a disinterestedness which forms a 
striking contrast between him and some other characters. Congress have given him a testimonial of their approbation, which I do myself the honor to inclose. 
I wish it may be in your Excellency's power to distinguish <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleage met'>Colonel Laurens</a> by a command. You may 
be assured that it will be highly pleasing to Congress. With every sentiment of affectionate attachment and respect, and the most sincere wishes for 
your glory and success, I have the honor to be, dear 
Sir, your Excellency's
