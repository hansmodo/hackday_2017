PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME. 

The period embraced in this second volume covers the 
closing years of the senatorial career of Mr. King, before 
his transfer to the position of Minister Plenipotentiary and 
Ambassador to the Court of St. James, and the following 
three years in that capacity; the matter in the third volume 
extending to the close of the mission in 1803. 

The history of the United States during the second term 
of Washington's administration is full of events which 
tested the adaptability of the constitution to meet the 
new questions both domestic and foreign which neces- 
sarily arose under its untried provisions. Happily the 
general policy, which has received the name of federal, 
prevailed, and the basis of .'govern menl; was firmly founded. 
Mr. King was largely instnraisnt&rVin iramihg and sustain- 
ing these measures adopted, as- the: records clearly show; 
yet it is much to be regretted that taere are many gaps in 
his private papers, the filling cfc which mig'ht have thrown 
strong light upon the interesting questions of the day. All, 
however, that the papers in the possession of the Editor 
contain as contemporary history is here presented. 

In reference to the correspondence in the second portion 
of the volume, during the years of Mr. King's residence in 
England, it is proper that some explanation should be made. 
It will be observed that many letters, which have already 
been given to the public in the lives of some of the distin- 
guished contemporaries of Mr. King, are here republished in 
order to show the bearing and illustrate the meaning of the 
letters now first presented. Indeed without them the con- 
tinuity of the narrative would lack much of interest. In all 



VI PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME. 



these cases, and especially in the letters to and from Hamil- 
ton, the source from which they have been taken is noted, 
and where no such reference is made the originals or copies 
of them are in the possession of the Editor, and are repro- 
duced verbatim, except where relating to matters of no in- 
terest to the public. The letters of Pickering, Cabot, 
Troup, Bingham, and many others, relative to the domestic 
affairs of the United States and containing their estimate of 
foreign affairs, are very full and served to keep Mr. King in- 
formed of the current opinion and business of the country, 
helping him in his ministerial work and receiving, in his 
answers, the effect they produced upon the mind of one 
deeply interested, but away from their immediate influence 
at home. 

But perhaps not less interesting is his official correspond- 
ence with the British Government, and with his personal 
friend Timothy Pickering, both in the latter's private capacity 
and as Secretary of State. Pickering's letters are contained 
in a separate volume, copied from the official dispatches, of 
which the originals are probably in the Archives of the 
Legation in jEflglartd'; \wMe''pJjScial communications from 
Mr. King «afr£ '.preservecl m'pres's copies of all his letters, 
which are all in* 'his qwVti handwriting, carefully arranged in 

five large folio volumes' of about 2000 pages ; his letters in 
fa . ... •/•;••:: • 

cipher deciphered..: /Of'/pp-u^se: this correspondence, which 

extends over seven' years — to the end of the next volume, — 
could not all be reproduced here. Many of the letters re- 
late merely to current matters of detail and, though mak- 
ing part of the history of official acts, are not essential to 
their elucidation. Nor is there given an unbroken series of 
letters to and from the Secretary of State, but such selec- 
tions from them as would show the contemporary diploma- 
tic history as it presented itself to the observation of the 
intelligent, clear-headed, and careful man, who had the in- 
terest of his country always at heart and desired to gain for 
it every advantage that his position could enable him to 
obtain. 



PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME. vii 

Conscious of the confidence in his ability and integrity of 
both his Goverment at home and of the King's Ministers, he 
met the various questions which, under the daily changing 
politics of Europe, presented the necessity of prompt de- 
cision, with firmness and courteous discussion, but always, 
when possible to do so, under the special instructions given 
to him. Sometimes, as will be seen, he could not wait for 
these, because of the difficulty of communicating by sailing 
vessels with his Government ; but in no case did his action 
meet with disapprobation at home, or fail to obtain the 
respectful consideration of the Government to which he was 
accredited. 

Several Appendices have been added to this volume, the 
first of which contains, as will be seen, a number of letters 
from Mr. King, during the first years of his public life, but 
which came into the Editor's possession after the publica- 
tion of the first volume. Others are reports of conferences 
with Lord Grenville, one in particular in reference to the 
difficulties which arose in the Commission under the seventh 
article of the Treaty with Great Britain, and which were 
satisfactorily solved. It has been deemed well to collect in 
separate and consecutive narratives the incidents which led 
to the action of Mr. King to protest against the avowed pur- 
pose of the British Government to allow the captured chiefs 
of the rebellion in Ireland to emigrate to the United States, 
and those relative to the proposed plans, by which, in con- 
nection with Miranda, the South American colonies of 
Spain were to be revolutionized and made independent of 
the mother country — plans that depended upon a co-opera- 
tion of England and the United States, but which were not 
carried out.

THE LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF 

RUFUS KING. 



CHAPTER I. 

Mr. King's Re-election to the Senate — Settlement of the System of public 
Credit — Mr. Hamilton's Retirement and R. King's Opinion of it — 
Hamilton's earnest Letter relative to non-subscribing Creditors — Mr. 
Jay's Nomination for Governor of New York. 

The term for which Mr. King had been chosen Senator of 
the United States from New York would expire on March 
4, 1795, and a strong effort was made by the friends of Mr. 
Clinton to prevent his re-election. Notwithstanding this, 
he was on January 27th again appointed to the position by 
a " majority of six in one House and one in the other." 

The Congress which was then sitting was engaged in an 
earnest endeavor to provide for the gradual redemption of 
the funded debt, in accordance with the general system of 
finance, which had been recommended by Alexander Hamil- 
ton and which he had in his reports sustained by most cogent 
reasoning. The result was that the entire management of 
the public debt was vested in the Commissioners of the 
Sinking Fund, with an appropriation, in addition to the re- 
sources already assigned, of the proceeds of certain tempo- 
rary taxes, which would enable them to pay with regularity 
the accruing interest and gradually to extinguish the princi- 
pal of the debt. 

VOL. II. — I T 



RUFUS KING. [1795 



In the original plan there were clauses providing for the 
creditors who had not before subscribed, which, in the House, 
were stricken out, one of the objections to it being that 
under its terms the non-subscribing creditors would be bet- 
ter off than those who had availed themselves of the original 
arrangement. Though it was answered that this would not 
be the case, and other reasons were given why the clauses 
making special provisions should be maintained, it was de- 
cided to strike them out. Mr. Hamilton, who had resigned 
from the office of Secretary of the Treasury before this time, 
was greatly moved by this action and expressed his disap- 
pointment in his letter to Mr. King of February 21st. 

It is to the settlement of the financial affairs of the gov- 
ernment and thus placing the public credit on the firmest 
foundation that Mr. King alludes in his letter to Mr. Gore 
of February 14th ; a letter which gives his opinion of the 
loss the country had sustained by the retirement of a " great 
and virtuous minister " from the public affairs of the coun- 
try, and of his hope that his successor (Mr. Oliver Wolcott) 
" may emulate his predecessor's example." * 



Egbert Benson to R. King, Phila. 

" Poughkeepsie, Jany. 15th, 1795. 
". . . The 27th inst. is the day big with the Fate. Some of 
the Gentry have supposed it would be most advisable to re-elect 
Schuyler, otherwise both the Senators will continue to be from 
the Southern part of the State. You may suppose they do not 
know what to say, and that they have not determined what to 
do, when they come forward with such stuff. Mark the Expres- 

* Hildreth happily says {Hist, of United States, 2dser., i., p. 538) : " During 
his [Hamilton's] six years of public service he had placed the fiscal concerns of the 
United States on a solid foundation — that, indeed, upon which they have ever 
since rested. The investigations into his conduct, dictated by the suspicions 
of his enemies, had resulted altogether to his advantage. His whole scheme 
being now complete, and his official integrity thoroughly vindicated, he could 
safely leave to the administration of others that system which his genius had 
organized "

sion of the Message, ' alarming aspect of public affairs/ ' daring 
claims,' ' children of the opulent ' — what a delectable Rascal he 
is ! Was there ever such cursed nonsense as what he says about 
our System of Jurisprudence being implicitly borrowed &c. ? " 



J. O. Hoffman to R. King, Phila. 

26th Jany., 1795. 

Our opponents spare no pains to defeat the success of your re- 
appointment. They have at length partly agreed on Mr. Jones ; 
but at a meeting this evening, for the purpose of counteracting 
their measures, he declared his entire disapprobation of the plan. 
They expected something from the change of the Scene ; but as 
yet they have made no impression and, I believe, instead of losing 
we daily gain ground. 

It has been judged prudent to postpone all arrangements rela- 
tive to Mr. Jay, untill after Tuesday. A visit from you might 
after that time, be attended with the most salutary effects. Burr's 
friends now declare that Watts, Gilbert & Van Gaasbeck are in 
his favor. With esteem J. O. Hoffman. 



Rob. Troup to R. King, Phila. 

27th Jany., 1795. 

Dear Sir : 

I sincerely congratulate you upon your re-election — by a ma- 
jority of six — five in one house and one in the other. Tillotson 
was your antagonist. . . . 

Very sincerely, Rob. Troup. 



C. Gore to R. King. 

Boston, Jany. 29th, 1795. 
My Dear Friend : 

On Monday a vessel arrived at Cape Ann from Ramsgate in 
England ... I have seen a letter for Mr. Sears, it is 
from Mr. Dickason, & says the commercial treaty between 
the U. S. and G. B. is signed and printed in the Gazette. Amer- 
ican stocks rose in consequence of this event . . . Now 



RUFUS KING. [1795 



nothing being said of the state of the belligerent powers at that 
time, it is probable their situation was not altered materially since 
our last advices. 

Yours affectionately, 

C. Gore. 



N. Gorham to R. King, Phila. 

Boston, Feby. 5, 1795. 
My Dear Sir : 

I most sincerely congratulate you upon your re-election & 
I can assure you that the true Federalists think it a very happy 
circumstance for the country. I am very much afraid we shall 
not be able to get Mr. Dexter elected again. . . . 

Your friend, Nath. Gorham. 



C. Gore to R. King. 

Boston, Feby. 9, 1795. 
My Dear Friend : 

. . . A letter from the Hague and published this day in the 
Orrery, informs that La Fayette has been again taken and recon- 
ducted to prison. This news we fear is authentic. It is said the 
letter is from Mr. Adams. 

Affectionately yours, 

C. Gore. 



R. King to C. Gore. 

Phila. Feb. 14th, 1795. 

The Treaty has not yet arrived, and we are very impatient to 
receive it before Congress adjourns. Hamilton's last Report 
exceeds my Frank or I would send you a copy, probably however 
you will have received one — the Resolutions that have been 
brought forward in pursuance of it, have been adopted with some 
immaterial variations by the House of Representatives, & there is 
a fair Prospect that the Finances will be arranged conformable to 
his views. 



1795] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 5 

We lose a Great and Virtuous Minister in the retirement of this 
Gentleman ; his successor* is a good man — possesses firmness, 
industry, integrity, and sound Talents with a disposition to emu- 
late his Predecessor's Example. 

I am mortified that Dexter has not succeeded ; should he from 
disgust decline, or should he finally fail it would, believe me, be 
the subject of serious & deep regret to the friends of the Govern- 
ment, for without depreciating the talents of any those of Mr. 
Dexter class him among the men of the very first order of Abilities 
in our Country. 

His re-election is worthy of great Effort, the want of which 
alone, it would seem to me, will defeat his Choice. 

You will have learnt that I have been re-elected ; in one view 
I am gratified ; but without affectation I can say to you, that lam 
wearied with this kind of life, which has nothing new to afford 
me, and which demands of me sacrifices that I become daily 
more and more unwilling to make. 

Pennsylvania & North Carolina have yet to make their Sena- 
torial Elections, the former will probably do well, & there is no 
reason to despair of the latter ; in any event the Senate will stand 
better after March than at present. 

Farewell — Yrs sincerely 

R. King. 



A. Hamilton to R. King. 

Kingston, Feb. 21, 1795. 
My Dear King : 

The unnecessary, capricious & abominable assassination of the 

National honor by the rejection of the propositions respecting the 

unsubscribed debt, in the House of Representatives, haunts me 

every step I take and afflicts me more than I can express. To see 

the character of the Government & the Country so sported with, 

exposed to so indelible a blot, puts my heart to the Torture. Am 

I then more of an American than those who drew their first breath 

on American Ground ? Or what is it that thus torments me at a 

* Oliver Wolcott. 



RUFUS KING. [i795 



circumstance so calmly viewed by almost every body else ? Am 
I a fool — a Romantic Quixot — or is there a constitutional defect 
in the American mind ? Were it not for yourself and a few others, 
I could adopt the reveries of De Paux as substantial truths, & 
would say with him that there is something in our climate which 
belittles every animal, human or brute. 

I conjure you, my friend, make a vigorous stand for the honor 
of your country. Rouse all the energies of your mind, and meas- 
ure swords in the Senate with the great Slayer of public faith, the 
hacknied Veteran in the violation of public engagements. Pre- 
vent him from triumphing a second time over the prostrate 
Credit* and injured interests of his Country. Unmask his false 
and horrid hypothesis. Display the immense difference between 
an able statesman and the Man of Subtilties. Root out the dis- 
tempered and noisome weed, which is attempted to be planted 
in our political garden, to choak and wither in its infancy the fair 
plant of public credit. 

I disclose to you without reserve the state of my mind. It is 
discontented & gloomy in the extreme. I consider the cause 
of good government as having been put to an issue & the Ver- 
dict against it. Introduce I pray you into the Senate, when the 
bill comes up, the clause which has been rejected, freed from em- 
barrassments by the bills of credit bearing interest on the nominal 
value. Press its adoption in this the most unexceptionable shape & 
let the yeas & nays witness the result. Among other reasons for 
this is my wish that the true friends of public Credit may be dis- 
tinguished from its enemies. The question is too great a one not 
to undergo a thorough examination before the community. It 
would pain me not to be able to distinguish. Adieu. 

God bless you 

A. Hamilton. 

Do me the favour to revise carefully the course of the bill, re- 
specting the unsubscribed Debt, & let me know the particulars. I 
wish to be able to judge more particularly of the underplot I 
suspect. 

* Witness the 40 for 1 scheme, a most unskilful measure to say the best 
of it.

A. Hamilton to R. King. 

N. York, Feby. 26, 1795. 
My Dear Sir : 

I have received your letter with the printed Bills. The new 
clause is an additional bad feature. Yet 't is better the thing 
should pass as it is than not at all. Every thing should be gained 
that can be. 

So : It seems that under the present administration of the De- 
partment, Hillhouse & Goodhue are to be the Ministers in the 
House of Representatives and Ellsworth & Strong in the Sen- 
ate. Fine work we shall have. But I swear the nation shall not 
be dishonored with impunity. 

Yrs. Affect' ly, 

A. Hamilton. 



Peter Van Gaasbeck to Rufus King. 

Kingston, 18th March, 1795. 
My Dear Sir : 

The people here wish farther satisfaction as to 
Mr. Jay's Return. Give me all by Billy (Wm. Marius Green) ; as 
I said in my former the great majority of the Committee who 
have nominated Mr. Burr, if he is no candidate, will unquestion- 
ably and very powerfully support Mr. Jay — thus as it is very prob- 
able that Mr. Burr will not stand a Candidate, every elucidation 
respecting Mr. Jay's Return will be of singular advantage. . . . 

Yr. most obedt. Servt. & Sincere Friend, 

Peter Van Gaasbeck. 



O. Wolcott to R. King. 

Phila., March 23rd, 1795. 
My Dear Sir : 

I have rec'd your favour of the 19th instant — on enquiry I find 
Mr. Blaney has left town, I cannot therefore ascertain the truth of 
the declaration attributed to him : the following circumstance 
however proves to my satisfaction, that the declaration it made 
has been misunderstood or perverted to impress a wrong idea. 



8 RUFUS KING. [1795 



On the 19th of Nov. Mr. Jay in a letter requested that he might 
have the earliest advice of the ratification; that he might be enabled 
to finish whatever might be expected of him in season to return in one 
of the first spring vessels. At the same time he suggested that if his 
health had been competent to a winter voyage he should have been him- 
self the bearer of the Treaty. 

The truth doubtless is, that Mr. Jay finding his health unequal 
to the severities of a voyage in winter, concluded to tarry 
until Spring, and of course might reasonably expect the ratifica- 
tion before his departure from England. There is however noth- 
ing in his Letters, and nothing as I believe on good grounds, in 
any Letters which have been written from this Country which 
can countenance an opinion, that Mr. Jay will wait for the ratifi- 
cation — The contrary is firmly believed here. 

I am with perfect respect 

Dear Sir your obed. serv., 

Oliver Wolcott. 



CHAPTER II. 

Jay's Treaty received — The Senate called to consider it — Mr. King's Reso- 
lution to ratify it — Ratification with Protest against Article twelve 
recommended — " Camillus Letters" by Hamilton and King — After much 
Delay the President signed the Treaty — Randolph's Correspondence with 
Fauchet, the French Ambassador — His Resignation of Office of Secretary 
of State — The President suggests Mr. King as his Successor — He declines 
— Letters of Hamilton, King, and Randolph relative to the Treaty — Delay 
of Ratification caused Dissatisfaction — Public Meetings opposed to it ; 
G. Cabot and C. Gore relative to these — R. King's Letter announcing 
Ratification. 

The treaty which had been negotiated by Mr. Jay with 
Great Britain late in 1794 was received by the Secretary of 
State on March 7, 1795, and the Senate was called by the 
President to meet on June 8th, to consider masters touching 
the public good. They accordingly convened on that day, 
and the President laid before them " the Treaty and other 
documents connected with it," asking them " to decide 
whether they will advise and consent that the said Treaty 
be made." 

As a preliminary step the Senate passed a resolution im- 
posing secrecy upon the communication until further order 
of the Senate. An ineffectual effort was made to rescind 
this resolution, and after consideration of the different 
articles a motion was made, it is said by Mr. King, on June 
17th to consent and advise the President to ratify the treaty 
" on condition that there be added to the said Treaty an 
article whereby it shall be agreed to suspend the operation 
of so much of the twelfth article " as relates to trade with the 
West Indies, " and at the same time recommending to the 

9 



10 RUFUS KING. L I 795 

President to proceed, without delay, to further friendly 
negotiations" on the subject of the said trade. 

Mr. Burr, on the 22d, moved to postpone this motion, to 
adopt a series of resolutions he offered to effect certain 
alterations in the treaty in the several particulars they sug- 
gested. His resolution was rejected next day by a vote of 
20 to 10, and on the 24th, after an attempt, for reasons 
given, to pass a resolution to refuse consent, that portion 
of the original proposition, advising the ratification of the 
treaty, was passed by 20 to 10, and the other portion, 
advising a renewal of negotiations, by an unanimous vote. 
Mr. King voted in both cases in the affirmative. It is well 
known that he made an earnest plea for the ratification of 
the treaty, but nothing can be found among his papers to 
indicate even the heads of the speech. His views, however, 
are fully presented in the letters of Camillus written by him. 

On the 26th, the injunction of secrecy was rescinded, with 
a proviso, however, " that it be nevertheless enjoined upon 
the Senators not to authorize or allow any copy of the said 
communications, or of any article thereof. ' 

The President delayed for some time appending his sig- 
nature to the treaty as explained hereafter, and the public 
became very anxious to know the particulars of the docu- 
ment, whose ratification had been recommended. In conse- 
quence of the secrecy, 

" statements as to the contents had begun to appear, accompanied 
by very malignant comments. In order to prevent hasty conclu- 
sions, founded on partial views, and wishing to hear the opinions 
of the people, Washington directed the whole treaty to be pub- 
lished. But in this he had been anticipated. On the same day 
that this direction was given, a full abstract had appeared in the 
Aurora, followed, a few days after, by a perfect copy furnished 
by Mason on the Senate under his own name."* 

In the Life of Alexander Hamilton, vi., p. 223, occurs the 
following passage : 

* Hildreth, Hist, of U. S., 2d ser. , i., 546. 



1795] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. II 

" To remove the prejudice this procedure [the publication of the 
treaty by Mason] excited, it was falsely charged that Rufus King 
had divulged the treaty by furnishing Hamilton with a copy. The 
charge was repelled by the Senator from New York, who stated 
that he had acted strictly within the limits of the injunction in 
having permitted a copy to be read ; but that no copy had been 
given ; a permission which had been freely exercised by other 
members of the Senate." 

Every effort was made by the enemies of the treaty to 
poison the public mind against it. The newspapers were 
filled with articles to show how shamefully the interests of 
the country had been sacrificed to the dictation of Great 
Britain and to the injury of France. Among those who 
opposed it in this way was Brockholts Livingston, who had 
been most conspicuous in the public meeting in New York 
against the treaty. In certain articles signed " Decius " he 
attempted to show how injurious the treaty would be, and 
how disgraceful to the country. Mr. R. R. Livingston, as 
" Cato," wrote in the same strain. These were ably an- 
swered by Hamilton in a series of papers, signed " Camillus," 
papers so able and conclusive, that they were largely instru- 
mental in checking the dissatisfaction which existed, and 
which was aggravated by the delay of the President in sign- 
ing the treaty. The first of these articles was issued on the 
22d of July, " four days after the public meeting where 
Hamilton was assailed with missiles." 

In the Life of Hamilton, vi., p. 273, we find these para- 
graphs : 

" The discussion of the first ten or permanent articles occupied 
twenty-two numbers of these essays. To the remaining or tem- 
porary articles twelve were devoted. The general views enter- 
tained by Hamilton as to the commercial features of this treaty 
have been seen in the letter * addressed by him to the President. 
That letter contains the outline of ' Camillus.' 

" It is perceived from a comparison of it with the first twenty- 
* July 6, Life of Hamilton, vi., 229. 



12 RUFUS KING. [1795 

two numbers, the original drafts of which are in Hamilton's auto- 
graph, that they were exclusively his. Of the remaining essays, ten, 
Nos. 23 to 30, both included, 34 and 35, were from another pen, 
with frequent alterations, interlineations and additions by Hamil- 
ton. The residue of the numbers, being six, are also Hamilton's 
exclusively. It has been stated that his letter to the President con- 
tained the outline of these numbers on the commercial features of 
the treaty, but it should be observed that the views were much ex- 
tended in the ' Camillus ' letters ; that, when the objections to the 
treaty are admitted, the defensive observations as to Jay, which had 
been previously presented by him to the President, are interlined 
in Hamilton's autograph, and that great anxiety is evinced by 
him, lest the positions taken should mean more than he felt was 
warranted by just inductions. As he had urged the mission of 
of Jay, he felt the more anxious to guard him from censure." 

Mr. J. C. Hamilton, in his Works of Alexander Hamilton, 
had stated in a note to the No. xxiii. Camillus letter, that 
" this and the seven succeeding numbers are from the pen 
°f Rufus King, excepting parts within brackets, which are 
in Hamilton's hand. — Ed." He claims here that xxxiv. and 
xxxv. were written by Hamilton, for he makes no note about 
them. It so happens that manuscript copies of these are 
in the present editor's possession. 

In his Life of Hamilton, written some twenty years later in 
vol. vi., p. 273, he says that the above numbered essays and in 
addition " 34 and 35 are from another pen [without mention- 
ing whose. — Ed.] with frequent alterations, interlineations 
and additions by Hamilton." It may be mentioned, that 
all these alterations, etc., amount to about two or three pages 
in one hundred.* 

Though in the Works, Mr. Hamilton mentions the name 
of Rufus King as that of one of the writers of these letters, 

* The length of these letters, which occupy 104 pages of the Works of 
Hamilton, vol. vii., pp. 378-468, and 487-501, has decided the Editor to omit 
them and to refer those who desire to read them and to examine the able and 
clear presentation of the points discussed, to the above named publication. — 
Ed, 



1795] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 1 3 

it is not a little strange that he should have forgotten to state 
in the Life, even in a note, that the " other pen " was Rufus 
King's, the warm, confidential, and trusted friend of his 
father to the end of his life. Though we are indebted to 
Mr. Hamilton for the first positive published evidence that 
Mr. King was the co-laborer in writing them, we find in a 
letter of John Adams to his wife January 31, 1796,* the 
following statement : 

" I have a secret to communicate to your prudence. The 
defence by Camillus was written in concert between Hamilton, 
King and Jay. The writings on the first ten articles of the 
treaty were written by Hamilton ; the rest by King till they come 
to the question of the constitutionality of the treaty, which was 
discussed by Hamilton. Jay was also to have written a concluding 
peroration ; but being always a little lazy and perhaps concluding 
that it might be most politic to keep his name out of it, and perhaps 
finding that the work was already well done, he neglected it. 
This I have from King's own mouth. It is to pass, however, for 
Hamilton's. All three consulted together upon most, if not all 
the pieces." 

In addition to these, the existence of manuscript drafts 
of several of the letters among the papers of Mr. King, and 
the following extract from a letter of Mr. King himself to 
Mr. William Coleman, February, 18 17, are authoritative 
evidences that he contributed some of them : 

" Of the papers under the signature of Camillus, those relative 
to the permanent, or ten first Articles of Mr. Jay's Treaty were 
written by Hamilton, those relative to the commercial and mari- 
time articles were written by me. The critical examination of 
these articles, in relation to navigation & trade, as well as to the 
Laws and Treaties of Nations, has been of great advantage to me 
thro' life. Principles were established and Usages and Regula- 
tions discovered relative to maritime and commercial Law which 
have given to me greater confidence in acting and deciding on 
these intricate matters than I feel on almost any other subject."

14 RUFUS KING. [1795 

A. Hamilton to R. King, New York. 

June 11, 1795. 
Dear Sir : 

I thank you for your letter of the 10th. The case has been 
with me as with you. Reflection has not mitigated the excep- 
tionable point. Yet it will be to be lamented if no mode can be 
devised to save the main object and close the irritable questions 
which are provided for. Every thing besides an absolute and 
simple ratification will put something in jeopardy. But, while on 
the one hand I think it advisable to hazard as little as possible, 
on the other I should be willing to hazard something and unwil- 
ling to see a very objectionable principle put into activity. 

It is to be observed that no time is fixed for the ratification of 
the Treaty. It may then be ratified with a collateral instruction 
to make a declaration that the U. States consider the article in 
question aggregately taken as intended by the King of G. B. as 
a privilege ; that they conceive it for their interest to forbear the 
exercise of that privilege with the condition annexed to it, till an 
explanation in order to a new modification of it shall place it on 
a more acceptable footing, or till an article to be sent to our Minis- 
ter, containing that modification, shall be agreed upon between him 
& the British Court as a part of the Treaty j the ratification not to 
be exchanged without further instruction from this country unless 
accepted in this sense & with this qualification. 

This course appears to me preferable to sending back the 
Treaty, to open the negotiation anew, because it may save time on 
the points most interesting to us, & I do not see that if the 
ratifications be exchanged with this saving there can be any doubt 
of the matter operating as intended. 

Adieu, Yrs. Truly 
A. Hamilton. 

A. Hamilton to R. King. 

My Dear Sir : 

New York, June 20, 1795. 

A considerable alarm has been spread this morning by a report 
that the Treaty has been disagreed to. I have assured those I 
have seen that I was convinced any rumour of a decision must be 



1795] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 1 5 

premature. The anxiety however about the result is extreme. 
The common opinion among men of business of all descriptions 
is that a disagreement to the Treaty would greatly shock and 
stagnate pecuniary plans and operations in general. This is not 
a small source of disquietude ; others who are likely to be affected 
in that sense (and among these myself) look forward to the result 
with great solicitude as fixing or endangering the stability of our 
present beneficial and desirable situation. 

My influence in seconding the wishes of our friend General 
Gunn is, I fear, overated. Unwilling to raise expectations, which 
may not be realized, I will only say, that it will give me real 
pleasure to be able to promote his accommodation or advantage ; 
as my opinion entirely coincides with yours. In the mean time, I 
will, as far as circumstances will permit, have an eye to the affair. 

Yrs. affectionately 

A. Hamilton. 



Edm. Randolph to R. King. 

Philadelphia, July 6, 1795. 
Dear Sir : 

My indisposition has prevented an earlier answer to your 
favour of the 1st instant. 

Before the co-agency of Mr. Bache and a Senator had violated 
the injunctions of secrecy, I was impressed with your ideas, and 
caused Brown to publish a memorandum, that on Wednesday the 
treaty would appear. This day was named, because I could not 
sooner recover the only copy in my powers which I had put 
into the hands of Mr. Adet, upon his expressing some vague 
inquietudes. 

I have since received his objections, feeble in themselves, and 
more feebly urged. They are these three simple things. 1. that 
we have granted to G. B., the liberty of seizing contraband be- 
yond what was agreed between us and France. 2. that we have 
annulled the 17th Article of the French treaty ; and 3 that we 
have incapacitated ourselves from forming a new commercial 
treaty with France by the last clause of the 25 th article in that 
with England. An answer is prepared, which is satisfactory to 
the President. 



1 6 RUFUS KING. [1795 

The 8th article will be attended to the moment after the Presi- 
dent shall give his final instruction on the treaty. With great 

respect 

Yr. mo. Ob Servt. 

Edm. Randolph. 



R. King to C. Gore. 

N. York, 24 July, 1795. 

I thank you for your letter and am pleased to learn that a coun- 
ter-current is appearing on the subject of the treaty. From the 
Resentment and past defeats of our Jacobins, it was natural to 
expect a very considerable effort on this occasion. They had 
concerted their plans, & by manifesting a noisy opposition in the 
large Towns at the same Time, they expected to surprize and 
gain the public opinion. Industry and arts will continue to be 
employed for this purpose, and you are right in saying that the 
moment demands all the Patience and Firmness of virtuous men 
to bear up against the torrent. 

You will have seen the progress and result at the meeting in this 
City. The invitation was to condemn, the Friends of order were 
requested to attend for the purpose of discussion, but the noise 
and confusion which prevailed, precluded all Examination and 
the first meeting separated without any regular Decision on any 
subject. The meeting that succeeded on Monday was ex parte, 
the friends of a fair Discussion having declined to attend, and 
the Resolutions which they adopted it is said were similar to those 
of Boston. The merchants who are here an incorporated Cham- 
ber, summoned a meeting for Tuesday evening. The chamber 
was unusually full, the Treaty was the subject, which, after Dis- 
cusion, they approved in Resolutions which they passed by a 
majority of 6 to 1. 

It is much to be regretted that Boston gave the example of a 
Town meeting on this subject — had they remained silent, or had 
the schemes of Jarvis & others, on this occasion, as heretofore, 
been disappointed, we should have had no meeting here, and the 
country would have escaped that Fever into which it is likely to 



1795] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. I? 

be thrown. You must exert yourselves in procuring a right con- 
ception of the Treaty — if understood, it will not be disapproved. 
Will not your merchants take any step to counteract the Opinion 
that Boston has been unanimous in their Condemnation — be per- 
suaded that tho' the thing is well understood with you, yet a 
counter-act, proceeding from your merchants would have a very 
considerable effect in this and other quarters of the Union. 

Farewell yrs. sincerely, 

R. King. 



G. Cabot to R. King. 
Dear Sir : Brookline, 25 July, 1795. 

Going into town yesterday for the first time since my return, I 
met your letter of the 13th * & was greatly rejoiced to find that 
the insanity which is epidemic in this quarter is less prevalent with 
you. It would be consolatory to believe that among the crew of 
our political ship, the sound would always be sufficient to take 
care of the sick. But I have not this desirable faith. 

The readiness and severity with which the Treaty has been con- 
demned is a new proof that our government cannot rely for sup- 
port even upon good men in cases of emergency : for these very 
generally acquiesced in the censure without any examination of 
the subject. It is true that they are now mortified at their in- 
discretion, & many of them will have the magnanimity to retread 
their steps ; but pride will probably prevent others from acknowl- 
edging they were wrong. 

A number of gentlemen visited me soon after I arrived here 
and were easily satisfied that the ideas circulated respecting the 
Treaty were very incorrect. But they all united with me in senti- 
ment that explanations wou'd be fruitless during the ferment 
which was extreme and universal — what was then foreseen has 
been since realized — men's minds had gone too far & when in- 
clined to come back a little effort has been successful in greatly 
accelerating the reverberation. 

With a view to ascertain the state of public opinion & to con- 

* It is to be regretted that this letter to Mr. Cabot cannot be recovered.

1 8 RUFUS KING. [1795 

tribute my mite towards forming it rightly in other parts of the 
State, I attended the commencement at Cambridge & was gratified 
to perceive that sensible and virtuous men from other quarters 
resented the proceedings of Boston, so that, if I were to judge 
from the evidence of that day, I shou'd pronounce that the sober 
sense of Massachusetts approves the Treaty. 

Since that time a piece entitled " Candid Remarks on the 
Treaty " has been republished here from some of your papers, 
the effects of which are highly beneficial. Such a summary de- 
fence was well adapted to the moment, but I hope a more elabo- 
rate one will be produced at New York & handed along very soon. 

Our mercantile men have learnt something more of our rights 
and the rights of the other nations than they knew formerly, but 
they have yet to learn that the commerce of the U. S. is not 
such as wou'd enable us to dictate the terms on which an inter- 
course is to be held with the nations of Europe. 

Upon examining the East India Article, I don't see that our 

vessels are prohibited the Coasting Trade & I shou'd imagine 

they will enjoy it as usual until an explicit prohibition shall be 

declared by the British. The more I have examined the article 

the better it has appeared, & most men with whom I converse 

seem to agree that it is good. I have much more to say, but my 

Potatoes need hoeing & must not be neglected. . . . 

Your faithful friend 

G. Cabot. 



G. Cabot to R. King, N. York. 

Dear Sir : Brookline, July 27th, 1795. 

Your favor of the 20th did not come to hand until this moment. 
It was not wholly unexpected that our mob shou'd inflame yours. 
All Society is full of combustible materials & a flame once lighted 
easily produces a general conflagration. It cannot be sufficiently 
regretted that some of our respectable men have on this occasion 
joined the Jacobins & very many of them acquiesced in their 
measures. They now see the pernicious tendency of their pro- 
ceedings & a good portion of them already condemn them. 

I believe it adds much to their mortification to reflect that they 



1795] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 1 9 

listened to the representations and observations of a man whose 
want of sense has been thought at Boston a security against his 
influence. After all no sufficient apology is offer'd for the con- 
duct of men who have habitually supported order and now have 
arranged themselves with its enemies. Some of them indeed say 
that they were deceived by the accounts brought by Mr. Langdon, 
others by the mutilated abstract published which totally removed 
alienage, and many confess that they condemned the Treaty with- 
out knowing its merits. 

You will perhaps hold me responsible for these excesses, but I 
decline being surety against the folly and nonsense of any men. 
If I had thought as ill of the citizens of Boston as their conduct 
respecting the Treaty wou'd now justify, or if I had realised that 
Mr. L. wou'd furnish sparks to inflame them, it is possible that a 
few hours conversation with some of them on the evening of my 
arrival might have retarded the rapidity of the current, tho' I 
don't think it cou'd have changed its course. 

In justice to Dr. Eustis I ought to mention, as from his friend, 
that one of his motives for sharing in the agency was that of pre- 
venting greater mischief. This is laudable and sometimes ex- 
pedient, but the services of our friends, when accompanied by 
improper concessions to our enemies are too costly to be profit- 
able. You will see a sharp speech of Dexter's, which does him 
credit for its spirit & good sense, but it is introduced by ad- 
mitting that the Treaty is " not so good as he hoped." I shall 
desire him to point out some of those good things, which he had 
a right to hope for, presuming that his hopes & even desires are 
regulated by reason. 

I wish you wou'd inform me by return of post whether these 
popular tumults have produced any embarrassment to the 
President, & whether the Treaty with its accompaniments is 
gone. 

Our good men here all presume that the President is too firm 
to be shaken, and therefore have the more willingly indulged 
themselves in supineness. I think, however, they wou'd rally and 
make a respectable effort if it were believed to be indispensable. 
In Salem & the other Seaports they are pretty steady, & in the 
country as yet I have not heard of the Treaty's being anywhere 



20 RUFUS KING. [1795 

unpopular, & every day furnishes new evidence that the old 
friends of order are re-uniting even at Boston. 

It was observed here that your Jacobins were prudent to en- 
deavour to knock out Hamilton's brains to reduce him to an 
equality with themselves ; but I trembled at the first account 
which was related of that adventure & offer'd up an unfeigned 
prayer for his safety. I mean the silent prayer of an affectionate 

heart. . . .* 

Your faithful friend, 

G. Cabot. 



G. Cabot to R. King, N. Y. 

My Dear Sir : Brookline, Aug. 4, 1705. 

The uncertainty you mention respecting the ratification of the 
Treaty by the President, renews my anxiety for the welfare of our 
Country. Altho' I have entertained some fears that the business 
was delayed, yet as no objections from the President had ever 
come to my knowledge, my hopes greatly preponderated. I shall 
seize this moment, while the proceeding of the President is un- 
known, to suggest to the Boston merchants the propriety of a 
manly declaration of their sentiments, but altho' I have reason to 
believe that the Treaty is now generally approved by them, yet so 
many of them had indiscreetly censured it, that it is doubtful how 
far they will incline formally to express their present opinions. 

* The allusions in these letters are to the public meetings held at first in 
Boston to denounce the treaty and to endeavor to influence the President to 
refuse his consent to the ratification, which the Senate had advised. The para- 
graph in Mr. Cabot's letter refers to a meeting called in New York by the 
enemies of the treaty to express their utter abhorrence of it. But its friends 
decided to attend the meeting that they might show that in the city other views, 
more representative of its sentiments, were held. At this meeting, Hamilton 
advised an adjournment, rather than that a hasty decision should be made, and 
the meeting became so disorderly that the friends of the treaty withdrew, but 
not before Hamilton had been struck in the head, but without serious injury, 
by a stone thrown from the excited crowd. In Philadelphia, Charleston, 
and other places also, meetings were held in which violent denunciations of 
the treaty were made to influence the action of the President. But all 
were ineffectual, for on August 14th the President after careful consideration 
signed it. 



1795] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE, 21 

Pride is a powerful enemy in this case & combined with the 
natural reluctance which men feel at combating popular prejudices, 
may not be easily overcome ; but be this as it may, you may be 
fully assured that the most respectable part of our community 
have become the advocates of the Treaty & are extending the 
opinion of its propriety every moment. I am told that the only 
article which is now unsatisfactory 'to any of the Federalists 
here is the 10th ; which shows, I think, that they are hard pressed 
by their friends. Indeed it will not surprise me to find the Sen- 
ate blamed for not accepting the entire instrument by some men 
who have lately censured every part. Such is the versatility of 
opinion. Although we have neither a Curtius nor a Camillus, yet 
the explanation given by Gore in the newspaper & those circulated 
by others in private conversations have so well aided the investiga- 
tion of individuals, that the subject is pretty well understood and 
its friends increased in a corresponding degree. I am however 
very glad to see the systematic & able defence setting up in your 
city & shall take measures to extend its operation in this quarter. 

I have too much respect for the character of the President to 
believe that he can be deterr'd from his duty by the clamor or 
menaces of these city-mobs, but still I agree with you, that their 
doings shou'd be counteracted by the good people, lest it shou'd 
be imagined that all are alike infected with the rage of disorgani- 
zation. 

Your sincere friend, 

G. Cabot. 



C. Gore to R. King. 

Boston, 7 August, 1795. 
My Dear Sir : 

A letter from Mr. Cabot to Mr. Higginson the day before yes- 
terday informs that it is uncertain, whether the treaty is yet rati- 
fied. A few days past, I felt satisfied that things were coming 
right, that reason and reflection were assuming the lead and that 
we should very soon have a just idea of the treaty, and return to 
our old good humor with the government and with each other. 
The signers to the protest amount to more than 200, and include 



22 RUFUS KING. [*795 

almost every man of property and reputation ; and a great many 
who had expressed themselves with warmth on the subject of the 
treaty — some of the most bitter opponents, — had given up clamor- 
ing, avoided all conversation on the business and very publickly 
declared that if signed by the President, which they considered 
the fact, it ought to be submitted to, like other laws, and wou'd 
meet their cordial support. But shou'd it be generally known 
that the instrument is not yet ratified, that, with the furious heat 
of Charlestown, wou'd bring back all our fire. It would be felt 
that the President was taking part with a mob against his own 
government. Our opponents wou'd naturally reason, that if a 
little tumult produced such a delay, a more violent opposition 
wou'd be completely successful. 

A chamber of commerce is called to meet this evening. It is 
expected the meeting will be large ; and the resolutions to be sub- 
mitted approve in positive terms of the treaty. There is great 
reason to hope they will be adopted with unanimity. Pains are 
taking to induce Salem and Newburyport to express favorable 
sentiments of the treaty. Mr. Cabot is at the latter place, and 
will undoubtedly take every step to promote such measures. But 
after all, my friend, every thing depends on an idea that the 
President has ratified it, and no measures ought to be left un- 
essayed to have the ratification compleat and dispatch'd to 
Europe immediately. That done, and publickly known to have 
been done, would place us again in quiet. 

Yours affectionately, 

C. Gore. 



C. Gore to R. King. 

Waltham, 14th August, 1795. 
My Dear Sir : 

The paragraph in Webster's paper relative to the state of the 
treaty has given me inexplicable pain. Whether strictly right 
according to the rules of proceeding in such cases I cannot say ; 
but taking it on ground the least objectionable, there is an expence 
of time in making the negotiation prior to the President's signa- 
ture, that may in itself be injurious. Tho' this is but of small 
consequence compared to the evils that result from the continued 



1795] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 23 

and increased ferment which this delay produces. The evils are 
incalculable, unless we can calculate all the evils of a compleat 
prostration of government, and of the unlimited and unrivalled 
power of the most malignant and licentious faction. The friends 
of government are disheartened and discouraged. They feel the 
humiliation of continual warfare for an administration which sup- 
ports its opponents and disgraces its friends. This is the obser- 
vation of the most respectable and steady advocates of order in 
Boston. 

The many sober, but unreflecting, men who first joined with the 
opponents were endeavoring to return to their old friends : they 
had been ensnared ; they saw it, but many had not magnanimity 
enough to declare their conviction, without some good apology. 
They said if the President had ratified the treaty, there was an 
end of all opposition ; and you may be assured, that their zealous 
support of it as a law of the land, would in some degree have 
compensated for their former error. They now think, as the 
President has delay'd to ratify it (for whatever may be the motive 
of the Executive, it will be attributed either to dislike of the in- 
strument, or the influence of the opponents), that their first start 
was right, that they were lucky in their opposition, and will now 
steadily adhere to their friends. Of all the critical situations in 
which the government has been placed, this is the most extreme. 
Prejudice against the English, love for the French, a false idea of 
our own strength and of that of Britain ; the character of the op- 
ponents in Charlestown, especially if Rutledge is appointed Chief 
Justice, together with the conclusions that will be drawn from the 
President's conduct, will require more strength and influence to op- 
pose, than can be expected from the few firm friends to order which 
may be found in Massachusetts. I know of but one step that can 
arrest this mania, that affords any hope of supporting the govern- 
ment. An address from the President to the people of the United 
States, stating that he had ratified the treaty, or done what 
amounted to a ratification, provided G. B. acceded to the suspen- 
sion as recommended by the Senate. This would allay the heat, 
unite the moderate men and those who are generally neuters till 
questions are decided, and it would afford support to those who 
fight the battles of the government, in the distant parts of the 



24 RUFUS KING. [i795 

continent. It appears to me that this alone will save us from the 
most distressing convulsions. The events of Europe may hum- 
ble the French influence here ; but at the same time, they would 
raise the pride of Britain, and if our Executive shews itself oper- 
ated on by them, it is not unnatural she should then say, you have 
made your choice, and are welcome to abide by it — we will remain 
as we are. 

Yours affectionately, 

C. Gore. 

Is it not possible for Col. Hamilton and yourself to induce the 
President to adopt some measure that would decidedly express 
his sentiments in favor of the treaty ? Be assured that in New 
England the word of the President would save the Govt. ; without 
it you may despair. 

G. Cabot to R. King. 

Brookline, Aug. 14, 1795. 
Dear Sir : 

Since my last I have been at Newburyport, where the mer- 
chants are perfectly well united and have by this time probably 
made a formal declaration of their opinion. I understand that the 
only point on which they differ'd was the expediency of giv- 
ing to the negotiator personal praise, & this was omitted entirely 
on the ground of avoiding present irritation. 

The Boston Chamber of Commerce have held a meeting ; the 
number attending was as usual about 40 ; they were of the most 
respectable class, & with only a single dissentient approbated the 
Treaty & reprobated the attempts everywhere made to excite dis- 
content and tumult among the People. Their proceedings, as 
well as those of Newburyport, are to be transmitted to the Presi- 
dent. At Boston the members of the Chamber of Commerce who 
did not attend are to be invited to concur in writing & it is ex- 
pected that J, including \% of the real respectability will concur. 

At Salem Mr. Derby, Gray & some others having consulted, de- 
clare it to be their opinion that \ of their town wou'd vote to leave 
the business where the Constitution has placed it ; but they think 
it not best to make any movement, — because, they say, as no op- 



1795] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 2$ 

position has been made among them they ought to be considered 
as unanimously favorable. 

After all where is the boasted advantage of a representative 
system over the turbulent mobocracy of Athens, if the resort to 
popular meetings is necessary ? Faction, & especially the Faction 
of great towns always the most powerful, will be too strong for 
our mild & feeble government. 

The newspapers will inform you of the arrival of a vessel from 
Rochelle yesterday, the Captn. of which informs that he fell in 
with the British Fleet of 14 sail of the Line, which had combated 
14 French & captured three : the action was off Bellisle & the 
English Capt. told our informant that the whole French fleet 
wou'd have been taken if night had not cover'd them. 

Yours truly, 

G. Cabot. 

Mr. Burr arrived in Boston the day before yesterday & visited 
me in the afternoon. I have return'd his visit but did not find 
him at home. He told me he had scarcely thought 10 minutes on 
political subjects since the Senate rose. 

The letters which have been presented show the great 
anxiety and even alarm consequent upon the delay of 
action by the President, and the open expression of discon- 
tent and disapproval of the treaty itself by those who were 
the partisans of France and opponents of the general 
course of the administration. The President had gone to 
Mount Vernon, and gave no intimation of his intention 
respecting the ratification of the treaty, as advised by the 
Senate. Even his trusted friends had no inkling of the 
course he would adopt. Moved by the alarming demonstra- 
tion, Washington decided to return to Philadelphia, but 
delaying a few days, his departure from home was hastened 
by a summons from some of the members of the Cabinet 
in consequence of a most unexpected occurrence, the receipt 
of a despatch No. 10, October, 1794, from M. Fauchet, the 
French Minister to his government, which was found in a 



26 RUFUS KING, [*795 

vessel captured by a British cruiser, and communicated, 
through Mr. Hammond, the British Minister, to whom it 
had been transmitted by his government, to Mr. Wolcott. 

This despatch had been preceded by another of an earlier 
date, which was written to explain the disturbances in 
Western Pennsylvania, and gave an account of an extra- 
ordinary interview with Mr. Randolph, who considered that 
11 a civil war was about to ravage our unhappy country," 
which could only be averted by certain men, who were 
without means to accomplish their plans, and for whom he 
asked the Minister to " lend them instantaneous funds to 
shelter them from English persecution." The second de- 
spatch, giving an account of American politics, in making 
which Mr. Randolph certainly assisted, attributes to Hamil- 
ton the enforcement of the excise tax, " to mislead the 
President into unpopular courses and to introduce absolute 
power under pretext of giving energy to the govern- 
ment." It is not necessary to enter more fully upon all 
that was said in this remarkable despatch, further than 
to state that it expressly charged Mr. Randolph with 
complicity in the statement, and saying, among other 
things : " Thus, with some thousands of dollars, the re- 
public could have decided on civil war or peace ! Thus the 
consciences of the pretended patriots of America already 
have their price ! " 

Upon Washington's arrival in Philadelphia, the despatch 
was shown to him, and a Cabinet meeting was held, at which 
the members, except Randolph, decided upon immediate 
ratification. This Washington assented to, and on August 
14th the treaty was signed by him. The preparation of 
certain other papers was completed by Randolph, and the 
copies of the treaty were countersigned by him, when 
Washington " presented to him, in presence of the other 
Cabinet officers, the original intercepted despatch, with a 
request to read it, and to make such explanations as he might 
think fit." 



1795] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 2 J 

Randolph, after reading it, endeavored to answer the 
allegations, denying many and claiming that he had been 
misunderstood and that his statements had been misinter- 
preted by M. Fauchet, but seeing that his explanations 
were not satisfactory, immediately offered his resignation. 
This was repeated in writing the same day, with the re- 
quest that the publication of the despatch might be with- 
held until he could prepare fuller explanations. These 
were published shortly afterwards, but did not relieve his 
name from the stigma which was attached to it. This 
delay of publication of the reasons for his resignation gave 
rise to the speculations as to its cause in some of the 
letters. 

Washington was much embarrassed in finding a successor 
to Mr. Randolph, which fact he communicates to General 
Hamilton in a letter of October 29th,* telling him in con- 
fidence that he had offered the office to several, whom he 
named, and who had refused. He continues: 

"Would Mr. King accept it ? You know the objection I have had 
to the nomination, to office, of any person from either branch of 
the Legislature, and you will be at no loss to perceive, that at the 
present crisis, another reason might be adduced against this ap- 
pointment. But maugre all objections, if Mr. King would accept, 
I would look no further. Can you sound, and let me know soon, 
his sentiments on this occasion ? If he should feel disposed to 
listen to the proposition, tell him candidly, all that I have done in 
this matter ; that neither he nor I may be made uneasy thereafter 
from the discovery of it. He will, I am confident, perceive the 
ground upon which I have acted, in making these essays ; and 
will, I am persuaded, appreciate my motive. If he should decline 
also, pray learn with precision from him, what the qualifications 
of Mr. Potts, the Senator, are, and be as diffusive as you can with 
respect to others, and I will decide on nothing until I hear from 
you — pressing as the case is."

28 RUFUS KING. [1795 

A. Hamilton to G. Washington, New York. 

" Nov. 5, 1795. 
"Sir: 

" I received on the second instant your two letters of the 29th of 
October, with the inclosures. An answer has been delayed, to 
ascertain the disposition of Mr. King, who, through the summer, 
has resided in the country, and is only occasionally in town. I 
am now able to inform you — he would not accept. Circumstances 
of the moment conspire with the disgust which a virtuous and in- 
dependent mind feels at placing itself en but to the foul and 
venemous shafts of calumny, which are continually shot by an 
odious confederacy against virtue, to give Mr. King a decided 
disinclination to office. 

" I wish, sir, I could present to you any useful ideas as a substi- 
tute. But the embarrassment is extreme as to the Secretary 
of State. . . . 

" I have conferred with Mr. King with respect to Mr. Potts ; we 
both think well of his principles and consider him as a man of 
good sense. But he is of a cast of character ill suited to such 
an appointment, and is not extensive either as to habits or infor- 
mation. It is also a serious question, whether the Senate at this 
time ought to be weakened. . . ." 

After suggesting several names, and commenting on 
them, he says : 

" In fact a first-rate character is not attainable. A second-rate 
must be taken with good dispositions and barely decent qualifi- 
cations. I wish I could throw more light. 'Tis a sad omen for 
the government. . . . 

Mr. Pickering* in a letter to Hamilton, November 17th, 
a letter marked perfectly confidential, after speaking of the 
President's having offered the office of Secretary of State to 
several persons, among them Mr. King, says : 

* Hamilton 's Works, vol. vi., p. 67. 



1795] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 29 

" The President . . . made me the tender. I declined it, 
as not possessing the talent so much to be desired in a Secretary 
of State, in the propriety and ability of whose conduct the dignity 
as well as the interests of the nation were so materially involved. 
On various grounds the President urged my acceptance. . . . 
I promised to consider of it ... I made " (he says after 
consultation with others) " the President the following declara- 
tion. That I wished no longer to keep him in suspense, and 
that I would accept the office of Secretary of State. ... I 
would continue my attention to both Departments (War & State), 
if that of War could be filled to his satisfaction, I would go to 
the Department of State ; if a character well adapted to the latter 
should present, I would remain where I was. In one word, to 
free him from all embarrassment, I would serve in one office or 
the other, as the public good should require. The President 
answered ' That is very liberal.' " 



E. Randolph to R. King, New York. 

Philadelphia, Aug. 16, 1795. 
Dear Sir : 

As my opinions upon the treaty itself are known to you to be in 
favor of a ratification, so I think it necessary to request you to 
read a letter,* which I have this day written to Mr. Jay and which 
he will show you. My object in giving you this trouble is to pre- 
vent a possible supposition that I have receded from the ground, 
which I still hold tenable in spite of the objections which I have 
seen and heard. 

With great respect & esteem, &c, 

Edm. Randolph. 

* This letter does not appear among those published in Mr. Jay's Life or 
Correspondence, but there is an answer to it of August 20th, thanking Mr. 
Randolph " for the interesting information detailed in it," and making no other

J. Gunn to R. King, New York. 

My Dear Friend : Philadelphia, Aug. 22, 1795. 

Secretary Randolph has, or will in a few days, 
resign his office. I confess my regret is not in the Extreme. This 
man has treated the President Infamously. He occasioned delay 
and then gave assurances that the Treaty was not signed '; which 
invited opposition from every quarter. 

Yours sincerely, 

James Gunn. 

R. King to C. Gore. 

Augt. 25th, 1795. 

My last will have informed you that the president had executed 
what depended on him pursuant to the advice of the Senate, to 
conclude the Treaty with England. The knowledge of this Fact 
has had a happy effect in composing the public mind. 

Mr. Randolph a few days since resigned his office as Secy of 
State, he is now here on his way to Rd. Island. He does not ex- 
plain himself in relation to this sudden measure ; It will probably 
be suggested, that he has gone out of office from a Dislike of the 
English Treaty — this will be wholly incorrect. Mr. Randolph ap- 
proved of the Treaty in toto ; and he yesterday told me, he saw 
no reason to change, or alter, his opinion on that subject. 

We have this morning been afflicted with the information from 
Phil, of the sudden Death on Sunday evening of the Attorney 
General Mr. Bradford — this is a serious loss to the Government. 

It may be satisfactory to the Vice President to be confirmed in 

the information, that the completion of the Business relative 

to the treaty with England, is confided to his son, our Resident 

at the Hague. 

Very affectionately, 

R. King. 



C. Gore to R. King. 

My Dear Sir : Boston, Sept. 13, 1795. 

The resignation of Mr. Randolph has occasioned many conjec- 
tures, none however favorable to him. Our curiosity is on tiptoe 



1795] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 3 1 

to know the cause ; tho' we are perfectly satisfied that the gov- 
ernment is relieved of the minister. We have expected every 
post to hear yourself announced as his successor ; and it is gen- 
erally agreed that such is the critical situation of our affairs, that 
you wou'd sacrifice your ease for your country's service. If we 
are not sound and able in the executive, our chance of an orderly 
government, that can protect the liberties of the citizens, will be 
desperate. The smallest deviation from a firm and steady con- 
duct in that department, or an inability to support its measures 
by strong and conclusive reasoning, will give strength to our dis- 
organizes, and confirm and encrease the hold they now have on 
the prejudices and passions of the people. So far as I can learn 
the temper of the country on the treaty, it is right ; and so it cer- 
tainly is in all our seaports, Boston excepted ; where the mob, 
doubtless instigated by the same men, who occasion'd the town 
meeting is continually attempting to burn the treaty, Mr. Jay's 
effigy, and to do other acts of violence. But I hope and trust that 
such conduct, as it seems to expose the views and wickedness of 
the faction, will confirm and consolidate the friends of order and 
government. It must convince the most timid that strength and 
energy is necessary to secure to them peace, liberty and property, 
and we find many who were among the deluded opposers to the 
ratification of the treaty, in the foremost ranks to oppose these 
sons of sedition. 

The governor (Samuel Adams) is assailed in all quarters to 
adopt efficient measures ; but he has evaded and will evade all 
requests of this nature, so long as he thinks the mob aim only its 
vengeance against national men and national measures. Indeed 
this weak old man is one of the loudest bawlers against the treaty, 
and the boldest in proposing schemes of opposition to the federal 
government. It is said a plan, that has been attempted, of es- 
tablishing committees of correspondence in the several towns of 
Massachusetts to gain a uniformity in the proceedings of opposi- 
tion was suggested by him, and the fitness and expediency of the 
plan supported by the good it did in our contest with Great 
Britain. Thus we see the inveteracy and extent of opposition 
proposed by our antis. But if all remains right and sound at the 
head, there is little danger of contaminating the mass of Massa- 
chusetts at present. Tho' the most fearful apprehensions are to 



32 RUFUS KING. [1795 

be entertained in case of any adversity, or an obligation on the 
part of government to do anything really bearing hard on the 
pleasures or quiet of the citizens. . . . 

Yours sincerely, 

C. Gore. 



Fisher Ames to R. King. 

Dedham, Nov. 5, 1795. 

Dear Sir : 

. . . I despair of attending Congress at the opening of the 
session [on account of his health — Ed.], & the time when I may 
is both remote and uncertain. Great reflection and care ought 
to precede as well as conduct the beginning of business in the 
house. If the Democrats would agree to be silent on the Treaty 
in the answer to the President's speech, would it be eligible, cer- 
tainly not the most eligible. I hope you and others will think 
beforehand what course ought to be taken. 

With sincere regard &c. 

Fisher Ames. 



C. Gore to R. King, N. Y. 

Boston, 19th Nov., 1795. 
My Dear Sir : 

. . . The politics of our country are really good, unless I 
am much deceiv'd. Every information from the interior has con- 
vinced me, that no evil is to be apprehended from the violent 
proceedings of the Seaports. The outrages of this town have 
produced a belief among the husbandmen, that very different 
motives than a regard for the public good have occasion'd the 
opposition to the Treaty. 

If Great Britain shall ratify this instrument on her part, and 
commissioners are appointed to determine the claims of Ameri- 
cans, I shou'd be pleased to be one of them. . . . 

My dear friend, very truly yours, 

C. Gore. 



CHAPTER III. 

Fourth Congress — President's Speech — Mr. King reports the Senate's Answer 
— Debate on its Terms — Mr. Jay's Resignation of Chief-Justiceship — Mr. 
Rutledge's Appointment and Rejection by the Senate — Mr. Ellsworth's 
Appointment. 

The Fourth Congress assembled on the 7th December, 
1795, and the President met the two Houses in the chamber 
of the House of Representatives, and read his speech, which, 
in the Senate, was referred to a committee of Messrs. King, 
Ellsworth, and Cabot. The speech was a very interesting 
summary of the domestic and foreign affairs of the country, 
of which he said that they had never at any period, more 
than at the present, afforded " so just cause for mutual con- 
gratulation," and " for profound gratitude to the Author of 
all Good for the numerous and extraordinary blessings we 
enjoy." Among the interesting details he presented was the 
official announcement to the House of Representatives of his 
ratification of the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Naviga- 
tion with Great Britain, with the advice and consent of the 
Senate, with a condition relative to part of one article ; that 
the result, on the part of his Britannic Majesty was un- 
known ; but when received, would without delay be laid 
before Congress. 

On the 10th, Mr. King reported the draft of an address 
in answer to the President's speech, which was probably 
written by him, and is here presented as expressive of 
his views on the matters to which attention had been 
directed. 

VOL. II. — 3 33 



34 RUFUS KING. [1795 

" Sir : 

" It is with peculiar satisfaction that we are informed by your 
Speech to the two Houses of Congress, that the long and expen- 
sive war in which we have been engaged with the Indians North- 
west of the Ohio is in a situation to be finally terminated ; and 
though we view with concern the danger of an interruption of the 
peace so recently confirmed with the Creeks, we indulge the hope 
that the measures you have adopted to prevent the same, if fol- 
lowed by those legislative provisions that justice and humanity 
equally demand, will succeed in laying the foundation of a last- 
ing peace with the Indian tribes on the Southern as well as on the 
Western frontiers. 

" The confirmation of our Treaty with Morocco, and the adjust- 
ment of a Treaty of Peace with Algiers, in consequence of which 
our captive fellow citizens shall be delivered from slavery, are 
events that will prove no less interesting to the public humanity, 
than they will be important in extending and securing the navi- 
gation and commerce of our country. 

" As a just and equitable conclusion of our depending negotia- 
tions with Spain, will essentially advance the interests of both 
nations, and thereby cherish and confirm the good understanding 
and friendship which we have at all times desired to maintain, 
it will afford us real pleasure to receive an early confirmation of 
our expectations on this subject. 

" The interesting prospect of our affairs, with regard to the 
foreign Powers between whom and the United States contro- 
versies have subsisted, is not more satisfactory than the review of 
our internal situation ; if from the former we derive an expecta- 
tion of the extinguishment of all the causes of external discord, 
that have heretofore endangered our tranquillity, and on terms 
consistent with our national honor and safety, in the latter we 
discover those numerous and widespread tokens of prosperity, 
which, in so peculiar a manner, distinguish our happy country. 

" Circumstances thus every way auspicious demand our grati- 
tude, and sincere acknowledgments to Almighty God, and require 
that we should unite our efforts in imitation of your enlightened, 
firm and persevering example to establish and preserve the peace, 
freedom and prosperity of our country. 

The objects which you have recommended to the notice of 



<< 



1795] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 35 

the Legislature, will, in the course of the session, receive our 
careful attention, and with a true zeal for the public welfare, we 
shall cheerfully co-operate in every measure that shall appear to 
us best calculated to promote the same." 

By a resolution adopted the day before, the gallery of the 
Senate chamber was permitted to be opened, and in conse- 
quence we have, in the Debates of Congress, the heads of a 
discussion relative to the fourth and fifth paragraphs, which 
Mr. Mason moved to strike out, as he considered these two 
clauses would precipitate decisions in the Senate, that " the 
minority could not be expected to recede from the opin- 
ions " they held in the June session, and " could not there- 
fore join in the indirect self-approbation which the majority 
appeared to wish for, and which was most certainly involved 
in the two clauses which he should hope would be struck 
out." If his motion was agreed to, the remainder of the 
address would, in his opinion, stand unexceptionable. He 
did not see, for his part, that our situation was every way 
auspicious. Notwithstanding the treaty, our trade is griev- 
ously molested. 

Mr. King remarked, that the principal features observable 
in the answer to the President's address were to keep up 
that harmony of intercourse which ought to subsist between 
the Legislature and the President, and to express confidence 
in the undiminished firmness and love of country which 
always characterize our chief executive magistrate. He 
objected to striking out especially the first clause, because 
founded on undeniable truth. It only declares that our 
prospects, as to our external relations, are not more satis- 
factory than a review of our internal situation would prove. 
Was not this representation true, he asked ; could it be 
controverted ? This clause, he contended, contained noth- 
ing reasonably objectionable ; it did not say as much as the 
second, to which only most of the objections of the member 
up before him applied, an answer to which he should defer, 
expecting that a question would be put on each in order. 



36 RUFUS KING. [i795 

The clause, he said, appeared to him drawn up in such 
terms as could not offend the nicest feelings of the mi- 
nority on the important decision in June ; it was particu- 
larly circumspect and cautious. If liable to objection, it was 
in not going as far as the truth would warrant. 

After some further debate, in which Messrs. Mason, But- 
ler, and Tazewell urged the striking out of the two clauses, 
and Messrs. Ellsworth and Read, of South Carolina, sus- 
tained the report, it was adopted by a vote of 14 to 8. 



A. Hamilton to R. King.* 

Dec. 14, 1795. 
My Dear Sir : 

An extraordinary press of occupation has delayed an answer to 
your letter on the subject of Mr. R. ; though it may come too late 
I comply with your request as soon as I can. 

The subject is truly a perplexing one ; my mind has several 
times fluctuated ; if there were nothing in the case but his impru- 
dent sally upon a certain occasion, I should think the reasons for 
letting him pass would outweigh those for opposing his passage. 
But if it be really true that he is sottish or that his mind is other- 
wise deranged, or that he has exposed himself by improper con- 
duct in pecuniary transactions, the byass of my judgment would 
be to negative ; and as to the fact I would satisfy myself by care- 
ful inquiry of persons of character, who may have had an oppor- 
tunity of knowing. 

It is now, and in certain probable events will still more be, of 
infinite consequence that the judiciary should be well composed. 
Reflection upon this in its various aspects, weighs heavily on my 
mind against Mr. R., upon the accounts I have received of him 
and balances very weighty considerations the other way. 

Yrs. 

A. Hamilton. 

From what a Mr. Wadsworth lately in Philadelphia tells me of 
a conversation between Burr, Baldwin & Gallatin, it would seem 

* Hamiltoris Wo7-ks. , vi. , 76. 



17951 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 37 

that the two last Gentlemen have made up their minds to consider 
the Treaty, if ratified by G. Britain, as co?iclusive upon the H. of 
Representatives. I thought it well this should be known to you, if 
not before understood from any other quarter. 



R. King to A. Hamilton.* 

16th December, 1795. 

I send you Dunlap of this morning. In it you have foreign in- 
telligence. Fenno, Dunlap and others have erroneously stated, 
that Mr. Warden brought the ratification of Great Britain. No 
official despatch has been received. Rutledge was negatived yes- 
terday. From present appearances, the address to the President, 
will pass without a debate. The draft has been, by agreement in 
the Committee who reported it, shaped so as to reserve all points 
intended to be discussed relative to the treaty. The words 
underscored f in the inclosed draft, were offered in the committee 
by Mr. Madison, who agreed to concur in the paragraph, if they 
were added. You perceive the object. 

R. King. 

Upon the resignation of Mr. Jay from the office of Chief 
Justice of the Supreme Court, the President had appointed 
John Rutledge of South Carolina to that position. His letter 
of appointment reached him two days after, at a public meet- 
ing in Charleston, in which he denounced the treaty as 
" totally destitute of a single article worthy of approval. He 
even went so far as to reproach Jay with stupidity, if not 
corruption, in having signed it." J It is to this fact that

f " In the paragraph which declared that ' a secure foundation will be laid 
for accelerating, maturing and establishing the prosperity of our country ; if by 
treaty and amicable negotiation, all those causes of external discord, which 
heretofore menaced our tranquillity, shall be extinguished on terms compatible 
with our national rights and honor,' Madison insisted, as a condition of his 
concurrence, that the words should be added — ' and with our Constitution and 
great commercial interests.' " — Hamilton's Life, by J. C. H., vi., p. 326.

Hamilton probably alludes in his letter to Rufus King of 
December 14th, while the question of his confirmation as 
Chief Justice was pending in the Senate. He presided over 
the Court during one term, but was rejected by the Senate, 
as mentioned by Mr. King in his letter of December 16th. 
Mr. Cushing was offered the position, but having declined 
it, Mr. Ellsworth was appointed. 



R. King to Dr. Southgate. 

Philadelphia, 27th Deer., 1795. 
Dear Southgate : 

William * [R. K.'s brother] I am informed is 

a member of the General Court, & I am sorry for it unless 

his Commercial Pursuits calling him to Boston, an attendance 

there will not be detrimental to his Business. When he has 

toiled as long as I have, I think he will agree with me that it 

would have been wiser altogether to have abstained from political 

Engagements. . . . 

Always sincerely yours, 

Rufus King.

CHAPTER IV. 

Treaty with Great Britain communicated to Congress — Opposition in the 
House of Representatives — Demand made upon the President for Instruc- 
tions to the Minister and Correspondence — Refusal of the President on 
constitutional Grounds to send in these Papers — Correspondence showing 
the Temper of the People about the Treaty — Correspondence relative to 
Patrick Henry's Nomination for the Presidency — Mr. King's Nomination 
as Minister to England — His Appointment. 

On March i, 1796, the President, having first proclaimed 
it as the law of the land, communicated to Congress the 
treaty with Great Britain, which had been duly ratified in 
London. This was the signal in the House of Representa- 
tives to let loose the pent up wrath against this measure, 
which had only been restrained until official notice of its 
ratification should be received. The Message was referred 
to the Committee of the Whole, and the consideration of it 
was begun the next day by a motion from Mr. Edward Liv- 
ingston : " That the President of the United States be re- 
quested to lay before this House a copy of the instructions 
to the Minister of the United States, who negotiated the 
Treaty with Great Britain, communicated by his Message of 
the 1st of March, together with the correspondence and 
other documents relative to the said Treaty," which he 
modified a few days later by the addition of the words, 
" excepting such of said papers as any existing negotiation 
may render improper to be disclosed." 

Upon a call for the reasons which prompted such a reso- 
lution, if, for instance, it was to lay the ground for an im- 

39 



40 RUFUS KING. [1796 

^-- -'■■ " '■ ' ' ■■-■■■---- ■ ■ — ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ — — 

peachment against any officer, Mr. Livingston answered in 
general 

" that the House were the guardians of their country's rights ; they 
are, by the constitution, the accusing organ of the officers em- 
ployed. That the information called for they ought to possess as 
it would tend to elucidate the conduct of the officers. His prin- 
cipal reason, however, . . . was a firm conviction that the 
House were vested with a discretionary power of carrying the 
Treaty into effect, or refusing their sanction. . . . For this 
purpose the papers were necessary, and the House had a right to 
call for them." 

Other reasons were put forth by later speakers, and chiefly 
by Mr. Gallatin, especially in answer to the argument on the 
other side, that by the Constitution the whole treaty-making 
power was with the President, by and with the advice and 
consent of the Senate, and that the publication of the treaty 
made it the law of the land. 

Mr. Gallatin said * that he had no objection to follow 
them into the examination of the constitutional question, 

" and to rest the decision of the Constitutional powet-s of Congress on 
the fate of the present question. He would, therefore, state his 
opinion that the House had a right to ask for the papers proposed 
to be called for, because their co-operation and sanction was 
necessary to carry the Treaty into full effect, to render it a bind- 
ing instrument, and to make it, properly speaking, a law of the 
land ; because they had a full discretion either to give or to re- 
fuse that co-operation ; because they must be guided, in the 
exercise of that discretion by the merits and expediency of the 
Treaty itself, and therefore had a right to ask for every informa- 
tion which could assist them in deciding that question." 

The same points were urged by all the leading members 
of the House who took that side of the discussion, Madison, 
Giles, Baldwin, Livingston, and others, and they were an- 

* Annals of Congress, Sept., 1795-6, p. 465. 



1796] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 4 1 

swered by Smith of South Carolina, Harper, Sedgwick, 
Hillhouse, and others, who based their arguments on the 
Constitution itself, as Sedgwick said * : " The treaty-making 
power, with all its effects and consequences, was solely and 
exclusively in the President and Senate." As the framers 
of the Constitution supported this construction, those who 
ratified did the same, and as the practical action of the gov- 
ernment had been in conformity with it, it was clear that 

"Treaties so made became in fact supreme law, and being com- 
pacts they bound the public faith, and could not be violated 
without national disgrace and personal dishonor. They might 
require Legislative provision to carry them into effect ; but this 
neither implied nor authorized the exercise of discretion as to 
refusal ; " 

and that Congress could not revise the terms that might be 
made, or have any authority in carrying it out, except where 
money was to be had, and that then their power was limited 
to the best method of raising and paying the money. 

Mr. Harper, f who closed the debate, stated that he op- 
posed the resolution because " the papers to be called for 
were not necessary for enabling the House to execute this 
discretion (to withhold its aid, where Legislative aid was 
requisite to carry the Treaty into effect) ; that their decision 
on it was to be guided by the instrument itself, and not by 
the instructions or the previous negotiations, the call for 
which implied an opinion that the House had a right, not 
only to determine whether it would co-operate in carrying a 
Treaty into effect, but also to interfere in making Treaties." 
Finding the former ground could not be maintained, he said, 
" they now asserted a right to interference in making 
Treaties," which right he, as others before him, explicitly 
denied. 

The debate was a very able and prolonged one, and of ex- 

* Annals of Congress, 1795-6, pp. 527, 528. 
\ Ibid., p. 747. 



42 RUFUS KING. [1796 

treme interest, as it involved a constitutional provision, rela- 
tive to the powers of the Legislative department and of the 
Executive, the President, and the Senate acting in executive 
capacity. It consumed nearly three weeks, when on March 
24th, the resolution of Mr. Livingston with its modification 
was passed by a vote of sixty-two ayes and thirty-seven 
nays. 

The decision of the House was next day conveyed to the 
President, who informed the committee that he would take 
the resolution into consideration. 

In Hamilton s Works, vi., p. 94, is a letter from him to 
King, March 16th, giving his views upon the call made by 
the House upon the President, and asserting that the Presi- 
dent ought to take a stand against the usurpation of the 
House, for reasons which he gives, and closes a letter to 
Washington of March 28th, after considering some sugges- 
tions as to the propriety of his communicating " only the 
commissions and Mr. Jay's correspondence," saying that 
these are all that it appears to him for the public interest to 
send, 

" But after the fullest reflection I have been able to give the 
subject (though I perceive serious degrees of inconvenience in 
the course), I entertain a final opinion that it will be best, after 
the usurpation attempted by the House of Representatives, to send 
none, and to resist in totality." * 

Three days after this date Washington writes, on the 31st : 

" From the first moment, and from the fullest conviction in my 
own mind, I had resolved to resist the principle, which was evi- 
dently intended to be established by the call of the House of 
Representatives, and only deliberated on the manner in which 
this could be done with the least bad consequences." 

And while thanking Hamilton for the trouble he had taken 
to dilate on the request of the House of Representatives, 

* Hamilton 's Works, vol. vi., p. 98. 



1796] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 43 

and " to show the impropriety of that request," he stated 
that after consultation with the heads of the departments 
and Attorney-General, he had finally sent the answer he had 
prepared, and which will be found in the Annals of Congress, 
1795, vi., pp. 760, 761, which closes with this paragraph : 

" As therefore it is perfectly clear to my understanding, that the 
assent of the House of Representatives is not necessary to the 
validity of a Treaty ; as the Treaty with Great Britain exhibits in 
itself all the objects requiring legislative provision, and on these the 
papers called for can throw no light ; and as it is essential to the 
due administration of the Government, that the boundaries fixed 
by the Constitution between the different departments should be 
preserved — a just regard to the Constitution and to the duty of 
my office, under all the circumstances of this case, forbid a com- 
pliance with your request." 

Upon receipt of this Message, the House resolved itself 
in Committee of the Whole upon it, and after a short debate 
affirmed, by a vote of 57 to 35, their right to deliberate on the 
expediency or inexpediency of carrying a treaty into effect, 
and to determine and act thereon, as in their judgment may 
be most conducive to the public good, when the treaty con- 
tains stipulations which depend for execution upon a law, 
or laws, to be passed by Congress, and that it is not neces- 
sary to state in the application for such information as they 
may desire, the purpose for which the information is 
wanted. At the same time they said they did not claim any 
agency in making treaties, as the Constitution, in Article II., 
gave the power to the President, with the advice and con- 
sent of the Senate. The bill for carrying the treaty into 
effect was finally passed on the 3d of May, by 5 1 to 48.* 

* Mr. Jefferson's A nas, vol. ix., p. 194 (Jefferson s Works.) 
'* March the 1st, 1898, Mr. Tazewell tells me, that when the appropriations 
for the British Treaty were on the carpet, and very uncertain in the lower House, 
there being at the time a number of bills in the hands of the committees of the 
Senate, none reported and the Senate idle for the want of them, he, in his place, 
called on the committees to report, and particularly on Mr. King, who was of 
most of them. King said that it was true the committees kept back their re- 



44 RUFUS KING. [1796 

The above sketch of the proceedings in reference to the 
Jay treaty is given to show the interest taken by Mr. King 
in the proper solution of the grave questions which were 
involved. He appears in harmony with Hamilton, who, 
though no longer occupying an official position, was still the 
able and trusted adviser of the President — not the director 
of his actions on all occasions, as some have asserted. The 
President's mind, as he says himself, was made up at once 
as to his duty ; his only hesitation was as to the manner of 
doing it. Mr. King in the Senate, and occupying an influen- 
tial position there, as the records of that body show, was 
able to watch events and to hold himself in readiness to meet 
every case that might arise and give direction to the efforts 
of the friends of the administration in the House also. A 
letter to Hamilton of 1st May, speaks of the results then 
accomplished and his fears and hopes for the future.* 

" In committee of the whole on Friday, it was resolved by the 
casting vote of Muhlenburgh, the chairman, to make provision by 
law for carrying the Treaty with England into effect ; yesterday 
the resolution of the committee was passed by the House by 51 
against 48. A proposition to prefix to the resolution a preamble 
declaring the Treaty to be injurious to the interests of the United 
States and assigning the short duration of its temporary articles as 
a reason why it should be permitted to go into effect, was negatived 

ports waiting the event of the question about appropriation ; that, if that was 
not carried, they considered legislation as at an end ; that they might as well 
break up and consider the Union dissolved. Tazewell expressed his astonish- 
ment at these ideas, and called on King to know if he had misapprehended him. 
King rose again and repeated the same words. The next day Cabot took an 
occasion in debate, and so awkward a one as to show it was a thing agreed to 
be done, to repeat the same sentiments in stronger terms, and carried further, 
by declaring a determination on their side to break up and dissolve the 
government." 

This narrative certainly shows that Mr. King held an influential position in 
the Senate during this exciting period, and, if correct, that he looked with 
most serious forebodings as to the future, if the House refused their part in 
carrying out the provisions of the treaty. 

* Hamilton' s Works, vol. vi., p. 112. 



1796] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 45 

by 50 against 49, and the resolution was immediately, and without 
division, referred to a committee, with instructions to prepare a bill, 
or bills, in conformity with the resolution. The failure of the 
party in their intention to denounce the Treaty, I am fearful, will 
not discourage them in a second attempt. A majority of five or 
six (if I am not mistaken) would join in a vote of condemnation, 
but in the shape in which the proposition was offered, some of 
the most inveterate opponents of the Treaty voted in the nega- 
tive, because, they said, if they voted for the preamble, it would 
be then proper for them to vote for the resolution, which they 
were determined not to do. Though from the stage in which the 
business now is, I hope the attempt will not be made ; yet, if an 
independent resolution should be offered declaring the Treaty to 
be injurious, &c, I am apprehensive it would be adopted. This, 
however, would not defeat the provision for the execution of the 
Treaty — 51 votes in the affirmative ; the Speaker's vote, with that 
of Mr. Freeman, of Massachusetts, both of whom are in favor of 
the provisions, make 53 affirmative votes, a majority of the whole 
number of Representatives."

Dear Sir : 

I take the liberty to avail myself of your aid for forwarding to 
Mr. Hamilton the inclosed letter.* 

The ruling party of Virginia are extremely irritated at the vote 
of to-day and will spare no exertion to obtain a majority in other 

* The letter to Hamilton here mentioned is of the same date as the above, 
and may be found in Works of Hamilton, vol. vi., p. 108. It relates to the 
feeling in Virginia relative to the question of the adoption of Jay's treaty, and 
of the temper of the House of Representatives, and especially of the Virginia 
members, who bitterly opposed its ratification ; and speaks of the meeting 
called that day in Richmond by those who desired the ratification of the treaty, 
saying that a resolution had been passed by a decided majority, after long dis- 
cussion, " that the welfare and honor of the nation required us to give full effect 
to the treaty negotiated with Britain." He says further : " I think it would be 
very difficult, perhaps impossible, to engage Mr. H. [probably Mr. Henry] on 
the right side of this question."

counties. Even here they will affect to have the greater number 
of freeholders and have set about counter Resolutions to which 
they have the signatures of many respectable persons, but of still 
a greater number of mere boys ; and altho' some caution has been 
used by us in excluding those who might not be considered as 
authorized to vote, they will not fail to charge us with having col- 
lected a number of names belonging to foreigners and to persons 
having no property in the place. The charge is as far untrue as 
has perhaps ever happened on any occasion of the sort. We 
could, by resorting to that measure, have doubled our list of 
petitioners. 

I have endeavored to take means to procure similar applications 
from various parts of the State. Exitus in dubio est.

R. King to A. Hamilton.* 

Monday, May 2, 1796. 

The inclosed letter will give you all the information that we 
have on the subject to which it relates. It seems problematical 
whether P. H. can be induced to agree in the arrangement. Some 
circumstances of which I have lately heard incline me to believe 
that he will not. Our session will close by the 1st of June, pro- 
vided no further impediment is thrown in the way of the provision 
for giving efficacy to the treaty with England — and it is much to 
be wished that a definitive should be made before we separate. 

Mr. Pinckney has asked leave to return home, and waits only 
for permission. To his former stock of popularity he will now 
add the good-will of those who have been peculiarly gratified 
with the Spanish Treaty. Should we concur in him, will he not 
receive as great, perhaps greater, southern and western support 
than any other man ? 

* Hamilton: 's Works, vi., p. 113. In this same volume, p. 425, Mr. J. C. 
Hamilton says in reference to Mr. Pinckney 's wish to be recalled : " This pur- 
pose was communicated by Rufus King to Hamilton, in a letter, relative to 
overtures which Hamilton had requested Marshall to open with Patrick Henry, 
to permit his name to be used at the next canvass for the Presidency."

You must know that I am not a little tired with this separation 
from my family and drudging in the Senate. The work now be- 
fore us being finished, I think I am entitled to a dismission. It 
would be agreeable to me to spend a few years abroad, and if I 
do not misconceive the interests of the country, I think I could 
render some service to the public at the present period in Eng- 
land. Will you converse with Mr. Jay on the subject — I can 
through no other channel communicate with the Executive — nor 
do I desire that either of you should suggest the measure, unless 
you both agree in its propriety and utility. 

Yours very sincerely. 



A. Hamilton to R. King. * 

May 4, 1796. 
My Dear Sir : 

Since my last I have received two or three letters from you. 
The late turn of the treaty question makes us all very happy. I 
hope no future embarrassment will arise. 

I am entirely of the opinion that, Patrick Henry declining, Mr. 
Pinckney ought to be our man. It is even an idea of which I 
am fond in various lights. Indeed, on later reflection, I rather 
wish to be rid of Patrick Henry, that we may be at full liberty to 
take up Pinckney. 

In the event of Pinckney's return to this country, I am of 
opinion, all circumstances considered, it is expedient you should 
replace him. I hope no great question will in a short period agi- 
tate our councils, and I am sure you will do much good on the 
scene in question. I have called on Jay, but happened not to 
find him disengaged. I shall quickly see him, and shall, with 
great pleasure, do everything requisite on my part. 

We believe confidently our election in the city has succeeded ; 
the other party, however, claims success. Our Senator ticket 
seems admitted on both sides to have prevailed, and all accounts 
assure us of great success throughout the State. The vile affair f

of whipping Burke and McCredy made our election, in the view 

of the common people, a question between the rich and the poor. 

You will easily conceive how much this must have embarrassed 

and jeoparded. 

Yours affectionately &c. 

The following letter closes the correspondence on the 
negotiations with Mr. Henry. 

J. Marshall to R. King. 

Richmond, May 24, 1796. 
Dear Sir : 

Mr. Henry has at length been sounded on the subject you com- 
mitted to my charge. Genl. Lee and myself have each conversed 
with him on it, tho' without informing him particularly of the 
persons who authorized the communication. He is unwilling to 
embark in the business. His unwillingness, I think, proceeds 
from an apprehension of the difficulties to be encountered by 
those who shall fill high Executive offices. 

With very much respect and esteem &c. 

J. Marshall.

Dear Sir : 

After reading, seal and hand in the enclosed. If such things 

are to be, you cannot leave the Senate. Jay is against it, at all 

events until the European storm is over. We must all think well 

of this business. 

Yours affectionately &c. 

The inclosed letter was for the President. — R. K. 

It is probable that the inclosed letter is that of which 
Washington acknowledged the receipt, and which he 
answered on May 8th, f beginning : 

* Hamilton s Works, vi., 114. \ Ibid., vi., 116. 



1796] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 49 

" Your note of the 5th inst., accompanying the information 

given to G. M. , on March 16th came to me on Friday. 

The letter he refers to as having been written to me is not yet 
received ; but others from Mr. Monroe of similar complexion, and 
almost of as imperious a tone from the Government have come to 
hand." 

The tenor of these letters indicated that France, disap- 
proving of the treaty with Great Britain, might take deci- 
sive steps to show this disposition, and as the President 
says : 

" May, and I believe, will send out an envoy extraordinary, 
with instructions to make strong remonstrances against the un- 
friendliness (as they will term it) and the tendency of our treaty 
with Great Britain ; accompanied, probably, and expectedly, with 
discretionary powers to go farther. . . . But I cannot bring 
my mind to believe that they seriously mean, or that they could 
accompany this envoy with a fleet to demand the annihilation of 
the treaty with Great Britain in fifteen days, or that war, in case 
of refusal, must follow as a consequence. ... If you have 
communicated this letter to Mr. Jay, I wish you would lay this 
also before him in confidence, and that you and he would be so 
good as to favor me with your sentiments and opinions upon 
both." 

This condition of the foreign relations was doubtless the 
reason which induced Hamilton to say that Mr. King must 
not leave the Senate, an opinion in which Jay concurred, 
and not as Mr. J. C. Hamilton* says without comment or 
reason given. " Jay thought King should not leave the 
Senate." In the same spirit, f in reference to the appoint- 
ment of Mr. King as Minister to England, he gives no 
authority for the following remark : " Washington's objec- 
tions to this appointment were not merely of a public 
nature ; he had conceived a strong dislike to King ; but 
sedulous of the public good the President now acquiesced 

* Life of Hamilton, vi., 426. \ Ibid., p. 428. 

VOL. 11. — 4 



50 RUFUS KING. [1796 

in Hamilton's wishes." There is no evidence given of the 
existence of this dislike. Mr. King's being a Senator was 
one of the causes of the President's hesitation, as the follow- 
ing extract from a letter of May 15 th from Washington to 
Hamilton indicates*: 

" . . . With respect to the gentleman you have mentioned 
as successor to Mr. P., there can be no doubt of his abilities, nor 
in my mind is there any of his fitness. But you know, as well as 
I, what has been said of his political sentiments with respect to 
another form of government ; and from thence can be at no loss 
to guess at the interpretation which would be given to the nomi- 
nation of him. However, the subject shall have due considera- 
tion ; but a previous resignation would, in my opinion, carry with 
it too much the appearance of concert, & would have a bad 
rather than good effect." 

To this Mr. Hamilton replied,f referring, as the general 
index to Hamilton's works says, to Rufus King: 

A. Hamilton to G. Washington. 

" May 20, 1796. 

" . . . I observe what you say on the subject of a certain 
diplomatic mission. Permit me to offer with frankness the reflec- 
tions which have struck my mind. 

"The importance of our security, and commerce, and good 
understanding with Great Britain, renders it very important that 
a man able and not disagreeable to that Government, should be 
there. The gentleman in question, equally with any who could 
go, and better than any willing to go, answers this description. 
The idea hinted in your letter will apply to every man fit for the 
mission, by his conspicuousness, talents, and dispositions. 'T is 
the stalking horse of a certain party, and is made use of against 
every man, who is not in their views and of sufficient conse- 
quence to attract their obloquy. If listened to, it will deprive

1796] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 5 1 

the government of the services of the most able and faithful 
agents. Is this expedient ? What will be gained by it ? Is it not 
evident that this party will pursue its hostility at all events as far 
as public opinion will permit ? Does policy require anything 
more than that they shall have no real cause to complain ? Will 
it do, in deference to their calumniating insinuations, to forbear 
employing the most competent men, or to entrust the great busi- 
ness of the country to unskilful, unfaithful, or doubtful hands ? 
I really feel a conviction that it will be very dangerous to let 
party insinuations of this kind prove a serious obstacle to the 
employment of the best qualified characters. Mr. King is a re- 
markably well informed man, a very judicious one, a man of 
address, a man of fortune and economy, whose situation affords 
just ground of confidence ; a man of unimpeached probity, where 
he is best known, a firm friend to the government, a supporter of 
the measures of the President — a man who cannot but feel that 
he has strong pretensions to confidence and trust. 

" I might enlarge on these topics, but I have not leisure 
neither can it be necessary. I have thrown out so much in the 
fulness of my heart, and too much in a hurry to fashion either 
the idea or the expression as it ought to be. The President, how- 
ever, will, I doubt not, receive what I have said, as it is meant, as 
dictated by equal regard for the public interest and the honor- 
able course of his administration. ..." 

Mr. King was soon after nominated, and confirmed by 
the Senate, as Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Lon- 
don, and on the 23d his letter of resignation from that body 
was read in the Senate.* Thus closed for a time his career 

* In reference to this appointment, Mr. King says in answer to questions 
from Mr. William Coleman in his letter of February 5, 181 7 : " The Mission 
to England I was desirous to have. I had reason to know that Genl. W. had 
thought of giving it to me, when Mr. Th. P. was appointed. When Mr. Py. 
desired to be recalled, and the mission was offered to me, I unhesitatingly 
accepted it. 

"I lived more intimately with the public men of England, as well those of 
the Opposition as of the Govt., than any foreigner of my time. I frequented 
the society of literary men and have been in correspondence with several of the 
most distinguished civilians of the old world."

in that legislative body. That he had been active in the per- 
formance of his duties there, both as chairman of important 
committees and as a member of others, in matters relating 
to commercial regulations, to the various treaties negotiated, 
to the admission of Tennessee as a new State, which only 
took place after he left the Senate, and to many other im- 
portant measures considered during that session, the Journal 
of the Senate bears abundant evidence. He had, however, 
for reasons which have been given, determined to retire 
from his position in the Legislature, and desired to seek 
employment elsewhere, where he thought he might do good, 
and in a position more congenial to his tastes. Washington 
thus announced to Mr. Pinckney, who had asked leave to 
return home, the appointment of Mr. King to take his 
place : 

" The doubtful issue of the dispute and the real difficulty in 
finding a character to supply your place at the Court of London, 
has occasioned a longer delay than may have been convenient or 
agreeable to you. But, as Mr. King of the Senate, who, it seems, 
has resolved to quit his seat at that Board, has accepted the posi- 
tion, and will embark as soon as matters can be arranged, you 
will soon be relieved."

Dear King : 

I hope you have found your family happier than you expected. 

. . . A copy of the treaty and its ratification is arrived, but 
the Prest. will not submit it to the legislature untill he receives 
the original. This information I have from Col. Pickering. By 
whom the original is to be expected is not known. I have evi- 
dence, to my mind conclusive, that it is determined to oppose the 
treaty and on the ground that it is unconstitutional. 

The legislature, by this however I mean only the House of 
Representatives, of S. Carolina,* have declared agt. the treaty, 
but in terms more soft and mild than the original motion. The 
concurrence of the Senate was not requested, and because, as the 
friends of the measure declared, they were convinced it could not 
be obtained. This I learn from a letter to Wm. Smith from his 
cousin a member of the house. Barnwell behaved nobly. . . . 

Yours affectly.

A. Hamilton to R. King. 

Jany., 1796. 

My Dear Sir : 

If the News Papers tell truth it would appear that Massachusetts 
has anticipated New York. But it is intended by our friends in 
the Legislature to give some pointed discountenance to the propo- 
sitions. It was expected that it would have been done to-day, 
but by the divergings of some men, who seek popularity with both 
sides, they have gotten into an unnecessary debate over the 
proposition in detail, which will lose time, but in the result a 
handsome majority will do right. 

Lawrance is hurt and as far as I see not without some reason 
from particular circumstances at being left out of the Direction 
of the Bank. It will be balm to his feelings to be put into the 
direction of the office here, and I believe it will be an improve- 
ment of the Direction to do it. I wish you would endeavor to 
bring it about. Speak to Bayard of our city and to Wharton of 
Philadelphia. This is a suggestion of my own, for Lawrance 
rather rides a high horse upon the occasion. 

Yrs. truly, 
A. Hamilton. 

C. Gore to R. King. 

Boston, 21st January, 1796. 
My Dear Friend : 

You did me justice in supposing that I confided in your friend- 
ship and zeal to promote my gratification. A confidence in the 
affection and esteem of those we love & respect is one of the 
choicest blessings of heaven, a distrust of a disposition in my 
friends to gratify wishes not in their opinion unreasonable, wou'd 
be the sorest mortification I could experience. Be assured I have 
not lost the former, or felt the latter. 

A letter from Mr. Cabot by this mail requests an explicit 
answer by return of post whether, if invited, I woud engage as 
Commissioner and go very soon to England. My answer by this 
post is explicitly in the affirmative. I coud settle my own affairs 
in one week. I shoud wish, and think it probable, that the 
Executive might choose, that I shoud visit Philadelphia and 



1796] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 55 

receive the ideas of our own government on the manner of ex- 
ecuting the commission. These things done, I know nothing to 
hinder my immediate embarkation for Europe. 

Ames was in this town the day before yesterday ; he talks of 
proceeding to Springfield shortly, and from thence making an 
effort to meet his friends in Congress. He express'd a wish for 
me to accompany him, wh. I would readily have acceded to, if 
it were not for the indelicate state it woud place me in before an 
appointment of Commr. He acknowledged the weight of the 
objection. . . . 

You will see in the papers Governor Adams' Speech which 
was received with almost universal disgust. The Senate has 
appointed a Committee wh. I think will respond not in unison 
with his Excellency. Two of the House's committee (the two 
branches answer separately) are deadly opposed to the Governor's 
sentiments : a third, I am of opinion, will not promote an echo : 
Jarvis and Ely will be disposed to any measures, regardless of 
their consequences. The disposal of the Virginia resolves, as 
related in the Centinel, is correct in every thing but the final vote 
of the house. After the question for commitment was lost, 
Doctr. Jarvis moved that they might lay on the table till the 
answer to the Govr's Speech was reported ; with great difficulty 
this obtained a majority of one only. 

Our Senate and house are well disposed to the federal govern- 
ment, and it is more than probable that an effort will be made to 
displace Adams from the chair, and put Sumner in his stead. 

With Sincerity and affection your friend 

C. Gore.

New York, 27 Jany., 1796. 
Dear Sir :

the public mind.

John Jay to R. King, Philadelphia. 

New York, 2d Feby., 1796. 
Dear Sir : 

I was at this moment favd. with yours of the 29th ult., in- 
forming me that " Mr. Harper concurred in the Idea of print- 
ing by way of note my entire letter to him." My Idea was a 
short note referring to the letter, subjoined or annexed to the 
address.* I have no objection to either mode, my object being 
that the first appearance of the Letter should be in or with his 
address, rather than in a newspaper ; for his objections to the 
latter mode appear to me well founded. 

The ratification will bear a little longer absence. Things seem 
to work together for good. Are you apprized that the preliminary 
articles of the peace were ratified on a copy sent by Dr. Franklin ? 
I suspect that the original still remains among his private papers. 
A hint of this to Mr. Pickering may not be improper, that he may 
(if that be the case) take measures for getting and placing the 
original in the office. I think I once searched for it there and 
could not find it and that the fact is as I have suggested. It seems 
strange Mr. Adams should have been ordered to London to do 
nothing, but we see strange things in our Days. . . . 

Yours sincerely 

John Jay.

I thank you for your letter of the 

My opinion on the resolution, when it first appeared, was that 
the President should answer in substance as follows, viz. 

" That it could not be admitted as a right of course in the 
House of Representatives to call for & have papers in the Ex- 
ecutive department, especially those relating to foreign negotia- 
tions which frequently embrace confidential matter. That under 
all the circumstances & upon so indefinite a call without any

Harper on his Address for approving the treaty with Great Britain — printed

declared specific object, he did not think it proper nor consistent 
with what he owed to a due separation of the respective Powers, 
to comply with the call. That if in the course of the Proceedings 
of the House, a question of their competency should arise for 
which any of the papers in question might be necessary, an ap- 
plication made on that ground would be considered with proper 
respect &c." 

But after what has taken place in the discussion, if it can 
with propriety be got in as to form, I think a stand ought to be 
made by the President against the usurpation. The following 
propositions comprise an obvious ground. 

I. The Constitution empowers the President with the Senate to 
make Treaties. 

II. A treaty is a perfected contract between two nations obliga- 
tory on both. 

III. That cannot be a perfected contract or Treaty to the 
validity of which the concurrence of any other power in the state 
is constitutionally necessary. 

IV. The Constitution says a treaty is a law. 

V. A Law is an obligatory rule of action prescribed by the 
competent authority. But 

VI. That cannot be such a rule of Action or a law to the valid- 
ity of which the Assent of any other power is requisite. Again 

VII. The object of the Legislative Power is to prescribe a rule 
of Action for our own Nation, which includes foreigners coming 
among us. 

VIII. The object of the Treaty Power is by agreement to settle 
a rule of action between two nations binding on both. 

IX. These objects are essentially different and in a consti- 
tutional sense cannot interfere. 

X. The Treaty Power binds the will of the nation, must 
within its constitutional limits be paramount to the Legislative 
Power, which is that will ; or, at least, the last law being a Treaty 
must repeal an antecedent contradictory law. 

And XI. If the Legislative power is competent to repeal this 
law by a subsequent law, this must be the whole Legislative power 
by a solemn act in the forms of the constitution, not one branch of 
the legislative power by disobeying the law. 



58 RUFUS KING. [1796 

XII. The foregoing construction reconciles the two powers and 
assigns them distinguishable spheres of action. While 

XIII. The other construction, that claiming that a right of 
assent or sanction for the House of Representatives, destroys the 
Treaty making Power & negatives two Propositions in the Con- 
stitution — to wit — I. that the President with the Senate are com- 
petent to make Treaties, II. that a Treaty is a Law. 

On these grounds with the President's name a bulwark not to 

be shaken is erected. The propositions amount in my judgment 

to irresistible demonstration. 

Yrs. 

A. Hamilton.

Ap'l 2, 1796. 

Thank you for yours of yesterday. I have no copy of the paper 
sent. The greatest part went in the original draft, though consid- 
erably reformed acccording to joint ideas & somewhat strength- 
ened by new thoughts. A letter I have received tells me that it 
came to hand after the ground which was acted upon had been 
formally considered in Council, and that it is referred for future 
use in the event of an expected criticism of the Message. 

I have asked for it conditionally to secure correct, &c. If I get

crossing of path.

Your affectionate friend,

1796] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 59 

A. Hamilton to R. King.* 

New York, April 15, 1796. 

My Dear Sir : 

A letter by yesterday's Post from our Friend Ames informed 
me that the Majority (57 concurring) had resolved in a private 
Meeting to refuse appropriations for the Treaty. A most impor- 
tant crisis ensues. Great evils may result unless good men play 
their card well & with promptitude and decision. For we must 
seize and carry along with us the public opinion ; and loss of 
time may be loss of everything. 

To me our true plan appears to be the following (I suppose 
that a certain communication has been made). 

1. The President ought immediately after the House has taken 
the ground of refusal to send them a solemn Protest. This pro- 
test ought to contain reasons in detail against the claim of the 
House in point of Constitutional right & ought to suggest sum- 
marily but with solemnity and energy the danger to the interests 
& Peace of the country from the measures of the House. The 
certainty of a deep wound to our character with foreign Nations, 
and essential destruction of their confidence in the Government, 
concluding with an intimation that in such a state of things, he 
must experience extreme embarrassment in proceeding in any 
pending or future negotiation which the affairs of the U. States 
may require, inasmuch as he cannot look for due confidence from 
others, nor give them the requisite expectation that stipulations 
will be fulfilled on our part. 

A copy of this protest to be sent to the Senate for their infor- 
mation : the Senate by resolutions to express strongly their appro- 
bation of his principles, to assure him of their firm support, & to 
advise him to proceed in the execution of the Treaty on his part 
in the confidence that he will derive from the virtue and good 
sense of the people, constitutionally exerted, eventual & effectual 
support ; & may still be the instrument of preserving the Consti- 
tution, the Peace & the Honor of the Nation. 

Then the merchants to meet in the cities and second by their 
resolutions the measures of the President & Senate, further

addressing their fellow citizens to co-operate with them. Petitions 
afterwards to be handed throughout the U. States. 

The Senate to hold fast & consent to no adjournment till the 
expiration of the term of service of the present House unless pro- 
vision be made. 

The President to cause a confidential communication to be 
made to the British stating candidly what has happened, his 
regrets, his adherence nevertheless to the Treaty, his resolution to 
persist in the Execution so far as depends on the Executive, & 
his hope that the faith of the Country will be eventually preserved. 

I prefer that the measures should begin with a Protest of the 
President, as it will be in itself proper & there will be more 
chance of success if the contest appears to be with him & the 
Senate auxiliaries, than in the reverse. 

But in all this business celerity, decision & an imposing attitude 
are indispensable. The Glory of the President, the safety of the 
Constitution, the greatest interests depend upon it. Nothing 
will be wanting here. I do not write to the President on the 
subject. 

An Idea has come from Cooper of an intention in our friends in 
the House of Representatives to resist the execution of the other 
Treaties, the Spanish & Algerine, unless coupled with the British. 
But this will be altogether wrong & impolitic. The misconduct 
of the other party cannot justify in us an imitation of their prin- 
ciples. 'Tis best I think that the freest course should be given 
to the other Treaties ; or at most, if a feint of opposition is 
deemed adviseable, it ought to be left to the Senate by postpone- 
ment &c. But even this is very delicate and very questionable. 

Let us be Right, because to do right is intrinsically proper & I 
verily believe it is the best mean of securing final success. Let 
our adversaries have the whole glory of sacrificing the interests of 
the Nation. 

Yrs. affectly. 

A. Hamilton. 

P.S. — If the treaty is not executed, the President will be called 
upon by regard to the character of the public good to keep his 
post till another House of Representatives has pronounced.

New York, April 18, 1796. 
Dear Sir : 

I thank you for your letter received to-day. Our merchants 
here are not less alarmed than those of Philadelphia, and will do 
all they can. All the insurance people meet to-day : the Merchants 
& Traders will meet to-morrow or the next day. A Petition will 
be prepared and circulated among the other citizens. 

I regret that a certain communication was not made. Indeed 
I think the Executive will be hereafter blamed for keeping back 
the fact in so critical a posture of things. 

Yrs truly 

A. Hamilton.

Dr. Sir : 

Yesterday's Post brought me a letter from you which gave me 
pleasure. The papers will apprize you of the proceedings of the 
Merchants & Traders here on yesterday : there is among them 
also "unexampled unanimity," & as far as I can judge the current 
is in our favour throughout the City. Persons to-day are going 
through the different wards. 

Yrs sincerely 

A. Hamilton. 

P.S. — Our friends in the House will do well to gain time.

Dr. Sir : 

I have received your two letters and shall this day attend to 
the one which requires it. I see however no objection to it as it 
stands, and I do not now perceive how the further object you 
aim at could be accomplished in the manner you seem to desire.

I have written to Ames this day concerning the course of things 
in our city. He will communicate to you, as I have not time to 
repeat. We are decidedly well. But it is intended to-day to 
continue the Petition in circulation & to-morrow it will be sent. 
I thought it adviseable to publish an extract from your letter with- 
out naming you.

A. Hamilton. 

It is much to be regretted that the letters of Mr. King 
referred to in the above short notes of Mr. Hamilton, and 
which must have given some interesting facts as well as the 
views of Mr. King relative to the important questions under 
review, are not accessible, if they are in existence, Mr. 
J. C. Hamilton, in his Works of Hamilton, publishing those 
above, but not the answers to them. A search for them in 
the United States State Department among the Hamilton 
papers by Mr. Andrew H. Allen, Chief of Bureau of Rolls 
and Library, at the Editor's request, has been unsuccessful.

Dear Sir : 

I did not expect you would leave us before the end of the 
Session. Your sudden departure has deprived me of the oppor- 
tunity I would have taken to give you my hand at parting. If I 
had enjoyed it, I could not have expressed all the esteem, good 
wishes, and real regrets I shall feel for you. I know you will not 
think it necessary, in order to make you convinced of my sin- 
cerity. It is, however, a pleasure to me, tho' it is a farewell, to 
assure you how ardently I shall ever take an interest in the 
increase of your reputation and happiness. I beg Mrs. King to 
accept my best respects — a good voyage — once more farewell.

R. King to T. Pickering. 

Private. 

New York, June 1, 1796. 
Dear Sir : 

I omitted suggesting to you before my departure from Phila- 
delphia an observation or two concerning our Consul at Ham- 
burgh. Our merchant ships may, without violating our national 
impartiality, be employed in the service of the belligerent Powers 
— if they engage in a service prohibited by the Law of Nations, 
and are detected, they incur the Penalty, and the conduct is not 
imputed to the nation. But where any officer of the Nation does 
an act, which in a private person wld. be prohibited by the Law 
of Nations, it is requisite in my opinion that on complaint the 
Nation to wh. such officer belongs shd. disavow the Act and pun- 
ish the offender. I am inclined to think the conduct of Mr. 
Parish has afforded just cause of complaint, and that although he 
may be a worthy man he shd. be displaced. The step may be 
explained to him in a satisfactory manner. The party wh. com- 
plains is in a state of irritation — the conduct cannot be justified. 
A compliance with the Desires of those who complain will be 
politic. The point is not of sufficient importance to be made a 
serious and solemn question between the two Nations. Besides I 
suspect we shd. be put in the wrong. I hope you will see this 
subject in the light in which I view it — in itself it is of small im- 
portance, it may become of real consequence. Should the Consul 
be dismissed and the ground explained to him, he would feel 
little dissatisfaction if he is a man of sense — and after the Peace 
he might be re-appointed if it should be deemed advisable. 

I am Dr. Sir your ob. St. 

Rufus King. 

R. King to T. Pickering. 

Private. 

N. York, 7 June, 1796. 
Dear Sir : 

I do not remember to have conversed with Mr. Jay concerning 
the terms of the XII Article of the Treaty with Great Britain, 
which were intended to ascertain the articles of Import and Ex- 



64 RUFUS KING. [1796 

port to and from the W. In. Colonies. I have conceived that the 
Article would have secured to us a Right to carry thither every 
Article which it is now lawful to carry thither from the U. S. in 
Br. vessels — that the Catalogue of articles could not have been 
diminished : and moreover that we should have had a right to 
carry thither every other article, which might hereafter, and 
during the operation of the Stipulation, be lawfully carried there 
from the U. S. in Br. Vessels — the second paragraph secured to 
our vessels a right to export from these Colonies, only such Arti- 
cles as may now lawfully be brought from thence to the U. S. in 
Br. vessels ; here again the Catalogue of articles could not have 
been abridged, but in case it had been enlarged in favor of Br. 
vessels, it is not obvious that we could have claimed a Right to 
receive and bring from thence in our vessels such additional arti- 
cles ; and in this respect the stipulation appears unequal — whether 
this was accident or Design, I am at a loss ; probably the former. 
I have seen no sufficient reason to change an opinion that I 
thought well founded on the first appearance of this article ; 
which is that it would have been more plain as a rule of Conduct, 
and less likely to originate misunderstandings, and perhaps com- 
mercial losses, if instead of a reference to the Br. Statutes to find 
out the articles which might be imported and exported to and 
from the Br. W. Inds., the articles had been enumerated in the 
Treaty. 

A clause might have been added which would have secured 
to us the advantages of any enlargement of the List of articles 
which the Br. Policy in future might have adopted. 

Relative to Mr. Adams taking leave at the Hague, would it not 
be proper to intimate to the Government of the U. N. " that cir- 
cumstances interesting to the U. S. have induced the President to 
remove Mr. Adams from the Hague to Lisbon — that it is hoped 
this measure will be taken in good Part, and meet with the appro- 
bation of the Gov. of the U. N. for whom we entertain a sincere 
esteem and friendship, and in whose Prosperity and Happiness 
we take a lively concern — that it is the President's intention to 
name a successor to Mr. Adams who will renew to the Govt, the 
assurances of the friendly attachment of the U. S. for the Bata- 
vian Republic." 



1796] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 65 

Some course like this will conciliate the Convention and will 
leave the President sufficient latitude in respect to the time of 
replacing Mr. Adams at the Hague. 

I omitted to tell you in a line I wrote to you yesterday, that I have 
engaged my Passage in the ship James, Conckling Master, of this 
Port. She is an American Ship and Master, is not to take con- 
traband of war nor Enemy Goods. She is to sail on the 19th 
instant. I have engaged to be ready by that Day. She is bound 
to London.

Wm. Smith to R. King. 

Charleston, July 23d, 1796. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . I did not leave Philad. till ten days after the adjt. and 
having a very tedious passage did not arrive here till the 1st inst, 
not in time to prepare, and scarcely in time to deliver my Oration, 
a copy of which I send you, with a curious advertisement of the 
Vender, who says that the works which have lately had the 
greatest run in town, are Paine's Age of Reason & Smith's 
Oration. You will smile at seeing any work of mine associated 
with Paine's & the heroic actions of the French. 

Our unfortunate town has lately suffered much from fire ; the 
last, which occurred on the 13th of June, was very destructive, 
having swept away several whole streets, and consumed upwards 
of two hundred and fifty dwellings. The contributions have 
been very considble. here for the relief of the sufferers, & we un- 
derstand that very generous aid will be furnished from New York, 
Philad. and some other cities. Many of our planters and Merchts. 
are extremely embarrassed by the great fall of produce. Mr. 
Izard, who refused a great price here & shipped a part of his 
crop, will probably lose near ^"3000. 

He and his family are well. I need not inform you how much 
satisfaction he reed, from your appointmt. ; indeed I can assure 

vol. n.— s 



66 RUFUS KING. [1796 

you it has met with general approbation here. . . . We have as 
yet no certain accot. of the President's intentions as to the next 
election. Before I left Philada., it seemed understood that Major 
Pinckney was to be joined with Mr. Adams. The friends of the 
former have been sounded about it, but as he is expected here 
soon, nothing definite has been concluded on. 

Since the last session there has been a promotion in Congress ; 
Hillhouse, Goodhue and Sedgwick having succeeded to Ellsworth, 
Cabot and Strong, I am happy to find that Goodhue is elected for 
six years from next March. . . . The Treatyphobia is com- 
pletely cured here, and federal politics, when they engage the 
attention, excite generally approbation. Those who made such a 
ridiculous clamor last summer seem ashamed of themselves and 
are glad to throw a veil over what has passed. Mr. Rutledge, 
the late C. J., lives quite retired & avoids being seen ; his health 
is said to be mended. ... I am, Dr. Sir, very sincerely 
yours &c. 

Wm. Smith. 



G. Cabot to R. King, London. 

Brookline, July 24, 1796. 
My dear friend : 

. . . I am in every sense so abstracted from the political 
world, that if my daily visitors did not talk over what passes in it, 
I should know nothing of its affairs ; as one of the people, however, 
I feel it my duty to say that we are well satisfied with our gov- 
ernment, and perceive very plainly that it has done for us much 
better than we shou'd have done for ourselves, if we had fol- 
lowed our own humour. We understand this now pretty well 
throughout New England, and we generally agree, that in future 
we ought to think before we decide on public measures, or inflec- 
tion may come too late. 

The Gazettes inform us a Mr. Williams of Stockbridge and 
Saml. Sewall are nominated as the successors of Sedgwick and 
Goodhue, and I am told that Sewall will probably be carried. In- 
deed the present temper of the people is extremely favorable to 
the choice of good men. If poor old Gorham had not gone off,

I incline to the opinion that he might probably have been elected 
Senator, but I am well persuaded that no man of doubtful poli- 
tics cou'd possibly have obtained the appointment. Several of 
the Gentlemen of that description very prudently declined being 
considered as candidates. 

I was ready enough to anticipate the troubles of which you 
speak in a prophetic spirit, but on the whole there is no appear- 
ance that our serenity will be disturbed this season. Every thing 
without doors looks well, and if Wolcott cou'd only have a mo- 
ment's use of the desideratum of the alchymists, every thing 
would go well. The cursed intrigues engendered by Americans 
at Paris and by Frenchmen in America have occasioned some 
anxiety among many lovers of our Country, but these projects 
are evidently failing, and it may be hoped that the time is not 
very distant when the cares of our Allies may be more confined 
to their domestic concerns. . . . 

Truly your affectte. friend 

George Cabot. 



CHAPTER VI. 

Mr. King having been appointed Ambassador to England starts on his Mission 
— Responsibilities of a Minister at that Time, from Difficulty of communi- 
cating with his Government — Often obliged to act at once withou,t waiting 
for new Instructions — Mr. Jay's Course in England left good Impressions 
for his Successor, which Mr. King was qualified and took pains to continue 
— His Arrival and Settlement in London. 

We have seen in the correspondence which has been pre- 
sented, that Mr. King, after continuous service in the councils 
of the nation for a period of twelve years, the last seven of 
which had been in the Senate, as a member from the State 
of New York, had determined to resign his position, having 
said in a letter to Hamilton, " You must know that I am not 
a little tired with this separation from my family and drudgery 
in the Senate." 

During these years he had borne an active and intelligent 
part in perfecting the various measures adopted for the 
inauguration of the new government, his experience in the 
old Confederation eminently qualifying him to assist in put- 
ting into operation the new Constitution, in the formation 
of which he had been so prominent an agent. The different 
departments through which it was to operate, and the wise 
principles upon which, through the guidance and moulding 
hand of Hamilton, the financial affairs were to be conducted, 
had been firmly established, and the first steps had been 
taken to determine our relations with foreign countries by 
the commercial treaty with Great Britain. The government 
was still embarrassed by a faction at home which seemed to 

68 



1796] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 69 

be anxious to engraft upon the nation the wild schemes of 
French democracy and manifested a consequent hatred 
against England, due partly to her unwillingness or delay to 
fulfil her obligations under the treaty of peace. They con- 
sidered the new treaty, as did the French Government, 
inimical to France, which used it as a ground for outrages 
upon our commerce and even for breaking off diplomatic 
relations. 

There was much excuse for the dissatisfaction with 
England, because of her conduct towards us ; for she too 
obstructed our commerce, especially with the West Indies, 
capturing American vessels and condemning them in the 
colonial courts, impressing seamen from our ships, and re- 
taining her hold upon the forts on the western frontier, which 
she had agreed to surrender by the treaty of peace. A 
large number of the friends of the government and who had 
no great sympathy with France, was influenced by these con- 
siderations to demand from England a redress for the wrongs 
inflicted upon us, and could only be satisfied by the appoint- 
ment of a minister to continue the negotiations who not 
only possessed a thorough knowledge of the history of his 
own country, was conversant with her resources and needs, 
understood the genius and character of her people, but was 
at the same time prudent, clear-headed, and intelligent, and 
thus able to cope with the practised statesmen of England, 
to present his country's claims with courtesy, tact, and firm- 
ness, and to render himself acceptable to the Court to which 
he was to be accredited. 

The President could not but feel the responsibility that 
rested upon him, and, moved by the suggestion of Mr. Ham- 
ilton, was inclined to select Mr. King for the post. He 
hesitated, however, not because he had a doubt of his fitness 
for it, but that he feared, from " what has been said of his 
political sentiments with respect to another form of govern- 
ment . . . the interpretation which would be given to 
the nomination of him." His doubts were dispelled by the 



70 RUFUS KING. [!79 6 



letter of Mr. Hamilton, who said that such considerations 
should have no weight against his well known character. 
Mr. King then received the appointment of Ambassador and 
Minister Plenipotentiary to Great Britain, resigned his seat 
in the Senate, and began at once to make the needful prep- 
arations to start upon his mission. 

He was at this time in the prime of life,* a man among 
men, of athletic form and graceful carriage, handsome of 
feature, as represented by Trumbull in his portrait of him, 
and dignified and courteous in address. His mind was well 
stored, conversant with the literature of ancient and modern 
times, which was always at his command whether in conver- 
sation or in debate. For twelve years he had mingled freely 
with the leading men of his own country, taking a large share 
of the burden which had made the nation what it was, and 
so accustomed to deal with the large questions which daily 
arise in the domestic and foreign affairs, which are the busi- 
ness of the nation, that he felt full confidence in himself in 
the new position to which he was called, and believed that 
he might do good service for his country and promote its 
welfare. 

It may be here remarked that the responsibility of a foreign 
minister in the times which are now being considered, was 
far different from that in the present day, when instantaneous 
communication may be had between a minister and his gov- 
ernment, and information sent to him at once to meet any 
modifications of the instructions given him, in order to meet 
new aspects of a question. During the period of Mr. King's 
mission and long afterwards a minister could rely only upon 

*Mr. William Sullivan, in the Public Men of the Revolution, p. 59, gives 
us his reminiscences of Mr. King in 1788, a few years before this : 

" Rufus King at this time was about thirty-three years of age. He was 
an uncommonly handsome man in face and form ; he had a powerful mind, 
well cultivated and was a dignified and graceful speaker. He had the appear- 
ance of one who was a gentleman by nature and had well improved all her 
gifts. It is a rare occurrence to see a finer assemblage of personal and intel- 
lectual qualities cultivated to best effect than were seen in that gentleman." 



1796] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. J I 

general instructions, which could not provide for the rapidly 
changing events which, at that time, arose in the entangled 
affairs of Europe, requiring his immediate decision and 
action. He was often for months unable to exchange views 
with his government, and was compelled to act upon his 
own responsibility and judgment where delay or hesitation 
would have been prejudicial to his country's interest.* 

It is, therefore, an evidence of the wisdom of Mr. King's 
appointment, that although his residence in England con- 
tinued eight years, under Washington, Adams, and, two of 

* Mr. Pickering, Sec'y of State, on the 27th July, 1796, says to Mr. King 
that as many questions have occurred and will continue to arise, in Mr. Bayard's 
agency for appeals and claims in behalf of American citizens, some of law and 
some of policy or expediency, the decision of which by reference to his depart- 
ment would cause delays and might be less depended upon than the legal opin- 
ions of the official American gentlemen on the spot — " I mean you, Mr. Gore 
and Mr. William Pinckney," he "has instructed Mr. Bayard to consult with 
the Commissioners (Mr. Gore and Mr. Pinckney) as to the measures he should 
adopt. With regard to questions of Policy or Expediency, those also can for 
the most part be best decided in the same manner. To postpone decisions of 
measures proper to be adopted, till advice can be sent and answers returned 
from hence, would generally be injurious by the delay, and often, probably, 
incur the loss of advantages to be secured only by prompt determinations. In 
great and extraordinary occasions, where the sanction of the President will be 
previously necessary, should any such occur, the delay will be unavoidable ; in 
others you and the Commissioners will know when you may advise a proceed- 
ing, on a fair presumption of his approbation." 

An extract from a letter of R. King, Jan'y 14, 1798, to the Secretary of 
State, shows that he felt the responsibility resting upon him, owing to the time 
which must elapse before he could receive instructions to meet new conditions 
constantly arising and requiring immediate attention and prompt decisions. 
" I shall consider this subject with attention and will exercise a discretion that 
the exigency seems to demand. It would certainly be more agreeable to me to 
have it in my power on all occasions, and especially on those of the highest 
moment, to find my duty in observing the well considered instructions of the 
President. But there sometimes occur, and more frequently at this period, 
than formerly, events so wholly unlooked for, that the subordinate agents of a 
nation may be called upon to act always with a sound and prudent discretion, 
in cases the decision of which belong to the highest department of the Govern- 
ment. While on the one hand I shall regret the existence of the occasion, I 
shall not hesitate on the other to do what, under its peculiar circumstance, shall 
appear to my judgment to be necessary to promote the national welfare." 



72 RUFUS KING. [1796 

them, under Jefferson, we find no instance in which he did 
not show a clear understanding of the questions under con- 
sideration, a large and comprehensive foresight, and a firm 
yet courteous presentation of the views of his government, 
winning at the same time the confidence of the different 
ministers with whom he had to deal in Great Britain ; nor 
was his action ever Overruled, nor its wisdom denied by his 
government at home. Indeed there is abundant evidence 
that his residence in London, surrounded as he was there, 
and intimate with the leading statesmen of the world, was 
used by him to raise the new country to a position of respect 
in the eyes of Europe, and to claim from other nations the 
consideration due to a power which knew its rights and was 
determined to maintain independence and firmness in dealing 
with them. He was but following the example of Mr. Jay, 
who, he said, had already laid the foundations for such 
respectful consideration.* 

Having received his instructions, Mr. King sailed on June 
20, 1796, from New York in the ship James, Conckling mas- 
ter, both American. The vessel " took neither contraband 
of war nor enemy's goods " and sailed directly to London, 
where he arrived on the 23d of July, as he wrote to Mr. 
Low on August 1st,

wholly engaged since my arrival in those employments, which are 
usual on like occasions " ; and on August 16th : " We do not yet 
feel ourselves settled, and when you see my friend the Judge, tell 
him, I find here no such house as I left in New York." 

His family at this time consisted of his wife and four boys, 
the eldest eight years old, and his youngest brother Cyrus 
as his secretary. He was particularly attached to this 
brother, who had been carefully educated by him, was at the 
time preparing to enter the bar, and had given strong evi- 
dence of the high ability, which, in his subsequent career, 
made him a prominent man in the councils of the nation. It 
may here be said that he remained in London about a year, 
profiting in many ways by his association with his brother, 
and then returned to America to resume his studies. 

There is little doubt that Mr. King's arrangements were 
much facilitated by his friends Mr. C. Gore and his wife, who 
had preceded him to England, the former as one of the Com- 
missioners under the 7th article of the treaty with England. 
A house was taken at first at 18 Baker Street, where he re- 
mained some time ; but by the beginning of the next year 
we find him established in Great Cumberland place, his resi- 
dence during the time he passed in England. Through his 
friends, Mr. Richard Codman and Mr. J. Pitcairn, he pur- 
chased much of the china and glass for his table in Paris, as 
well as the French wines for his use, and thus began to pre- 
pare to take the place in social life which his own merits and 
his position as Ambassador Extraordinary and Minister 
Plenipotentiary of the United States entitled him to hold. 
It may here be mentioned that he soon found that the pay 
he received from the Government would not enable him to 
meet the demands upon him, and his correspondence with 
his friend and agent in New York, Mr. N. Low, shows that 
he was obliged to draw upon his private funds, which were 
ample for all his wishes. His letters, which follow, to Mr. 
J. Q. Adams and Col. Monroe show his kindly feelings to 
those who were in the diplomatic service of his country

Mr. Hall informs me is perfectly safe, I send you a letter from

Wm. Strickland to R. King. 

York, July 29, 1796. 
Dear Sir : 

I have this day received an account of your arrival in England 
& take the liberty of congratulating you on the occasion. 

The minds of each of our countries have for some time wished 
in your hands the appointment you now hold but despaired of 
seeing it accomplished, apprehensive that your presence would 
be too valuable in your own country for it to be there dispensed 
with ; fortunately it has proved otherwise and I am satisfied to 
the mutual advantage of our kindred countries. 

I have much pleasure in the thoughts of renewing in this coun- 
try an acquaintance commenced with so much satisfaction to my- 
self on the other side of the Atlantic ; & shall therefore take the 
earliest opportunity of paying my respects to you whenever I 
come to London, but which I fear will not be before the next 
Spring, having left it not more than six weeks since. You will 
no doubt, while here, endeavour to see as much of the country as 
you can ; this I must strongly recommend to every one from the 
United States, who knows how to turn the many new objects he

Minister to Berlin.

would meet with to the benefit of his own country ; the Metropo- 
lis is the seat of pleasure & of Politics, but a just estimate of this 
country can only be formed by visiting the interior of it ; & there 
only can observation be made useful in numberless instances to 
the circumstances of America. Should you visit this place or the 
neighbourhood of it, before I have the pleasure of seeing you, be 
assured of my possessing the inclination to be of every service to 
you in my power & to assist you in obtaining the object of your 
researches or acquiring the information you may wish for ; it is 
the slightest return I can make for innumerable attentions re- 
ceived in your country & for the liberal and friendly reception I 
everywhere experienced & always acknowledge with pleasure. 

I shall be happy to hear that you have had a pleasant voyage

R. King to Col. Monroe, Paris. 

London, August 1, 1796. 
Dear Sir : 

Mr. Pinckney having desired to return home, I arrived here a 
few days ago to relieve him. We sailed from New York on the 
20th of June, but as your information through our countrymen, 
who are so frequently arriving from America, is probably as 
late or later I presume that I can tell you nothing new or inter- 
esting. . . . 

I shall be happy to hear from you, and beg you to be assured 
that it will afford me peculiar pleasure to render you any service 
that my situation in this country will permit. . . .

Mr. King enters upon his Duties as Ambassador — Presentation to the King — 
First Interview with Lord Grenville — Statement by Dr. Edwards of the 
Condition of Affairs in France — Appointment of Col. Trumbull as the 
fifth Commissioner under 7th Article of the Treaty — Mr. Monroe's

Pretensions. 

Mr. King in the following letter announces to the Secre- 
tary of State his arrival in London, his reception by the 
King, and his first interview with Lord Grenville : 

R. King to Secretary of State. 

London, August 10, 1796. 
Dear Sir : 

I arrived here on the 23d ultimo ; the King was in the course 
of a few days to go to Weymouth, where he spends the remainder 
of the summer. Finding it to be the desire of Mr. Pinckney that 
I should enter on my office without delay, I was in the course of 
the week that followed my arrival presented to the King and 
Queen. 

My reception being in the usual manner, nothing occurred on 
the occasion that merits particular attention ; the King expressed 
his satisfaction with the prospect of a lasting friendship and 
harmony between the two countries, declared that he sincerely 
desired to live in friendship with the United States and that he 
would execute with the most scrupulous good faith the Treaty 
lately concluded with them. 

Tho' this is a season when public men in this country consider 
themselves entitled to some relaxation from business, and most

of them are in the country not much disposed to be interrupted, 
yet I thought some parts of my instructions were so important and 
interesting, that I ought not to delay requesting a conference with 
Lord Grenville respecting them. I accordingly wrote him a note 
on the eighth instant, requesting him to appoint a time when I 
should wait on him for the purpose of making certain communi- 
cations to him, relating as well to the suspended portions of the 
late Treaty, as to some other points that are mentioned in my 
instructions. He appointed the next day for the interview, when 
I communicated to him in a concise manner our ideas respecting 
the points * of our conference. He heard me with attention, ex- 
pressed the desire of this government to preserve harmony and 
good understanding with us, and said that as these were points of 
much consequence to their commerce and marine, he would 
faithfully state what I had said to his colleagues, with whom a 
conference would be requisite preparatory to any reply. The 
object of the meeting was to begin, and to make the principal 
points contained in my instructions. Speaking respecting the 
care of our Seamen, Lord Grenville expressed a wish that some 
notice had been given of our intention to send an agent for their 
protection to their West India Colonies ; observing that the Gov- 
ernors of those colonies were not authorized to allow the resi- 
dence of such a character, and that without instructions they 
might perhaps refuse to admit Mr. Talbot, an event, he said, that 
might excite unpleasant feelings on our part. I explained the 
course of this measure, and urged the importance of our having 
an agent in that quarter ; intimating at the same time that an im- 
mediate instruction for Mr. Talbot's admission might arrive in 
season to prevent any disappointment to which we might other- 
wise be exposed. 

Col. Trumbull is in France ; he is expected here soon, but I 
am fearful that he will be unwilling to accept the agency for the 
protection of our seamen. This I shall regret, as from a recent 
arrangement, appplication for the discharge of our seamen, de- 
tained on board the British ships, which have formerly been 
made by our Consuls, must soon go through my hands. I 
hope to be able to prevail on Col. Trumbull to accept the ap-

pointment and continue to act until the President can appoint 
another person. . . . 

With great respect, 

R. King. 

Mr. T. Pickering, Secretary of State, in his letter of 
August 8, 1796, says to Mr. King: 

" Our Treaty with Spain was promptly ratified, and the ratified 
copy has been received here a few days since from Spain. By 
this time all the British posts must have been delivered up to the 
troops of the United States, except perhaps the remote one of 
Michilimackinac. The deliveries, so far as we have received 
intelligence have been made in the most handsome manner on 
the part of the British." 

R. King to Col. Monroe, Paris. 

London, August 11, 1796. 
Dear Sir : 

I avail myself of Mr. Tudor's visit to Paris to inform you that 

a few days since a paper was published in the English Gazettes, 

purporting to be a letter from the Directory to Mr. Barthelemi, 

in which the French government announces their intention to 

stop the cargoes of all neutral vessels bound to the English ports, 

and assigns as the cause and justification of this measure a recent 

order of the British government to stop the cargoes of all neutral 

vessels bound to French ports. Though I was not ascertained of 

the authority of this paper, yet considering its importance to our 

commerce, I applied to this government for information whether 

any such order had been issued, and I was assured in reply that 

no such order exists, and that no new order has been issued on 

this subject. I expect that it will be in my power in a day or two 

to send you a precise and formal document on this point ; in 

the meantime I could not excuse myself from giving you the 

earliest information in my power relative to a measure so truly 

afflicting, should the paper in question prove genuine. 

I am &c, 

R. King.

The following statement is in Mr. King's handwriting : 

Doctor Edwards, August 19th, 1796. 

Dr. Edwards* called on me yesterday with Mr. Pinckney, hav- 
ing arrived the day before from France — he spoke of the dissatis- 
faction towards the U. S. which was entertained by and influenced 
the Government of France — that Mr. Monroe had conducted 
with fidelity towards the U. S., that he had vindicated the 
measures of our Government, and, though he did not like the 
Treaty, that he had contended that in no respect it violated our 
Treaty with France — that the Government there were elevated 
with their successes, and said though we might not have broken the 
Treaty, that nevertheless by the late Treaty with England, we 
had broken our Friendship with France — that the late order for 
stopping neutral vessels was aimed in a great measure against 
England — that however they were disposed to treat us not as an 

* Through the assistance of Mr. F. D. Stone, Librarian of the Pennsylvania 
Historical Society, the editor has been enabled to identify Dr. Edwards with 
Dr. Evan Edwards, of Philadelphia.! He was born in 1757, and received a 
classical and medical education, was an earnest participant in the Revolution- 
ary war, and especially during the British occupation of Philadelphia, having 
been an aide to Lord Stirling. After the war he held many important posi- 
tions in Pennsylvania, and was a Judge from 1791 to the time of his death 
in 1802. 

Frenno's Gazette is quoted, saying : 

"He possessed talents which eminently qualified him for a public station, 
a sound understanding, good sense improved by habits of reading and reflec- 
tion, an intimate knowledge of mankind, incorruptible integrity with popular 
and engaging manners. . . . His affable and amiable manners and cheer- 
ful conversation . . . procured him the esteem and good-will of all who 
conversed with him." Mr. Charles Biddle, in his Autobiography, p. 309, gives 
an interesting account of him. He was very sick in Paris, and spoke in the 
warmest terms of the kindness of those who cared for him, wondering how 
these people — French — could "be guilty of crimes so disgraceful to human 
nature. It has often been said that Mr. Monroe encouraged Thomas Paine 
to write the infamous letter he sent to Genl. Washington. The Doctor often 
told me that Monroe sent him to Paris, and did everything in his power to pre- 
vent his sending or publishing that letter. Paine told him that anything Mr. 
Monroe wrote, it was of no consequence whether it was suppressed or not, but 
what he wrote was for posterity."

Enemy but as a Nation who had shown a Preference for their 
rival & Enemy — I met Dr. Edwards in the city to day and walked 
home with him — the Temper of France towards our Country was 
again the Topic of conversation. He said T. Paine had been 
writing a Book agt. the President — that Monroe, while T. P. was 
in his House, expressed his disapprobation of the measure, and 
that Paine immediately removed to other Quarters — that the work 
was very abusive, — he had seen it, and a young Virginian who 
came over with him from Havre had the Copy, which he was 
charged to deliver to Bache for Publication — that in a conversa- 
tion he had with the Members of the Directory, speaking of their 
sentiments respecting America, he attributed all the circumstances 
of coldness and caution respecting which they complained, to the 
operations of Genet ; Reubell replies that undoubtedly there was 
the first Error ; but Barras said perhaps it was to be regretted 
that Genet had been recalled — that Monroe had been much re- 
spected — that he was believed to be honest, frank, and a zealous 
friend of the French ; that for a Time he rec'd marks of Prefer- 
ence and Distinction, but that latterly such was the temper 
towards us, that his situation was less agreeable — that at a Dinner 
given by La Croix to the foreign Ministers, he gave out, turning to 
Del Campo (of Spain) our new ally, and to the Prussian ambassa- 
dor, our old and faithful ally, that Monroe suspected T. Paine of 
having done him an injury with the Directory — that he was there- 
fore on bad terms with Paine ; that La Croix expressing his Dis- 
approbation with us observed, that they had no intention of treat- 
ing us as an Enemy ; once he said they had resolved to send an 
Envoy Extray. to demand certain explanations, and, in case they 
were not satisfactory, to immediately withdraw — that this Project 
was abandoned, and they had resolved to permit their resident 
Minister Adet to return home, and to leave with us a Charge des 
Affaires to take care of their People and Concerns in our 
Country. 

Doct. Edwards mentioned various circumstances to shew the 
haughtiness of the French, flushed as they were with Victory — the 
refusal of the Swedish Charge des Affaires, the sending away the 
Tuscan Minister, and the language they held on the subject of 
peace and particularly of a Peace with England — he said that 
Monroe had been made uneasy with the declar'on of a Character 



1796] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 8 1 

supposed to be confidential, or employed by Reubell of the 
Directory — who lately intimated to Monroe, that the Directory 
had been deceived by his Representations of the Temper & 
Dispositions of our Country — that Monroe suspected T. Paine, 
with having been the source of the Information that had led the 
Directory to doubt his Representations, that he had applied to 
Reubell and his Colleagues on the Subject, and asked whether T. 
Paine had given them Information contradictory to the Repre- 
sentations — that he had not been perfectly satisfied on this Point 
— that in conversation concerning their temper towards us he had 
said that it would disserve them, that every country has its Par- 
ties, that this was the case in America — that the Friends of France 
must be silent, or join those of England, if France persisted in an 
unfriendly conduct towards us 

After a desultory conversation on these points — he spoke of 
Monroe having formerly been much influenced by Hichbon ; 
that he had finally suspected & thrown him off — that Hichbon 
spoke of the corrupt Character of some of his countrymen, and 
of the application of English Money to procure an influence in 
America, that he himself had been Offered a Bribe & that the 
Money and Offer came from Lord Dorchester. 

That Monroe was made uneasy by a Report that his political 
Opponents were combining to Effect his Recall — that he hated 
Jay & Hamilton, especially the former, concerning whom he told 
a story of his having very soon after Monroe coming into Con- 
gress, in a private conversation attempted to engage him to con- 
cur in a Proposal of appointing a committee of Congress to 
instruct him Jay respecting the negotiation of the sp. treaty ; 
the Object of wh. was to shut up, as Monroe supposes, the Missis- 
sippi — that he from that moment suspected Jay's integrity & 
Patriotism — -that he made a memorandum of the overture in his 
Diary, and showed it to Henry Lee who would now recollect 
it— &c. &c— 

Dr. Edward's idea respecting the Order agt. the neutral com- 
merce seemed to be this — the Commerce of Amer. centres in G. 
B. — it is of immense consequence to that nation — Fr. cannot 
affect G. B. in any way but by assailing her commerce — if she can 
shut her out from the various Ports of Europe she will severely 
wound her — if she can moreover embarrass her Commerce with 

VOL II. — 6 



82 RUFUS KING. [1796 

America, she may do her a still greater injury — The order there- 
for is more aimed against G. B. than America &c. &c. Speaking 
of the President he said he was truly unpopular in France — that 
the conduct of G. Morris had paved the way to his unpopularity 
— that when G. M. was recalled, Monroe carried him a private 
Letter from the President, which was delivered to Morris at a 
Dinner where there was much Company, and several Members of 
the Government — that G. M. publickly read the Letter in which 
the President told him that his recall arose from no dissatisfaction 
that he had with his Conduct — but because the french Govt, had 
requested it — that besides, the Directory had a letter from the 
Pr. to G. M. which had been intercepted, and wh. was written 
after the Ratification of the Treaty with England, in which he 
says " so desirous have we been to preserve our Neutrality and 
remain at Peace, that though he disapproved of some parts of the 
Treaty he had ratified it — that he hoped this conduct would have 
its Effect in procuring to us the friendship of England, and he 
wished G. M. to let Lord Grenville know his Opinions in this 
respect." 

August 30th, 1796. 

Mr. Pinckney told me that conversing with Doctr. Edwards, he 
told him that inasmuch as he did not on his way through France 
to Spain, solicit the aid of the french Government in the negotia- 
tion with Spain, they had revoked an instruction which had been 
given to their Minister at Madrid to facilitate our wishes — that 
they were displeased with the Treaty and said that it sacrificed 
their Interest — Mr. Pinckney said he did not ask the interference 
of France, because he supposed them displeased with our having 
concluded a Treaty with England.

August 16, 1796. 

We do not yet feel ourselves settled and when you see our 
friend the Judge, tell him, I find here no such house as I left in

can form no conjectures that are entitled to any consideration. . .

By a letter of the 24th of July from Paris, I am informed that our 
fellow citizens so long held in captivity at Algiers have been 
released and have arrived at Marseilles : through the same 
channel we learn that the American Schooner Eliza captured by 
the Tunissians has been given up. Mr. Barber employed for that 
purpose by Col. Humphries having effected a treaty with the Bey, 
previous to her capture.

R. King to A. Hamilton. * 

London, August 25, 1796. 
Dear Sir : 

It would have been agreeable to this government, if we could 
have agreed to the appointment of Doctor Swabey as the Commis- 
sioner ; he is really a very candid and honorable man. But for 
the same reason that we could not satisfy the Commissioners on 
the part of Great Britain with the appointment of our country- 
man, Colonel Trumbull, an equally candid and honorable 
character, they have been unable to convince us, that under all 
circumstances, it would be advisable that we should accept Doctor 
Swabey. 

The utmost propriety of conduct has been shown on both sides ; 
and out of several names proposed by each, the British Commis- 
sioners selected Colonel Trumbull, and our Commissioners Doctor 
Swabey, as the names to be put in the urn. The lot has decided 
in our favor, and Colonel Trumbull, who is on the spot, is the 
fifth Commissioner. \ The Board being now complete, will pro- 
ceed to business without unnecessary delay. 

Knowing the immense importance of this Commission to our 
Commerce and navigation, I take the earliest opportunity to give

f In the treaty with Great Britain, negotiated by Mr. Jay, two of the Articles 
provided for the adjustment of claims by private individuals against the two 
Governments, the sixth Article for claims preferred by Englishmen against the 
United States, and the seventh, by American citizens against England. The 
claims were to be adjusted by five Commissioners under each Article, two of each 
set to be chosen by the respective Governments and the fifth by lot cast by the 
four. Those under the sixth Article were to sit in Philadelphia, those under

you this information. The surrender of the posts which has 
taken place, and the very explicit assurances that I have received 
from the highest authority in that nation, of a resolution to carry 
into effect the treaty, with the most scrupulous fidelity, make me 
anxious that nothing should take place on our part, that would 
furnish even a pretence, much less a justification, for arresting 
the further and complete execution of the treaty. The very ex- 
traordinary situation of Europe at this moment, should inspire 
us with great caution, and those whose property depends on the 
treaties being permitted to go into full effect, should feel and be 
influenced by this reflection. Farewell, &c. 



T. Pickering to R. King. 

Department of State, Aug. 29, 1796. 
Dear Sir : 

I beg your care to transmit the inclosed Letter to Mr. Monroe. 
The object of it is to inform him of his recall, of which it is de- 
sirable to give him notice, prior to the arrival of his successor. 
Mr. Monroe's own communications in February and March last 
laid the foundation of his recall. They manifested the great un- 
easiness existing in the French government in relation to the 
United States, especially on account of the Treaty with Great 
Britain. His former letters had predicted this consequence of 
the Treaty ; and the good reception of Mr. Fauchet, who left this 
country with strong prejudices against it, was likely to aggravate 
every cause, real or imaginary, of dissatisfaction on the part of 
France. The necessity of obviating complaints, of stating facts, 
of explaining the conduct and declaring the principles of the 
American government had been apparent ; and for these pur- 
poses Mr. Monroe had been amply furnished with documents, the 
last of which he acknowledged, in his letter of December 6, 1795, 

the seventh, in London. The Commissioners under the sixth Article were 
Thomas Fitzsimons, and James Innes, who died, Samuel Sitgreaves being ap- 
pointed in his place, Americans, and Thomas McDonald and Henry Pye Rich, 
with John Guillemard, the fifth, Englishmen. Those under the seventh Arti- 
cle were Christopher Gore and William Pinkney, Americans, and John Nickoll 
and James Anstey, afterwards Maurice Swabey, Englishmen — John Trum- 
bull being the fifth. The history of these Commissions will appear in the 
correspondence. 



1796] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 85 

that he had received. Yet he appears to have been perfectly- 
silent, until on the 15th of February last he was alarmed by a 
project of the Directory, announced to him by the Minister, M. 
De La Croix, to send an Envoy Extraordinary to this Country. 
This he endeavoured to prevent and manifested his readiness to 
vindicate his Government. He had an audience of the Directory ; 
and the project was suspended to give an opportunity to receive 
their complaints and make his answer. The result was not re- 
ceived here until the 18th July, in a letter from Mr. Monroe, 
dated the 2d of May. But this only covered M. De La Croix's 
statement of complaints and Mr. Monroe's answer ; the effect of 
the latter remained to be learnt. The objections made were 
feeble and perhaps we may hear no more of them. But the dis- 
satisfaction and uneasiness produced by Mr. Monroe's Letters of 
February and March, concurring with divers other causes, had 
determined the President early in July to recall him. The Presi- 
dent immediately wrote to General Pinckney, requesting him to 
accept the mission to Paris. He has accepted ; and is daily 
expected here from Charleston. 



R. King to the Secretary of State. * 

Sept. 8. 1796. 
Dear Sir : 

Mr. Trumbull's appointment as the fifth Commissioner in the 

capture question has prevented his acceptance of the agency for 

the relief and protection of our seamen. His duties must devolve 

on me for the present ; and, I hope by a careful attention to the 

cases that shall come to my knowledge assisted by the several 

Consuls, whose vigilance on this subject is great and meritorious, 

that I shall be able to relieve many of our countrymen from the 

hardships and injustice to which they continue to be exposed. If 

I shall find occasional aid requisite for the purpose of extricating 

any of our seamen detained on board the British Ships of War, I

shall not hesitate to compensate the persons I may employ out of 
the money destined for this Service. 

A practice has prevailed among our Consuls to grant Certifi- 
cates of Citizenship, or Protections as they are called, to our 
seamen and I am informed that they have been efficacious in 
securing those who possessed them from Impressment. Some 
abuses are unavoidable, and it is said have been discovered ; in 
consequence of which these consular Certificates have in some 
instances been disregarded, and in a late conference with Lord 
Grenville, he asked me whether our Laws, or the President's In- 
structions gave to our consuls authority to grant these certifi- 
cates ; observing that it was not within the ordinary Functions 
of Consuls to issue Documents of this nature. Perceiving the 
importance of this enquiry, I told his Lordship that I would 
enquire concerning the authority of our Consuls, & give him an 
answer as soon as I should have obtained satisfactory informa- 
tion respecting it. The Fees taken for these Certificates may 
have some influence in rendering the Consuls less critical than 
would be proper in the examination of Evidence ; but no com- 
plaint of this nature has been made, and as the Practice of 
granting these Certificates is not peculiar to our Consuls, but 
common with the consuls of other nations, and our Sailors are 
frequently found here without a certificate of citizenship, whereby 
they are exposed to impressment, I cannot take upon myself to 
instruct the Consuls to discontinue the practice, though I should 
find no positive law or instruction that authorizes it. 

With perfect respect &c.

and given notice that he should probably draw for the whole of 
that sum, Mess. Barings after sending me a statement explaining 
the probable deficiency of the public money in their hands, a 
copy of which is enclosed, asked my opinion whether they should 
pay Donaldson's drafts for a greater sum than the estimated 
amount of the public money in their hands. They manifested 
no disinclination to make the advance should it be requisite, but 
desired advice. As Col. Humphries is fully empowered on this 
subject and has authorized Donaldson to draw, I told Mess. 
Barings that I thought it adviseable that they should pay Donald- 
son's drafts, adding that I was convinced their conduct would be 
approved and the advance w r hich they might make faithfully re- 
imbursed by the U. S. They will pay the drafts should they 
exceed the funds appropriated for this object ; I mean the amount 
of their sales added to the estimated value of the unsold stock in 
their hands. 

I intimated to Sir Francis Baring a wish that the sale of the 
residue of the stock might not be forced, especially at a time of 
such general depression in the prices of all Funds. I understood 
him that they could without inconvenience make the requisite 
advance and that the 6 pr. cents unsold would not be sold under 
90 for 100, without consulting you on the subject. I hope the 
Algerine Treaty may finally be effected, though hitherto it has 
been attended with a series of disasters. The low price of Stocks 
here and the high price of dollars at Leghorn make the present 
operation a very unfavorable one. 

Though it is no relief, it is an argument against bad manage- 
ment to know that great embarrassments accompany all money 
operations at this period. Even here great difficulties are en- 
countered and burthensome terms submitted to to make their loans. 

Farewell yrs. very truly & sincerely

Algiers, concluded on the 5th September, 1795, a treaty of peace with the Dey, 
by which a payment of about 800,000 dollars was to be made in cash, besides an 
annual tribute, and goods to the value of $24,000 a year. The treaty was rati- 
fied by the United States and the money had to be borrowed by a sale of bonds 
for $800,000 through the Messrs. Barings in London. The allusions in this 
letter and in several others refer to this transaction. Before the Dey was 
satisfied, an agreement was made to give him a frigate and more money. — Ed.

written to Mr. King a letter stating his services to the 
United States, that he had been made a member of the 
Cincinnati, that he proposed returning to the United States, 
and asking him certain questions based upon these state- 
ments, was answered as follows : 

R. King to Le Cte. de la Prade. 

London, Sep. 18, 1796. 
Sir: 

I have reed, the letter you did me the honor to write to me on 
the 17th instant, and regret that my answers to your enquiries will 
be less satisfactory and agreeable to you, than I could wish them. 
The members of the Society of Cincinnatus do not receive any 
pensions from the U. S. ; indeed no person is allowed a pension 
except such officers and soldiers as are disabled by wounds re- 
ceived in war. The Military Establishment of the U. S. has 
always been small & since the peace lately made with the Sav- 
ages, this establishment has been made less ; so that no vacancies 
exist either in the infantry or cavalry. The U. S. have lands for 
sale, and at moderate prices ; but they do not grant any lands 
gratuitously ; neither do they supply or defray the Expenses of 
Passages to foreigners inclined to become American Citizens.

London Sept. ioth, 1796. 
Dear Sir : 

I received this morning a letter from Mr. Monroe, dated Paris, 
August 28th, of which the following is an extract : 

" As soon as the order of this government, as notified by the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs to Barthelemi, the present ambassa- 
dor at Basle, appeared in the papers, for it was never notified to 
the foreign Ministers here, I applied for information whether 
orders were issued for the seizure of neutral vessels, stating 
equally as the motive of my application a report, apparently well 
authenticated, that one of our vessels had been lately taken near 
our own coast ; and was informed, that no such order was issued, 
and further, that none such could be, in case the British did not 
seize our vessels. I am happy to give you this information, be- 
cause I flatter myself the knowledge of this fact may be useful 
in respect to our commerce with the country in which you reside.

90 RUFUS KING. [1796 

I have in a former letter told you that the British government 
deny that any order has been lately issued, or that any order ex- 
ists, authorizing the seizure of neutral cargoes bound to the 
French ports, as was alleged to be the case in the letter from 
the French Minister of Foreign Affairs to Barthelemi." 

The foregoing extract is all I know from Mr. Monroe respect- 
ing the resolution of the French government, communicated by 
their Minister of Foreign Affairs to their ambassador at Basle, 
you will have seen the letter to Barthelemi, which is undoubtedly 
authentic ; and you have now what Mr. Monroe reports as the 
result of his application on the subject ; I make no comments 
nor inferences. You have the materials, and can make your own 
interpretations. 

Very sincerely yours 

Rufus King. 

This same extract was communicated to the Secretary of 
State, and is referred to in his letter of Oct. 26, 1796, to 
Mr. King. 

T. Pickering to R. King. 

Department of State, Sep. 22, 1796. 
Dear Sir : 

In this letter relative to complaints of injuries and insults from 
the British Naval officers, and a fresh one, of which he encloses 
affidavits and protests, Mr. P. says " It must be painful to you 
to receive such repeated complaints of this kind, and unpleas- 
ant to lay them before the British ministers ; but their number and 
frequency may serve to rouse them to some exertion to prevent 
a continuance of such outrages, while a few solitary instances 
might be passed over in silence . . . You will make such use 
of information of the kind here presented as you shall think most 
likely to produce a remedy for the evil. ..." 



John Lawrance to R. King, London. 

New York, Sept. 24, 1796. 
My Dear Sir : 

We have heard of your arrival, and having had a closet audi- 
ence. . . . Nothing material has happened, relative to your 



1796] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 9 1 

Friends here, since your departure, or on political matters ; ex- 
cept the address of the President, who declines another election. 
His address contains very good advice, and, if followed, will 
make our Country a great and happy one. Indeed we enjoy 
peculiar felicity at present, and every day adds to our prosperity. 
It is said Mr. Adams and Mr. Pinckney will be voted for on one 
side ; on the other Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Burr are mentioned. 
You can determine as well as myself, who, it is probable, will be 
the successful persons. We are all well. Mrs. Lawrance joins 
me in best wishes for Mrs. King's health, and all with you. 

Yours very truly, 

John Lawrance. 

George Cabot to R. King, London. 

Brookline, Sept. 24, 1796. 
My Dear Sir : 

The public papers announced to us the day before yesterday 
your safe arrival in England and your presentation at Court. . . . 

A Mr. Maund of Virginia who is here and seems to be well in- 
formed is very confident that Patrick Henry will come into the 
Senate in Mason's place at the next election. He also strengthens 
our hope that a strong party is formed in that State in favor of 
government, & which in future will be active. You will see by 
the newspapers that Mr. Adet was yesterday entertained at Con- 
cert Hall ; altho' he associates with Jacobins only, yet the friends 
of order were the promoters of this measure. As I go to town 
scarcely once in a month, I was not apprized of the intention of 
our friends until it was in execution ; but I was extremely morti- 
fied to see this sort of testimonial in favor of french politics given 
by the best citizens, when it is known that the undue influence of 
that nation among the people already endangers the union and 
government of the U. S. I wish Mr. Adet to receive all the indi- 
vidual attentions which hospitality can require, but I consider Ox 
Feasts as acts of supererrogation and as tending to confirm in the 
minds of the people erroneous opinions, which are extremely 
mischievous. 

A few days ago Mr. Liancourt assured me that as soon as the 
french had subdued the Emperor and given peace to Germany? 



92 RUFUS KING. [1796 

they intended to cut up the roots of the british power (their com- 
merce and manufactures). He says they are resolved " that all 
ships of whatever nation wheresoever from, or whithersoever 
bound, having on board any of the products or manufactures of 
the british dominions, shall be captured, and such product or 
manufacture (at least, if not the vessel) confiscated." I told 
him such an outrage on the rights of nations wou'd render the 
french universally detested & wou'd confirm to all the world, 
what many already believe, that they are animated by the most 
vindictive and daring spirit that ambition had ever engender'd. 
He acknowledged his fears that the measure wou'd be deemed 
extraordinary & that it wou'd be unjustifiable if there were any 
better way of destroying the English. This inveterate hatred of 
the English, increased by the pride of conquest is now the strong- 
est passion frenchmen feel, and if their successes continue must 
occasion serious inquietudes among the English. Is it therefore 
possible that this nation shall disdain to engage in its defence 
every auxiliary in its power ? I have always thought that the true 
policy of England wou'd be to invite every neutral nation to a 
participation of its commerce during the war, by which means her 
trade wou'd be uninterrupted, & she wou'd be enabled to man a 
navy sufficient to annihilate the marine of all her ene??iies. This 
expedient too long neglected might even now be resorted to with 
advantage. It is intimated by English emigrants in this country, 
that Mr. Pitt will find it difficult to procure money sufficient to 
maintain the contest : Is it so ? 

Your sincere & affectte. friend 

G. Cabot. 



R. King to Messrs. I. & F. Baring & Co. 

London, Oct. 6, 1796. 
Gentlemen : 

I have received with much satisfaction the information you 
have been so obliging as to give me respecting your agency in the 
application of the funds placed in your hands for Barbary pur- 
poses. And though this business exclusively belongs to Col. 
Humphries, yet as a Servant of the U. S. I think it due to the 
occasion to express to you my approbation of the liberal and 



1796] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 93 

skillful manner in which you have assisted Col. Humphries in a 
very critical operation. I have written to the Secretary of the 
Treasury on this subject and shall communicate to him the 
assurances that I have given to you of my conviction that the 
U. S. will entertain a proper sense of your Services in this Busi- 
ness and moreover make speedy dispositions to re-imburse any 
advances you shall make on this account. 

Should it finally appear requisite to advance a greater sum than 
we have heretofore thought probable, I flatter myself that you will 
be able to make such arrangements as will obviate any disap- 
pointment, which at this stage of the Business might hazard all 
that has been already done. 

Although a sale of the stock, in the present depression of the 

market, would be somewhat unpleasant in reference to the credit 

of the U. S., yet that must be done, rather than risque the refusal 

of any of the drafts which Donaldson may have negotiated in the 

course of his agency. I hope however that his drafts will not be 

found to exceed the Estimate that we have heretofore made of 

their amount. 

With perfect regard &c. 

Rufus King. 

R. King to S. Bayard, Esq. 

London, Oct. 6, 1796. 
Sir : 

I perceive by Mr. Slade's letter to you and by the papers you 
left with me some time since, that he has furnished you with the 
amount of several Bills of costs, in cases stated to have been 
finally decided in the Admiralty, and likewise that most of the 
many causes that you have confided to his care, are or soon may 
be at a stage in their progress, at which he expects a further ad- 
vance of Eighty Pounds sterling in each. As the payment of a 
single Bill will constitute a precedent for all future cases, it ap- 
pears to me proper, before such precedent is made, that the items 
and regularity of the Bill should be critically examined. I there- 
fore desire that you will receive from Mr. Slade the Bills of costs 
in such cases under his management as have been terminated, 
and that you will transmit them to me in order that I may make 
such enquiries respecting them as may be requisite. 



94 RUFUS KING. [1796 

The public money at my Disposal applicable to various objects 
does not amount to a sum sufficient to satisfy even the expecta- 
tions of a single Proctor. I have however advanced to you one 
Thousand pounds Sterling, which you will apportion among 
our Proctors according to the number of cases in their respective 
hands, having regard to the stage in which they are. These pay- 
ments should be made on account and without being applied to 
any particular cases or classes of cases. This will be productive 
of no inconvenience to the Proctors and will give time to consider 
and decide the manner in which the Business must ultimately be 
conducted. 

No precise understanding exists on the subject of the Ex- 
penses which attend the prosecution of the claims of our citi- 
zens in the Courts of Admiralty. In most instances the public 
have, & will probably continue to advance the money that may 
be requisite. Though under all circumstances such advances may 
be reasonable, it appears to me just, that ultimately these advances 
should be re-imbursed by the claimants. Where the costs are 
paid by the Captors, the claimants have no title to them, except to 
repay the public advances. Where the costs are charged upon the 
claimants, it must be on the principle of their delinquency ; and 
for that reason they ought to be paid by them and not by the 
public. In these cases, however, we have no means in our 
power to recover such costs ; except in the instances of a restora- 
tion of the Property claimed and a condemnation of the claim- 
ants in costs. In such cases, as well as in all cases where the 
property is restored and the captors condemned in costs, it will be 
in your power to retain sufficient to reimburse the public ad- 
vances. This I think it will be proper that you should do. 

With much esteem &c. 

Rufus King. 

R. King to Col. Monroe. 

London, Oct. 7, 1796. 
Dear Sir : 

I was extremely sorry to receive the information contained in 

your last letter, that there was reason to believe that the French 

Government has, contrary to the stipulations of our Treaty, issued 



1796] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 95 

orders to their cruizers & Corsairs to seize Enemy goods on 
board American vessels. These orders are the more extraordinary 
since they are excused by no circumstance of necessity and as 
they violate the Doctrine that free Bottoms make free Goods, at a 
period when France proclaims herself the friend of liberal com- 
merce and the advocate of the Freedom of the seas. The injury 
that the enemies of France may experience by the execution of 
these Orders will be small indeed : but the Damage and mischief 
to her Friends, and especially to the U. S. will be great and seri- 
ous. These orders furnish to private cupidity a Pretence for the 
interruption and spoliation of our Trade, which France, as 
our Friend, cannot desire to see, and which must prove ex- 
tensively mischievous to our Navigation and Commerce. I hope 
my dear Sir, that those representations that I am persuaded you 
have made, to demonstrate the impolicy and injury of this meas- 
ure, will induce the Revocation of the Orders, if they have in fact 
been issued. 

I mention to you a report which is in circulation here among 
some of our countrymen, because you may possibly hear of it, 
and think it singular that I had given you no information on the 
subject. It is for this reason only that I am induced to com- 
municate to you a Rumour that General Pinckney of S. Carolina 
has been appointed to succeed you at Paris. I have letters from 
Mr. Pickering as late as the 15th Aug., and likewise from several 
friends in different parts of America, and in no one letter have I 
the slightest intimation of General Pinckney's appointment or of a 
change being meditated in our Legation to France. Mr. Pinckney 
my predecessor, who is still here or rather on the sea side waiting 
for his ship, knows nothing of his Brother's having been ap- 
pointed and has heard only the London rumour to which I have 
alluded above. 

With Sentiments of Esteem & respect, &c, 

Rufus King. 

R. King to J. Pitcairn, Paris. 

London Oct. 9, 1796. 
Dear Sir : 

. You have been erroneously informed, when you were 

told that a portion of the debt we owed to France has been paid 



96 RUFUS KING. [1796 

in assignats. I am at a loss to conjecture to what circumstance such 
an opinion owes its origin. The instalments and interest were 
regularly paid, and in solid coin j and we made advances both to 
Mr. Genet and Mr. Fauchet byway of anticipation of future instal- 
ments, when the demands of France were pressing, and often with 
much inconvenience to ourselves. In the year 1794 Congress 
passed a Law to domesticate, if I may so say, the foreign debt, 
or so much of it as the foreign Proprietors should be willing to 
change from a foreign to a domestic debt, the annuities in which, 
and the final reimbursement whereof, should be payable at the 
Treasury of the United States. 

Under this Law in June or July 1795, Mr. Swan came forward 
with full powers from the French Government to subscribe the 
whole of the remaining instalments of the debt due to them — 
amounting to something over 2. Mills, of Dollars — and a new 
stock bearing an interest of 5J per cent, for as much as bore an in- 
terest of 5 pr. cent, and 4-J, for as much as bore an interest of 4 
p. c. was offered to Mr. Swan, who I presume has sold the same 
for cash to satisfy such engagements as he had entered into for 
the French Government. This was a measure of choice on the 
part of France. The instalments would together with the inter- 
est have been regularly paid as they fell due. France preferred 
to change this shape of the debt, for one bearing a half per cent, 
higher interest, and possessing a transferable quality— we were 
willing to make this change with respect to the French debt, as 
well as the whole foreign debt, because instead of foreign com- 
missions and expensive remittances, which would be requisite to 
discharge the annuities and reimburse the capital of the foreign 
debt, we pay both at our Treasury after it is changed to a domes- 
tic debt. It is possible that the discharge of what remained of 
the French debt in 1795, by issuing to the agent Mr. Swan 5! and 
4! per cent, certificates of stock, may be what you heard called a 
payment in assignats — but this is unfair and unfounded — We 
were bound to pay by instalments ; we did regularly pay as fast 
as pay day arrived. This was not as fast as France wanted the 
money. We then offered to change the nature of the contract ; 
to make the foreign a domestic debt and to add J percent, to the 
annuities and make the capital transferable. France had the 
option to stand to the old contract, or to change it for the new — 



1796] LIFE AND COERESFONDENCE. 97 

she preferred the latter — we have gained nothing by it. If she 
has sold this stock at a loss, we have not gained the difference. 
In short nothing can be more uncandid than to represent this 
measure adopted for the benefit of France without the least advan- 
tage to us, as a profitable or unkind proceeding on our part. I 
send you a printed statement on this subject presented to the 
House of Reps, in January last, by which you will see that our 
debt is paid off. 

I shall be happy to hear from you often, and if you think it 
prudent to give me a little news and politicks, I shall be glad to 
receive them. Make my compliments and congratulations to 
Talleyrand. 

Farewell Yrs &c. 

Rufus King. 



R. King to Lord Grenville. 

Baker Street, 10th Oct., 1796.* 

Mr. King presents his compliments to Lord Grenville, and in- 
closes for his Lordship's information a letter that he has received 
from Mr. John Haven, a citizen of the U. S. of America, stating 
the capture of the American ship Strafford laden with a valuable 
Cargo, the property of the said John Haven & regularly cleared 
at his Majesty's custom house and bound from London to Lisbon. 

Mr. King takes the liberty to request Lord Grenville's inter- 
ference, in order that this case may speedily be examined, and if 
the statement of Mr. Haven is well founded, that the said ship & 
cargo may with the least possible delay, be restored and permit- 
ted to proceed on her voyage. 



R. King to Mr. Strickland.

which within a few days after my arrival, afforded me so much 
pleasure. I have the more regrets on this subject, as without em- 
ploying terms of civility, I can with truth say that no foreigner 
who has visited America, has left more favorable impressions, and 
that to no one with whom I have had so short an acquaintance 
should I have been so unwilling to have appeared wanting in 
those tokens of respect and esteem, which I feel to be due from 
me to you. 

When you visit London, I shall hope for the pleasure of seeing 
you, and of making you acquainted with Mrs. King, who with 
our young family are with me. In the course of the next year, I 
natter myself, that I shall be able to see different parts of your 
charming country, and I assure you it will give me peculiar pleas- 
ure to meet you where you reside. 

With perfect and sincere esteem your faithful & ob. Servt. 

Rufus King. 



John Lawrance to R. King, London. 

New York, Oct. 15, 1796. 
My Dear Sir : 

It gave us pleasure to hear you were all safe. 
We hope that now and then some information we can 
rely on will reach us. What is to be the result of all, I have done 
conjecturing. The late events have so far exceeded my expecta- 
tions, that I am lost in astonishment. 

We are somewhat alarmed at the report of the design of the 
French interfering with the vessels of neutral Powers, coming to 
and going from the ports of their enemies. This may embarrass 
our trade exceedingly, and, I suppose, if carried into execution, 
produce serious losses ; however we have escaped serious dangers 
heretofore, and I am not without hope we shall get through with- 
out much inconvenience. We must mind our own concerns and 
take care of ourselves ; could we do these things we should not be 
tangible. . . . 

Hamilton, Henderson & myself made an excursion to Long 
Island for 5 days, the beginning of this month. We got a few 
grouse, and the ride restored Hamilton's digestion. He was not

well. I remembered, when at Nicolls Mill, the execution you did 
with the aid of your spectacles. Hamilton is gone to attend the 
term at Albany. . . . 

Yours sincerely, 

John Lawrance. 

R. King to Secretary of State. 

London, Oct. 16, 1796. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . I wish it was in my power now to give you a more 
satisfactory account of what will be the decision of this Govern- 
ment respecting our trade with their West Indies and relative to 
an equitable agreement for the security of our seamen. I have 
before communicated to you that soon after my arrival here, I 
asked a conference with Lord Grenville, in which I explained to 
him what would be satisfactory to us on these points. He en- 
gaged to confer with his colleagues and to give me an answer ; 
but here the business has stopped, his Lordship not having yet 
furnished me with his promised answer. I know that this Gov- 
ernment are almost exclusively employed in the very interesting 
affairs in which they and the principal powers of Europe are en- 
gaged. These may divert their attention from objects which we 
consider as very important to us, and I have no doubt that the 
delay that I shall experience is in some measure to be ascribed to 
this cause ; but I am not certain that other considerations may 
not have their influence in postponing for the present any defini- 
tive step on these subjects. 

If they should decline forming such an article relative to the 
West Indies as we would accept, they may prefer, as I think 
they would, not to design such decision at this juncture. A like 
policy may operate in respect to our Seamen : though I cannot 
allow myself to believe that ultimately they will decline entering 
into a reasonable convention on this subject. But as they believe 
that their national safety depends essentially upon their marine, 
they feel unusual caution relative to a stipulation that by mere 
possibility can deprive their navy of a single seaman, who is a 
real British subject, or that may even diminish the chance of ob- 
taining the services of those who are not British subjects, but who 



IOO RUFUS KING. [1796 

by various pretences are detained in service as such. Hence it is 
to be apprehended that they desire to postpone a convention with 
us on this subject till the return of peace. In the mean time their 
officers may show more caution in impressing our Seamen, and 
more justice in discharging them when claimed. 

I have no reason to doubt the sincere desire of this Government 
to cultivate our esteem. I believe that the administration, to- 
gether with the nation throughout, desire to live with us in Friend- 
ship, and I do not think they would for a slight cause disagree 
with us. But their colony trade and marine are topics intimately 
and exclusively connected with their prosperity and security and 
more deeply with their prejudices. If we cannot agree respecting 
their West Indies, we may still remain friends. The case of our 
Seamen is more important as well as more difficult. At present 
we are injured in this point. A rule of discrimination between 
our and their Seamen is practicable. We are ready and desirous 
to establish such Rule. If they decline it they increase the injury. 
We cannot respect the justice of a nation and at the same time 
believe that it will refuse to enter into a convention, that without 
injury to itself is necessary to prevent it to another. 

I have thought prudent, as well as politic, to pursue the most 
conciliatory course. I shall continue to follow it and will not 
cease to endeavour to effect a reasonable and satisfactory arrange- 
ment, as well in respect to the West India article as well as rela- 
tive to the security of our Seamen. 

With great respect & esteem &c. 

Rufus King. 

R. King to N. Low, New York. 

London, Oct. 17, 1796. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . Our Commissioners here are beginning — hitherto they 
have decided no important questions, though I understand they 
are now discussing some points of much consequence. There 
does not appear any reason to doubt that the results of this com- 
mission will be satisfactory. 

The French Govt, have issued a new order, as I am informed, 
authorizing the seizure of enemy property on board neutral ships ;, 



1796] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 10 1 

their treaties to the contrary notwithstanding. This is a singular 
proceeding at the time when they proclaim themselves the advo- 
cates of a liberal commerce and of the freedom of the seas. Lord 
Malmesbury has gone to Paris — whether peace will be established 
is thought very problematical. Some say a Spanish war is nearer 
and more likely than a French peace. 

Farewell yrs. 

Rufus King. 

R. King to Col. Monroe. 

London, Oct. 19, 1796. 
Dear Sir : 

Since I wrote to you a few days past by Mr. Livingston, the 
rumour that General Pinckney had been named to succeed you at 
Paris has been confirmed ; and the letters from Philadelphia that 
I now transmit to you by Mr. Robert Lyle, will I presume an- 
nounce this information from the Department of State. I hope 
there has been no misunderstanding on this subject. Mr. Pinck- 
ney, my predecessor, did not embark till within two days, and 
just as he was going on board ship, he received the information 
that his Brother was named as your successor & that they would 
probably pass each other on the Ocean. . . . 

With great esteem yr ob & faithful Servt.

John Jay to R. King, London. 

New York, Oct. 21, 1796. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . Dr. Edwards left us a few days ago. He arrived here 
after an uncommon short passage ; from him I reed, much inter- 
esting Information ; among other things that you pleased and was 
pleased. 

I am happy to find that the Board of Comrs. has been com- 
pleated, and that it consists of men, whose characters promise 
Justice and Satisfaction to both sides. This intelligence causes 
agreeable sensations in this Country, and is in many Respects in- 
teresting. It is to be wished that the Comrs. may harmonize as 
to principles, and the application of them. 



102 RUFUS KING. [1796 

Things remain here much in the state in which you left them. 
The President's Resignation has been followed by publications 
calculated to influence the ensuing Election. They manage in 
some places with very little Respect to Decorum. It is said that 
Mr. Jefferson has consented to serve if elected. But this Fact 
does not as yet appear to be unequivocally ascertained. 

The handsome manner in which the Posts were delivered — the 
appointment of Benson to the St. Croix Commission and of Trum- 
bull to the other are pleasing circumstances. The Return of the 
Governors of Canada, who were generally supposed not to have 
been friendly to us in regard to the Indians, is a judicious 
measure — especially if their successors should be prudent and 
conciliatory. 

Very Sincerely yours 

John Jay. 



T. Pickering to R. King. 

Department of State, Oct. 26, 1796. 

. . . I think it is mentioned in your Instructions, that the 
British naval officers often impress Swedes, Danes and other 
foreigners from the vessels of the U. States ; they have even 
sometimes impressed Frenchmen. If there should be time to 
make out a copy of a Protest lately received, it shall be inclosed, 
describing the impress of a Dane and a Portuguese. This surely 
is an abuse easy to correct. They cannot pretend an inability to 
distinguish these foreigners from their own subjects ; and they 
may with as much reason rob American vessels of the property or 
merchandize of Swedes, Danes and Portuguese, as seize and de- 
tain in their service subjects of those nations, found on board 
American vessels. The President is extremely anxious to have 
this business of Impresses placed on a reasonable footing. . . . 

Your information of the advice from Mr. Monroe in his Letter 
of August 28, was very gratefully received. * The note published 
purporting to be from Mr. De La Croix to M. Barthelemi was 
doubtless authentic ; but it only declared the intentions of the 

* See R. K.'s Letter to Hamilton, Sept. 10, 1796. 



1796] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. IO3 

Directory, and no order, it is to be presumed, had been issued 
for capturing neutral vessels bound to or from English ports ; and 
as the threatened order for this purpose was made to depend on 
a previous similar order of the British Government, I trust our 
Commerce will not be subjected to new vexations. In the West 
Indies indeed the French Privateers are capturing and condemn- 
ing our vessels ; but I believe this to proceed only from the 
wants of their Colonies, and the injustice of their officers in other 
instances, who under the pretence of public wants plunder for 
themselves. . . . 

Your observations relative to costs in prosecuting appeals by 
the Agent of the U. States, Mr. Bayard, merit much attention — 
Mr. Pickering then proceeds to state the case as it strikes his 
mind, and closes " where there shall be a final condemnation of 
the property captured, we have a right to conclude that the suf- 
ferers were not entitled to the aid of Government, and yet these 
are the cases in which, as you remark, the recovery of an indem- 
nity to the public would be extremely difficult, no previous 
security or stipulation being given by the claimants. Where resti- 
tution shall be decreed, the amount of the expenses may be 
deducted as you propose, and the balance paid over to the claim- 
ants. It will certainly be proper to adopt your advice in this case 
until by the proper authority the question shall be deter- 
mined." . . . 



R. King to J. Q. Adams. 

London, Nov. 10, 1796. 
Dear Sir : 

We still have cause to complain of the capture of our vessels 
by the marine of this country. At the same time it is no more 
than candour to confess that some of the captures have been but 
too well justified. Allured by the Hope of high freights some of 
our people (I hope and believe the instances are few) have lent 
their names to cover Enemy Goods. One or two such cases hav- 
ing been detected, have cast a suspicion upon all our vessels 
employed in a similar trade. . . . Though we have reason 
to be disatisfied that so many of our vessels are captured, still I 



104 RUFUS KING. [1796 

think the injury and injustice we experience in the impressment of 
our Seamen is a more serious cause of discontent. I wish I 
could inform you that I have a reasonable expectation that any 
equitable Regulation is likely to be agreed in by this Government 
on this point. I will not say that I despair of their doing us 
justice, but being sincerely desirous to see a friendly and harmo- 
nious intercourse between the two countries, I regret that I do 
not discover that disposition on this very important subject with- 
out which it cannot exist. 

Our latest accounts from home are to the last of September. 
The President has published an address to the People, in which 
he declines another Election. The Topics he has discussed are 
very interesting to our Happiness and I think the perform- 
ance will add to his Reputation. The country is in great tran- 
quillity and unless the passions of the People should be roused 
by any unexpected occurrence, I feel little doubt that the choice 
of a successor will fall where it is eminently merited, where you 
& I must wish it. I understand that Mr. Adams & Mr. Pinckney 
(my predecessor) will be voted for by the Federalists, and Mr. 
Jefferson and I don't know whom by their opponents. Mr. 
Monroe is recalled & is to be succeeded by General Pinckney, 
the elder brother of the gentleman you knew here. He is a very 
amiable and truly respectable character. I allow myself to hope 
that no public inconvenience will attend this change. 

With sincere Esteem & Respect &c.

R. King to Genl. Washington. 

Washington, Nov. 12, 1796. 
Dear Sir : 

I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 26th of 
August, and Dr. Nichols, whose advice I have asked, has been so 
obliging as to give me information respecting the manner in 
which the order of the Court of Chancery should be published. 
In a day or two I will procure its insertion in the proper News 
Paper. Some little attention will be requisite to avoid, as far as 



I79 6 J LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 105 

practicable, the great Expense which commonly attends this kind 
of publication. The Newspapers containing the notification shall 
be transmitted to you agreeable to your directions. 

It is extremely difficult to form a satisfactory opinion respect- 
ing the probability of peace. I meet with few persons who 
appear to have much confidence in the success of Lord Malmes- 
bury. The declaration of war by Spain at a moment when Eng- 
land appeared to be making serious efforts to conclude a general 
peace, strengthens the belief of many that France prefers still to 
continue the war. All the internal movements of this Govern- 
ment, that are visible, indicate a Determination to prosecute the 
war with vigour. The funding of the floating debt earlier than 
usual and at the commencement of the negotiations with France, 
when its influence upon the Stocks is such as a measure so direct 
for the restoration of peace is calculated to produce, the augmen- 
tation of the militia by the addition of 60,000 men, and the means 
employed to recruit the regular army, if peace is near, would 
seem to be improvident and unwise. But if the war continues, 
12 millions will have been funded on advantageous terms, the 
Government will have removed an important obstacle to the fur- 
ther use of their credit, and, by an increase of the internal 
strength of the nation, placed at their disposal, the regular Forces 
to be employed abroad. 

France will bend all her energies against that Commerce in 
which England finds such immense Resources to prosecute the 
war, not by attacking her navy, not by attempting the threatened 
invasion, but by compelling the neighbouring nations to exclude 
the commerce of England from the great and profitable markets 
of Europe. England in turn will endeavour to balance the 
account, by conquering or emancipating the colonies of Spain 
and France, thereby opening new and extensive markets in 
another quarter of the Globe. Should the war unfortunately still 
grow, the meditated expedition against Canada by the Mississippi 
may possibly be undertaken. I think it much less probable since 
the evacuation of our frontier posts by the British forces. 
Though I cannot seriously believe that such an expedition will be 
attempted, still it may be the part of prudence to consider it as 
possible, in order to guard against its mischiefs. 



106 KUFUS KING. [1796 

Spain enumerates among the injuries received from Great 
Britain, the Treaty concluded with us. And France was satisfied 
neither with that Treaty, nor with the subsequent one, that was 
concluded at a fortunate moment between us and Spain. Both 
may have been dissatisfied from motives connected with the 
Project of an Expedition through the Mississippi. 

With perfect respect &c.

London, Nov. 12, 1796. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . The ordinary conferences at Lord Grenville's office 
have been interrupted for some days past on account of the death 
of his sister ; in consequence of this interruption I have not been 
able since the receipt of your letter of the 31st of August to fulfil in 
the manner I prefer your instructions respecting Mr. Liston's 
conciliatory and friendly interference to assist Col. Talbot's 
agency for the relief of our seamen in the West Indies. I 
have no reason to believe that this interference will be disap- 
proved : on the contrary I am persuaded that it is a pleasing cir- 
cumstance to this Government that Mr. Liston's conduct has 
been satisfactory to us. Mr. Liston had transmitted an account 
of the base and humiliating treatment of Captain Jessup by Capt. 
Pigot before I received your letter of the 10th of September and 
the Lords of the Admiralty have ordered, as I am informed, a rig- 
orous enquiry to be made into the conduct of that officer. This 
case is so extraordinary that I hope proper means will be em- 

107 



108 RUFUS KING. [1796 

ployed to authenticate it in the most solemn manner. If this is 
done and the evidence transmitted to me I think this Government 
cannot avoid punishing Capt. Pigot in a manner that will deter 
others from imitating his infamous conduct. 

Mr. McDonald and Mr. Rich will sail in a day or two for Phila- 
delphia. These gentlemen are the Commissioners on the part of 
this country in the Debt Questions. The former is a Barrister of 
some eminence, the latter is a merchant who has resided for more 
than twenty years in Holland and was the British Consul there at 
the commencement of the war between this and that country. 
They are both esteemed to be liberal & upright men, wholly un- 
connected with the business of the Commission and well disposed 
to cultivate a good understanding and friendly intercourse be- 
tween the two countries. I have no doubt that they will be re- 
ceived in a manner that will be proper and of course satisfactory. 

With perfect respect, &c, 

Rufus King. 



T. Pickering to R. King. 

Department of State, Nov. 14, 1796. 

Dear Sir : 

. . . A very unpleasant transaction has lately taken place 
between the French Minister Mr. Adet and our Government. 
On the 28th ulto. I received his Letter of the 27th, which he pub- 
lished in the Aurora of the 31st, together with the Decree of the 
Executive Directory relative to the commerce of the Neutral 
Nations. His representations were of a nature to render it ex- 
tremely desirable that the conduct of the American Government 
should be as publicly vindicated. The public sentiment appeared 
to demand it. Yet it was with great reluctance that my answer to 
Mr. Adet was sent to the press. The printed copies of these 
letters you will find inclosed. In his note of the 3d, of which 
also a copy is inclosed, he promises information in answer to the 
questions I had proposed relative to our Commerce ; but his reply 
has not yet been received. It is remarkable that in this short 
note, he says that the Decree of the Directory, which he notified 



1795] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. IO9 

to me, bears no likeness to the supposed order which was the 
subject of Mr. Monroe's Letter of the 28th of August to you ; 
when the result of both is precisely the same, to wit, that the 
French cruizers would act towards the vessels of other Nations in 
the same manner as these suffer the English to act towards them. 
The declaratory words in the note to Mr. Barthelemi, to which 
you and Mr. Monroe referred, as printed in the Paris newspapers 
(for the matter was not officially communicated to Mr. Monroe) 
were these " Le directoire executif charge, en consequence, tous 
les agens politiques de la republique francaise d'annoncer aux 
gouvernemens pres desquels ils sont envoyes, que les escadres et 
les corsaires de la republique agiront contre les navires de chaque 
pays de la meme maniere que ces gouvernemens souffriront 
qu'en agissent envers eux les anglais." The words of the decree, 
sent to me by Mr. Adet, are as follows : 

" II sera notifie sans delai a toutes les puissances neutres ou 
allies que le pavilion de la republique francaise en usera envers 
les batimens neutres soit pour la confiscation, soit pour la visite, 
ou prehension de la meme maniere qu'elles souffront que les 
Anglais en usent a leur egard." 

As Mr. Adet's letter was published on Monday, and the elec- 
tion of Electors of President and Vice President was to take place 
the Friday following in Pennsylvania, and the choice of President 
was so near at hand, conjectures appeared in the newspapers of 
one motive for its publication. 



T. Pickering to R. King. 

Department of State, Nov. 26, 1796. 

Mr. Pickering writing about the difficulty of communicating 
directly with Mr. Pinckney at Paris, says "It will be in your 
power to communicate earlier advices of what is passing in France 
than we can expect from Mr. Pinckney. I must entreat you to 
advert to this circumstance, and that to a recital of facts you 
would add such reflections as a nearer view of them shall 
suggest." 



IIO RUFUS KING. [1796 

R. Troup to R. King. 

New York, 16th Nov., 1796. 

My Dear Sir : 

. . . Our good friend the district Judge (John Lawrance) 
has been appointed to take your seat in the Senate. There was 
but one dissenting voice in both branches of our Legislature to 
this appointment. . . . 

We are all anxiety about the coming election of President and 
Vice President. In this State our electors were appointed a few 
days ago. We have none but good and true men, who will vote 
unanimously for Adams and Pinckney. ... I am inclined to 
think, and such is the inclination of our friends here, that Mr. 
Adams will not succeed ; but we have Mr. Pinckney completely 
in our power if our Eastern friends do not refuse him some of 
their votes, under an idea that if they vote for him unanimously 
they may injure Mr. Adams. Upon this subject, we are writing 
to all our Eastern friends and endeavoring to make them accord 
with us in voting unanimously both for Mr. Adams and Mr. 
Pinckney. It would appear from the proceedings of Jefferson's 
party in Pennsylvania, that Burr was to be their Vice President. 
But we all suppose he will meet with little support. ... In 
our election for Representatives, we are and I fear we shall con- 
tinue to be divided. It is most probable that Watson will be 
agreed on to be supported ; but if he succeeds, it will be owing 
to vigorous exertions. His very name is an emetic to many of 
our best friends. 

The President's resignation has not even been carped at in a 
single instance that I have heard of ; all his friends consider it a 
second new testament. 

Our friend the Governor is well but rather out of temper with 
the abrupt adjournment of our Legislature to meet in January 
next, and at Albany. We shall never, in all probability, see them 
again in this city ; and we suppose it will not be long before the 
seat of government is removed to that quarter. The northern 
and western interests are much too powerful for us. . . . 

Your friend 

R. Troup. 



1796] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. Ill 

Baron Jacobi to Mr. King. 

London, Gloucester Place, iothNov., 1796. 

Baron Jacobi begs leave of Mr. King to apply to him in the 
following business. General Von Steuben, a Prussian subject 
being lately in the service of the United States of America, died 
there near New York, as it is presumed these twelve months ago. 

His sister, Julianna Von Steuben, and his brother Siegfried Von 
Steuben are desirous to know what has become of the inheritance 
of the said General. 

B. Jacobi would be much obliged to Mr. King if he would 
have the goodness to interfere in order to procure some authentic 
accounts about that business. He would be very thankful also if 
in the mean time he could get any information about the steps to 
be taken for procuring the inheritance of General Von Steuben 
to his above mentioned heirs. 



Great Cumberland Place, Nov. 19, 1796. 

Mr. King presents his compliments to Baron Jacobi, and has 
the honor to inform him in answer to his note respecting the late 
Baron de Steuben, with whom Mr. King had the pleasure to be 
well acquainted, that he served with great reputation in the 
American army, and by the introduction of a more perfect dis- 
cipline than had before existed, rendered important and acknowl- 
edged service to the United States. At the conclusion of the 
American war, in addition to other compensations for these ser- 
vices, the Baron was allowed by Congress a yearly pension of two 
thousand and five hundred dollars to continue during his life — 
and the State of New York, where the Baron resided, gave him a 
valuable tract of Land, containing several thousand acres. The 
Baron was a man of expence and Mr. King has reason to believe 
that he owed debts to a considerable amount, when he left for 
Europe. Some of these debts were afterwards paid by the Baron ; 
others of them remained unpaid at his death. 

The Baron's moveables, or personal estate, were at the time of 
his death of small value. His Lands, part of which he sold during 
his life, were his only property worth inquiry. As the Baron died 



112 XUFUS KING. [1796 

without issue, his next of kin capable to inherit, would have 
succeeded to his Lands had he died intestate. But he made a 
will, in which, after bequeathing his Books, Furniture and other 
personal estate of small value to a young Gentleman of the name 
of Milliken (who lived in his house and whom he had assisted in 
his collegiate education) he devised the whole of his Lands and 
other property to Col. Walker and Major North, two American 
citizens, who had been Aids-de-Camp to the Baron and whom he 
considered and treated as his particular friends. This will has 
been established according to the requisitions and forms of our 
Laws, and the next of kin to the Baron de Steuben are thereby 
excluded from inheriting any part of his estate. Mr. King gives 
this information from recollecting what was publickly understood 
respecting the Baron de Steuben's affairs — he has no doubt that 
it is essentially correct. If however, the Baron Jacobi should 
desire more exact and formal information, Mr. King with much 
pleasure, will procure from New York an authenticated copy of 
the Baron's will, together with an attested inventory of his estate. 



Wm. Bingham to R. King, London. 

Philada., Nov. 29, 1796. 
Dear Sir : 

I have sent by the present opportunity a full length Portrait of 
the President. It is executed by Stewart (who is well known in 
London) with a great deal of enthusiasm, and in his best manner, 
& does great credit to the American Artist. It is intended as a 
Present on the part of Mrs. Bingham to Lord Landsdown. As a 
warm Friend of the United States and a great admirer of the 
President, it cannot have a better Destination. 

The Frame that accompanies it is manufactured in Philada. with 
much Taste & Elegance. It has been suggested that some diffi- 
culties may exist relative to its admission : in which case I must 
request your Interference to obviate them. 

Our Elections of Electors have been so far closed as to deter- 
mine with considerable accuracy the result. The Friends of Mr. 
Adams may calculate on a majority in his favor, but so small that, 
on so momentous an occasion, it would be risking too much to 



1796] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. II3 

trust entirely thereto. It is therefore deemed expedient to recom- 
mend to the federal Electors to give an uniform vote for Mr. 
Pinckney, which with those that he will obtain to the Southward, 
detached from Mr. Adams, will give him a decided Majority over 
the other Candidates. 

We are unfortunate in the Election in this State : we carried 
only two of our Ticket. The most unwearied Exertions, accom- 
panied by some Bribery, and not a little chicane, have been prac- 
tised on this occasion by the anti-federal Party. They were very 
essentially aided in their Views by some of Mr. Adet's strokes of 
diplomatic Finesse. In the House of Representatives the fed- 
eralists have triumphed at the last Election. We shall rather 
have an accession than diminution of strength in the Senate. 
Burr will not be re-elected and Butler resigns in disgust. . . . 

With sincerity & esteem, 

Wm. Bingham. 

R. King to Lord Grenville. 

Great Cumberland Place, Nov. 30, 1796. 
My Lord : 

I have the honor to return the letter addressed to John Maxwell 
from his wife which your Lordship some time since transmitted 
to me as containing evidence of improper conduct on the part of 
the American Consul at Bristol. I sent this letter to Mr. Vander- 
horst, the Consul referred to, with a request that he would furnish 
such Explanations relative to this case as should be in his power. 
From the communication that I have received from Mr. Vander- 
horst, extracts from which I take the liberty to inclose for your 
Lordship's information, I flatter myself that it will appear that the 
unfavorable inferences that have been drawn from this letter, re- 
specting the conduct of Mr. Vanderhorst are not well founded. 

In your Lordship's letter of the 21st of September in answer to 
my application for the discharge of Mr. Maxwell, an American 
citizen impressed and detained on board his Majesty's ship 
Sandwich, the reason assigned against his discharge is " that he 
is married and settled at Bristol " ; and I understand that the orders 
of the Commissioners of the Admiralty for the discharge of Amer- 

VOL. II. — 8 



114 RUFUS KING. [1796 

ican Seamen usually contain a Proviso that the discharge is not to 
operate in favor of any person who has entered on board any of 
his Majesty's ships, or who is married or settled within any of his 
Majesty's dominions. Without admitting or contesting on 
this occasion the Rule of English Law, that a subject cannot 
divest himself of his natural Allegiance, I take the liberty to re- 
quest your Lordship's attention to the diversity of practice so 
much to the disadvantage of American citizens that prevails in 
the application of this Rule. 

If Great Britain requires the acquiescence of foreign nations 
in this Law, so far as regards the requisition of her subjects mar- 
ried or settled abroad, or voluntarily engaged in foreign service, 
is she not bound in like manner to observe it herself in respect 
to the subjects of foreign Powers under similar circumstances in 
her service or within her Dominions ? If to the demand of a 
Foreigner in her service by the nation to which he belongs, Great 
Britain answers that such Foreigner cannot be delivered because 
he voluntarily engaged to serve his Majesty or is married or set- 
tled within his Majesty's Dominions ; is she not bound by her 
own Principles to admit the validity of the same answer from 
such foreign nation, when she requires the surrender of British 
Subjects found in a similar predicament in the service or within 
the Territory of such foreign Nation ? Justice, which is always 
impartial, furnishes the proper answer to these questions. 

Admitting that the voluntary contract of an American citizen 
to serve on board a British Ship, or the marriage or settlement of 
such citizen within his Majesty's Dominions, is the foundation of 
a right in his Majesty's Government to refuse the requisition of 
the United States of America, that such citizen should be dis- 
charged from his Majesty's service, do we not thereby establish a 
Principle that at once condemns and puts an end to the practice 
of his Majesty's Naval officers in entering American Ships in 
search of and for the purpose of impressing British seamen, since 
all seamen found on board such ships are there of choice and by 
voluntary compact to serve in the American Employ. 

But if neither of these circumstances can be considered as 
justly giving a Right to his Majesty's Government to refuse the 
discharge of American citizens, does it not result that the usual 



1796] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 115 

Proviso connected with the orders for the discharge of such citi- 
zens, and which is assigned as a reason against the discharge of 
John Maxwell, is without any just foundation and consequently 
operates to the disadvantage and injury of the American 
citizens ? 

With the highest consideration & esteem, &c, &c, 

Rufus King. 

R. King to Lord Grenville. 

Great Cumberland Place, Nov. 30, 1796. 
My Lord : 

In obedience to the instructions of the President of the United 
States of America, I transmit to your Lordship an account of the 
violent and humiliating treatment received by William Jessup, a 
citizen of the said United States and master of the American ship 
Mercury, from H. Pigot commander of his Majesty's Frigate Suc- 
cess. The circumstances of this outrage are so extraordinary, 
that, persuaded as I am of the Justice of his Majesty's Govern- 
ment, I cannot a moment doubt that conformable to the just 
requisition of the President of the United States, efficacious 
measures will be taken to inquire into the same, and upon the 
verification thereof, that the said H. Pigot will be punished as an 
atrocious violator of the Treaty between the two Nations.

his Majesty's Minister to the United States of America, together 
with a Copy of the Petition referred to therein from William 
Jesup, Master of the American vessel the Mercury, on the subject 
of the outrageous and cruel conduct, stated to have been exer- 
cised towards him by Capt. Pigot of his M. S. Success on the occa- 
sion set forth ; and signified to us at the same time his Majesty's 
pleasure that we should cause a particular inquiry to be immedi- 
ately made respecting the conduct imputed to Capt. Pigot and the 
circumstances of the transaction in question ; we have the honor, 
in answer thereto to acquaint your Lordship for his Majesty's 
information, that we have sent transcripts of the Extract and 
Petition above mentioned to Admiral Sir Hyde Parker, Com- 
mander in chief of his Majesty's Ships and vessels at St. Do- 
mingo, with instructions to make immediate and strict Enquiry 
into the said transaction accordingly, and to report to us the 
Result without delay ; having however previous to the receipt of

R. King to A. Hamilton.* 

London, Nov. 30th, 1796. 
My Dear Sir : 

The Archduke having expelled Jourdan and Moreau from Ger- 
many, the parties are in respect to territory in that quarter, where 
they were when the campaign began. Bonaparte, by the latest 
accounts from Italy, is critically circumstanced, and it seems not 
improbable, that he likewise will be compelled to retire from 
Lombardy. The mission of Lord Malmesbury remains undecided, 
and though the negotiation is not promising, it does not appear 
as desperate as it did a fortnight ago. Paper has entirely ceased 
as a medium in France ; what their ability is to prosecute another 
campaign, you, as well as I can, may conjecture. New projects are 
to be brought forward in this country, and if for no other reason 
than that they are novelties, they will be hazardous, where the 
force of habit is stronger than that of reason. The minister's plan 
is not definitively settled ; but enough is known to authorize a be- 
lief that it cannot be approved by the moneyed men. The 3 per- 
cents are at about 56 per ct. The minister is unwilling to augment 
the debt, already enormous, by borrowing on such terms. He 
intends proposing a loan, which is to be advanced by patriotic 
capitalists, upon terms more advantageous to the government. 
What patriotism may do, I cannot say ; but unless there exists a 
real conviction in the minds of wealthy men, that their wealth is 
in danger, I should suspect that this virtue, pure and dignified as 
it is, will in this country prove an unproductive source when mil- 
lions are required. It is time to make peace ; for all sides are 
weary with the war. We most sincerely desire it, since peace 
alone will afford us the tranquillity we wish, and ought to enjoy. 

I do not think it prudent to write my opinions, so far as I 
have formed them, concerning certain subjects interesting to our 
rights, and respecting which you will naturally wish for informa- 
tion from this quarter. The casualties to which letters are liable 
require a caution that between friends is unpleasant, and some- 
times inconvenient. You know my opinion respecting this 
country. We have often endeavored to explain appearances that

we disliked, and preserve our respect for a nation who have done 
much to improve the condition and happiness of mankind. I 
still hope that I have not been deceived, and that experience will 
prove that the opinions of those from whom we differed were, as 
we believed them, partial and erroneous. 

We are anxious to hear the result of the Presidential election — 
much, very much will depend upon that event. Farewell.

Dear Sir : 

My letter of the 8th of September has given you information of 
what passed between Lord Grenville & me respecting the author- 
ity of our Consuls to grant Protections to Seamen. On the 3rd 
day of Nov. I received the following letter from his Lordship. 

" Downing Street, 3d Nov., 1796. 
" Sir : 

" The Consuls of the United States residing in his Majesty's 
Dominions have for some time past been in the habit of granting to 
sea-faring Persons certificates under their consular seal purport- 
ing that the Bearers of them are citizens of the United States, and 
as such liable to be called upon for the service of their own country 
and that they are therefore not to be interrupted or molested by 
any means whatever. I have reason to believe that these certifi- 
cates have frequently been granted upon very slight and insuf- 
ficient evidence and in a great number of cases to Persons who 
were in fact British seamen. 

119 



120 RUFUS KING. [1796 

" But independently of this abuse, I am under the necessity of 
representing to you on the part of his Majesty's Government 
the insuperable objections which apply to the Principle of a 
jurisdiction in this respect assumed and exercised within his 
Majesty's dominions by the Consuls of a foreign nation. And 
I must remark to you that the impropriety of a proceeding so 
much out of the ordinary line of consular functions, and so liable 
to be abused for the worst purposes, is very much aggravated by 
the unwarrantable assumption of a Power in the Consuls to 
administer oaths to his Majesty's subjects and others resident 
within these realms concerning the matter of the said cer- 
tificates. 

" I had the honor of writing to Mr. Pinckney on this subject on 
the 13th of July last, requesting that he would inform me whether 
the Consuls of the United States are in any manner authorized or 
instructed by their own Government to grant such certificates, 
and, in such case, whether any and what Rule of evidence or dis- 
cretion is prescribed to them for their guidance is a duty of so 
difficult and delicate a nature. 

" I apprehend that Mr. Pinckney's departure prevented his 
answering my letters ; but as I am persuaded that no such author- 
ity can in fact have been given, the frequent instances of this 
practice which have lately come within my knowledge, oblige me 
now to request that you will have the goodness to notify the con- 
suls that they are in future to abstain from a proceeding which 
far exceeds the limits of their office, which is neither sanctioned 
by the law and usage of nations, nor by any treaty between the 
two countries, and the continuance of which must be considered 
an act on their part injurious to the authority of the King's Gov- 
ernment. The earnest desire which I feel to avoid even the ap- 
pearance of a misunderstanding between the two Governments, 
leads me to prefer this mode of notification rather than to take 
any manner of signifying it to them more directly. 

" And I avail myself with pleasure of this opportunity to assure 
you of the high consideration & esteem, &c, &c. 

" I have the honor to be, 

" Grenville." 

I thought it proper to communicate this letter to our Consuls, 
which I did by copies accompanied by the following letter : 



1796] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 121 

Mr. Knox, American Consul, Hull — Circular to the 

Consuls. 

"London, Nov. 18, 1796. 
" Sir : 

" Inclosed I send you a copy of a letter from Lord Grenville to 
me respecting the Consular Jurisdiction. Hitherto I have not 
had leisure to consider the subject in the manner I wish to do, 
previous to the return of an answer. It has however appeared to 
me adviseable to transmit to you a copy of the letter, in order that 
you should be informed of the Decision of this Government on 
the points to which it refers. I am at present inclined to believe 
that the administration of oaths by our Consuls in these or any 
other cases to British subjects is neither necessary nor proper. 
The other Point is more doubtful, as well as more important, as it 
regards the security of our navigation and seamen. As we have 
no convention with this Nation, defining the Consular Powers, 
they must be ascertained by the Law of Nations. General usage 
is evidence of this Law, and some of its Rules are to be found 
only in the existence of such usage. I have not discovered any- 
thing explicit on the Question in any work of Reputation, and I 
shall be obliged to you to inquire and, as early as convenient, to 
inform me what is the Practice on this subject of the consuls of 
other Powers resident in this nation. If you can procure and send 
me copies of similar certificates issued by the Consuls of other 
nations, if such certificates are granted by any of them, I desire 
you to do so. 

" Though I would not be understood as giving a settled opinion 
on this Point, I ought not to omit observing to you, that neither 
our Laws respecting Consuls nor the late Law for the Relief and 
Protection of American Seamen give to our Consuls any authority 
to grant Certificates of Citizenship ; and I have seen no Instruc- 
tion from the Executive that authorizes it. If the Power exists, it 
must be derived from the Law of Nations. This Government 
denies that it can be deduced from that source, and notifies to us 
that we must abstain from the Exercise of the Power, since the same 
is deemed to be repugnant to the Jurisdiction, and a continuance 
thereof will be considered as injurious to the Authority of the 

King's Government. 

" With great respect, &c, 

"Rufus King." 



122 RUFUS KING. [1796 

I do not consider myself authorized to instruct our Consuls in 
this or in any other instance : in cases in which they ask my ad- 
vice, I readily give it according to my views of their Privileges, 
and of the public welfare. So far as I have been informed, the 
Consuls do not think it prudent since this communication from 
Lord Grenville to grant any more protections, and in consequence 
thereof, I am frequently applied to by Seamen on the subject. 

I did not approve of that part of the late Law for the Relief and 
Protection of Seamen which authorizes the Collectors to grant 
Protections. It appeared to me to be a measure of questionable 
policy, and I apprehend it has placed our Seamen in a worse 
instead of a better situation than that in which they were before. 

One great evil of the regulation is that every Seaman who is 
without a Certificate, and every one who has a Certificate from 
% any other Officer than a Collector, is considered as not having 
been able to procure a certificate from the Collector and is treated 
here as a British Subject. The Law ought to be repealed, or 
what under present circumstances would be better, it might be 
amended by requiring every Seaman, who is a citizen, to prove 
the same in a safe and satisfactory manner and to procure a Cer- 
tificate thereof from the Collector. Another amendment should 
be added to prohibit every other person except the Collectors 
from granting Certificates to Seamen. 

At present it is optional with a Seaman to procure or not to 
procure a Certificate of citizenship, or to procure it from the Col- 
lector or any other Officer. Hence these Certificates are granted 
on a variety of forms on different degrees of proof and by almost 
every grade of magistrates, and the consequence thereof has 
been that they are all in some sort disregarded. 



R. King to Lord Grenville. 



Great Cumberland Place, Dec. 12, 1796. 



Mr. King presents his compliments to Lord Grenville, and 
takes the liberty to inclose a list of Thirty three Seamen, who 
state themselves to be American citizens detained on board his 
Majesty's Ships of War ; most of these cases are without the 



1796] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 1 23 

usual Proofs : the laws of the United States permit, but do not 
oblige any citizen to procure and carry with him abroad a Certifi- 
cate of Citizenship. Several of the persons named in the list 
state that they did procure such Certificates before they left 
America, but that the same have been taken from them, and are 
detained or destroyed. All of them are strenuous in declaring 
themselves to be American Citizens, and in expressing their Confi- 
dence, that on an impartial examination they shall be able to 
produce such Circumstances and Proofs, as will afford reasonable 
satisfaction that they really are so. 

Mr. King is apprized that inconveniences may be apprehended 
from the reference of these and similar cases to a civil magis- 
trate, or to any other & more regular Tribunal, than that which at 
present decides them. But on the other hand his confidence in 
Lord Grenville's candor, induces him to believe that his Lordship 
will agree with him in the opinion, that the commander of a ship 
of war (however honorable and esteemed, whose zeal for the 
public service, whose personal emulation, and whose Reputation 
and honor must inspire him with a strong and natural anxiety 
that his ship should continue ably and fully manned) cannot be 
the impartial Judge that these cases require. 

Mr. King on this occasion finds it to be his Duty, to request 
Lord Grenville's interference in order that these cases may receive 
an impartial examination ; and though not accompanied by the 
usual proofs, if by Circumstances and other satisfactory Evidence, 
it shall appear that the same are truly represented, that the said 
Seamen may be discharged. 



R. King to Secretary of State. 

London, Dec. 15, 1796. 
Dear Sir : 

I think it prudent to transmit to you copies of a Letter and of 
the papers that accompanied it, which I yesterday received from 
General Ira Allen of Vermont. Agreeable to his wishes and to 
the accustomed course in Cases of Capture, I shall send copies to 
Lord Grenville with a request of his interference in order that 
this case should be examined, and if the statements of General 



124 RUFUS KING. [1796 

Allen should be found true, that the ship and Cargo should be 
restored and permitted to proceed on her voyage. 

Various rumours respecting the Destination of these arms have 
prevailed here ; among them it has been said that they were in- 
tended to be introduced through Vermont into Canada in order 
to favor certain Projects that France meditates respecting that 
Country. It is not my business to add conjectures or specula- 
tions upon this subject. You will be able to judge of the number 
of the militia of Vermont, of their probable deficiency of arms ; 
whether it has been the practice in Vermont to arm the militia at 
the public charge, whether the Legislature had authorized Gov- 
ernor Chittenden or General Allen to make a Purchase of such a 
quantity of muskets & Cannon and, by examining the contracts, 
of which I enclose copies, you will be better able to form a 
correct opinion of the nature of this Transaction than I am 
able to do.* 

Yr. obt. & faithful Servt., 

Rufus King. 



B. Goodhue to R. King, London. 

Philada., Dec. 15, 1796. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . You must, I presume, have seen Adet's Notes to our 
Secretary calculated to degrade the character and measures of 
the Executive, and to influence in the choice of another : in the 
latter view it had doubtless an effect to establish the Anti-Ticket 
of Electors in this State by a small majority, but I don't hear of 
any such effect anywhere else ; neither do I believe it will be 
possible for him or his Master, either by gasconading threats or 
fulsome flattery to strengthen their party or influence. 

I enclose you the returns of the Electors so far as have been 
received ; a few days will put us out of doubt ; indeed from the

Capt. Bryant, sailing from Ostend to New York with arms for the State of Ver- 
mont, as alleged, and captured by his Majesty's ship of war Audacious \ Capt.

alluded to in Mr. Pickering's letter to Mr. King of April 6th and June 16th,

1796] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 1 25 

votes already in, and by the information we have, it almost is a 
certainty that Mr. Jefferson cannot be President : tho', probably 
by throwing away votes in some of the Eastern States for Pinck- 
ney to ensure Adams, he may be the V. President. His own 
party pretty much give up any expectation of his being President. 
Mr. Tichenor succeeds Gov. Robinson, Mr. Howard Mr. Potts, 
and Mr. Butler has resigned ; from these changes with our ex- 
pectation of having a good man instead of Mr. Burr after the 
Third of March, I think we need not fear any machinations that 
can affect the Senate, and poqrr Langdon will be the only man 
East of the Potomac in the Senate to save us from going to the 
Devil, as his phrase is. Dearborn & Lyman will be left out, and 
Gov. Jay & Col. Hamilton inform me they expect a better repre- 
sentation from your State, tho' they fear James Watson is not 
popular enough to oust Livingston. Those who could have done 
it, could not be prevailed upon to stand Candidates. There is a 
better representation in this State, Delaware, Maryland, So. Caro- 
lina, and a better one expected from Virginia, so that we calculate 
upon having a decided majority of good men in our House of 
Representatives. . . . 

It may be expected the threatenings of Adet may occasion 
much spouting and foaming in the House, touching the subjects 
of his complaints, but never fear ; we shall be steady and our 
Country will support us against these Disorganizers. I expect 
the French will practise on their Scheme of Spoliation ; but if 
they should, I hear of no person who supposes we would get any- 
thing by going to war with them. . . . 

Your sincere friend, 

B. Goodhue. 

A. Hamilton to R. King, London. 

New York, Dec. 16, 1796. 

I have received, my dear Sir, your several letters of the 25th 
August 10th & nth of Sept. You know my sentiments towards 
you too well to ascribe my Delay in answering them to any other 
than the imperiousness of avocations with which I could not 
dispense. 




126 RUFUS KING. [1796 

Public opinion, taking the Country at large, has continued 
since you left us to travel on in a right direction, and, I trust, 
will not easily deviate from it. You will have seen before this 
reaches you Mr. Adet's communications. We conjecture, as to 
the timing of them, that they were intended to influence the elec- 
tion of President by the apprehension of war with France. We 
suppose also they are designed in the same way to give support 
to the partizans of France, and that they have for eventual object 
the placing things in such a state as will leave France at liberty 
to slide easily into a renewal of cordiality or an actual or virtual 
war with the U. S. If the war of Europe continues, the efforts 
of France will be likely to be levelled, as a primary object, against 
the Commerce and Credit of Great Britain ; and to injure these 
she may think it adviseable to make war upon our Trade, for- 
getting perhaps that the consequence may be, to turn it more 
entirely into the channels of Great Britain. These reflexions 
will be obvious to you. I only make them to apprize you of the 
view which is taken of the subject here. Thus far appearances 
do not indicate that the purpose of influencing this Country has 
been obtained. I think in the main the effect has been to im- 
press the necessity of adhering more firmly to the Government. 

You need not be told that every exertion, not degrading to us, 
will be made to preserve peace with France. Many of the oppo- 
site party, however they may be pleased with appearances of ill 
humour in France, will not wish it to go to the length of war ; 
and we shall endeavour to avoid it in pursuance of our general 
.plan of preserving peace with all the world. Yet you may 
depend, that we shall not submit to be dictated to, or to be forced 
into a departure from our plan of neutrality unless to repel an 
attack upon us. 

Our anxiety has been extreme on the subject of the Election 
for President. If we may trust our information, which there is 
every reason to trust, it is now decided that neither Jefferson nor 
Burr can be President. It must be either Adams or Pinckney, 
the first most probably. By the throwing away votes in New Eng- 
land, lest Pinckney should outrun Adams, it is not unlikely that 
Jefferson will be Vice President. The event will not a little mor- 
tify Burr. Virginia has given him only one Vote. 

It was to be expected, of course, that the Senators' answer to 



1796] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 12 J 

the President's speech would be nattering to him. But the result 
in the House of Representatives has been better than was ex- 
pected. An address which I have not yet seen, but stated by our 
friends to be a very good one, passed the house with only twelve 
dissentients, confessedly of the most fiery spirits. The address 
is not only generally complimentary to the President, but includes, 
it is said, an explicit approbation of his administration, which caused 
the division. Edward Livingston is in the minority. 

After giving you these consolatory accounts, I am now to dash 
the cup a little, by telling you that Livingston is in all probability 
re-elected in this City. The principal cause has been an unac- 
ceptable candidate on our part, James Watson. There were four 
Gentlemen who would certainly have succeeded, but neither of 
them would accept. In Watson we could not unite opinions ; he 
was more disagreeable than I had supposed to a large body of our 
friends ; and yet after the declining of the four persons alluded 
to, we could not do otherwise than support him : for he had 
gotten a strong hold on most of the leading mechanics who act 
with us. 

But in the State at large, we shall better our representation, 
and I hope for a majority in the next house of Representatives. 
As an omen of this, there are several new me??ibers in Congress 
from different States, who hitherto vote with our friends. 

The favourable change in the conduct of Great Britain towards 
us strengthens the hand of the friends of order and peace. It is 
more to be desired that a Treatment in all respects unexception- 
able from that quarter should obviate all pretext to inflame the pub- 
lic mind. We are labouring hard to establish in this country 
principles more national and free from foreign ingredients ; so that 
we may be neither " Greeks nor Trojans," but truly American. 
Adieu. 

Affectly. yrs, 

A. Hamilton. 



R. King to Col. Humphries. 

London, Dec. 29, 1796. 

. . . Adet had announced to our Government, a decree of 
the Directory authorizing the capture of neutral vessels in like 



128 RUFUS KING. [*797 

manner and for the same causes as England captured them. Col. 
Pickering made a very proper reply to Mr. Adet's Note. I have 
not heard whether Mr. Pinckney has been reed, at Paris. I am 
^fc inclined to believe that he has been, or soon will be received. 
The object of the apparent displeasure of the Directory no longer 
requires this stately behaviour, and I therefore conclude that the 
Directory in France and Mr. Adet in America will return to their 
former and more reasonable course of proceeding towards us. 
Nothing is more certain than that we sincerely desire to live in 
harmony and friendship with France ; and of this Disposition we 
have given the most plain and solid proofs. We equally desire 
and are firmly resolved to be the independent Judges of our own 
interest and- concerns. We think ourselves able to manage our 
own affairs, and observing Justice towards every other Nation, 
we are willing to be left to govern our own. If it is essential to 
the continuation of a friendship with France, that we should sub- 
mit our Politicks and the Management of our affairs to their Guid- 
ance I think we shall not hesitate, or be embarrassed, in discovering 
our Duty. . . . 

Farewell, &c, &c, 

Rufus King. 

R. King to General Pinckney. 

London, Jany. 2, 1797. 

. . . I had thought much of your situation before Mr. Hall's 
arrival and I am convinced that the course you have pursued, has 
been the most proper that could have been adopted. It will require 
moderation, patience and firmness to finish the work you have so 
well begun. . . . 

I am, Dear Sir, truly yours, 

Rufus King. 

The above letter was written in answer to a communication 
addressed to the Secretary of State by Mr. Pinckney, giving 
to him an account of the conduct of the Directory of France, 
in not receiving him as Minister, succeeding Mr. Monroe, 
and of his own course ; he asked Mr. King to transmit the 



1 797 J LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 1 29 

same, first making a copy of it. It is an interesting state- 
ment of the circumstances connected with this refusal to 
receive him. 

In the following letter to Mr. Pinckney, Mr. King expresses 
most clearly the views he held in reference to the charges so 
often made against him and those who acted with him, of 
an extreme fondness for England in the opinions they held, 
controlling their actions in the public affairs of the country. 
They could not indeed conceal their fear of the dangers to be 
encountered in surrendering the conduct of our government 
into the power of those who were carried away by a most 
unreasoning admiration for French methods and the French 
ideas then so prevalent, which had been so disastrous to 
other nations. Nor could they fail to see that with all her 
acts of unkindness and insolent assumption towards us, Eng- 
land was indeed the bulwark against French aggrandizement, 
and the nation from which we might receive in the end the 
fairest treatment, and which would contribute most to the 
growth of our commercial interests, though at the time look- 
ing most persistently and even unjustly after her own. Com- 
mercially England and the United States have always been 
rivals, and at this time, the younger country was only begin- 
ning to win the respect of other nations and thus to lay the 
foundations on which she might command and maintain it. 

R. King to General Pinckney, Paris. 

London, Jany. 14, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . I have received no intelligence of the public opinion 
respecting Mr. Adet's Notes. The News Papers suggest that they 
have been published in order to influence the choice of a Presi- 
dent ; and not it is said without having in some measure answered 
the purpose with the Quakers of Pennsylvania. How humiliating 
is this Reflection ! On carefully attending to, and examining, 
these complaints of Mr. Adet, it is plain that no just cause of 
offence has been given by us to the French Government. Our 

VOL. II.— 9 



130 RUFUS KING. [1797 

real sin, however it may be desired to conceal it, has been that 
neither our interest, nor inclination, led us to make common cause 
with France in the war against England. Most of the complaints 
preferred by Mr. Adet have again and again been discussed and 
refuted. Those which grow out of the Treaty with this Country, 
are built on gross misrepresentations and are quite unfounded. 
The pretended Vexations of French Privateers and prizes and the 
countenance by our Government of British Equipments in our 
ports are equally uncandid and destitute of support. Every man 
who has resided in America must recollect the great trouble we 
have had by repeated attempts to equip French Privateers in our 
Ports, and to engage our People to embark in their enterprizes so 
repugnant to our Interest and our Laws ; and there is not a French- 
man who has visited our seaports who, if he will declare the truth, 
would not say that it has been impossible for the British openly to 
make an equipment of a single vessel in any of our Harbours. 
The most satisfactory answer might in my opinion be given to 
these notes, and such only I hope will be given ; an answer which 
shall expose and correct the misstatements with which Mr. Adet's 
Notes abound ; which shall demonstrate that we have been just to 
f ranee and impartial to all Nations ; that we are resolved to gov- 
ern our own, and that we continue to be earnestly desirous to 
cultivate in every way compatible with self-respect, and the inter- 
est and honor of our Country, the esteem, the good-will and the 
friendship of France, in whose welfare and prosperity we have at 
all times taken not only a sincere but an affectionate concern. 
No step, in my belief, would have been more impolitic, none will 
in the end be more injurious to a beneficial connection between 
America and France, than that lately adopted, unless it is suc- 
ceeded by one which Justice and sound Policy alike demand. I 
detest the idea that either France or England should really have 
any influence in the Government of America. I will not believe 
that such is our degraded condition. From causes too plain to be 
mistaken and too considerable not to have some influence there 
have existed a strong regard and sincere friendship among the 
people of America for those of France ; but these have their limits 
and can be overcome. Much as France has been beloved, our own 
character, our honor, our national Independence not only of 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 131 

France, but of all the rest of the world, are infinitely more dear 
to us than the interest we have taken in whatever concerned 
France. This will be proved beyond a doubt if France persists. 
But I will not tire you with observations which you must feel and 
know to be true. I still hope that you will witness more modera- 
tion, and experience a Treatment less extraordinary and more 
friendly than you have hitherto received. . . . 

Truly yrs., 

Rufus King.

London, Jany. 14, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

We sometime since were uneasy on account of certain embarrass- 
ments which for a time arrested the proceedings of the Commis- 
sioners and threatened to defeat the purposes of their appointment. 
These difficulties I have reason to think are overcome, a pretty 
full explanation of the extent of the Provision of the Seventh 
Article has taken place between me and this Government, and I 
now flatter myself that the Commissioners will not in future ex- 
perience any serious obstructions to the fair and full execution 
of their Trust. I reserve a more detailed report on this subject 
to a future opportunity.* Very few American Vessels have for 
some time past been taken by the British Cruizers in these seas. 
Three or four American ships bound with rich cargoes from 
Surinam to Amsterdam have been sent in and are in the course 

* See Appendix III. 
132 



1797] MF& A ND CORRESPONDENCE, 1 33 

of an admiralty trial. Some discoveries unfavorable to the Amer- 
ican claims have in one or two of these cases been made and operate 
against others in the same Trade* 

I have for some time been endeavouring to obtain from Mr. 
Bayard an abstract, classing in a manner I have indicated to him 
the whole of the American claims. I hope soon to obtain it, 
when I shall be able to judge what measures remain to be adopted 
in order that we may not be charged with Delay, negligence or 
wilful omission. I am not however without my fears that this 
business has been conducted in a manner that we may have cause 
to regret. The mutual Reliance of the Claimants and of the 
Government on each other may have prevented either from ob- 
taining such Documents and Proofs as may be found requisite to 
substantiate our Claims. What our true situation is in this respect, 
I cannot discover because / have not been able to obtain such a view 
of the agency of Mr. B. and of the cases in his care as is necessary 
for this purpose. I hope we shall not ultimately find that greater 
talents were requisite in this agency than those that have been 
employed in it ; and it will be a real relief if I shall find the 
business in such a situation that past omissions can still be 
remedied. ... I have intended at an earlier period to mention to 
you the expediency of precise instructions respecting the Receit, 
deposit and Payment to the Proprietors of such Sums of money as may 
be paid upon the claims under the care of Mr. Bayard. I have sug- 
gested to you my opinion on the subject of costs advanced by the 
Governments ; and I have lately learned that Mr. Bayard expects 
and perhaps will claim a commission upon all sums paid by him to 
those to whom it belongs. Having a strong and I think just aver- 
sion to the blending of public and private Duties and the mingling 
of pub. with priv. emoluments, I disapprove of this course of pro- 
ceeding. In my opinion the pay of the Government ought to be 
considered as the only compensation of its agents, and all monies 
received by such agents on account of any of our citizens, ought 
to be paid to them without any deduction except of the advances 
for costs made on their account by the Government. The 
national character and the interests of individuals will in this 
manner be best secured. 

* Sentences in italics are in cipher here and elsewhere. 



134 RUFUS KING. [1797 

The money when received should be deposited with some safe 
banker, notice should be given to the Proprietors of the amount 
of their respective Portions, on whose Drafts, or to whose Agents 
duly authorized the same would be paid without delay or deduc- 
tion. It will be easy to form a proper rule on this subject, its 
promulgation in America will put the Claimants on their guard 
against improper demands, and moreover will enable them to make 
seasonable arrangements for the Reception of their Money. 

As this Business is in some degree connected with the Duties 
of my office, I think it due to myself as well as to the public inter- 
est, to intimate my Ideas on the subject. Knowing that, in 
pecuniary concerns in which the public as well as individuals are 
interested, nothing short of the utmost circumspection can shield 
a man from suspicions that often fasten themselves upon 
him. , . . 

With perfect Respect, 

Rufus King. 



R. King to Genl. Pinckney. 

London, Jany. 20, 1797. 

. . I send you a few of the latest American Papers 
that I have received. They contain the President's Speech to 
Congress, and the address of the two Houses in answer. They 
have afforded me much satisfaction, as I consider them as strong 
Testimonials of what all my letters concur in stating to be the case> 
that the public opinion, taking the country at large, is sound and 
right ; the addresses of the two Houses are not only highly com- 
plimentary to the President, but they contain an explicit approba- 
tion of his administration. Principles more and more national 
appear in every quarter of the Union, strong marks of displeasure 
on the subject of foreign influence and foreign interferences in 
our affairs are likewise seen in the different News Papers ; so that 
I think it will be soon perceived that we are neither Greeks nor 
Trojans, but truly Americans. . . . 

Farewell, yrs. very Sincerely, 

Rufus King. 



17971 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 1 35 



R. Troup to R. King. 

New York, 28 Jan., 1797. 
My Dear Sir : 

Our election for President and Vice President 

has terminated. It is admitted on all hands that Adams is to 

be our President and Jefferson our Vice President. . . . 

The Eastern States were afraid of voting generally for Pinckney 

lest they should make him outstrip Adams ; and this policy has 

lost us one of our Candidates. Burr was left very much in the 

background ; even in Virginia where his greatest strength was 

supposed to lie he had but one vote. The antifederal party affect 

at present to be well pleased with the fate of the election, and 

they are now fraternizing with Adams and his particular friends 

and endeavoring to raise an opinion that Hamilton and his friends 

E'ted to bring Pinckney forward in preference to him. In this 
e we voted unanimously Adams and Pinckney. This was the 
also with New Jersey. As the event of the election was all 
important and extremely critical, we judged it the soundest policy 
to take a double chance — the contrary policy put everything at 
hazard, and we have made a hairbreadth escape. Jefferson, his 
friends say, will serve. 

The public mind is at present much engaged with the letter 
from our Secretary of State to our Minister at Paris, in answer to 
Mr. Adet's note of the 15th of November last. ... I 
think Mr. Pickering has given a satisfactory refutation to all the 
charges contained in Mr. Adet's note. . . . Adet and 
his party have injured their cause by the means they have 
taken. I have not met a man who does not condemn his note. 
All the friends of peace, which constitute the great mass of our 
fellow citizens consider it as one of the most insulting and 
offensive addresses that ever was made to a government or a peo- 
ple. Ad et having suspended .himsje]f remains suspended. . . . 
What is to be the result of the present state of things with 
France we cannot even conjecture. The general opinion is that 
we shall rub along without a war. An embargo has lately been 
talked of in consequence of the serious depredations on our com- 
merce in the West Indies by the French ; but I doubt whether 
the measure will be adopted. . . . 



136 RUFUS KING. [1797 

The only subject which during the present sessions (of Con- 
gress) has occasioned any warmth in the House of Representa- 
tives, is a resolution which lately passed for calling upon the 
debtor States to pay their balances. Lawrance writes me that he is 
not without hopes of a satisfactory result. 

The payment of the balance due, or appearing to be due from 
this State is a subject much debated with us. I confess I feel 
awkwardly and unpleasantly on the occasion. If we are called 
upon to pay, our State will give an answer that I presume will go 
into the merits of the claim. W. Smith of South Carolina has 
been very active in Congress in urging the claim. Benson says he 
is the last man in the world to have engaged in the measure. 
What will be the final issue of this business is very uncertain. It 
certainly creates embarrassment and excites feelings that are to be 
regretted. . . . 

Burr is now here. He has during the present session paid lit- 
tle, or no, attention to his duties in the Senate. It is whispered 
that his money engagements are embarrassing to him. . . . 

By the by, do you know that I am Lawrance's successor — the 
fact is undoubtedly so. I have in consequence begun to powder 
my hair — and in a full suit of black with powdered hair I have 
appeared on the bench thus far with some advantage. All admire 
the decorum and gravity with which I conduct myself. Hamilton 
and Lawrance are the cause of my metamorphose. . . . 
You have no conception how high the necessaries of life, labour, 
&c, still continue. Every month brings after it some addition to 
prices. The pressure for money in every part of the continent is 
beyond example. This arises from the large sum locked up in 
France ; the depredations upon our trade by the French which 
are enormous ; the over speculations as well by merchants, as by 
land-jobbers, and other causes that will readily occur to you. 
Failures here are becoming common ; not a man amongst us that 
is in business but what is extremely driven for money. . . . 
This state of things is a source of innumerable mischiefs to us, 
and I pray that we may soon experience a release. . . . 

Hamilton has for some time past been laid up with a lame leg, 
got by watching the City. Have you heard that within two 
months past frequent attempts have been made to burn the City ? 
It is the case. The like attempts have been made in Philadel- 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE, 1 37 

phia. Who are concerned in them, or what in particular has 
led to them we cannot discover. The consequence, however, has 
been a serious alarm, which produced a nightly watch consisting 
of about 20 in each ward. From this duty no person is considered 
as exempt if health will permit his service. A few nights ago 
Col. Hamilton and Col. Troup had the honor of being reduced to 
the ranks, serving under Capt. Low, ci-devant Governor Low. I 
do not believe the watching in this way will continue much 
longer ; the fear has lessened. . . 

Very sincerely and affectionately, 

Rob. Troup.

Dear Sir : 

In one or two conversations with the Turkish Ambassador at 
this court relating to a Treaty of Commerce, I should infer, if reli- 
ance can be placed on his opinion, that there would not be much diffi- 
culty in our concluding a valuable Treaty with that Power. On this 
subject I take the liberty to inclose a letter sent to me by Mr. 
Bird which has been addressed to him by Mr. Abot, who was born 
& has for many years resided at Constantinople. . . . 

Rufus King. 



R. King to Lord Grenville. 

Great Cumberland Place, Jany. 24, 1797. 
My Lord : 

From considerations perfectly respectful to his Majesty's govern- 
ment, it is with reluctance that I find myself obliged to represent 
to your Lordship the numerous complaints of the delays which 
have been experienced by the American citizens and which con- 
tinue to prevent decisions in the causes pending in the High 
Court of Admiralty. These causes are very important both in 
number and value. Many of them for a very long time have been 
ready for trial ; in all of them the Claimants are exposed to heavy 
expenses in the prosecution of their claims, and in some instances 
they are threatened with heavy losses by the detention of their 



138 RUFUS KING. [1797 

property, in consequence of which other of their commercial con- 
cerns are deranged and placed in a ruinous situation. I am 
sensible that a prompt administration of Justice by his Majesty's 
Courts is enjoined by the highest and most venerable Authority. 
I likewise know that this authority is equally obligatory upon the 
highest court of Admiralty as upon the other Branches of the 
judicial Department, in addition to which, the act commonly 
called the Prize act, conformable to the equitable and just Princi- 
ples of public Law, prescribes and limits the time within which 
all Questions of Prize shall be decided by this court. It would ill 
become me, my Lord, to inquire into the causes of the delays 
complained of, if on investigation these complaints shall appear 
to be well founded ; but it is my duty to state to your Lordship 
that a long catalogue of American Causes, in which these cap- 
tures took place so long ago, as the period when the Island of 
Martinique was conquered by his Majesty's Forces, and in which 
the Claimants for a long time have been prepared for Trial, 
remain undecided ; and that others, some of which are attended 
with circumstances of peculiar hardship, are likewise ready for a 
hearing, but no decision can be had. 

Having full reliance upon the Justice of his Majesty's Govern- 
ment, and being likewise impressed with the belief that the 
subject of these complaints is not without a remedy, I take the 
liberty to request your Lordship's interference in order that, by 
such means as shall be deemed proper, future delays may be pre- 
vented, and a speedy Trial be had in the said American Causes. 

With the greatest satisfaction, I avail myself of this occasion to 
assure your Lordship of the high consideration with which I have 
the honor to be your obed. & very humble servant. 

Rufus King. 



R. King to Lord Grenville. 

Great Cumberland Place, Jany. 28, 1797. 
My Lord : 

I have the honor to send your Lordship the copy of a Law of 
the United States for the relief and protection of American Sea- 
men, likewise the copy of an Instruction given by the President 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 1 39 

to the Collectors of the several Districts, which supplies an omis- 
sion in this Law and prescribes the Evidence, on which alone 
Certificates of Citizenship may be granted by such Collectors, and 
also a copy of the first section of the law of the United States 
prescribing an uniform Rule of naturalization. I flatter myself 
that your Lordship will perceive in these Documents the care and 
caution that the American Government have observed, in order 
that those only who are justly entitled should obtain Certificates 
of American Citizenship. It is not my present purpose to enter 
into an Examination of the precise limits of the Consular Juris- 
diction and Functions, which your Lordship conceives do not 
extend to give a right to the American Consuls to grant Cer- 
tificates of Citizenship to the Seamen of that Nation, who come, 
or are brought within his Majesty's Dominions ; I think it how- 
ever my Duty to observe, that on careful Enquiry I find it to 
have been the antient practice of the Consuls of Maritime Nations, 
resident within his Majesty's Dominions, ex officio, to grant Cer- 
tificates of this kind ; and that this practice is still, as I am 
informed, pursued by the Consuls of Denmark, Sweden & Portu- 
gal, and probably by those of other Nations. * I ought also to 
add that from the best Examination I have been able to give the 
subject, I cannot but be of the opinion, with becoming deference 
for the Sentiments of his Majesty's Government, that, under 
proper Regulations, the Exercise of this Power is both an im- 
portant, and especially between America & Great Britain, the 
most material, portion of the Consular Rights. I make this ob- 
servation, my Lord, not to invite a discussion of the Question, 
but for the sole purpose of precluding any Inference that might 
result from its not having been made on this occasion. 

The object of this communication is to represent to your Lord- 
ship, that in consequence of the relations of Peace and friendship 
subsisting between America and Great Britain which give, and of 
the fourteenth Article of the Treaty lately concluded between 
them which confirms, to the People and Inhabitants of the United 

* See Lord Grenville; Letter to R. K., p. 119 of this volume, denying this 
right and requesting R. K. to notify the Consuls to abstain from granting 
these Certificates as "neither sanctioned by the law and usage of nations, 
nor by any treaty between the two Govts." 



140 RUFUS KING. [1797 

States, a Right, securely to resort to, and to reside in his Majesty's 
European Dominions, great numbers of American Citizens, and 
especially of the class which compose the Seamen engaged in the 
American Navigation, are from Time to Time arriving within, and 
in the prosecution of their lawful concerns frequenting, his 
Majesty's said European Dominions, many of whom have no Cer- 
tificates of Citizenship, in some instances having omitted to obtain 
the same within the United States, and in others the Certificates, 
which had been so obtained, having by the casualties of sea- 
faring Lives been destroyed. These seamen who cannot easily 
be distinguished by language or manners from those of Great 
Britain, are while employed on board American Ships, and on 
Shore, daily seized, and contrary to their will, impressed into his 
Majesty's Service, to the manifest injury of their personal Rights, 
and to the material detriment and disadvantage of the American 
Navigation and Commerce. So long as our Consuls were in the 
Practice of granting Protections to American Seamen, these in- 
juries and inconveniences were less frequent, and more easily 
remedied. The Laws of the United States authorize, but do not 
compel, their Seamen to take out Certificates of Citizenship, within 
the United States ; and the Practice is not uncommon, that they 
omit to obtain such Certificates ; and place their dependence 
upon the assistance of the Consuls in case of interruption in any 
of the Ports of his Majesty's European Dominions. 

Some few irregularities, it is possible, may unintentionally have 
happened in the granting of Protections by the American Consuls, 
as no precise instructions for the Regulation of their Conduct in 
this respect, have heretofore been given to them. To avoid 
similar irregularities in future, and to afford the Protection which 
is indispensably due to the American Seamen within his Majesty's 
European Dominions, I have the honor to submit to your Lord- 
ship, the following propositions — 

1. That the American Consuls shall hereafter grant Certificates 
of Citizenship, in the Form prescribed in the inclosed Law, to 
such American Seamen as shall prove themselves entitled to 
receive the same. 

2. In order that no persons, except those who are so entitled, 
should receive such Certificates, That an instruction similar, to 
and founded upon that given by the President to the Collectors, 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE, 141 

should be given by me to the several American Consuls for the 
government of their conduct. 

3. That instructions should be given by the proper Department 
of his Majesty's Government, to his Majesty's Naval Officers to 
respect such Certificates issued by the American Consuls. 

Convinced of the Disposition of his Majesty's Government to 
remove effectually and as fast as possible every cause of In- 
quietude and Discontent between the two countries and to 
strengthen the good understanding and friendship which subsist 
between them, I persuade myself that your Lordship will see no 
objection sufficiently weighty to prevent the early Adoption of 
the Propositions, which appear to me, my Lord, to be essential to 
the security of the commerce and navigation of my Country. 

I cannot express to your Lordship in language too strong, my 
thorough conviction of the importance of this Subject to the 
Mutual Harmony of the two Countries, which it is my earnest 
Desire should be uninterrupted and perpetual ; nor can I cease 
to entertain the Expectation that his Majesty's Government will, 
with as little Delay as possible, meet the overtures of the United 
States and proceed to those mutual Discussions, which, it is be- 
lieved, must lead to the permanent settlement of Principles and 
Rules, by which the Seamen, belonging to the respective Nations, 
may in all Situations hereafter be known & distinguished. 

This done, the Regulations that I have the honor to submit to 
your Lordship's consideration, will cease to be necessary. 
With high consideration, &c, 

Rufus King. 



R. King to Col. Hamilton. 

London, Feb. 6, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

I have had the pleasure to receive your letter of the 16th of 
Deer., and I need not express the satisfaction, which the informa- 
tion that it contained afforded me. The probable termination of 
the Election of Pr., the general Temper of the Country, and the 
Effect likely to be produced by Mr. Adet's Notes, are such as I 
had not only hoped but expected : if by prudence and Firmness, 



142 RUFUS KING. [1797 

which have hitherto kept us out of this extraordinary and deso- 
lating war, we shall be able to maintain the public peace and na- 
tional Honor, we shall not only increase our Reputation as a wise 
people, but we shall moreover establish a Precedent of inestima- 
ble worth for future Times of Trouble and Embarrassment. Noth- 
ing can exceed the applause that is given here to our Government, 
and no American who has not been in England can have a just 
Idea of the admiration expressed among all Parties of General 
Washington. It is a common observation that he is not only the 
most illustrious but also the most meritorious character that has 
hitherto appeared. The King is without doubt a very popular 
character among the People of this Nation : it would be saying 
very much to affirm, that next to him, General Washington is the 
most popular character among them, and yet I verily believe this 
to be the fact. 

I mention these Circumstances, not only because it will give 
you, as it has afforded me, much pleasure to hear them mentioned, 
but also because they show a more liberal manner of thinking and 
speaking respecting us, and a more rational estimate of our affairs 
than formerly existed. Much credit is due to Mr. Jay on this 
Score, who we thought would do honor and be of advantage to 
our country, but who has done much more than I could have 
imagined, had I not seen the clearest proofs of his success. He had 
great difficulties to encounter, he overcame many of them, some 
still exist & when they will be removed I am unable to say. Time 
and patience are necessary to form a satisfactory opinion how far 
we shall finally be able to agree. In the main our affairs here are 
in a good train, the treaty I think will be fairly and fully executed. 
You remember the opinion given by certain Gentlemen upon the 
Construction of the 7th Article of the Treaty. We have experienced 
embarrassments on this subject, and for several weeks the busi- 
ness of the Commissioners was entirely at a stand ; the advocate 
of this Government having denied their Power to examine any 
question that had been decided by the H. Court of Appeals. The 
question was delicate ; the pride, and as it was alleged, the im- 
portance of men of Rank and Influence were almost enlisted 
against our pretensions ; and a little imprudence might have 
thrown the Business into the worst possible situation : this did 
not happen ; with moderation, caution and a conciliatory mode of 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 1 43 

proceeding these difficulties have been entirely removed, and all 
is now proceeding in a satisfactory manner. The result of several 
conferences has been, after the manifestation of much candor 
and fairness on the part of this Government, a direction to the 
British Commissioners to unite with ours and to proceed to hear 
and decide every question that shall be brought before them ac- 
cording to the Provisions of the Treaty, which it was added it was 
the Duty of the Commrs. to consider and interpret. . . . 

By letters received to-day from Paris, I have the unpleasant 
information that Genl. Pinckney was on the 28th ulto. ordered by 
the Directory to leave Paris, and that he intended to depart for 
Holland (where he will wait the orders of our Govt.) on the 31st. 
I cannot fully account for this step, after the irresolution that for 
some time has existed ; whether it is to be ascribed to information 
which has been thought sufficient to satisfy the Directory of the 
Result of the Election for Pr., or whether it is to be attributed to 
the late astonishing victories of Buonaparte, which have latterly 
destroyed an army of 40,000 Austrians, I am uncertain ; perhaps 
both have contributed to this extraordinary step. 

Yours very sincerely 
Rufus King. 

R. King to Genl. Washington. 

London, Feby. 6, 1797. 

Sir : 

I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 22d of De- 
cember. Count Rumford being in Bavaria, I have requested the 
minister of that country at this court, to forward your letter to the 
count with his next dispatch. . . . 

Our affairs here relative to the execution of the Treaty are in a 
good train ; some delays and difficulties have existed, but they 
exist no longer, and the Commissioners are going on in a satisfac- 
tory manner. In the Conferences that I have had with this 
Government upon these and other Topics, I have found them 
candid and impartial in as great a degree as I had expected. 
Several important points not settled by the Treaty still remain 
open ; and both time and patience are requisite even now to form 
a safe opinion how far we shall in the end be able to agree. I 
think I am not deceived in supposing that a sincere and general 



144 RUFUS KING. [1797 

desire exists in this country to live in harmony and friendship 
with us. This disposition is however fettered and enfeebled by- 
Prejudices and Opinions connected with the national commerce 
and marine, which make the Government slow and cautious in 
every step which has a reference to these important concerns. 
Some uneasiness has been manifested here for some few weeks 
past concerning the situation of the British Territories in the E. 
Indies. It is not very easy to obtain good information upon this 
Subject, but there is reason to believe that much disaffection 
exists among the native troops in the Company's Service. The 
Establishment is understood to be 20,000 Europeans and 60,000 
native or Black troops. Whatever the origin of these discontents 
may have been, and they are supposed to be of several years' 
standing, they have lately risen to such a pitch that the local Gov- 
ernment of India has been compelled first to temporise, and then, 
as is commonly the consequence, to submit to measures they were 
unable to prevent. Lord Cornwallis is suddenly to be sent to 
Bengal, and with such extensive powers as it is hoped will enable 
him to restore tranquillity. What may be his success my w 
accurate information forbids me to conjecture. . . . 
With perfect Respect, I have the honor, &c. 

Rufus King. 



R. King to Lord Grenville. 

Great Cumberland Place, Feby. 10, 1797. 
Mv Lord : 

Long antecedent to the year 1775, the Assembly of the Colony 
of Maryland invested a large sum of money, collected from the 
Inhabitants thereof, in the capital stock of the Bank of England. 
The object of this investment was to aid the credit and promote 
the local welfare of the Inhabitants of the colony. This Stock for 
the convenience of its management was purchased, and stood, in 
the names of certain British subjects, resident in England. The 
Dividends pursuant to the direction of the Colony's Legislature, 
were, for a series of years, invested in the same stock, and thus 
the property belonging to the said Colony in the year 1775, had 
increased to the sum of Twenty-nine Thousand Pounds sterling 
of the said capital stock of the Bank of England. 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 1 45 

The Trustees continuing to reinvest the Dividends, have thereby 
since augmented the said Property to a still greater sum. In the 
year 1783, the Legislature of the State of Maryland authorized the 
appointment of an agent for the purpose of receiving from the said 
Trustees, or their Survivors, a transfer of the said stock, together 
with all monies that had arisen from the same, & which had not 
been reinvested. One of the said Trustees having refused to join 
in such Transfer & Payment, a Suit or Suits were instituted in 
his Majesty's high Court of Chancery to compel the same. These 
Suits, in which his Majesty's attorney-general has been made a 
party, are still depending, and the State of Maryland is unable to 
obtain possession of the said property, inasmuch as it is ailed ged 
that the Crown has an interest in the same. In this Situation the 
State of Maryland made application to the President of the United 
States, who has instructed me to employ such proper means as 
should be deemed advisable, in order to obtain for the said State 
the possession and enjoyment of the said Property. 

Without entering into a discussion of the Reasons on which the 
right of his Majesty is supposed to be founded, my full and per- 
fect confidence in his Majesty's equity induces me to rely with 
Satisfaction that his Majesty, when he shall be informed of the 
nature and circumstances of this case, will be pleased to relinquish 
the claim to the said Property, that the Crown has been supposed 
to have, and that in consequence of the Request, which in obedi- 
ence to the Instructions of the President of the United States I 
have the honor to make, his Majesty will moreover authorize and 
appoint, that the said Property should be assigned transferred and 
paid to me, by the Accomptant General of his Majesty's high 
Court of Chancery (in whose possession the same is) to and for 
the use of the State of Maryland. 

From the experience that my short Residence near his Majesty 
has given me, of your Lordship's disposition to countenance and 
assist those measures which are truly calculated to increase and 
confirm the Harmony and good will that happily subsist between 
the United States & Great Britain, I feel assured on this occasion 
of your Lordship's good offices and obliging interference, which 
I take the liberty to solicit. 

With high consideration I have the honor &c. &c. 

Rufus King.

T. Pickering to R. King. 

Department of State, Feby. 15, 1797. 

. . . By the news papers you will find Mr. Monroe's infor- 
mation mentioned in your letter of Oct. 10th has been more than 
verified. The French armed vessels have captured ours not only 
when they had enemy's property or contraband goods on board, 
according to the enumeration of such goods in our Treaty with 
Great Britain but merely because they were going to or from a 
British port. This has been done in Europe. Two American 
vessels had been carried into Spain by French Privateers, about 
the 10th of September last, before even the general Decree of the 
Directory (of July 2d) had been made known to our Consuls, and 
the French Consul at Cadiz avowed his authority to condemn 
them, under the order of the Directory. 

But in the West Indies, the proceedings of the public agents 
and of the Privateers have set all justice at defiance. Lanthonax 
and the other commissioners at St. Domingo have issued a decree 
explicitly directing the capture of American (not generally 
Neutral} vessels bound to or from a British Port. Great numbers 
have been taken under this order. . . . 

The letters received from Col. Talbot (agent to the British W. 
Indies) show that his mission has been, and will be useful in 
liberating some of our seamen and preventing the impressment of 
others. Admiral Harney at Martinico and Admiral Bligh at 
Jamaica treated him with the utmost politeness, released the 
Americans found on board their own ships, and gave orders for 
the discharge of all found in the ships under their command. But 
some of the Commanders of Ships behaved very differently and 
reluctantly complied with the order of the Admirals, or in part 
evaded them ; at the same time treating Col. Talbot with dis- 
respect. Hence we feel strongly the necessity of some other 
arrangement for the protection of our Citizens, and which it was 
hoped you would have been able to accomplish. But the subject 
presents many difficulties, especially when you look beyond the 
protection of native citizens ; and your design of using concilia- 
tory means in the negotiation can alone be eligible. 

Timothy Pickering.

In Cipher. 

Feby. 15, 1797. 

Sir: 

We have often heard that the French Government contemplated 
the repossession of Louisiana, and it has been conjectured that 
in their negotiations with Spain the cession of Louisiana and the 
Floridas may have been agreed on. You will see all the mischief 
to be apprehended from such an event ; the Spaniards will cer- 
tainly be more safe and quiet neighbours ; for her own sake Spain 
should absolutely refuse to make these cessions. 

One of our citizens who resided many years at New Orleans, 
and who was acquainted with Don Galvez, who had been Viceroy 
of Mexico, says Don Galvez considered Louisiana, notwithstand- 
ing the distance between them, as the door of Mexico, and con- 
sequently of the highest importance to Spain to retain in her 
hands. We do not know what opportunity can occur to you for 
throwing obstacles in the way of the conclusion of this project 
of the French Government. We know it has been an object very 
dear to them ; it was expressly avowed by one of their ministers 
here to Mr. Randolph. Mr. Adet said " he knew that the cession 
of Louisiana to France was a preliminary to be insisted on by France 
as a negotiation with Spain." We are happy to recollect that the 
public Treaty between them announced only the cession of the 
Spanish part of St. Domingo, which we hoped was offered and ac- 
cepted as an equivalent for Louisiana, and that Spain would not 
yield the latter. The President desires that you will keep this 
affair in your mind to discover whether the design exists and to 
counteract it by any proper , should your situation put any- 
thing in your power. 

A. Hamilton to R. King. 

Feby. 15, 1797. 

My Dr Sir : 

. . . You must not think I forget you because I do not 
write (for this is only my third letter). I am overwhelmed in 
professional business, and have scarcely a moment for anything 
else. 



148 RUFUS KING. [1797 

You will have learnt the terrible depredations which the French 
have committed upon our Trade in the West Indies, on the de- 
clared principle of intercepting our whole Trade with the ports of 
Jier enemies. This conduct is making the impression which might 
be expected, though not with that electric rapidity which would 
have attended similar Treatment from another power. The 
present session of Congress is likely to be very unproductive. 
That body is in the situation which we foresaw certain Anti- 
executive maxims would bring them to. 

Mr. Adams is President, Mr. Jefferson Vice President. Our 
Jacobins say they are well pleased, and that the Lion & the Lamb 
are to lie down together. Mr. Adams' personal friends talk a 
little in the same way. Mr. Jefferson is not half so ill a man as 
we have been accustomed to think him. There is to be a united 
and vigorous administration. Sceptics like me quietly look for- 
ward to the event, willing to hope, but not prepared to believe. 
If Mr. Adams has Vanity, 't is plain, a plot has been laid to take 
hold of it. We trust his real good sense and integrity will be a 
sufficient shield. 

Yrs. affectly.

R. King to Richard Codman, Paris.

Dear Sir : 

I have had the pleasure to receive your favor by Mr. Whitte- 
more and am pleased to hear that no unfavorable change in the 
situation of our Countrymen in Paris has taken place since the 
departure of General Pinckney. We have nothing new from 
home, but every day expect the confirmation of Mr. Adams' elec- 
tion to the Presidency. I regret very much the apparent mis- 
understanding between our country and France. As we think 
and act respecting National Rights and Duties different from any 
of the European Nations — always preferring peace to war, with 
the same decision as we prefer the friendship to the enmity of 
France, I am persuaded that we shall display in our conduct upon 
this occasion a wisdom and moderation which will compose an 
honorable contrast to the ill advised and erroneous proceedings 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE, 1 49 

of those who are without a title to the character of the real 
friends of France or America. We shall incontestably prove, 
notwithstanding the sounding, and often-repeated, Professions of 
France, that we are in reality more sincere friends to her and her 
interests than she is or has been to us, and ours. Against her 
creeds of Republicanism, we shall place the modesty, the justice 
and the firmness of real Republicans. Hence I conclude that 
there will be no war between France and America, unless France 
makes war upon us, which I hope and believe she will be too wise 
and just to do. . . . 

Very sincerely yrs.

Thomas Pinckney to R. King, London. 

Charleston, Feby. 21, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

I have to thank you for your favor of the 19th of November 
enclosing sundry letters to my address. I wish I had any agree- 
able intelligence to communicate to you from this country, but 
great commercial distress in our cities, our trade much harassed 
in the American seas, particularly by the cruizers of the French 
Republic, & much party spirit prevailing within our country, form 
the general description of our affairs. This spirit of party was 
particularly called forth by the late election & I feel extremely 
happy that I was not called upon to sacrifice my domestic tran-

I hope you are now compleatly settled to your satisfaction in

150 RUFUS KING. [*797 

R. King to Secretary of State. 

London, Mar. 5, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

The unexpected and total defeat of the Austrians in Lombardy, 
followed by the fall of Mantua, to which the Treasure of the 
neighbouring country had been removed for safety, produced a 
serious despondency in the public Opinion of this country. The 
expedition against Ireland, tho' it failed, increased the public 
inquietude, by refuting the consoling opinion that England was 
safe against invasion, so long as she could maintain a decided 
superiority upon the Ocean. The effects of these events have been 
strengthened by the continuation of the practice of alarming the 
Country in order that the means of prosecuting the war might more 
easily be obtained* The consequence has been that the Fears and 
Despondency of the Nation have been such, as to materially 
impair that confidence so necessary in conducting the affairs of 
every Nation, and without which the means of administering this 
Government are annihilated. The alarm first commenced in the 
country, and the provincial Banks, being pressed for Specie 
beyond the customary demand, had recourse to the Metropolis, 
and the Bank of England was put in requisition to supply their 
wants. The National Stocks in which most of the Provincial 
Banks had invested a Portion of their Capitals, were in this 
Emergency brought in large sums into the market, for the purpose 
of being converted into Specie, and thereby the Funds suffered an 
alarming Depression. This joined to the Failure of several country 
Banks increased the public apprehensions and augmented the 
Demands for Specie upon the Bank of England. The quantity 
of Specie in the Vaults of the Bank is not publicly known, but 
without Doubt it has always been much beneath the sum generally 
supposed to be deposited there. The strongest objection, or at 
least one of them, against the Bank combination is that Bank 
Paper, in itself of little or no value, excludes from the country in 
too great a degree real money or specie, which possesses intrinsic 
worth. Credit has nowhere been more perfect than in England, 
and the Substitution of Paper, including the public stocks as well 
as bank notes, in lieu of Specie, been equally extensive and gen-

eral in any other Country, and to this cause in a considerable 
degree must be ascribed the small quantity of actual Coin to be 
found in England, compared with the sum in circulation in other 
Commercial Countries. 

It is not extraordinary then that the principal Depository of the 
national Coin, when called on at a period of Despondency and 
of general alarm, to give it in exchange for that which had before 
passed as of equal value, because it was esteemed an instant power 
over an equivalent Sum, should be unable either from its actual 
deposits, or from the contributions of its Patrons and Friends to 
perform its Engagements. This was in fact discovered to be the 
Situation of the Bank of England on Saturday, the 26th of Feb- 
ruary ; and on the communication thereof to the Chancellor of 
the Exchequer, the King was brought from Windsor on Sunday 
to attend a Council, which passed an Order requiring the Bank to 
stop the further issue of Specie ; and accordingly on Monday the 
28th, the Bank refused Specie for their notes, and also to their 
other creditors. Committees were immediately named by the 
several Houses of Parliament, to examine the affairs of the Bank, 
which have reported the amount of the Debts which the Bank owe, 
and likewise of the Debts due to the Bank, together with their 
other effects (exclusive of their funded capital) applicable to the 
payment of their Engagements. The result of these Reports con- 
firms the Declaration of the Directors, that there is a difference 
of more than three millions sterling in favor of the Bank, between 
the amount of debts they owe and that of the effects applicable to 
the payment thereof. 

Parliament have passed two Bills, one enabling the Bank to issue 
notes for any sum less than £$. ; the other enabling the Manu- 
facturers, Bankers and others, to issue small notes payable on 
Demand, which by the existing Laws they were prohibited to do. 
The object of the first has been to enable the Bank to supply the 
Absence of Guineas by 20/ and 40/ notes ; and of the second, to 
allow the Manufacturers who employ great numbers of workmen, 
whom they pay weekly, to give them their own notes in lieu of 
Specie. Parliament will probably go on, and pass another Bill 
sanctioning and continuing for a limited Time the Prohibition 
upon the Bank to issue Specie ; they will likewise make Bank 
notes receivable in Payment of Taxes, and also by the public 



152 RUFUS KING. [1797 

Creditor in Payment of the Annuities, or Dividends upon the 
National Debt. Associations have been formed in London, and 
throughout the Kingdom to receive and circulate Bank Notes ; 
and for a time this may secure to them a general currency. But 
unless they can be converted into Specie, they will depreciate : 
indeed they are at this moment at a depreciation, by the Prefer- 
ence that universally exists of Gold and Silver, which have 
disappeared and are no longer in Circulation. 

This Depreciation is proved likewise by the sudden rise of for- 
eign Exchange and also by the Demand for the American Stocks, 
which have risen since the Bank stopped payment in Specie. 
Bank Stock from ^103 to ^117 per share. Six per cents from 
80 to 90 per cent ; three per cents from 49 to 55 per cent : while 
the British three per cents have vibrated between 50 and 52 per 
cent. It is commonly said that this Embarrassment will be but 
of short Duration, and that the Bank will soon resume its former 
course of payments ; but I do not see the subject in this favora- 
ble Light. What influence the event may have on the Duration 
of the war, what changes it may effect in the Ministry, in short what 
misfortunes this event will draw down upon this nation, is beyond 
human foresight to discern. I see but little chance against a Na- 
tional Bankruptcy ; an event that the progressive accumulation of 
their public Debt has menaced but which no one seems to have sup- 
posed so near at hand* 

With perfect respect &c.

R. King to Secretary of State. 

London, March 12, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . We are embarrassed to decide how far the french Gov- 
ernment will carry their measures of vexation towards our Com- 
merce : Though but few Instances of Captures have occurred in 
these Seas, yet these joined to the apparent misunderstanding

1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 1 53 

between us and France, have imposed a heavy Tax upon our 
Commerce with this country by the enormous increase of Pre- 
miums demanded and given to insure our Ships & Cargoes. . . . 
The persons principally concerned in the American Business, as 
well as the underwriters upon the American Ships & Cargoes 
have been desirous that our Ships and Cargoes should take a British 
Convoy ; a committee of merchants have applied to this government 
on the subject. This was all without consulting me, an opinion being 
entertained, as I am informed, that it would not be advisable that I 
should be consulted, since it was supposed that I should not think my- 
self authorized to give the measure my support. From several indi- 
rect suggestions I had seen that the Government would order a 
Convoy if I should ask it. I had therefore well considered the sub- 
ject before this movement among the merchants occurred. I saw it to 
be a measure too important to suffer my opinion respecting it to be 
misunderstood. I went therefore to Lord Grenville's office, and said 
not only that the project was without my approbation, that moreover I 
desired to be understood as explicitly objecting to the measure as one 
too decisive to be adopted except upon the plain and direct application 
of the American Government. Having since heard little of the 
scheme, I suppose that it has been laid aside. I however think that 
it would be proper that I should know the President's way of think- 
ing upon this subject, should unfortunately a state of things exist 
that would make such a measure more proper than it would be under 
present circumstances. 

Mr. Adams will inform you from the Hague of what is passing 
in that quarter : but least his opportunities of writing should be 
less frequent than mine, it may be proper to state, that I have 
reason to believe, tho' the French Government assigns our Treaty 
with England as the cause of their maritime conduct towards us, 
they have recently demanded of Hamburgh and Bremen to suspend 
all commerce with England. These cities have not yet complied, and 
the French Minister has been removed from Hamburgh. The same 
demand has been made at Copenhagen, and the refusal has pro- 
duced a sharp diplomatic controversy ; these poivers have made no late 
Treaties with England* . . . 

With perfect respect &c.

R. King to A. Hamilton.* 

March 8, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

On the 28th ult., the Bank of England stopped payment in 
specie and since every bank in Great Britain has followed its ex- 
ample.! . . . Many whom I meet profess to believe that the 
bank will soon be able to resume their former course of payments. 
But I see so few of the causes (if they exist) which are to effect 
this restoration, that I am somewhat skeptical, and my want of 
faith is in some measure excused by circumstances that I think 
will for the present prevent the return of the golden age. No 
nation has supported a more perfect credit than England. None 
has been able to substitute in so great a degree paper in lieu of 
coin — and in no country, therefore, is the quantity of specie com- 
paratively so small as in England. This fact was not practically 
believed. The Bank has now proved it to the conviction and dis- 
may of the country. . . . 

Farewell yours sincerely. 

P. S. Since the capture of Mantua, the Austrians have notified 
this court of their resolution to prosecute the war — relying on the 
co-operation of Great Britain. What effect the pecuniary state of 
England may have upon their disposition to persevere, I will not 
conjecture. Without moneys the Emperor will not be able to go 
on. Thus you see a very interesting subject brought within a 
narrow compass. France will harass and waste our commerce, 
regardless of justice. She makes our treaty with England the 
pretence. Had we made no treaty her conduct would have been 
the same. She has recently required of Hamburg and Bremen 
to suspend and prohibit all commerce with England — and yet she 
has not succeeded in her views, though she has recalled her min- 
ister from Hamburgh. The demand has likewise been repeated 
at Copenhagen, and a refusal to comply has produced a diplo- 
matic altercation, as pointed perhaps, as that between Colonel 
Pickering and Mr. Adet. 

Our affairs in the Mediterranean are settled, or nearly so. Col. 
Humphries informs me that we stand well with Algiers. We have

concluded a treaty of peace with Tripoli, and it is probable we 
shall soon make a similar one with Tunis. The Dey of Algiers 
having invaded the Tunissean territory — principally, says Col. 
Humphries, to compel the Bey to conclude a peace with the 
United States of America, for the accomplishment of which 
the Dey offers to advance the money from his own treasury, and 
engages to guarantee this treaty as he has done that with Tripoli. 
Strange event.

Theodore Sedgwick to R. King, London. 

Stockbridge, i 2th March, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . The scenes which have passed here, since you left the 

country, to every man who is interested in its welfare, have been 

highly important. The retirement of Genl. Washington from the 

Presidency, and the subsequent election have produced an ardor 

far exceeding all former experience. Men of a character the most 

congenial to your own, and in whom I believe you have the most 

confidence, thought that in our critical situation the object of 

most importance was to exclude the Virginia Philosopher from the 

chair, endeavored, as they might, to exclude him by impressing 

their own sentiments on the electors and inducing them to vote 

homogeneously from the Delaware eastward for Pinckney & 

Adams. Had those views, and in them I concurred, prevailed, 

the former would have been President and the latter continued in 

his former station. What effects that arrangement would have 

produced can now only be a subject of conjecture. The attempt 

however has afforded abundant matter for Jacobinical intrigue. 

The first display of this was a letter from Mr. Jefferson to his 

friend Madison, which was disclosed, in confidence, within one or 

two days after the event of the election was certainly known. In 

the letter the writer states that he may be placed in three situa- 

156 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 1 57 



tions in relation to this subject. The first, and that which would 
be most grateful to himself, that he may not be elected to, or a 
candidate for either of the offices of Prest. or Vice Prest. ; the 
second, that he may be the competitor of Mr. Adams, & the com- 
petition to be decided by the H. of Representatives, in which case 
he earnestly requests that his own pretensions may be withdrawn 
in favor of the preferable ones of his rival ; and the third, (which 
he most dreads) that he may be elected President. Concurring 
in this system of insidious deception, the faction have been indus- 
trious in declaring that it was evidently the intention of Hamilton 6° 
his party (so when speaking on this subject they denominated the 
friends of the Government) that Mr. Pinckney should be elected 
as President, because him they believed they could govern, and Mr. 
Adams they knew they could not. You will perceive that Mr. Jeffer- 
son is profering the same objects in his speech to the Senate, when 
he took his seat as Vice Prest. It is really to be regretted that 
these Ideas had not occurred to the " Friend of the People " a few 
weeks sooner ; he might then have spared the good man, whom 
he so highly reveres, much unmerited abuse, and his friends much 
painful anxiety. 

The late session has been one of the most unpleasant which I 
have known. Our friends in the House, knowing their adversaries 
to be a majority, have despaired of effecting any public good, 
and have, therefore, permitted the Session to pass without one 
generous effort. The same impression as to the character of the 
House, has given the same apprehension of indolent inactivity to 
the Senate. 

Two objects of importance present themselves, the one, an im- 
provement of revenue, and the other, giving to the executive the 
means of checking the depredations on our commerce. An in- 
crease of revenue I do not believe to be immediately necessary 
to discharge existing demands. It was however most certainly 
desirable in our critical situation. In this all parties were agreed, 
but as to the means, there was not a majority for anything except 
a paltry increase of imposts, which will produce, probably be- 
tween 2 & 300,000 dols. — a sum less than the diminution by 
French robbery. To check the insolent oppression of the french 
the most obvious, and I believe the most effectual measure which 
could have been adopted, would have been to have authorized the 



158 RUFUS KING. [1797 

President to lay an Embargo, either general or special. There 
was little hope such a measure would have passed the House, but 
its friends entertained no doubt of its success in the Senate ; but 
to our astonishment the Bill was lost on the final question by an 
equivote. Several gentlemen, who did not take the trouble, pre- 
viously, to explain themselves, afterwards declared that they 
voted against the Bill, because they thought it would place the 
President in too delicate a situation, for he having been charged 
with improper prejudices for the british and against the french j it 
would be said that he had been influenced by partiality to adopt a 
measure, which in its effects would benefit the former and injure the 
latter. 

The circumstance of a new administration would of itself in 
some degree tend to check the virulence of faction. This will be 
the more encreased by the attempt which is manifestly made to 
seduce the President, by impressing him with a belief that he has 
been deserted by his friends. This attempt, I trust, will be inef- 
fectual. At all events, while they are making their efforts, they 
will suspend all personal attacks. 

In the newly elected house of Reps, we flatter ourselves that 
there is a majority of good men — friends of national liberty, of 
their country and of its government. It is, however, if at all a 
majority, a small one. If our expectations are not disappointed, 
the next session will be a very important and I hope a productive 
one ; much remains, respecting our internal police, to be done, 
to give to the government the best chance of success. I have 
been long convinced that even on the principles of our federal 
Union, much more might be done than has even yet been at- 
tempted. This will possibly induce me once more to sacrifice 
my quiet and happiness by attending another session of 
Congress. 

There is much distress, in this state, among the adventurers 
in the Georgia Speculation. A committee of Senate have made 
an elaborate report, which had not been printed when I left 
Philadelphia, which is well founded, and, whether it be so or 
not I am ignorant, will show that Georgia is restricted within 
much narrower limits than I had supposed. 

The inauguration of the President was a scene the most 
august and sublime I ever beheld. Mr. Adams behaved with 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE, 1 59 



dignity. The company was numerous, respectable, and behaved 
with that decent gravity which the solemn occasion demanded ; 
but the circumstance the most interesting was the presence of the 
late President. He came unattended and on foot, with the modest 
appearance of a private citizen. No sooner was his person seen, 
than a burst of applause such as I had never before known, 
and which it would be as impossible for me to describe, as my 
own sensations produced by it, saluted the venerable Hero and 
Patriot, while the animation of countenance which accompanied it 
gave the most pleasing, as well as the most convincing evidence, 
that all the lies which malice has invented, have been ineffectual to 
injure the character of this great and good man. ... I am, 
dear Sir, most sincerely & affectionately 

Your friend, 

Theodore Sedgwick. 



R. King to R. Southgate, Esq. 

London, March 17, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

I am reluctant in saying anything more respecting Emery's 
claim,* having so often troubled you with the expressions of my 
concern upon that subject, but having heard that Emery has been 
recently baffled in an attempt to procure a legal decision in his 
case ; I feel that I do him an injustice in suffering the circum- 
stance of my absence to deprive him of the exercise of a perfect 
Right that he has to demand a judicial Examination of his Claim. 
I have therefore authorized Cyrus [R. K.'s brother and secretary] 
who is returning home to consent to a suit against me, in case you 

* In a letter dated Jany. 14, 1794, S. Emery had written to R. K. : 
1 ' I have endeavoured to settle the matter respecting the farm at Scarborough 
which you sold my father with Dr. Southgate till I am quite tired out ; he will 
not settle upon any principle which I think just . . . therefore I am 
obliged to write to you or take what he pleases to give. . . ." 
Enclosing this letter to Dr. Southgate, R. King writes, Jany. 27, 1794 : 
". . . I had hoped that by some arrangement convenient to all branches 
of the family, the Heirs of Mr. Emery had been satisfied. It will remain with 
you to do what is proper on this Subject. I have written to Mr. Emery in my 
answer to his letter that the claim will not be denied and that you will do all 
that justice which I sincerely desire should be afforded. . . ." 



l6o RUFUS KING. [1797 

and Emery continue to be unable to agree in an amicable Settle- 
ment. I have a great Repugnance to legal controversy, and 
should therefore be gratified in being exempt in this instance 
from disputing with a man who I think has just grounds of com- 
plaint against me. The Difference between his demand and what 
you would be willing to pay I understand to be small and unim- 
portant ; and I had much rather pay it myself than be drawn into 
a lawsuit, in which I must in the End be in the wrong. 

We are so far apart and both at a period of life at which we 
are liable to occurrences that may prevent our reunion, that I feel 
the force of that uncertainty, which darkens the prospect of our 
meeting. I hope for the Pleasure of the Event, and flatter my- 
self that it will not long be postponed. Where I now am I am 
not quite my own master, but it is not my intention to remain 
long in England ; and it will be one of the earliest pleasures of 
my return home to visit and embrace those branches of my family 
from whom I have been so long separated. I hope you enjoy 
health & Happiness. These Blessings I likewise wish to my 
beloved Sister. God bless you, her and yours. 

Forever and affectionately yrs 

Rufus King. 



G. Cabot to R. King, London. 

Brookline, March 19, 1797. 

Dear Sir : 

I hope your conjectures respecting Mr. Pitt's supplies will not 
prove as well founded as your political opinions usually are, for I 
have never yet thought a peace practicable, & with Burke, I think 
any peace wou'd be unsafe while the power of Societicide or rather 
Staticide remains unbroken. That the welfare of the United 
States will become precarious, if G. B. yields, most of our think- 
ing people perceive pretty plainly. The feelings of our merchants 
are greatly irritated & their fears not a little excited by the depre- 
dations committing by the French. But what is to be done ? The 
great extension of our maritime commerce has rendered us ex- 
tremely vulnerable while our aggressor has nothing upon the sea 
thro' which a blow could be returned. 

By the pieces, entitled " the Warning," which from their ex- 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. l6l 

cellence I attribute to Hamilton, you may see our affairs with 
France are converging to a critical point. How we shall behave 
at last you can foresee as well as I ; for living out of the world as 
I do, and having no other communication with it than the visits 
of a dozen friends, which are not frequent, my knowledge of 
what passes is chiefly derived from the Newspapers. Our public 
servants however will ordain the course to be pursued and I hope 
they will do right, and be fully encouraged by us their masters. 

Some pains have been taken, and I think with considerable 
success in this quarter to explain the nature of our controversy 
with France. I fully agree to the superior estimate you make of 
the present enjoyments and future hopes of our country, as com- 
pared with others, but I can't avoid suspecting you of a little too 
much despondency on another topic. Perhaps we always over- 
rate absent blessings, and generally, present difficulties. 

You will be glad that Adams is elected, and that the prospect 
of our Government continuing steady is good. For a while things 
will go well and we must do everything in our power to give per- 
manency to every good disposition. I am nevertheless mortified 
to see Jefferson Vice-President after so much exertion among the 
agents of a foreign nation to secure his election, and I cannot dis- 
card my fears that he will have an influence that may be unpro- 
pitious. It occurs to my mind frequently that the hostile conduct 
of France towards this Country, may suggest to the British Gov- 
ernment new schemes of policy that might extremely embarrass 
us ; but it wou'd be the most short-sighted project that folly ever 
adopted if their conduct should become ^conciliatory now that 
we are breaking off that dependent connexion with their enemies, 
which they ought always to discourage, but which their disdainful 
spirit had contributed to produce. I reflect with infinite satisfac- 
tion that you are placed in a situation to demonstrate the ill 
tendencies of these crooked politics, which erroneous views of 
this country cou'd alone have recommended. 

What do Sweden & Denmark say to the outrages of the French ! 
They must be uneasy under such treatment as we receive ; but at 
what point will they begin to repel ? Presuming that Pinckney 
will not be received, I expect an official notice of this will be fol- 
lowed by a summons of Congress, & if it shou'd, I hope they 
will have spirit enough to declare all Treaties between the 2 

VOL. II. — II

nations annulled by the gross and avowed violations of our rights 
under them. But all these affairs are with the constituted authori- 
ties & while I rejoice that I am not among them, I am happy that 
many better heads are devoted to those services, which our country 
needs & deserves. . . . 

Yrs. faithfully 

G. Cabot. 



R. King to Sir John Sinclair. 

Great Cumberland Place, Ap. 1, 1797. 
Sir : 

I have had the honor to receive your letter of tl±e 29th ulto. 
informing me, in very obliging terms, that the Board of Agriculture 
had been pleased to admit me, as a " Foreign honorary member " 
of that Society. I request the favor of you, Sir, to present to the 
Board my respectful acknowledgments of the honor conferred 
upon me by this admission. I ought at the same time, Sir, to 
observe to you, that my very moderate acquaintance with agricul- 
tural subjects, forbids me to hope that it will be in my power to 
afford the society any valuable information in the prosecution of 
their patriotic and important researches. 

With great consideration and esteem, &c, 

Rufus King. 



R. King to A. Hamilton.* 

London, April 2, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

As Mr. Church is the bearer, I refer you to him for what it 
would take many pages to relate, and will only say, that, notwith- 
standing the injuries we continue to receive from France, I still 
hope the same policy that has hitherto kept us out of the war, will 
continue to influence and decide our government. 

How the new President will conduct himself in a situation 
thorny and embarrassing, remains to be seen ; the first step is very 
important, and therefore should be deeply and extensively con- 
sidered. 

* Works of Hamilton, vi., 227. 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 163 

Everything looks like an active and, to a certain degree, a 
vigorous campaign ; yet, with all these appearances of the con- 
tinuance of the war peace may be near. But what will be the 
consequence of such a peace as alone can be had at this time ? 

A late arret of the Directory gives notice to all French citizens 
that the Treaty of February 1778, between France and the United 
States of America, has been (of full right) in virtue of the second 
article thereof, so modified as to conform to the stipulations con- 
tained in the treaty of 1794 between the United States and Great 
Britain. The arret proceeds to specify the modification. 

This says Mr. King, demanding in its fourth article that 
our ships should have 

a role d' equipage en bonne forme, such as is required by the 
form annexed to the treaty of the 6th of February 1778 . . . will 
render all our ships liable to capture, and, if acted upon, to con- 
demnation, since no American vessel has on board the document 
required. . . . Mr. Church will show you a copy of the com- 
mercial Treaty with France, printed in London in 1783, which has 
the form of a passport role d'equipage, &c, annexed . . by which 
you will see that none of our vessels are exempt from capture ; if 
this copy is that referred to in the late arret. Indeed it seems 
too absurd in some things to be genuine, yet I suspect it is the 
model or form referred to and required by the fourth article of 
the arret. 

Farewell yours, 

Rufus King. 



T. Pickering to R. King. 

Department of State, April 6, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

... I have written to Vermont for information about the 
arms and cannon captured on the Olive Branch, with Governor 
Ira Allen, and carried into England. Whatever answer I obtain 
shall be communicated to you. In the meantime there appears 
to me to be little room to doubt of their real destination such as 
you mention to be suggested in London. It is incredible that 



164 RUFUS KING. [1797 

Governor Allen should undertake to purchase 20.000 muskets 
and 24 brass cannon with their appendages for the militia of Ver- 
mont at the request of Governor Chittenden. Nothing but an Act 
of the Legislature would warrant the measure or provide the funds, 
is well known that Allen was destitute of property. . . . 



T. Pickering to R. King. 

Department of State, 12 April, 1797. 

. . . The French continue their depredations on our com- 
merce in the West Indies ; and by the accounts almost daily 
published in the newspapers, frequently commit the most flagrant 
piracies and robberies, even in their own ports : so that the 
insurers at Baltimore (as I am this day informed by a letter from 
thence) have ceased to underwrite upon American vessels bound 
to French ports ; while they insure at war premiums those bound 
to English West India ports.

Philad., April 3, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . Capt. O'Brien arriv'd day before yesterday & brought 
as the acct. of Sir J. Jervis' victory over the Spaniards, which has 
assisted in raising our depressed spirits. It is a melancholy and 
a humiliating consideration that we are compelled to derive con- 
solation from the successes of other nations. Under present 
circumstances we must rejoice at the victories of G. Britain, tho' 
we may fear they may hereafter be turned to our disadvantage. 
The haughty conduct of France, which increases with her tide of 
prosperity, makes us rejoice at the defeat of herself or her allies ; 
we look for safety in her depression, for we cannot expect to find 
either from her justice & our wisdom. Her late outrages have 
however kindled a good spirit, but it is uncertain how long it will 
be kept alive, and there is reason to fear that the same capricious 
disposition, which so quickly changes from love to resentment 
will from trifling causes change back again. 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. l6$ 

The active and incessant manoeuvres of french agents in this 
Country, make me apprehend that any inconsidble. change in the 
measures of France favorable to us will drive the great mass of 
knaves & fools back into her arms. What indeed have we not to 
apprehend from the multitude which for four years has, with so 
little reason, avowed such a devoted attachment to that insidious 
nation ? If the present temper can be steadfastly maintained, 
the losses from their spoliations will scarcely be regretted ; they 
will be well compensated by our deliverance from gallic thraldom. 

The eyes of a great many are now opened to the real views of 
France, and the public mind is thereby become more open to re- 
ceive impressions favorable to England ; nothing will be so con- 
ducive to the complete establishment of our independence, as a 
conduct on the part of G. Britain at this crisis, marked with sin- 
cere good will to this country. This will do away with those 
antipathies which are still lurking in a great many breasts and 
produce a- general disposition to view that nation as connected 
with us by the strongest ties of mutual interest. It has been so 
much a fashion of late years to call parties here by foreign names, 
that many conceive we cannot be alienated from the French 
without throwing ourselves a corps perdu into the arms of the 
English ; and unfortunately many of the ci-devant English mer- 
chants here, yielding without due reflection to an habitual im- 
pulse, encourage this degrading idea ; it is important that it 
should be banished from our sight and that we should forcibly 
inculcate the sentiment, that if we are alienated from the French, 
it is because we cherish our independence and have determined 
to form no connexions but those which unite indepent. nations for 
their common interest. 

It is a fortunate thing for us that the Representatives of the 
respective nations are at this present juncture so peculiarly gifted 
with those rare and valuable qualities, which at the same time 
remove every distrust and strengthen a growing friendship. Mr. 
& Mrs. Liston are much liked, so much so as to be, in the eyes of 
the Jacobins, dangerous people. I am much pleased with the 
promises of Abercromby & Simcoe ; the british Govt, may, with 
little trouble & no expence, do many things which wo'd produce 
the most happy effects here. There never was so favorable an 
opportunity ; but they must understand the footing on which our 






\66 RUFUS KING. [i797 

^connexions are to rest — the most complete independence on 
our part. 
v I was about to return to Charleston, when the late disagreeable 
intelligence from Gen. Pinckney compelled the Executive to con- 
vene Congress on the 15th May. I must therefore stay here. The 
successes of Buonaparte will probably give the Directory a still 
more haughty tone, unless their internal affairs sho'd produce 
something favorable for us. Congress are to meet this day six 
weeks — something may occur of an important nature before that 
period. The operations of the French cabinet have been so fluc- 
tuating & their danger relative to foreign and neutral powers so 
C sudden & violent, that I am not without hopes that when they find 
\ their prospects blasted of overthrowing our Government & can- 
celling the British Treaty, they will suddenly wheel about and 
generously forgive us. There is only this yet wanting to com- 
pete their character for generosity & magnanimity, so much 
dinned in our ears by their adherents. 

We shall pass a new Law next Session relative to Seamen ; 
your suggestion on that subject will be carefully attended to. 
Major Lenox, the successor of Trumbull, sails for London in a 
few weeks. The Commrs. for the 6th Article are arrived here. 
I have not yet seen them. 

Our Treaty with Sweden expires in about fifteen months ; the 
Executive have it in contemplation to propose a revival of it. 
Have you turned your attention much to this subject ? What 
think you of a commercial connexion with Denmark ? Those 
two powers have a common interest with us, whenever the great 
maritime nations are at war ; it seems therefore strange that we 
sho'd have a Minister Plenipotenty. in Portugal with whom we 
have no Treaty and little commercial intercourse, and no relations 
with Denmark & Sweden, whose interests in time of war are so 
homogeneous with ours and with whom we might have extensive 
commercial intercourse. . . . 

The accounts from the Mediterranean are highly pleasing. The 
Treaties with the Barbary powers have cost us a great deal of 
money and vexation. I trust they will realize the benefits you 
justly anticipated. This new source of commerce will indemnify 
us for the abridgement of our Commerce in the W. Indies. 

The change of the Executive here has been wrought with a 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 1 67 

facility and a calm which has astonished even those of us who 
always augured well of the governt. and the general good sense 
of our citizens. The machine has worked without a creak. On 
the 4th of March John Adams was quietly sworn into office, 
George Washington attending as a private citizen. A few days 
after he went quietly home to Mt. Vernon ; his successor as 
quietly took his place, and in the same house last Tuesday I saw 
him well dressed, in a full suit, sword, bag &c. at his first levee, 
which was a very crowded one. The Jacobins are nattering him 
and trying to cajole him to admit the V. P. into the Council. 
Jefferson lodged at Francis' hotel (with Adams) while here, 
attended the Philosophical Society of which he is President, made 
a dissertation about a Lion's claw, and soon after returned to 
Monticello. 

Our friend Murray sails for Amsterdam shortly ; he will do 
credit to the appointment. I shall intrust to his care a copy of 
my little work on the Constitution for you, which I have had 
interleaved to receive those judicious remarks which will I am 
sure occur to you on perusing it. When this is done, I shall request 
you to return it to me, in exchange for a copy of a new edition 
on a more enlarged & useful plan. 

Farewell, yours very affectly. 

Wm. Smith. 

A. Hamilton to R. King, London. 

April 8, 1797. 

I thank you, my Dear Sir, for your letter of the 6th of Febru- 
ary. The Intelligence that the Directory have ordered away our 
Minister is every way unpleasant. It portends too much a final 
Rupture as the only alternative to an ignominious submission. 
Much public feeling has been excited. But the Government, I 
trust & believe, will continue prudent, and do everything that 
honor permits towards accommodation. 'Tis however to be feared 
that France successful will be too violent and imperious to meet 
on any admissible ground. 

Congress are called together. I can give you no conjecture as 
to what will be done. Opinions are afloat. My idea is another 
attempt to pacify by negotiation, vigorous preparations for war 



1 68 RUFUS KING. [1797 

and defensive measures with regard to our Trade. But there never 
was a period of our affairs in which I could less foresee the course 
of things. 

I believe there is no danger of want of firmness in the Execu- 
tive. If he is not ill-advised, he will not want prudence. I mean 
that I believe that he is himself disposed to a prudently firm 
course. 

You know the Mass of our Senate. That of our House of 
Representatives is not ascertained. A small majority on the right 
side is counted on. In Virginia it is understood that Morgan 
comes in place of Rutherford, & Evans in place of Page. The 
whole result of the Virginia election is not known. 

The conduct of France has been a very powerful medicine for 
the political diseases of the country. I think the community 
improves in soundness. 

Adieu, God bless you 

A. Hamilton.

Brookline, April 10, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

I see by the style of your Letter of the 25th of Jany that you are 
more happy and if you had not told me expressly that you had 
surmounted your difficulties, I shou'd have inferr'd it. Our Cam- 
paign here is soon to open, & I think may prove a more impor- 
tant one than any we have seen. Both parties are active in 
endeavouring to preoccupy the popular mind, and if a judgment 
were now to be formed, it wou'd be that the friends of order and 
good government will be successful. The aim is to rouse the 
country as much as possible without inflaming it, & by exciting a 
due attention to the public danger it is expected that we the people 
shall be reconciled to some new burthens which may become 
necessary, & shall be disposed to strengthen the Govt, by a ready 
support of the measures it shall adopt. The President, I am as- 
sured, will not yield to the insolent dictates of France ; but on the 
contrary will propose to Congress measures which will satisfy 
the men who elected him. If the House of Representatives 
shou'd be well composed, the national dignity will be supported 
at any rate (& probably peace maintained) ; but if a majority 

169 



1^0 RUFUS KING. [1797 

there shou'd be wrong, disgrace may be expected. The weakest 
men generally follow the popular sentiment, & I am persuaded 
that opposition to the tyranny of France is every day growing 
more popular. To me it wou'd seem a wise policy in G. B. to 
seize upon this moment for breaking off our French attachments. 
A steady course of liberal treatment wou'd render this Country an 
inestimable customer to G. B. for a long time. We shou'd con- 
tinue to buy of them what a quarrel or even coldness may oblige 
us to make for ourselves. I have been for many years convinced 
that the true interest of Great Britain required a relaxation 
towards us of the vigorous commercial system she ordinarily main- 
tains. We are not, and probably never shall be her Rival in Naval 
power. The extensive territory we possess forms an interest that 
jpust countervail it for many years, & it is hardly to be doubted 
JjjJ^ftf/' 1 *''' many years shall elapse, we shall divide or be divided. 
A constant & adequate market for their manufactures is infinitely 
important to the support & prosperity of England proper, & to 
enable the parent stock to circulate without impoverishment or 
redundance of the nutriments of the immense cyons engrafted in 
the 2 Indies. But quitting a figure almost unintelligible, is it not 
clear that the prosperity of England depends more than ever 
upon her power at Sea ? Her wisest provisions for the support 
of this power are calculated to keep at all times the greatest pos- 
sible number of Seamen employ'd : the intention is proper but it 
is not well fulfilled. It is in navigation as in other branches of 
industry ; they who work cheapest will have most employment. 
The English laws which recognize no Ship as British except such 
as are built within the British dominions, prevent Englishmen 
from freighting in many countries where they might, if allowed to 
use the cheap Ships they cou'd build in the U. S. To whatever 
extent this is true, England sacrifices her greater interest in sailors, 
to a minor interest in shipwrights. Besides every facility of pay- 
ment which England gives to the U. S. must tend to increase our 
consumption of her goods ; and if the facility costs her nothing, 
she certainly derives a clear profit on the increased consumption. 
Many other considerations occur to me which ought to produce 
in G. B. the most conciliatory policy, but these, as well as those 
suggested, are all familiar to you. The condition of the British 
nation is certainly critical & requires to be propp'd up by every 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. \J\ 



auxiliary they can obtain. A commercial intercourse with us 
established on the most liberal principles wou'd be a firm & last- 
ing support to them & might be highly useful to us. . . . 

Your faithful friend, 

G. Cabot. 

There is an interesting paper in the handwriting of Mr. 
King containing a statement of the negotiations between 
France and Prussia, made by Jacobi, the Prussian Ambas- 
sador in London, which is here given : 

"April 16, '97. 

11 Jacobi told me that the King of Prussia had been applied to 
by France to aid in restoring peace with Austria ; that he had 
declined all interference unless in favor of a general peace and 
the integrity of the German Empire. Thus, said Jacobi, it is 
evident that the Rumours of a Design in the King to break in 
upon the Rights of the Empire are disproved ; and it is equally 
plain that the account of his having guaranteed Belgium is un- 
founded. The French offered to give him Hanover long ago, 
wh. he refused. If Bavaria sh. be attempted to be annexed to 
Austria, the King of Prussia wd. object, nay he wd. be obliged to 
take a portion equivalent of some part of Germany contiguous to 
his Dominions. I have consd. Jacobi notified to this Court the 
refusal of the King to assist in a separate peace, France wants 
peace — she will not insist on the Rhine as a boundary, but she 
will adhere to the union of Belgium. England will not agree to 
this sacrifice to obtain peace. The Emperor will therefore refuse 
to make any peace — he will even quit Vienna and retire to Hun- 
gary, where he will make still great exertions to expel the French 
from his Dominions." 



R. King to Lord Grenville. 

London, April 19, 1797. 
My Lord : 

Having learnt that a Packet soon sails for the West Indies, I 
take the Liberty to send to your Lordship copies of a letter and 
its inclosures that I have lately received from Mr. Talbot, who is 
the Agent appointed by the President of the United States for the 



172 RUFUS KING, [1797 

Relief and Protection of American Seamen in the West Indies. 
It gave me much pleasure when I had last the honor of meeting 
your Lordship to express to you the satisfaction with which the 
President had been informed, that Mr. Talbot had been received 
and treated in a friendly manner by his Majesty's Naval officers 
in the West Indies ; and that there was a fair prospect that his 
agency would prove successful in relieving such of our Seamen 
as had been impressed and were detained on board his Majesty's 
ships in those seas. I have great regret in perceiving by Mr. 
Talbot's report, that there is an appearance of a Temper, some- 
what different from our just expectations on this subject, on the 
part of the Commander in Chief, Admiral Sir Hyde Parker, and 
(it) is my Duty to request your Lordship's interference to obtain 
an order from the proper Department of his Majesty's Govern- 
ment for the Discharge of the American Citizens named in 
the list remitted by Mr. Talbot, and also instructions to the 
Commanders of his Majesty's ships of war in the West Indies to 
discharge all other American citizens, that have been impressed 
and are detained on board any of the said Ships. 

With high consideration &c. 

Rufus King. 

R. King to the Secretary of State. 

London, April 19, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

You will naturally suppose that I must be anxious to be 
informed what measures the President shall adopt to arrest the 
depredations that France is committing upon our commerce. 
The Arret of the 2nd of March, if executed, will subject all our 
Ships to capture and condemnation, since none of them are 
furnished with such papers as the 6th Article thereof requires. 

Hitherto the captures in Europe have not been numerous, 
though several of our valuable ships have been carried into 
France, and in a few instance the Masters and other Officers of 
our vessels have been treated in a barbarous and cruel manner by 
the French Cruizers, who have put them to the torture to compel 
them to make such Declarations relative to the property and des- 
tination of their ships and Cargoes as were desired. I send you 
the protest of William Martin, Master of the Cincinnatus of Balti- 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 1 73 

more, who lately arrived here, after having fallen into the hands 
of a French Cruizer, which obliged him to leave his own vessel 
and to go on board the Cruizer, when he was tortured for more 
than three hours. Captain Martin's thumbs, which I examined, 
bear the marks of the screws, and the scars will go with him to 
his grave. 

It is impossible that these barbarous outrages should be author- 
ized ; indeed the concealment observed by the Perpetrators of 
them, who refused to tell their names, or the Port of their Equip- 
ment, evince that they are not so. A general Peace, if concluded 
on a basis of reciprocal Justice may secure to us an exemption from 
the System of Plunder and Barbarity into which Europe seems 
in danger of relapsing. 

The elections in France, so far as Results are known, have been 
favorable to the friends of moderation ; but Victory & Conquest 
are advantageous to their opponents, and will elate both. The 
Emperor of Russia avoids, even in a greater Degree than his 
Mother did, taking any share in the war. Prussia adheres to 
the maxims that have long influenced her, and will make no efforts 
except to augment her own Territories or to weaken those of * her 
neighbours. Some recent successes confirm the past character of 
this Court and increase our Detestation of its principles. Germany 
is disjointed, dispersed and in some degree revolutionized ; it 
cannot therefore be depended on at a time, when union, courage 
and zeal could alone be of any advantage. England must soon 
have no option j her wealth and her Navy have been her glory and 
her safeguard. The f owner is found to have limits j the latter by 
an extensive and successful mutiny of her Seamen has recently 
received a wound of the most dangerous consequence. The Nation is 
weary of the War and there is a general despair of any advantages 
from the prosecution of it. The Ministry have been supported 
for the last twelve months by the opinion which they assiduously 
propagated that the continuance of the war was against their 
wishes and owing to the disinclination of the French to make Peace. 

The public discontents increase daily and there is reason to be- 
lieve, notwithstanding the strong personal desire of the King to go 
on with the war, that nothing but the dread of the consequences 
to his authority from Mr. Fox's coming into office, prevents a change 

* Italics in cipher. 



174 RUFUS KING. [1797 

of Ministers. If an administration could be made without Mr. 
Fox it is supposed that an immediate change would take place. 
There is however a circumstance of considerable weight that is 
favorable to the continuance of the present Ministry. A change of 
Ministers, it is apprehended, would require a change of the House 
of Commons. The present is the first session of a new Parliament, 
and the seats are too expensive to be soon given up. Hence the friends 
of the Ministers, though they wish for Peace and would recom- 
mend a surrender of all the National Conquests to obtain it desire 
that it should be made by men whom they have supported and not by 
those whom they have opposed. In this situation of ±e Allies, the 
burthen of continuing the War falls upon Austria. The Emperor, 
it is true, whatever we may think of his wisdom by his firmness 
and constancy excites our admiration. The nobles of Vienna 
since the late Defeat of the Arch Duke have surrounded the 
Throne with Petitions for an immediate Peace, as the only means 
of saving the Capitol, or preserving the Monarchy. To this 
advice, nothwithstanding past Disasters, and the tide of success 
on which Bonaparte advances, the Emperor has answered that he 
could not consent to make Peace, without his allies, that Vienna 
was not the Monarchy, that the Monarchy would survive, beloved 
and defended by his loyal subjects, when even Vienna should 
have surrendered to the enemy. Though this courageous firm- 
ness in the Chief of a warlike nation, if accompanied with more 
propitious Circumstances, would perform Prodigies and might 
save a sinking State, yet in this instance the affairs of Austria 
are so deranged, her armies so reduced and dispirited, her sub- 
jects so depressed by the Burthens and misfortunes of the war, 
and the conflict so apparently hopeless, that it is even doubted 
whether the Emperor will be able to hold out till the person who 
has been sent from this Country to Vienna, to join in the nego- 
tiations, shall arrive there. 

Should he conclude a separate Peace, & whether separate or 
joint its terms will be much the same, it must be one in which 
France dictates the conditions, and consequently too unequal and 
humiliating to be lasting. This view of the Situation of the war 
recommends to us in a forcible manner the Policy of continuing, 
if possible, in peace. We have been wronged and greatly so, but 
it is only by negotiation and by persevering in the moderate but 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 1 75 

manly representations of the injustice that has been done to us 
that we shall be likely to obtain satisfaction. There certainly is 
nothing heroic, nothing that excites admiration in this march ; 
on the other hand I hope there is nothing really humiliating in it ; 
since it is one that promises to obtain for us, with more certainty 
than any other, that satisfaction for the past and security for the 
future which in a different way the greatest and most powerful 
Nations in Europe have attempted but utterly failed to obtain. 

With great respect &c. 

Rufus King. 

P. S. The public Papers announce an arret of the Executive 
Directory of the 10th instant which directs that the Passports 
granted by the Ministers and Diplomatic Envoys of the United 
States of America, and Passports certified by them, shall not be 
admitted nor acknowledged by any authority ; the arret is ordered 
to be printed and the Minister of Police is charged with the 
execution of it. 

I am at a loss to conjecture the motives to this Regulation. 
You know that in time of war, it is by Passports only that the 
Merchants are enabled to pass from one country to another in the 
transaction of their business. This arret will be embarrassing to 
such of our countrymen as, being in Europe, might be desirous of 
following and claiming their Property captured and carried into 
France. 

I shall recommend to those of them who are going to France 
from this Country to take a Certificate of Citizenship from our 
Consuls here ; having sometime since understood that Mr. Skip- 
with, our Consul at Paris, was permitted to grant Certificates of 
this nature. But whether this precaution will answer, or whether 
we shall avoid still greater mischief than hitherto I have appre- 
hended, I confess myself at a loss to determine. 

I have this moment received a letter from Mr. Pitcairn, dated 
Paris April 8, 1797 : he begins by saying that " Mr. de Clerck 
flls, the Chief of the Co?nptability of the National Treasury, in- 
formed me yesterday that two days before the Directory had laid 
an opposition to prevent any payment being made to the American 
Government or any of the people, founded on the law of Reprisals." 
Mr. Pitcairn makes a query whether Private Debts could be con- 
fiscated. . . . 



176 RUFUS KING. [i797 

T. Pickering to R. King. 

" Department of State, April 26, 1797. 
" Dear Sir : 

" . . . To-day I received your letter of March 5th, and 
notice the immediate causes and effects of the stoppage of cash 
payments from the Bank of England. I should presume on the 
spirit and patriotism of British subjects, to make sacrifices propor- 
tioned to the present extraordinary emergencies. It is an obvious 
remark that if you contend with a nation which uses new weapons 
or new manoeuvres, to which your own are unequal or inapplica- 
ble — to fight on a par, you must change your own and adopt 
corresponding means of attack and defence. What would France 
have effected in the present war, had she relied on the ordinary 
means of France when a Monarchy ? With even a small portion 
of the immense sacrifices of that nation under her Revolutionary 
governments, Britain might yet maintain the conflict. Her bitter 
resentments and national antipathy and revenge towards a people 
whom she has long called her natural enemy, joined to her national 
pride, it might be imagined would furnish the extraordinary means 
which the unexampled state of things demand. 

" The depredations of the French in the West Indies continue. 
Mr. Adet, a few days since expressed to me his opinion that they 
are not authorized by the French Government ; remarking that it 
is impossible to restrain Privateers from irregularities. But it 
happens, unfortunately, that nearly all the vessels or Cargoes, or 
both, which are carried in by their Privateers are condemned by 
their civil officers on shore. Besides when he mentions unauthor- 
ized captures, he cannot refer to the multitude which we complain 
of as made in direct violation of our Treaty with France, or of 
the law of nations, but which he himself declared would be made 
pursuant to the Decree of the Directory on the 2nd of July last." 



R. King, London, to T. Pickering. 

Personal and Private. 

Ap. 29, 1797. 

Dear Sir : 

. . . I submit to you whether it would not be advantageous, 
if you shd. send me 10 or 12 Copies of the State Papers from your 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE, 1 77 

office which are from time to time published : a distribution of 
them among the foreign Ministers here & others, would in my 
opinion contribute much to the extension of correct opinions con- 
cerning our Policy and national Characters. Your late letter to 
Genl. Pinckney has been very serviceable in this light ; it has been 
well received by every one, and obtained, as it deserved, the 
approbation and praise of sensible and impartial men. 

Mess. Gore and Pinckney will write to you on a subject on 
which I have had, and still suffer, much anxiety — unless a more 
systematic attention is given to the procuring of the seasonable 
and requisite Evidence in cases of Capture, I see little prospect 
in obtaining the reasonable satisfaction for our Losses, which with 
proper diligence & skill in the Agency, and with the present 
views of this Government, we might rationally expect to receive. 
It is unpleasant to say so, but it is my opinion, that we shall ulti- 
mately meet with serious Losses, and give occasion to complaints 
among our people, unless we can induce Mr. Bayard to examine 
each case (instead of turning them over without examination to a 
Proctor) and wherever there is a defect of proof, to point it out 
and take immediate measures to supply it. If Mr. Bayard is 
unable or unwilling to take this trouble, which ought to have been 
taken a year ago, we shall endeavour to fall upon some plan of 
having the business done by some other person. 

I hope soon to hear from you respecting the manner of keeping 
and paying to the Claimants the Monies awarded to be paid by 
this Government. I am persuaded that a precise regulation must 
be given on this subject ; and I am likewise in hopes to receive 
your Opinion concerning the Commission which may be claimed 
to be deducted by Mr. Bayard (for his own emolument) from such 
sums as he shall pay over to the Claimants. I can't say that Mr. 
Bayard will make this claim unless he has the consent of the 
claimant, but I have reason to suppose that it has not been a dif- 
ficult matter to obtain their consent ; various motives may have 
induced Merchants and others in America to agree to such 
proposal. I have before observed to you that I wholly disapprove 
of it. 

With great Respect & Truth 

I am, Dr. Sir, yours &c. 

Rufus King. 

VOL. II. — 12 



I78 RUFUS KING. [1797 

T. Pickering to R. King. 

Department of State, May 9, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

On the 6th, in the evening, I received your letter of the 12th of 
March. . . . The State of affairs relative to French Captures 
of American Vessels, at the date of your Letter no doubt rendered 
your disapprobation of the project of a Convoy very proper. I 
mean for vessels of the United States sailing from the ports of 
Great Britain ; but the piratical conduct of their privateers in the 
American seas, and even on the coast of Spain, must render any 
measures of protection and defence both eligible and lawful. If 
therefore the British Government, on the request of the Merchants 
trading to America, or of the underwriters, or on their own Mo- 
tion, order convoys for the American vessels under a change of 
circumstances which show that our commerce is in more danger 
than when you expressed your disapprobation of the measure, the 
convoys are certainly not to be refused. 

After illustrating the question by some suggestions Mr. P. says : 
*' What legal consequences can result from accepting a convoy in 
any case, except that of its being a cause of condemnation in 
cases of capture, altho' the vessel should really be neutral ? It 
would then seem to be a matter of calculation, whether to accept 
or decline a convoy." He then presents some decisions by Eng- 
lish authorities on the subject of the causes of forfeiture of a 
vessel under convoy, and says : " But here the cause of forfeit- 
ure is not the simple act of going under convoy ; but the attempt- 
ing in a neutral vessel to shelter the goods of an enemy by means 
of a convoy ; and therefore, if this distinction be correct an 
American Vessel, with an American Cargo, may innocently go 
under Convoy. Because a belligerent power, without regarding 
Treaties or the Law of Nations makes prize of such Property. 
If however such unwarrantable captures are not made (and this I 
suppose you judged to be the fact in respect to our vessels trad- 
ing with Great Britain and Ireland) there can be no reason for 
seeking convoys, and the doing it might give offence to the Gov- 
ernment against which it was requested. But whenever that 
Government has no scruple to interrupt and injure our lawful 
commerce, by means of her armed vessels, we can have no scruple 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 1 79 



to accept protection from the Convoys of her Enemies. The 
question will be whether the Government shall personally request con- 
voys. This is a question of some delicacy, as it regards the foreign 
power to whom the request shall be made, on the score of obligation. 
But if, for the sake of preserving lucrative or necessary trade, that 
power voluntarily offers, or on the request of individuals, grants the 
requisite Convoys, are we to refuse them ? Certainly not, and such is 
the sense of the President*

G. Cabot to R. King, London. 

Brookline, May 9, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

It is abundantly evident that the designs of France as disclosed 
to me by Mr. Liancourt * last summer were real, and if they do 
not already exceed them fully, it is only because their successes 
have fallen short of their calculation. I fear it will prove unfor- 
tunate for our country that their successes have been lately so 
great. The fall of Mantua and the appearance of pecuniary em- 
barrassment in England have revived the spirit of Jacobinism, which 
had been declining very fast. Still however it may be relied on, 
that public opinion in relation to foreign politics & the affairs of 
France particularly, is infinitely more correct than it has ever 
been since the Devil was let loose. You will feel, as we all do, 
great anxiety for the measures which Congress shall adopt : our 
friends have hope, & even expect that things will all go well, but 
you know I always expect the contrary, and if the power of faction 
is not sufficient to direct the movements of Government, I am 
persuaded they will obstruct them. Their schemes have so far de- 
veloped themselves as to convince us that they will favor every 
kind of concession to France, and will endeavor to charge all our 
troubles, and even the disgraceful submission they would make

to France, to the British Treaty. Our best security against them, 
is that their projects are well understood by the Executive & will 
be resisted there. My own opinion is to avoid giving provocation 
to the pride of France and to hold ourselves ready to conciliate 
on any terms not dishonorable j but as they are encouraged to in- 
sult and injure us by a contempt of our power, I wou'd make a 
show of the Spirit and resolution of the country, that shou'd com- 
pel them to expect resistance, if they advance. . . . After all 
I think our tranquillity essentially depends upon events on your 
side the water & the fate of England especially. If Englishmen 
do not forfeit the just character of their ancestors, they will perish 
sooner than submit to France, & altho' it must be confessed they 
have immense difficulties to struggle with at home, yet if they feel 
the same inveteracy toward their rival, which this feels toward 
them, they will certainly conquer at last. England has the means 
to defend herself on the sea against the whole of Europe and I 
shou'd imagine with these means in possession, the nation will 
always reject the idea of submission under every vicissitude of its in- 
ternal affairs. Our Expectants of Compensation for captur'd 
property begin to feel impatient at the delay which they can't 
easily be persuaded is unavoidable. 

Your faithful and affect, friend 

G. Cabot. 



N. Webster, Jr. to R. King, London. 

New York, May 30, 1797. 
Sir : 

I take the liberty to enclose you my opinions on the relative 

interests of Great Britain & the United States.* If you agree 

with me in opinion, you will make what use you please of the 

Letter. The present moment is important, and tho' I reprobate 

a connection with any European power, which shall necessarily 

involve us in their broils, yet it is hardly possible for a commercial 

nation not to be implicated more or less in the contentions of 

other powers. Prudence and safety seem to require that we should 

be on good terms with the greatest naval power in Europe, as I 

* Paper alluded to published in New York, 1802 ; see Webster's Essays, dated 
June 1, 1797.

apprehend, in case of hostility, naval aid will nearly supersede the 
necessity of any other defense. 

In the ideas I have suggested, a few friends to whom I have 
communicated them, most heartily concur. And as we are 
probably approaching a rupture with France, we are to calculate 
upon the event, & be prepared to meet it. If we can escape it, 
so much the better. I sincerely wish the British Ministry could 
be convinced of the utility of conciliating the attachment of the 
Americans & of the extreme folly of irritating them by taking 
little advantages at sea. This policy had nearly thrown us into 
the arms of France in 1793. You know with what firmness Govt 
resisted, and you was among the foremost in the ranks on that 
occasion. The French interest is yet considerable, but much 
weakened, since the seizure and confiscation of our vessels in the 
West Indies. The tide has turned and the current is setting 
strong agt. the French Govt. The northern States wish peace as 
much as ever, but the losses of property already sustained, & the 
insolent conduct of the French Govt, toward ours, has united 
them in the opinion that war is probable, and they are ready to 
meet it with firmness. 

Never was there a more favorable moment for the British Govt, 
to remove the prejudice & regain the confidence of our citizens ; 
& what extreme ill-policy in the Ministry not to embrace it. . . . 

With great respect your obedt. Servt. 

N. Webster, Jr. 



John Jay to R. King, London. 

New York, June 3, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . The newspapers contain the Debates and Proceedings 
in Congress. Public opinion respecting the true policy of this 
country is gradually becoming more and more correct. Injurious 
Treatment from foreign nations, whether followed by peace or 
war, will encrease our Wisdom. It seems Experience must 
generally be purchased, and sometimes at a high price. 
I am happy to find that the Comrs. go on well, and that the brit- 
ish Govt, act candidly. 

The late session of our Legislature was a temperate and in 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE, 1 83 

several respects an useful one. The Security and Lassitude of 
the Federalists at the late election was such in this City and some 
other Places, that the present House of Assembly will be more 
chequered than the last. . . . 

Yours sincerely 
John Jay. 

A. Hamilton to R. King, London. 

June 8, 1797. 

I thank you, my Dear Sir, for your two letters lately received 
from you. ... I feel very guilty for my negligence — but 
how can I help it ? 

The public prints will inform you of the course of public pro- 
ceedings hitherto. You will perceive that the general plan is 
analogous to what was done in the case of Great Britain, though 
there are faults in the detail. Some people cannot learn that the 
only force which befits a government, is in the thought and action, 
not in the words, and many reverse this golden rule. I fear we 
shall do ourselves no honor in the result, and we shall remain at 
the mercy of events without those efficient preparations which are 
demanded by so precarious a situation, and which not provoking 
war, would put us in condition to meet it. All the consolation 
I can give is that the public temper of this country mends dayly 
& that there is no final danger of our submitting tamely to the 
yoke of France. 

Yrs. affectly. 

A. H. 

R. King to the Secretary of State. 

London, June 5, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . The Mutiny of the Navy is ascribed to the intrigues of 

Emissaries employed to mislead and corrupt the Seamen, and a 

Bill has been brought into Parliament for the Punishment of those 

who shall be detected. It is possible that the Seamen may have 

been tampered with, but practices of this sort could not well 

escape detection, and it is not easy to conceive that this general 

insubordination should have been produced in this manner. 



1 84 RUFUS KING. [1797 



There are other and more obvious causes to which it may be at- 
tributed. The Naval Force of the Enemy has been held in 
Contempt by the British Fleet. France has had neither Fleets 
nor Commerce against which the Navy of England could be 
employed. The men of war have therefore passed most of the 
time in Port ; discipline has been neglected ; the officers have 
lived on shore ; and the Ships have been left under the command 
of young, inexperienced and very subordinate officers ; besides 
the Times have been feverish and critical, and men of all, includ- 
ing the most subordinate, conditions have heard so much of the 
Equality and Rights of Man, that the dependencies of Society, 
instead of being acknowledged and submitted to by habit, have 
been questions for determination and proof. 

This, in my belief, is nearer the true solution than that which 
is publickly professed. 

The Situation of Ireland is still hazardous, and must neces- 
sarily be the subject of great inquietude. The Bank of England 
continues to make their operations solely with Paper, and it 
seems improbable that they will be able with safety to resume 
their ancient mode of payment before the return of Peace : an 
event that the present distresses of England may induce the 
French Government to postpone in hopes of a more ample grati- 
fication of their resentment and hatred against the only Nation 
which they own as a Rival. 

The supposed accession of Moderation in the new third added 
to the election of Barthelemy, have however decided the British 
Government to make another effort to terminate the war, and a 
Message has been Sent to France to ask a Passport for a Minister 
to be sent from this Country direct to Paris. 

With perfect Respect & Esteem 

Rufus King. 



R. King to N. Low. 

London, June 6th, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . It is not easy in a short letter to give you an adequate 
idea of the situation of this country. Ireland is in a very dis- 
turbed and critical condition, and government is there maintained 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE, 1 85 

alone by military force, although your kinsman, Mr. Wallace, who 
is at present in London, says things are not so bad in Ireland as 
they are represented. 

The late mutiny in the Channel on Lord Bridport's fleet, after 
a negotiation carried on between delegates on the part of the sea- 
men with the Lords of the Admiralty, was quieted and the fleet is 
now at sea. But the ships at Sheerness joined by a portion of 
Admiral Duncan's fleet from the north seas (which have confined 
their officers and separated from the fleet) are in a state of Revolt 
and indeed Rebellion. 

Negotiations have been attempted with them but their demands 
are deemed wholly subversive of the discipline and government 
of the navy and therefore not to be admitted. The consequence 
has been that the mutinous ships, consisting of about twenty sail, 
eleven of which are of the line, have blocked the mouth of the 
Thames and detain and plunder all vessels which pass. All com- 
munication with them is forbidden ; the neighbouring shores are 
put in a state of defence ; and the alternative seems to be submis- 
sion or the carrying of the ships to the enemy. 

The Bank will not resume their former mode of payments till 
peace. It is believed that their operations are prudent ; the first 
embarrassments which followed in stopping specie payments 
have in a great degree vanished. Specie circulates in small pay- 
ments, and very large sums have been obtained from abroad and 
lodged by the Bank in their vaults. 

The nation despairs of advantage from a continuation of the 
war ; they therefore desire peace, direct and new efforts to obtain 
which have been lately made by this government, who have sent 
a messenger to France to obtain a passport for a Minister to go 
to Paris. The moderation that has prevailed in the election of 
the new third, joined to the election of Barthelemi as a Director, 
are favorable to the conclusion of peace ; but the very great em- 
barrassment of England has a contrary influence and may induce 
the Directory to defer an event so much desired in hopes of seeing 
England, their only rival, reduced still lower. 

We who are nearer the war than you are earnestly hope that 
America will persevere in that course of moderation and prudence 
which has kept her out of the war. I think the late change in 
France furnishes an occasion that, if improved, will probably 



1 86 RUFUS KING. [1797 

terminate our disagreements, or at least so far terminate them, as 
to enable us to maintain peace with the preservation of pub. 
honor. The dreadful scenes which have been exhibited in 
Europe, and which are still to be exhibited, should decide us to 
reject the advice of those who may advise us to war. Fare- 
well — 

Rufus King. 



T. Pickering to R. King. 

" Department of State, June 9, 1797. 
" Dear Sir : 

" I have recurred to your letter of January 14th, in which you 
state your ideas relative to the monies which shall be recovered 
as indemnifications to our citizens for the losses sustained by 
British captures. They are indisputably just, and the agents of 
the United States employed and paid by the government in prose- 
cuting and establishing those claims, can form no rightful de- 
mands for compensation beyond their fixed salaries ; but after 
deducting the costs of prosecution, which shall have been ad- 
vanced by the United States, the remainder to be wholly paid to 
the claimant or his agent. 

" If however, the claimants choose to appoint either of the public 
agents (Mr. Bayard or Mr. Cabot) to receive their reimbursements 
there will be no objection made to it. Many of the sufferers have 
no connections in London, and such will doubtless prefer the pub- 
lic agents to receive their monies. Mr. Cabot will probably have 
authority from many of the claimants in New England to receive 
their dues, and with this view in part they solicited his appoint- 
ment ; and I know that the expectation of this benefit was a prin- 
cipal inducement with him to accept the public agency. Where 
the claimants have correspondents in England to receive their 
dues, there can be no pretence for any demand of commissions 
by either of the agents. Neither ought they to make any such 
demands when their monies can be safely lodged with some safe 
bankers, subject to be drawn for by the claimants without any 
expense. But there will be some risk in this mode of depositing 
the money, and whose shall it be ? Instead of drawing the monies 
from the British Government, will it not be most eligible to let 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 1 87 

them remain in the Bank of England to be paid at the times fixed 
by the commissioners or pursuant to the Decrees of the Courts ? 
For this purpose you will be pleased to make an arrangement 
with the British Government. . . . With this information of 
the intentions of the Government, you will consider yourself 
authorized to take, in forming the proposed arrangement, that full 
latitude and discretion, which the security of the property of our 
citizens and their receiving the same with the fewest possible 
deductions, shall appear to you to require." 



T. Pickering to R. King. 

" Department of State, June 15, 1797. 
" Dear Sir : 

". . . The Senators and that Representative (Mr. Lyons) 
from Vermont (the other Representative was not chosen when 
the present session commenced) have shown me a Letter from 
Governor Chittenden, desiring them to seek the aid of the British 
Minister in favor of General Allen's Claim for the restoration of 
the arms and cannon he procured from France and which were 
carried into England. I have handed that Letter to the British 
Minister, together with a Letter from each of these gentlemen in 
which they concur in one opinion that those arms and cannon 
were really destined for Vermont. They say that General Allen 
was embarrassed in his pecuniary affairs, for relief in which he 
has pledged real property to a large amount ; to redeem which 
was the object of his voyage to Europe, by some important specu- 
lation, to which his genius was well adapted. Governor Chitten- 
den advised him to speculate in arms for the purpose of supplying 
the militia of Vermont, who by the law of the State were required 
to furnish themselves, or, if paupers, their respective towns were 
to supply them ; the penalty for not being furnished was con- 
siderable. 

" General Allen, being successful in obtaining arms in France, 
gave notice of it to Governor Chittenden, who formally communi- 
cated the information to the Legislature of Vermont, last Fall. 
In consequence of the expected arrival of these arms, the Legis- 
lature suspended the law above mentioned, to give the militia this 



1 88 RUFUS KING, [1797 

opportunity of arming themselves before the penalty should be 
exacted. Other circumstances relative to the character of Gen- 
eral Allen and the nature of this speculation lead me to think that 
the real objects of it were to arm the militia of Vermont with 
arms which cost General Allen (or rather for which he made a 
bargain in form with the French minister of war) twenty five 
livres, but which he could readily sell to the militia for fifty livres 
to the number of ten or fifteen thousand in that State, and the 
residue to the militia of the neighbouring States or to the Govern- 
ment of some of the States ; and thus relieve himself from his 
incumbrances on his lands, which those Gentlemen assure me are 
extensive and worth perhaps two hundred thousand dollars, but 
a great part of which he has already forfeited, and will forfeit 
much more by means of the detention of the arms in question, 
unless they should be immediately restored, and his creditors, 
whose forfeitures are already incurred should from equitable 
views relinquish their strictly legal rights. 

" The Gentlemen assure me that the most friendly intercourse 
has taken place and is increasing between the inhabitants of 
Vermont and those of Canada [for whose benefit it has been sug- 
gested these arms were intended. — Ed.] and nothing would be 
more impracticable than to induce the former to aid an insurrec- 
tion against the British Government in that Province. 

" Upon the whole, it is the real wish of the Executive of the 
U. States that the arms and military stores in question may be 
restored to General Allen, to be brought to the U. States, where 
they are much wanted. By General Allen's Letter to Capt. 
Gould, of which you sent me a copy ; the General offered to give 
caution for the landing of the arms &c, in New York. Upon such 
security I hope there will be no difficulty in restoring them. . . . 

" We have this day a report by Letters from Boston, that the 
French Directory have proposed to the Council of 500 to declare 
war against the U. S. and the Council rejected the proposition. 
No act of the Directory can any longer excite surprise."

found no limits, and you have continued your kind care at Bris-

" Department of State, June 20, 1797. 
" Dear Sir : 

" . . . The President sincerely desirous of adjusting by 
negotiation all our differences with France, declared his determi- 
nation to pursue that course ; but the issue being uncertain 
strongly recommended preparatory measures of defence. In the 
Senate these assumed a form ; but the House of Representatives 
have but partially concurred. The session however continues, 
and as the aggressions on the part of France are multiplying 
daily, and Spain by her agents in Louisiana, has discovered an 
inclination to postpone and apparently to evade the execution of 
her Treaty with us, at least respecting the Boundary Line, and 
the withdrawing of her Troops from our Territory — perhaps the 
preparatory measures may at last be adopted. 

" The correspondence between Mr. Ellicott, the American 
Commissioner and the Spanish Governors, the Baron de Caron- 
delet and Gayoso, on the subject above mentioned, you will find 
in the Packet which accompanies this letter. The miserable pre- 
texts, evasions and prevarications of Governor Gayoso are aston- 
ishing. We should expect from any man claiming any degree of 
consideration, and especially from an officer of rank, even if 
deficient in moral principle, that for the sake of his reputation in 
the world, he would have some regard to consistency and truth. 

190 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. I9I 

But the Baron de Carondelet is still more eminent in rank ; he is 
the Governor General of Louisiana, and has, the Spanish Minister 
here informed me, been appointed lately to the Government of 
Quito in South America. Yet the Baron has written to the Min- 
ister on the subject of the Boundary and the Spanish Ports, and 
the Minister literally translating it, as he said, read me the Baron's 
Letter in which he makes some complaints against Mr. Ellicott, 
frivolous indeed, and one palpably false. He complained that 
Mr Ellicott had not informed him of his arrival at the Natchez 
as the Commissioner of the U. States for running the Boundary 
line ! I showed the chevalier d'Yrujo the Letter of Mr. Ellicott 
dated the 27th February to the Baron, three days after his arrival 
at the Natchez, and doubtless by the first conveyance to New 
Orleans, informing him of his arrival in the character of American 
Commissioner, and the Baron's answer of the 1st of March, con- 
gratulating Mr. Ellicott on his arrival. The Chevalier was con- 
founded, but said he supposed the Baron did not consider Mr. 
Ellicott's Letter as official 7 . . . 

" The Windsor (Vermont) Paper of June 9th informs that a 
Major McLane from Rhode Island and his brother and Thomas 
Butterfield of Vermont, have lately been apprehended at Quebec 
■ upon something more than a suspicion of treasonable practices 
against the Government of that province.' That Major McLane 
had a commission from the French Republic, was under pay, and 
for about two years had been faithfully employed whispering sedi- 
tion in the ears of the French Canadians ; and that upon exami- 
nation this appeared to be a branch of an extensive plan of opera- 
tions settled in the French Cabinet ; that upon the arrival of a 
Fleet in the St Lawrence the magazines were to be blown up — 
the French inhabitants were to rise in a mass and exterminate 
the English. It is added that several characters in Vermont are 
implicated in the business, and the whole (says the Editor) ' We 
learn by undoubted authority.' Probably Mr. Liston may have 
received official intelligence of this affair. The discovery corre- 
sponds with prior facts and circumstances indicating the designs 
of France to repossess Canada by a force from Europe, an insur- 
rection of the Canadians and aid from numerous adherents in the 
United States. In the expectations from the letter, I have 
no doubt France would find herself essentially disappointed. 



I92 RUFUS KING. [7179 

Whatever might have been done three years ago when we were 
suffering under British spoliations and saw threatening appear- 
ances of hostility from that power, France can form no reason- 
able hopes of assistance in the U. S. except from a few corrupt 
men, a few desperate adventurers, and a few, who apparently 
would be willing to sacrifice even their own country to their 
malignant passions. The Vermont Gentlemen in the Senate, 
who you know are persons of information and stability, assure me 
that the Inhabitants of their State are perfectly well disposed 
towards their neighbours in Canada and the British Government 
there established. 

" We are not without apprehensions that France means to regain 
Louisiana, and to renew the ancient plan of her Monarch, of cir- 
cumscribing and encircling what now constitutes the Atlantic 
States. To the execution of such a plan, so dangerous to our 
union and peace, every real American must be firmly opposed." 



T. Sedgwick to R. King. 

My Dear Sir : Philadelphia, 24 June, 1797. 

. The Convention of the Legislature was generally, I 
believe universally, approved by the friends of government and 
declaredly by all the Jacobins. The former, at the commence- 
ment of the session, warmly approved the sentiments expressed in 
the Prest's speech. War must, if possible, be avoided ; a redress 
of our injuries must be obtained. For these purposes, a new 
attempt must be made to negotiate, & to render its success prob- 
able, manly preparations must be made. This was the language 
held by all our friends, and altho' the reasons for such a system 
of measures have been strengthened and increased by events, 
which, since that time, have been disclosed, and altho' men of 
good disposition, are in fact a majority, yet all things dictated by 
our situation have been left undone. 

To account for these apparent contradictions, I am sorry to 
state a fact, which to my mind is the principal & perhaps the only 
operative cause, a dread of the power &° vengeance of the terrible 
Republic. Some almost explicitly declare it : they talk of our 
divided councils, — that France elated with victory will be irri- 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 1 93 

tated by any attempt to coerce — that resistance in Europe is at an 
end, and that in the event of peace now certain, she can have no 
motive to quarrel with us, but on the other hand will hope to 
participate in our commerce, as the means of reviving her own, 
— that therefore she will be disposed to conciliate &c. &c. Con- 
comitantly with arguments of this nature, the authors of them 
dwell on the necessity of avoiding expence, and indeed to justify 
themselves declare that any incurred at present for defence or 
protection would be a waste of money. The session is now draw- 
ing to a close and we shall separate after having given to the 
world the most conclusive evidence that the contempt in which 
France holds our power of resistance, which is her motive for 
aggression, is a sentiment well founded. 

Our friend Gerry is the third of our joint and several ministers 
to France. No appointment could, in my opinion, have been 
more injudicious. In justice to the President's council, I ought 
to tell you, that the nomination was not the result of their appro- 
bation, and in justice to myself, I declare that it received my 
negative. However painful, for reasons which will be obvious to 
you, it was to withhold my consent, I could not reconcile to myself 
to approve an appointment so highly improper. Messrs. Read, 
Marshall, Ross, Tracy & Goodhue also voted against it. 

I have frequently seen the british commissioners ; and am much 
pleased with them, particularly Mr. McDonald. I believe they 
have a disposition to conduct liberally. 

The House of Representatives did not reelect Mr. Beckley as 
their Clerk. This was resented not only by himself but the whole 
party, and they were rendered furious by it. To revenge, Beck- 
ley has been writing a pamphlet mentioned in the enclosed adver- 
tisement. The " authentic papers " there mentioned are those of 
which you perfectly know the history, formerly in the possession 
of Messrs. Monroe, Muhlenberg & Venable. This conduct is 
mean, base and infamous. It may destroy the peace of a respect- 
able family, and so gratify the diabolical malice of a detestable 
faction, but I trust it cannot produce the intended effect of injur- 
ing the cause of government. . . . With much sincerity and 
esteem 

Your affect'e friend

I have been honoured with your letter of the 12th of Novr. of the 
last, and 6th of Feby. & 26th of April of the present year ; and feel 
myself much obliged by your kind & prompt attention to the pub- 
lication of the Decree of the High Court of Chancery, of the State 
of Virginia ; the evidence of which you were pleased to forward 
in the London Gazette. 

As you will have the Political situation of this country trans- 
mitted to you from the proper Department, and, no doubt, will 
be informed of the causes wch. have produced it and which 
create a continual opposition to the Administration, detailed with 
more accuracy by such of your friends as are at or near the foun- 
tain of intelligence, than I could do, I shall say but little more on 
the subject of Politics, than that matters are pretty much in the 
train you left them ; and that it is my firm belief that no occur- 
rence or event, of whatsoever kind or nature it may be, will 
change the sentiments, or (which perhaps would be more correct) 
the conduct of some characters amongst us. 

However much to be regretted this is, by those who think dif- 
ferently, yet, having taken my seat in the Shade of my Vine & 
Fig tree, I shall endeavour to view things in the " calm lights of 
mild Philosophy " ; persuaded that if ever a crisis should arise to 
call forth the good sense & spirit of the People, no deficiency in 
either will be found. 

For the interesting details you have had the goodness to com- 
municate in your several letters, I pray you to accept my thanks. 
It is reported, and with a confidence which gives it a currency, 
that the preliminaries of Peace between France & Austria are 
actually signed. For the sake of humanity, I hope it is true, but 
it is an accommodation of the differences between the former & 
Great Britain, that is to produce harmony in this country ; for 
nothing short of that, while there is a party determined to advo- 
cate French measures under all circumstances, & to withdraw 
this country from that tried neutrality, which its policy adopted 
& the administration has adhered to, can effect this purpose. 

Let me ask the favor of you to present me in respectful terms

to Mrs. King, and that you would be assured of the great esteem 
& regard with which 

I am, Dear Sir, your most obedt. Hble. Servt.

R. King to A. Hamilton.* 

London, June 27th, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

Lord Malmesbury will leave London in three or four days for 
Lisle, where the conferences between this country and France are 
to be held. Opinions fluctuate concerning the probability of 
peace. A struggle evidently exists in France between the Direc- 
tory and the Legislature ; in the latter of which bodies it is sup- 
posed there is a sincere desire of peace. 

Some late proceedings in the Legislature, or rather in the 
Council of Five Hundred, give occasion to hope that our affairs 
are in train to assume a more friendly appearance. 

If, as many assert, the public opinion is friendly to America, it 
will be employed by the Legislature against the Directory, which 
at this moment is viewed as a rival power. We have just received 
the President's speech : it has arrived at a critical hour. You 
will perceive by newspapers that all Italy will be overturned. 
Venice is no more ; and Genoa has been completely revolution- 
ized by Citizen Faypoult, the Minister of France. 

Portugal sees, but seems unable to escape her fate. 

Though these are days of wonder, still one dares not believe 
all we hear. The march already made by France has astonished 
and confounded every beholder — and we are told that she medi- 
tates and will attempt projects still more gigantic than those she 
has executed — plans which will operate a change in the whole face 
of Europe, and which extend to every other quarter of the globe. 
Russia may be able to preserve her dominions from the fire that 
is passing over the neighbouring countries. This nation has 
lately renewed her commercial treaty with Russia, and by an 
arrangement of their mutual interests may strengthen their com- 
mon defence. It may be worth remarking that during this 
negotiation Russia never even proposed the project of the armed 

* Works of Hamilton, vi., 260.

neutrality, so that the omission of the requisite provisions on 
that subject may be considered as an abandonment of the system 
by Russia. 

Russia is to be treated in the British ports upon the same foot- 
ing as the most favored European nation. Farewell. 

Yours, &c, &c. 



T. Pickering to R. King. 

" Department of State, July 8, 1797. 
" Dear Sir : 

" . . . The letter from Governor Blount to Carey has 
been considered by both Houses of Congress. . . . This in- 
tended Impeachment induced Governor Blount and his friends 
to endeavour to postpone a decision on a question of expulsion 
(from the Senate) until the trial on the Impeachment should be 
had ; when, if found guilty, his removal from office would be a 
part of his sentence. . . . But the impropriety of suffering a 
Senator incontrovertibly guilty of the crimes exhibited in his 
Letter to Carey, to retain his seat was stated with great force and 
justice ; and after hearing Governor Blount by his Counsel 
(Messrs. Ingersoll and Dallas), the Senate this day pronounced 
the Sentence of Expulsion with only one dissenting voice, Mr. 
Tazewell's — 25 Senators were present. Mess. Mason, Stockton, 
Schuyler, Paine and Langdon, together with the Vice President 
were absent. Mr. Bradford was President pro tempore. 

Precisely to understand the nature of Governor Blount's offence, 
it will be necessary to remind and inform you that Col. Hawkins 
(whom you well know) is the actual Superintendent of the United 
States for the four Southern Indian Nations ; that Dinsmoor is a 
particular agent of the U. S. residing among the Cherokees ; that 
Byers is the factor charged with the public store at Tallico- 
Blockhouse, for carrying on trade with the Indians, and that 
Carey, to whom the Letter was written, was the Interpreter regu- 
larly appointed and in constant pay of the United States for the 
Cherokee Nation. Carey had been employed in the same capacity 
during Governor Blount's Superintendency, and doubtless was 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. igj 

supposed by the latter to be devoted to his interest, and abso- 
lutely subject to his direction. Chisholm also used to be an 
agent of the Governor and was often employed by him in Indian 
affairs, carrying messages into their nations and repeatedly con- 
ducting the Chiefs to and from Philadelphia. Chisholm came 
on here last winter with a party of the Cherokee Chiefs. You 
will see by Mr. Liston's note to me, dated the second instant, that 
several persons were concerned in offering to him the project ex- 
hibited in Governor Blount's Letter. But their names are not yet 
known. . . ." * 

The following letter from Mr. Liston will be interesting 
in this connection as showing the circumstances under 

* " Along with the papers transmitted to Congress in relation to the Spanish 
business was the copy of a letter from William Blount, late Governor of the 
Territory south of the Ohio, and now one of the Senators from Tennessee, ad- 
dressed to a recently appointed Indian agent (Carey) among the Cherokees, by 
whom it had been communicated to the President. It appeared from this let- 
ter, as well as from information furnished by Liston, the new British Minister, 
of whom explanations had been asked, that Blount was engaged in an intrigue 
for transferring New Orleans and the neighboring districts to the British by 
means of a joint expedition, Britain to furnish a naval force, and a co-operating 
corps of backwoodsmen and Indians to be raised on the western frontier of the 
United States. Desperately involved in extensive land speculations in Ten- 
nessee, and wishing to relieve himself by getting up an English company for 
the purchase of his lands, Blount dreaded the re-transfer to the French, a mili- 
tary and not a commercial nation, of the outlet of the Mississippi, a transfer 
expected, and indeed supposed by some to be already made. Conceiving that 
it would be for the interest of the Western people, as well as for his own pri- 
vate benefit as a land speculator, that Louisiana should pass into the hands of 
the English, he relied upon his influence with the backwoodsmen of Tennessee, 
and with the Southern Indians, among whom he had long acted as agent, to raise 
a necessary force. He had engaged as his chief co-operator one Chisholm, a 
wild backwoodsman, well acquainted with the Spanish posts, and who had con- 
ceived against the Spanish authorities, from some collisions with them, a bitter 
hatred and an ardent desire of revenge, and, in his letter, laid before Congress, 
he had sought to engage in his schemes the Indian agent to whom it was 
addressed. 

" It did not appear that the British minister had given to it any other coun- 
tenance beyond yielding to Chisholm's earnest request to be sent to England to 
lay the project before the British ministry, by whom it was rejected on the very 
ground that it might interfere with the neutrality of the United States." —

which he introduced Mr. Chisholm to his correspondent in 
England. 



R. LlSTON TO J. H. GOVERTS, ESQ. 

Philadelphia, 16th March, 1797. 

Dear Sir : 

I beg leave to recommend to your attention and good offices the 
bearer of this Letter, Mr. John Chisholm, a native of Scotland, 
but settled from his early years in this Country. He goes to Eu- 
rope to dispose of certain Lands situated in different parts of 
America, but particularly in the South : and if you can in this 
point render him any service, you will personally oblige me. I 
beg however that before you do anything definitive & particularly 
before you either advance or even promise money, you will natu- 
rally consider the long letter I wrote you on this subject on the 
13th of last month. This I say so far as it regards myself ; as to 
others I give you full liberty to do, and to allow him to do, what- 
ever you please. 

My injunctions on this subject are the more positive, as I have 
lately seen Capt. W, from the Genessee Country & listened with 
a pleasure mixed with regret, which I cannot describe, to his de- 
scription of the new Settlements he is carrying on there. Upon 
my honour, it is enough to make a man go stark staring mad. 
However, mum ! I do not hold this language to my friends in 
London, and I beg you never may. 

I do not think it impossible that Mr. Chisholm may push on 
to London, if he is not completely successful at Hamburgh. If 
so, and if he applies to you for a recommendation to any of your 
correspondents in London, I beg you will not refuse it to him. I 
do not intend he should return re infecta, and I am well acquainted 
with your goodness. . . . The damned French Rogues are 
playing the Devil with this country, as they have done with all 
the world ; but, as you used to say, when things are at the worst, 
they must mend. Amen, so be it. 

With perfect truth, your most obedient and faithful humble 
Servant, 

R. Liston.

Wm. Bingham to R. King. 

Philada., July 10, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

I received your Letter of April 26th, with several inclosures 
from the Marquis of Lansdown, who, I am pleased to find, is 
much gratified with the Portrait of the President. Stewart has 
been much disappointed in his Hopes relative to Profits, which he 
expected to derive from this Picture. He had wrote to his friend 
West, requesting him to engage an able artist to execute an En- 
graving therefrom, which, from the general admiration the picture 
attracted, might have been disposed of to great advantage in this 
Country. He has not heard from Mr. West, & he is fearful that 
Lord Lansdown's obliging character may induce him to permit 
some other artist to take off the Impression.* 

Congress has finished its Sessions. Its acts during that Period, 
partake strongly of a Disposition towards Peace, thro' friendly 
Negotiation. Many of our Friends, who believe war with France 
inevitable, wished the public councils to assume that appearance. 
In the meantime our Commerce is much molested, & Bankruptcies 
are already happening in our great Towns. A stagnation is 
taking place in business of all kinds ; the Wages of Labor are 
lowering ; Property of all kinds is much diminished in value ; 
Disappointment in their views, joined to a great scarcity of 
money, has put an end to the various extravagant Speculations, 
which disgraced the Country ; many of those, who engaged 
deeply, are ruined & involved great numbers in their Mis- 
fortunes. 

A general Hope prevails, that Peace will take place in Europe 
as the result of the present Negotiations. This alone will heal 
our Misunderstanding with the French Republic. A Commission 
of Envoys extraordinary has been instituted ; it is questionable 
whether they will be received, & still more doubtful whether, if 
received, their Negotiation will be successful. If war should en- 
sue, I dread the Disorganization and extreme Disorder which will 
arise out of it, especially in the Southern Parts of the Union. 

The public papers will inform you of the Expulsion of Gov. 
Blount from the Senate. A Letter, which you will find published, 

* This happened, and thus Stuart lost the benefit. 



200 RUFUS KING. [1797 

he wrote to the Interpreter of the Cherokee Nation was the Cause 
of it. A Project was set on foot, ostensibly to engage & encour- 
age the British to attack the Spanish Settlements. But it rather 
appears that the real object was to alarm the Spaniards, and when 
the Agents in this Business had created serious Apprehensions in 
their Minds, then to offer their Services to arrest or oppose its 
Progress, from which they expected to derive immense advan- 
tages. This nefarious Scheme was dark & intricate, & the full 
Extent of its Views is not yet unravelled. It has defeated the 
Provisions of the Spanish Treaty, as relative to the Cession of 
Territory, near the Boundary Line, & without great Prudence, at 
the present moment, on the part of our Government may involve 
us in a war with that nation. 

I will write to Baron Hompesch on the Subject of his Proposals 
relative to the Transportation of his Germans to this Country : I 
do not think that I can offer him much Encouragement. Such 
an arrangement can only succeed after a Variety of necessary 
Measures have been pursued preparatory to their Arrival. How- 
ever I will present the Matter to him in different Points of View, 
so that he shall be fully acquainted with the Subject & be able to 
act with Confidence. 

With great sincerity yours, 

Wm. Bingham. 



R. King to Wm. Hindman. 

London, July 15, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

It was some time after my arrival here that I received the Let- 
ter that you wrote to me just before my embarkation. My Brother 
accompanied me as my Secretary, but as he is destined to the 
Profession of the Law, and had not been admitted to the Bar 
when he left America, he has returned home in order to pursue 
his Studies. This has occasioned a vacancy in the place of my 
Secretary, which I am willing should be filled by Mr. Helmsley. 
Inclosed is a letter for him which I request you to deliver. Mr. 
Helmsley will be one of my family in all respects, except that he 
will not lodge in my house. This was the footing on which Mr.

Deas was with my Predecessor. . . . My table will be that of 
my Secretary, and his servant will eat with mine. I mention 
these small circumstances that no misconception may take place 
respecting them. If I have but a very slight knowledge of Mr. 
Helmsley that indeed has left favorable impressions of his 
character ; I rely essentially upon your knowledge and recom- 
mendation of it. I shall be inclined to treat him as a friend, if 
he will put it in my power. . . . 

Farewell, my worthy friend, and accept 
the assurance of my sincere Esteem and Friendship, 

Rufus King.

R. King to Lord Grenville. 

Great Cumberland Place, July 19, 1797. 
My Lord : 

I have the honor to send your Lordship inclosed copies of my 
Letter of the 10th of February and also of a Letter that some time 
ago I wrote to the Lord Chancellor respecting the Maryland Bank 
Stock. I have the satisfaction to add that the Lord Chancellor 
lately informed me that the Certificate (which for many years has 
been in the Court of Chancery) is now in a situation in which a 
Transfer of the Stock could be made to me, provided his Majesty 
under his Sign Manual would give an order for that Purpose. 

Since the date of my Letter to the Chancellor, I have ascer- 
tained that the other persons who claimed to be indemnified from 
the Fund for their Losses in Maryland, have as American Loyal- 
ists been compensated for these Losses by his Majesty's Govern- 
ment, so that the Claim is freed from those demands, which are 
supposed formerly to have obstructed the Transfer. I take the 
Liberty to request your Lordship's interference for the Purpose 
of Compleating, in such manner as shall be deemed adviseable, 

202 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 203 

the Transfer of the said Stock to me for the use of the State of 
Maryland. 

With perfect Consideration & Respect, &c. &c. 

Rufus King. 



R. King to Lord Grenville. 

Private. 

Great Cumberland Place, July 20, 1797. 
My Lord : 

From what has taken place in the Court of Chancery, I flatter 
myself that there no longer exists any objection agt. the Transfer 
of the Maryland Bk. Stock : my only remaining concern is, that 
the Business should be finished without Delay. Since the Trans- 
fer is to be made, I take the liberty to express to your Lordship 
my earnest wish, that it may take place as soon as possible. I 
think I do not deceive myself in supposing that the satisfactory 
settlement of this Affair at the present juncture may be attended 
with consequences mutually beneficial to both Countries. 

I presume that the order will enjoin the Accountant General 
of the Court of Chancery to pay over such Dividends as he may 
have received since the Stock has stood in his name, and which 
may not have been invested in further Sums of capital Stock. 

I intreat your Lordship's attention to this Subject before the 
King goes to Weymouth ; and beg you to accept the assurance of 
the sincere Respect and Esteem, &c. 

Rufus King. 



R. King to Secretary of State. 

London, July 27, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

I was a few days since informed that Instructions were by the 

last vessel sent to Mr. Liston to propose an article to be added to 

the late Treaty, which should stipulate that all Deserters from the 

Army and Navy of the two countries should be delivered up and 

obliged to return to the service from which they deserted. This 

Instruction, it is understood, has been given in consequence of 



204 RUFUS KING. [1797 

the inconvenience experienced by the British Ships of war in our 
Ports. We cannot with propriety object to such just and con- 
venient Regulations as may be calculated to promote and secure 
a good Understanding and friendly intercourse between us and 
other Nations. But that proposed embraces only part of a Sub- 
ject of great Extent and Importance ; and it does not appear to 
me that it would consist with good Policy to enter into any par- 
tial Stipulations respecting it ; more especially when our repeated 
Overtures to adjust the entire Subject on Principles of liberality 
and mutual advantage, if not neglected, have not been received 
in a manner we had a Right to expect. 

I have received a letter from Col. Humphries, dated the 21st 
of June, in which he informs me that it is probable that our Peace 
with Tunis has been concluded and that for the purpose of cora- 
pleating our Treaties with the three principal Barbary Powers, he 
may be obliged to draw on the House of Barings for 170,000 or 
200,000 dollars ; he adds that he has no other resource but the 
Credit of the United States in London, and that a failure in the 
procuring of this Sum, may put at Risque what we have already 
expended to accomplish this object. The House of Barings are 
already in advance a few Thousand Pounds beyond the Funds 
remitted to them. You are sensible that I have no authority to 
enter into any engagements upon this Subject, the whole concern 
having been committed to Col. Humphries. 

I have not however on that account omitted to employ the best 
means in my power to make a provisional arrangement for the 
advance of this money, should Col. Humphries be under the 
necessity of drawing for it. Accordingly the Mess. Hopes and 
the House of Barings have agreed to accept and pay Col. 
Humphries' Bills. The Business will be conducted by the House 
of Barings. I have informed Col. Humphries of this arrange- 
ment and shall in a few days be able to send you Copies of the 
Letters between Col. Humphries and me and between me and the 
Mess. Barings ; these will give you full information of the terms 
upon which the money will be advanced by the Mess. Hopes & 
Barings. . . . 

My letter of the 26th of June will apprise you of the Regula- 
tions I have presented to Mr. Bayard concerning the Receit, 
Custody and payment of the Monies. (Paid under the Decisions 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 205 

of the Commissioners for settling claims & damages against Eng- 
land.) The affairs of some of the Claimants have been deranged 
and their Creditors employ every means to seize their property 
wherever it can be found. Among these means they have served 
attachments upon Mr. Bayard to arrest any property which may 
come into his Hands. This circumstance joined to an opinion 
that my Superintendance of the Payments might be advantageous 
have induced me to deposit the Money received on the Awards in 
the Bank of England to my Credit. I have at the same time by 
procuration appointed Mr. Bayard to draw for and pay the Money 
to the respective Claimants. This Arrangement will disappoint 
the Schemes of Arrestation that otherwise might have been prac- 
tised, and as the Receit Book will show the sums drawn and the 
names of the persons to whom paid, this check will be in favor of 
a correct execution of this Trust. 

With perfect Respect & Esteem, &c. 

Rufus King. 



Sir Joseph Banks to R. King. 

Soho Square, July 29, 1797. 
Sir : 

The King having been graciously pleased to give orders that 
Mr. Francis Masson, a Botanic Gardener who has for many years 
been employed to collect Plants for the Royal Gardens at Kew in 
Various parts of Europe, Africa & America, do proceed to upper 
Canada to collect and transmit from thence to Kew such Plants 
as he may discover which have not yet been described by Botani- 
cal Writers ; and it having been represented to his Majesty that 
the most commodious Rout Mr. Masson can chuse is by the way 
of New York, I have his Majesty's command to solicit your 
Excellency to furnish him with the necessary Passports for his 
intended journey. 

I beg leave at the same time to state to your Excellency that it 
appears to me very desireable that Mr. Masson should during the 
time of his Residence in upper Canada, visit the immense Tract 
of high Land between the Lakes Michigan and Huron, from 
whence numerous rivers take their Rise, some of which discharge 
their waters into the Western & some into the Eastern Lakes, 



206 RUFUS KING. [1797 

provided that the States of America are not likely to make any 
objection to his undertaking this journey, of which I beg your 
Excellency's opinion and also your advice how to proceed in case 
it is deemed proper that Mr. Masson should Receive it before 
he undertakes to carry on his Enquiries within the American 
Boundaries. I have the honor to be 

with respect, esteem & regard, your Excellencies 

Obedient Hble Servant 

Jos. Banks. 

It cannot be without interest to read the following letter 
to M. Talleyrand, and especially in view of his conduct 
towards the envoys who had been sent from the United 
States to endeavor to reconcile the two nations and re-estab- 
lish the good feeling which had formerly existed. How 
entirely Mr. King misunderstood the wily and dishonest 
statesman at that time is only too evident. 

R. King to Mons. Talleyrand, &c. 

London, 3d Aug., 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

My Countryman and friend Col. John Trumbull is going to Stutt- 
gard for the purpose of receiving a Plate that has been engraved 
for him in that City from a Picture which he painted some years 
since in Commemoration of a military Event that occurred in our 
Revolutionary War. It would very much shorten his journey if 
he could receive a Passport to go and return thro' France. I 
therefore take the liberty to state to you his wishes and if no 
public consideration forbids it, I think I can rely upon your dis- 
position to gratify Col. Trumbull in his request. If the Passport 
is lodged with the Mayor or Municipality of Calais, he will with- 
out difficulty find it on his arrival at that Place. 

I cannot suffer the present occasion to pass, without offering 
you my congratulations upon your appointment to the office of 
Foreign Affairs, a department always and in every country im- 
portant ; but nowhere so much so as with you at the present 
Juncture. Neither will I affect to conceal from you that the 
satisfaction with which I have heard of your choice has not been 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 207 

purely disinterested. We have been accustomed to converse on 
every subject with the greatest freedom ; and though I ought to 
impose upon myself a reserve that official situation on both sides 
may seem to recommend, yet I prefer to express my sentiments 
with that frankness which you approve and practice and which 
always belongs to important occasions. 

You know, because you have resided among us, that we desire 
to have neither attachment nor aversion to any Nation. France 
has no cause to believe that we prefer any other to her, and you 
can pronounce, if we had an aversion to any Nation, that it would 
not be to yours. Not yet recovered from the Derangement in 
our affairs produced by our Revolutionary War, busily employed 
in watching the operations of our new organization, and in gaining 
by our Union Strength and Consistency, we were forbid by all 
the Duties of Patriotism from suffering ourselves to become 
Parties in a war in which from situation, we could afford little aid, 
and should be certain to suffer great, if not irreparable Evils. Our 
Policy has, therefore, been by practising Justice to all and by ob- 
serving the most scrupulous and exact neutrality, to establish and 
confirm our State, to remain in peace. Unfortunately our success 
has not corresponded with our Expectations ; you witnessed 
the Posture of our affairs when we suffered by the British Depre- 
dations on our Commerce, and you saw its influence upon the 
public opinion, and you also perfectly understand the motives 
which guided us in the Measures we adopted to procure Compen- 
sation for our Losses and to maintain our National Peace. 

The afflicting Events which have since occurred are notorious: 
but their extent and tendency are, I apprehend, greater and 
more consequential than has been supposed. It is neither France 
nor America which will be benefitted by the angry Passions which 
so many causes unite to provoke. This is a fruitful and interest- 
ing topic : to your mind it is not necessary to present its details ; 
you will view the subject in the extensive consequences with 
which it is connected, and I am confident that you will exhibit it 
in the light in which a wise Policy requires it should be seen. 
Without intimating how much, in my poor opinion, the Character 
of the future Connections of America with Europe will depend 
upon the Sentiments of France concerning Questions which have 
arisen and must be decided, I will only add to these private and 



208 RUFUS KING. [1797 

personal observations, that from the moment I heard that you had 
been named to the Department of Foreign Affairs, I have felt a 
satisfactory Confidence that the Cause of the increasing Misunder- 
standing between us would cease, and that the overtures meditated 
by our Government would not fail to restore Harmony and Friend- 
ship between the two Countries. 

Accept, my dear Sir, the assurances of the Sincere attachment 

& Esteem, &c, &c, 

Rufus King. 

R. King to R. Troup. 
Dear Sir : London, Aug. 4, 1797- 

I promised myself a treasure in your correspondence, for really 
one's friends are so occupied, or so little inclined to give them- 
selves the trouble of writing even the familiar incidents which 
occur from day to day, that when absent we know very little of 
what is passing at Home. You began with me in a way that prom- 
ised to leave me no regrets on this subject, but unfortunately I 
have reed, but a single letter from you since your promotion. 
Now, my dear Judge, I must appeal to your Equity, for I think 
you are a chancellor as well as a common Law Judge, and with 
its assistance endeavour to enforce your engagement to be a 
punctual, nay a better correspondent than Hamilton, or any 
other of our friends whom you sometimes amuse yourself with. 
As for Lawrance, I have not heard from him since he became a 

Senator. . . . 

Farewell, yrs., 

R. K. 

Do you know, my dear Judge, that the Debates which took 
place in May & June last in a certain Assembly, did not afford 
me any gratification ? Is it that they were ill reported, or that 
they did not display the true character of our country ? 



R. King to Secretary of State. 
Dear Sir: London, Aug. 5, 1797- 

. . . Great Secrecy prevails concerning the Negotiations at 
Lisle, which may be protracted for many Months, and probably 
are to be very materially affected by the result of the Struggle

which exists at Paris between the different Parties. The Refusal 
to evacuate the Spanish Posts in the Mississippi according to the 
Stipulations of the Treaty ; the Spoliations committed upon our 
Commerce by the Spanish Privateers, and that under the most 
scandalous pretexts, joined to the prevalence of the Rumour that 
Spain has actually ceded Louisiana to France, are circumstances 
of some weight in leading us to apprehend that France has really 
become the Proprietor of that extensive and undefined Region. 

Immediately on the Receit of your Letter of the 16th of June 
I communicated to Lord Grenville the President's opinion and 
wishes respecting the Military Stores claimed by General Allen ;* 
and in consequence thereof, notwithstanding this Government 
has received Information which was confidentially shewn to me 
that the Arms were French Property, and that General Allen 
would lose nothing by their Condemnation, I have been assured, 
and am satisfied, that the Government are disposed to restore 
them without farther Enquiry : but the Captors, who have no In- 
terest in the Question, refuse to consent to the restoration, and 
persist in holding the property for Trial. The process is at a 
stage when according to the usual Custom of the Court, the claim- 
ant has a Title to receive the Property on bail. I have advised 
General Allen to endeavour to obtain Possession of the Property 
in this way, and, in case he fails in the attempt, to leave the claim 
in the care of his Counsel and to return home. . . . 

With great Respect & Esteem, &c, 

Rufus King. 



T. Pickering to R. King. 

Department of State, Aug. 5, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

In my letter of the 8th of July I gave you some information 
respecting Governor Blount's conspiracy. The House of Rep- 
resentatives appointed a Committee to sit in the recess, with 
power to send for persons and papers. By this authority they 
sent and took Dr. Romayne of New York and his papers ; but I 
do not learn that any important discoveries were the consequence. 
The Party, who stick at nothing to excite resentment against

210 RUFUS KING. [1797 

Great Britain, ascribe the plot to her Minister, Mr. Liston, and 
pronounce that the British Government was at the bottom of it. 
But no evidence has as yet appeared to warrant these charges. 
On the contrary, Mr. Liston's frank declarations, verbally and 
in writing, have been verified, and the discoveries, as to the 
participation of the British amount to no more than this — That 
certain citizens of the United States, of whom Capt. John Chis- 
holm was one, made proposals early last winter to Mr. Liston, 
for an expedition against the Floridas and adjacent possessions 
of Spain, to be carried on by land with the aid of citizens of 
the United States, assisted by the Indians, and by sea, on the 
part of the British ; that Mr. Liston among other objections to 
the project offered these two, that upon the plan proposed the 
expedition could not be carried into execution without viola- 
ting the neutral rights of the United States, nor without employing 
the Indians ; that he nevertheless thought it his duty to com- 
municate the project to his Government, accompanied with his 
objections ; and that his Government rejected the proposals, be- 
cause the means suggested were inadequate to the object ; and 
because, independently of all other objections, the two reasons 
of Mr. Liston above mentioned were sufficient to determine the 
British Ministry not to adopt it. It appears also that the answer 
of Lord Grenville not arriving so soon as Chisholm expected, he 
became impatient ; and importuned Mr. Liston to let him go in 
person to London to tell his own story, which with much hesita- 
tion and reluctance Mr. Liston consented, paying his passage. 



R. King to A. Hamilton.* 

London, August 6th, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

No satisfactory opinion can yet be formed concerning the ter- 
mination of the negotiations for peace. Even those who are sup- 
posed to have the best information are without confidence. On 
the one hand, peace may be concluded sooner than any one 
thinks probable. On the other, the negotiations at Lisle and 
Montebello may be suddenly broken off, and France again en- 
gaged with Austria, as well as England. A great struggle in which 

* Works of Hamilton, vi., 262. 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 211 

all Europe think themselves interested exists between the two 
Councils and a majority of the Directory, for it is well understood 
that almost every question is decided in this latter body by three 
against two. If the Councils prevail, peace is believed to be more 
probable ; if the war continues, Denmark and the neighboring 
free cities, Portugal, perhaps Switzerland, and even Greece, as 
well as the whole of Italy will be revolutionized. I wish I could 
write to you with the same freedom as we could converse. How 
far the new order of things is to extend, which are still to be over- 
turned, and who are to be spared, is a subject concerning which 
we amuse ourselves with conjectures. It would be a consolation, 
could we anywhere discover a mind of adequate foresight and 
authority to influence, to combine and apply to their proper and 
legitimate uses, the disposition and the means which unques- 
tionably exist to resist and baffle the monstrous force which over- 
turns and will continue to lay waste every country against which 
it bends its energies. Paradoxical as it may appear, the people 
are less wrong than their governments, which, everywhere seem 
to be destitute of both wisdom and courage. I cannot except 
even the government of this country, which possessing the com- 
mand of the resources of the richest nation in Europe, with a 
clear and distinct view of the total insecurity of any compromise 
with their enemy, still dismounts and lowers the national spirit 
and courage by fruitless and repeated efforts to restore peace. 
Men are mortal and by a law to which they are subject, can exist 
but for a limited time. Societies are exempt from this law, and 
there is nothing in their nature that limits their improvement, in 
duration ; still the analogy is but too strict, and we seem to be 
doomed to witness, if not to suffer, in the dissolution of the 
present social organization. Farewell — when I am able to give 
you a gayer prospect I will write you again. 



G. Cabot to R. King, London. 

Brookline, August 17, 1797. 
My Dear Sir : 

Altho' it is a long time since I had the pleasure of hearing from 

you, yet I have no right to complain, but we are full of concern 

for the fate of Europe, which we know may ultimately affect our 



212 RUFUS KING. [1797 

own ; we are anxious to see the condition of their political wrecks, 
after the revolutionary storm shall subside. But when will this 
happen ? I, who am a sailor, have great fears of a sudden calm ; 
the tempestuous gales, which threaten to overwhelm the ship, 
furnish also some means of escape, but the terrible agitations, 
which succeed the wind, bring a destruction which cannot be 
resisted & from which there can be no flight. ... I 
refer you to the public papers for all sorts of news & I am 
mortified that they should tell to you & the world how much we 
are disgraced by the Congressional discussions of the last session. 
But at the same time, I think that I can assure you that the peo- 
ple are infinitely better than many of the Representatives, and 
that infamous servility discovered in the debates has been 
properly reprobated. 

Ever your sincere friend, 

G. Cabot. 



Wm. Hindman to R. King, London. 

Bellfield, Talbot County, Maryland, Aug. 21st, 1797. 

My Dear Sir : 

. . I presume you have been already gratified in hear- 
ing that there is a Majority of fsederal Members in the House 
of Representatives ; it is by the bye a very bare one. Of this 
number there are some new Members who want training. They 
sometimes get frightened and fly the way ; I am in hopes they 
will understand things better at the next Session & feel the neces- 
sity of going with the Friends of Government upon all occasions. 
The Antis, or Jacobins, or whatever name may be given them, 
are ever at their Post, always prepared to seize upon any Prey 
which may offer, whenever they discover a new member, who 
comes under the character of fsederal, in any sort wavering. They 
hang about him, flatter him, sometimes completely seduce him. 
In this they have an Advantage, as the same measures are not 
taken on our side of the Question. Jacobinism I think is on the 
Decline, happily for the Friends of Government and those who 
administer it ; whenever any Plots or Villainies are discovered it 
ever falls upon those worthless Men, who have the Effrontery to 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 213 

stile themselves the exclusive Patriots. Quondam Senator Blount's 
letter you must have seen. 

The Ministerial appointment of our Friend W. Smith of 
Charleston will be a great loss to our House, unless he is suc- 
ceeded either by your Predecessor Major Pinckney or Mr. Desa- 
soare, of which I hear there are some Hopes ; it is said if either 
of those Gentlemen will consent to stand, there is no doubt of 
their Election ; if they do not, there is some danger that our for- 
mer Acquaintance, Charles Pinckney of the Old Congress will be 
elected : this would be very unfortunate. . . . 

Most of the great Land Speculators are Bankrupt. Mess. 
Nicholson, Greenleaf, Judge Willson are said to be in Jail. Mr. 
Morris has been for some time confined to his own House for 
Fear of the common Jail. I hear he means to surrender himself 
shortly ; his notes have been for some time as low as five cents in 
the Pound. 

Mr. Smith & myself were alone at Mrs. Williams last 
session. . . . The Old Lady drinks less than she used to 

do. . .

bound to Philadelphia to take charge of a Diploma delivered to 
me for you by Sir John Sinclair, President of the Board of Agri-

I have just received from Mr. Strickland a letter for you ; but 
as he informs me that the letter is to accompany a small box, 
containing an assortment of seeds which is also to be sent to my 
care, but which has not yet been received, I shall detain this let-

214 RUFUS KING, [1797 

S. Williams to R. King. 

Hamburgh, 22d Aug., 1797. 

Sir : 

I have the pleasure to inform you that the Marquis de la 
Fayette and his companions will soon be at liberty. The French 
Government, or laws, denying them an entry into France, the Em- 
peror has been pleased to order that they shall be at liberty to 
proceed to Holland, or to embark at Hamburgh for the United 
States, provided proper measures be taken to pursue either rout 
within eight days after their arrival here. The Baron de Buol, 
the Imperial Minister, has been instructed to apply to Mr. Parish 
(as Consul) and make the necessary arrangements. He called 
and communicated to me his instructions. As Consul, I told him, 
I was not authorized to take any steps, but in a private capacity 
I was ready to do all that was required in case the Marquis were 
desirous to embark for the U. S. I soon met Mr. Childs and 
Mr. Joy. We agreed to provide the Marquis and his family with 
a passage and every necessary, if wanted — certain that we should 
have, at least, a compensation, in gratifying our feelings, by pro- 
curing them a speedy release. I waited on the minister the next 
day (yesterday) and informed him of the steps we were ready to 
take. 

A friend of the Marquis was at Vienna and had a conference 
with the Imperial Minister relative to this business. He is here 
and had seen Mr. Parish, and obtained a letter from him to the 
Baron de Buol, with an offer similar to ours. He and another 
friend went with me to the Baron's, who has communicated our 
arrangements to his Court, and who appears well disposed. Al- 
though the condition of their release is that they quit the terri- 
tory of the Empire eight days after their arrival in this city, the 
Minister observed that he did not doubt of their being indulged 
agreeably to their wishes, and that if the state of the Marquis' 
health would not admit of his proceeding immediately to Holland 
or America, he might reside at Altona. 

It appears to be the wish of his friends, that he go by the 
shortest rout to Holland ; they expect, perhaps, that he will have 
leave to enter France and recover his property. I hope so, for, 
entre nous, I would rather that he and his companions were there 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE, 21 5 

than in the U. S. Knowing that it will gratify his best Friend 
General Washington and our Countrymen in general, I shall 
render him every service in my power. 

Respectfully &c, &c, 

S. Williams.

R. King to Lord Grenville. 

Private. 

Gr. Cumberland Place, 28th Aug., 1797. 
My Lord : 

Having just received dispatches from Philadelphia, I take the 
liberty to send your Lordship several newspapers containing the 
Proceedings of the Congress relative to Thomas Blount, who was 
expelled from the Senate on the 8th of July by all the voices 
except one. 

It has given me great satisfaction to observe, and especially as 
it corresponds with the tenor of my reports to the American 
Government, that his Majesty's ministers so distinctly disap- 
proved the project contrived by Blount and his associates, the 
moment they were apprized of it. 

But I cannot avoid regretting that Mr. Liston suffered an oc- 
casion so favorable to the promotion of the good harmony be- 
tween the two countries to pass without turning it to profit by 
communicating to the American Government the existence of a 
scheme so full of mischief and so hazardous to our Peace. . . . 

With perfect consid'n., 

R. King.

R. King to Secretary of State. 

London, Aug. 28, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

Before I received your Letter of the 8th of July, communi- 
cating the intercepted letter of Mr. Blount, I had entertained 
suspicions and been on the watch, respecting certain characters 
who had appeared here from the Tennessee Country. In the 
ship John Henderson, which arrived here last spring from Phila- 
delphia, came Captain Chisholm and another person who called 
himself Doctor Hutter. The latter is a Dutchman who I am 
informed has lived several years in Knoxville. Hutter has said 
that his coming with Chisholm was accidental, that he came to 
England for the purpose of going from thence to the Continent, 
which, as he alledged, he has several times attempted to do, but 
not having the requisite Passports to leave this Country, has been 
stopped and turned back. Neither Hutter nor Chisholm have 
come near me ; and by the reports of a person in some measure in 
their confidence* I have been repeatedly informed that Chisholm 
since his arrival has received money from this Government, that he 
has sometimes spoken of having had an interview with Lord Gren- 
ville, and having plunged into the dissipation of this City, and 
spent his money, that he had been redeemed from the custody of the 
Bailiff by the Government 's paying his debts. This they refused do- 
ing except Chisholm would immediately leave the Country which he 
promised to do, but has not yet done. Hutter says that he lodged 
in the same house with Chisholm in Second Street Philadelphia, 
that Chisholm was often backwards and forwards between the 
houses of Blount and Liston, and that the latter was several times at 
the house in which they lodged : that they brought a letter of 
introduction from Liston to a Mrs. Thomas or Thomson who lives 
in Half?noon Street, and at whose House they lodged on their first 
arrival here ; that this woman is an old friend of Liston 's, having 
been abroad in his family for many years. 

Hutter is reserved and cautious, says little concerning his own 
affairs but sometimes has intimated to the person who at my desire 
has observed them, that Chisholm in his opinion had been sent 
here by Blount and that his mission was connected with a pro- 

* Italics in cipher. 



21 8 RUFUS KING, [1797 

ject to invade Florida, and perhaps to separate Tennessee and the 
Western Country from the American Union. I cannot, I think, be 
mistaken in the information that Chisholm has received money here y 
and at several times : the sums have been inconsiderable and such as 
his course of life soon dissipated. lie is said to have brought a let- 
ter of Credit from Mr. Bell of Philadelphia to a Mr. Wilson of 
London. This is a thread which you may follow : I shall be 
able to ascertain from Wilson whether this information is correct. 
By Mr. d'Asp, the Swedish Envoy here, and who was at Consta?iti- 
nople with Liston, I am ascertained that Mrs. Thomas, the person 
at whose house Hutter and Chisholm lodged, was really with Liston 
in Turkey. Chisholm is again arrested for his Debts, and is at 
this time in a Lock-up House in Chancery Lane. I do not des- 
pair of being able to obtain the possession of Chisholm' s papers, tho' 
the publication of Blount's Letter, as well as of those between 
you and Liston which have appeared in all the News Papers 
may put the parties on their guard. 

With perfect Respect and Esteem, &c, &c, 

Rufus King. 



Lord Grenville to R. King. 

Private. 

Dropmore, Aug. 30, 1797. 
My Dear Sir : 

I am much obliged to you for the communication of the 

American Papers you sent me. I am not sorry for the accident 

which has afforded the means of proving the principles and rules 

by which our conduct is guided in everything that affects the 

Peace and tranquillity of the U. S. : but I hardly think that Mr. 

Liston would have been at liberty to communicate to the Govt. 

of the U. S. a proposal of this nature, the communication of 

which might have involved the proposers in much personal risk, 

while the plan itself could be productive of no inconvenience to 

your Government, — since it could never be acted upon but by 

the cooperation of the King's Ministers — a cooperation which 

Mr. Liston had no reason to presume could be given, and which 

was accordingly refused in the most distinct & pointed manner, 

on the first intimation we received of the business. 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 219 



I own I think that Mr. Liston (tho' acting for the best un- 
questionably & with great means of judging of the line which he 
was to pursue) has nevertheless gone at least to the utmost extent 
of what his situation allowed, if not somewhat beyond it, when 
he answered the letter of Col. Pickering by an avowal which may 
prejudice individuals supposed to be implicated in it. I have 
however no reason to regret in the present instance that the sub- 
ject did not strike him in the light in which it might perhaps have 
struck me in the same situation, as the consequence has only 
been to evince still more clearly the correctness of our principles 
and conduct. 

Ever, my dear Sir, 
Most faithfully & sincerely your obt. Hum. Servt, 

Grenville. 

It would appear that the merchants in London interested 
in American commerce asked Mr. King to accept a dinner 
as an evidence of their gratitude for the efficient efforts he 
had made to facilitate their trade and protect them from 
the depredations consequent upon the persistent interference 
by French enactments and cruisers. The answer below is 
characteristic of the Minister. 



R. King to H. M. Bird. 

Great Cumberland Place, Sep. 1, 1797- 
Dear Sir : 

I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 31st ult. We 
still remain in Town, and are uncertain when we shall be able to 
pursue our projected excursion. Concerning the intentions of 
the American Merchants, which you have been so obliging as to 
communicate to me, I entreat you to believe and to assure 
these Gentlemen, sensible as I am of the honor of their good 
opinion, that it will be far more agreeable to me that their pur- 
pose should be postponed, than that it should be carried into 
execution. As I do not entertain the smallest Doubt of their 
good wishes and friendly sentiments towards my Country, I can- 
not on that score desire the Proof thereof which they have 



220 RUFUS KING. [1797 

proposed to give ; and so far as I have any personal wishes, they 
will be best gratified by availing myself with the least possible 
eclat of every occasion that shall occur to render to you and 
them any service that my situation shall permit. 

With great consideration and Esteem, &c, 

Rufus King. 



R. King to Secretary of State. 

London, Sept. 1. 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

I am much obliged to you for the regular and satisfactory in- 
formation that your correspondence has afforded me. Nothing 
could be more unpleasant, and I may add more disadvantageous, 
in my situation than to be without authentic information concern- 
ing what is passing in our own Country ; and it is with very sin- 
cere pleasure that I acknowledge the attention, which, amidst 
other engagements, you have found time to bestow upon the 
Correspondence with this Legation. There is an authenticity in 
your letters that you must not expect to find in those of our 
Foreign Ministers. You possess all the means of giving a correct 
Report of the situation in our domestic affairs ; while we on the 
contrary, are often obliged to form an opinion upon contradic- 
tory evidence. From this consideration I have indulged myself 
less in troubling you with Speculations relative to affairs in 
which we have a common interest than I should have done, had 
I either possessed more complete information concerning them, 
or more adequate means of procuring it. I do not, however, 
recollect that I have ever expressed to you an opinion that a 
general Peace was likely to be the Result either of the Prelimi- 
naries with Austria or of the Negotiations at Lisle : indeed my 
uniform opinion has been, as it now is, that the Peace of Europe 
was still far, very far distant. Was Peace concluded tomorrow 
upon the Terms on which alone it could be, with the Temper and 
Principles which prevail and under the present circumstances of 
the Parties, it would not be durable. I therefore do exceedingly 
regret to observe that Congress have been in any degree influ- 
enced by an opinion that the Peace of Europe was about to be 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 221 

restored, and that consequently they might dispense with those 
wise and, in my judgment indispensable precautions which the 
President recommended for their adoption. 

Nothing can be more erroneous in the Politicks of a Nation 
than to omit on any consideration, much less on the score of a 
mistaken and dangerous economy, those Preparations for self 
defence and national safety, which, even in days of profound 
Peace, ought not to be neglected, and of which, in this mighty 
crisis of human affairs, he must be blind who does not see the 
absolute necessity. It is a false, and will prove a fatal, security, 
if we allow ourselves to be persuaded that we are either too just, 
too remote, too wise, or too powerful to be drawn into the present 
war, which continues to exhaust and threatens to change the 
face of Europe, and the results of which, in reference to the 
whole world, were never more uncertain or beyond the reach of 
human foresight, than at the present moment. 

In Italy, the negotiations still continue, while the Emperor with 
great activity is reinforcing his armies and completing the Feudal 
organization of his Subjects in Hungary. The preliminaries with 
Austria stipulated among other things the restoration of Mantua 
and the assembling of a Congress of all the Powers affected by the 
war for the purpose of concluding a definitive and general Peace : 
the Performance of these Stipulations France desires to avoid, the 
Emperor insists, and there seems to be no small Probability of the 
recommencement of war between them. At Lisle the Prospect is 
still more unpromising, and it may with confidence be concluded, 
unless a temper more pacific on the part of France shall prevail, 
that the negotiation will entirely fail and that the war will be pur- 
sued with encreased Vehemence and Energy. 

England will probably consent to restore to France all her Con- 
quests ; to Holland, all but Ceylon and the Cape, perhaps the for- 
mer of these places also ; and it is not likely that she would hesitate 
to restore Trinidad to Spain. In respect to Belgium, she would 
not insist on what the Emperor has consented to relinquish for 
Equivalents ; but this is not enough. France, by her Canada 
project, delivered at Lisle, is understood to have required for her- 
self a restoration of all the places that England had taken from 
her, a return of the Ships carried away from Toulon and payment 
for those which were there destroyed, an alteration in the English 



222 RUFUS KING. [1797 

Navigation Act and a renunciation of the Use of the Title of King 
of France. 

For Spain, a Restoration of the Places conquered, together with 
Gibraltar, and for Holland, a Restoration of all the Places con- 
quered, the return of the Ships of War, and Compensation for the 
Ships and Merchandize stopped and brought into the English 
Ports, before the declaration of war between England and Holland. 
To these England will not agree. 

Portugal has been counted among the Enemies of France ; but 
if the late Treaty shall be ratified, she will probably be treated as 
the enemy of England. It is said with considerable confidence 
that d'Aranjo, the Portuguese Minister had no power to conclude 
a treaty ; and England hopes to defeat it, by preventing its confir- 
mation. The same thing was said concerning the Treaty with 
Spain, concluded by d'Yriarte at Basle, on which occasion the 
Prince of Peace, even after the date of the Signature of the Treaty 
told Lord Bute not only that d'Yriarte had no power to conclude 
a Treaty, but that Spain, with her accustomed Fidelity, would 
adhere to England in the prosecution of the War. The fact is 
said to have been, that both the Queen and the Prince of Peace 
were ignorant that a certain influence had prevailed on the King 
to give a private instruction and authority to d'Yriarte, in conse- 
quence of which the Treaty was concluded and afterwards ratified. 
Whatever the fact may be respecting the power of d'Aranjo, there 
is not much doubt respecting the ratification of this Treaty. The 
articles are not yet public, but they are supposed to be favorable 
to France and repugnant to the Treaties with England, and among 
other Stipulations it is believed that Portugal has consented to the 
Cession of a portion of her possessions in America ; but to what 
extent, I am not informed. If Spain should take the alarm, which 
she reasonably may do, from the neighborhood of the French to 
her Colonies, it is possible that she will, to a certain extent, coun- 
tenance Portugal in refusing her Ratification ; but the predomi- 
nant influence of France destroys in a great measure the proba- 
bility of an efficient interference from this Quarter. 

Besides Portugal is a minor, and against France and Spain, a 
defenceless Power, and in common with almost every Nation in 
Europe, is deeply embarrassed in her pecuniary affairs : indeed 
there seems to be everywhere those symptoms of Derangement, 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 223 

which may be expected to precede a general Bankruptcy of 
Europe. At Rome, at Genoa and at Venice, private as well as 
public Credit is annihilated ; in Spain, as on former occasions, 
the Government has been obliged to have recourse to the fraudu- 
lent and ruinous System of Paper Money which has likewise been 
lately adopted by Portugal, and failed in the attempt to obtain a 
Loan of half a Million Sterling in London, tho' she offered to 
pledge Diamonds to the full amount and to mortgage in addition 
the Revenue of the Tobacco Farm. In Holland, and in Germany 
there is no public and a very limited private Credit, and all Parties 
agree in the Confusion and insufficiency of the French Finances. 
With the exception perhaps of this Country, whose fate is beyond 
my view, but on whose security we ought not to depend, there is 
no where that safety for Property and that security for Individuals 
that our Country at present affords. 

To preserve these Blessings will demand all our efforts and we 
must be prepared to meet and to resist the Storm which lays waste 
the old world and threatens to extend to the New. 

With perfect Respect & Esteem, &c, &c. 

Rufus King. 

R. King to Secretary of State. 

London, 5 Sept., 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

Mr. Williams, our Consul at Hamburgh, informs me that the 
Imperial Minister has notified to him that the Emperor had con- 
sented to the release of General La Fayette upon condition that 
he should embark for America within eight days after his arrival 
at Hamburgh ; he also requested Mr. Williams to make the neces- 
sary preparations for this embarkation. Mr. Williams answered 
that he had no instructions to take any measures on this Subject, 
but that he had no hesitation to engage (and he accordingly did 
so in concert with one or two other Americans) to make the ad- 
vances which may be required to provide a ship and other accom- 
modations for the passage of General La Fayette and his family 
to America. Conceiving that it would be more agreeable both to 
the President and to the General that the Supplies which may be 
necessary on this occasion should be furnished by the public 
instead of Individuals, I wrote to Mr. Williams a letter recom- 



224 RUFUS KING. [1797 

mending to him to make such advances to General La Fayette as 
his occasions might require, and to draw upon me for their reim- 
bursement. This arrangement corresponds with one that I had 
before made with Mr. Cadignan, one of the General's aids, who 
went a few days past to Hamburgh in expectation of meeting him 
at that place. I do not consider it certain that General La Fay- 
ette will go to Hamburg or embark immediately for America, 
having understood that he will be allowed by the Emperor to go 
to Holland where (if permitted by the Dutch Government) he may 
perhaps be inclined to wait some time in order to ascertain whether 
he will be allowed to return to France. 

. . . Paris is not a Commercial Station, or a place at which 
commercial questions can ordinarily arise, but where they may 
nevertheless exist by reference from the Sea Ports : yet we have 
always had a Consul General at Paris, who has had a superinten- 
dance over our Consuls in that Nation, and at present the office 
is particularly important to us. London is the centre of our ex- 
tensive commercial operations with this Country, and it is likewise 
essentially connected in our commercial intercourse with the 
South, as well as with the North of Europe. Still we never have 
had a Consul General at London. The duties have been exercised 
by me since my residence here ; but I do assure you that the per- 
petual details, in which I am thereby engaged, consume much of 
my time and attention which perhaps might be more advanta- 
geously employed. Most of our Consuls in this Country are British 
Subjects : they are certainly worthy characters ; but I have, I 
confess, a decided preference of the employment of our own 
people, where they can be induced to serve ; and in respect to the 
office of Consul General, a consul for London, I think you will 
agree with me, that he should be an American Citizen. I take 
the liberty of making this latter observation from a knowledge 
that several Foreigners are desirous of obtaining this appointment. 

. . . The Paris accounts exhibit no proofs of reconciliation 
between the Directory and the Consuls ; the breach now appears 
greater than it has been ; both sides are courting the Armies, who, 
having at present no foreign enemy to employ them, are engaged 
in considering the internal affairs of the country. This is a state 
of things that will not surprize you and is moreover one that must 
be productive of further and still more important Events in

Europe. The Armies may take different sides, and after a bloody- 
civil war, the Conqueror may establish such a government as will 
best maintain his authority. 

There is great suspicion concerning the views of Buonaparte ; 
the deference with which he is treated by the Directory is com- 
monly ascribed to his supposed Devotion to their views ; while 
others think he is too powerful to be treated in the customary 
stile, and that both England and Austria would aid him, if requi- 
site, in the consolidation of the Italian States under one Govern- 
ment to be hereditary in his family. . . . 

The Malcontents of Ireland have been overawed, and that 
country is at present quiet ; but Scotland is at this moment in a 
state of great fermentation, in consequence of a late determination 
of the Government to embody 6000 militia in that Country. The 
People in several counties have resisted the execution of this meas- 
ure and blood has already been shed in the Controversy : the 
Consequence will be that large Bodies of troops will be sent to 
Scotland, and the Peasantry will be forced to submit.

Dear Sir : London, Sept. 5, 1797- 

I have had the honor to receive your Letter of the 15th of June ; 
and having a few minutes before the Mail for New York is dis- 
patched, I employ them in sending you inclosed the copy of a 
Letter that I received a few days past from our Consul at Ham- 
burgh, which announces the approaching release of General La 
Fayette.* 

* The event recorded above is the release of La Fayette from the cruel im- 
prisonment in the dungeon at Olmutz, to which he had been consigned by the 
Austrian Government for four years. He had been in 17S9, a member of the 
Assembly of France and Commander-in-chief of the National Guard, and, dis- 
trustful of the policy of the Jacobins, had sought to screen the King from their 
attempts to coerce him. Having been promoted to the chief command of a 
portion of the Army on the Prussian frontier, upon the declaration of the war 
with Austria, he still watched over the welfare of the King and wrote to the 
Assembly a letter denouncing the acts of the Jacobins, and even went to Paris 
to endeavor to defend himself in the course he had taken. He found that he 

was too late to counteract their designs, returned to the army, and after the im- 
vol n. — 15

Sir :

prisonment of the King, finding himself suspected, his command taken from 
him, and his impeachment ordered, he fled into Belgium, where he was captured, 
confined by the Prussians, who offered him freedom on the condition, which he 
refused, that he would fight against his country. He was then handed over to 
Austria, which sent him to the dungeon at Olmutz. From this he was at one 
time set free by the enterprise and boldness of a young German, Dr. Bollman 
and Mr. F. K. Huger of S. Carolina, but being recaptured was again placed in 
prison, where his wife and daughter were permitted to join him in 1795. At 
this time G. Washington La Fayette, with his tutor, Mr. Trestel, left France, 
with the privity of some of the Committee of Safety, and arrived at New York, 
where he was received by Genl. Hamilton, who informed Washington of their 
arrival and advised, on Washington's suggestion, that the latter should at first 
communicate with them only by letter. This was done, but after some months 
they were received by Washington in person, and urged him to suggest some 
method by which La Fayette might be released from captivity. His opinion 
was that the return of peace alone would cause him to be set free, but intimated 
to them that perhaps a private letter addressed to the Emperor of Austria from 
him, communicating his own hope and that of the people of America, to be 
sent through Mr. Pinckney, the Minister of London, after consultation with the 
other diplomats there, might bring about the liberation, on condition of his 
coming to America. The letter was written and sent.* What effect it had in 
mitigating the severity of his imprisonment is not known. But what other 
means, the sympathy in England and the United States, had failed to do, was 
finally brought about by the victorious march of Bonaparte, on the 23d of Sep- 
tember, 1797. The young men were still in America, when Mr. King's letter 
reached there, and though against the advice of Washington, they returned 
immediately to Europe to join the General on his liberation from captivity.

1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE, 227 

R. King to A. Hamilton.* 

London, September 9, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

We hear this day accounts from Paris, which, though very 
important and interesting, are not unexpected. The breach 
between the Councils and the Directory has for some time de- 
stroyed all prospect of a reconciliation between them, and either 
an organized civil war, in consequence of the different sides 
adopted by the several armies, or a measure like that which has 
happened, had become inevitable. The march of a considerable 
division of the army into the interior, the removals of generals in 
whom they did not confide, the various messages in the style of 
manifestoes addressed to the Councils, and the sending for Gen- 
eral Jourdan who commanded the Army of the Rhine, to Paris, 
and putting his army in the interim of his absence under Hoche, 
are now explained. 

Augereau, who had been called from Italy for the purpose, 
upon the alarm-cannon being fired on the morning of the 4th in- 
stant, marched his troops, and surrounded, without opposition, 
the place of sitting of the Council of 500. He then proceeded 
to arrest Pichegru, and a considerable number of the most in- 
fluential members of that Council, on the charge of a royalist 
conspiracy ; having for its object the massacre of three of the 
Directory, to make way for successors who would place Louis 
XVIII on the throne of France. Carnot, say the same advices, 
has fled and Barthelemi, say others, is also arrested. I do not 
give you this account as authentic, though I have little doubt it 
is so, as far, at least, as it states an attack of the Directory upon 
the Council of 500. 

If the consequence of this proceeding was confined to France 
it would be less the subject of regret, though all must deplore the 
sanguinary scenes so frequently there exhibited ; but, in reference 
to the pending negotiations and the return of peace, this transac- 
tion is very important. The two Councils, who, in this respect, 
are supposed to here faithfully represent their constituents, de- 
sired peace with sincerity ; the Directory most certainly differed 
from them in their inclinations on this subject. If the Directory 

* Works of Hamilton, vi., 265. 



228 KUFUS ICING. [1797 

overwhelm the Councils, the war must, and will, continue. But 
how will the armies — how will the nations conduct on this occa- 
sion ? I fear there is little consolation to the friends of humanity 
from the doubt, which for a moment exists on these points — the 
nations are nothing, the armies are most probably secured, and 
the Directory will triumph. Adieu. 

Yours, &c, 

P. S. If I do not forget names, a majority of the Committee 
to whom Pastoret's speech on our affairs was referred, are among 
the members now arrested. You will readily see how mischiev- 
ous to us this success of the Directory may and probably will be. 



John Lawrance to R. King. 

Newport, Sept. 19, 1797. 
My Dear Sir : 

. . . We are waiting with much anxiety to hear the result of 
the Negotiation at Lisle. Much (probably) depends on it as to 
us. We are sincere in our wishes for Peace, and in our endeavors 
to preserve it. A nation, so much disposed to amity, ought not 
to have their tranquillity disturbed. Ours has been too much so, 
but still not so much as it may be ; should an Event, so unfortu- 
nate, take place, I hope we shall exhibit a conduct which will not 
disgrace us. ... 

Yr, affectionate humble Servt., 

John Lawrance.

Hambro', 19 Sept., 1797. 
Sir: 

I have delayed to write to you since my arrival here in hopes 
that I should have soon some good news of our friend to relate 
to you. This day is at last come. Mr. William has acquainted 
your excelency of the last business between the minister of the 
emperor and Mr. Parish here ; since that we have been without 
news ; but yesterday M. Le B. ron de Buol, minister of the em- 
peror here, wrote a note to Mr. Masson to let him know that he 
had just received the official note from his Cabinet that the order 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 220, 

had been sent from Vienna to Olmutz to liberate the prisoner 
directly ; so we expect them here now every moment and will 
have the honour to inform your excelency of their arrival and 
mention then the offer you have made to me for our friend Laf. 
who certainly will be very grateful of the interest you have always 
shown for his unfortunate fate. 

Mr. William will certainly write to you by this post, so I have 
nothing more to tell. Pray present my respects to Mrs. King. I 
remain 

Of your Excelency Most obedient Servant, 

C. Cadignan.

Hamburgh, 3 Oct., 1797. 
Sir: 

I shall have the happiness of receiving General Lefayette to 
morrow. He will arrive tonight with his family and companions 
at Harburg on the opposite bank of the Elbe, and on passing it 
tomorrow he will be saluted by an American ship — which with 
the others in the Port, will show him every mark of attention by 
displaying their colours, &c. We shall endeavour to do every- 
thing that will be agreeable to him and to every American. 

They are all, excepting Madame La Fayette and one of her 
Daughters, in pretty good health. If the state of theirs do not 
prevent, the General and family may embark in Mr. Joy's ship 
for Philadelphia. 

With perfect consideration, &c, 

S. Williams. 

S. Williams to R. King. 

Hamburg, 5 Oct., 1797. 
Sir: 

General Lefayette, his Lady and two Daughters, his two com- 
panions, and their families arrived here yesterday. Mr. Joy sent 
the ship John's barge for them in the morning — on their way 
they stopped to partake of a collation on the ship, and then met 
Mr. Cadignan and other friends, then landed and proceeded to 
my house. 



23O RUFUS KING. [1797 

I find their health to be as I have mentioned. The General 
retains all his affection and respect for the United States. The 
season is now so far advanced, that it is not probable they will 
embark for America this fall. They all go tomorrow to lodgings 
about ten miles from the city, where they may pass the winter 
without molestation. It appears that the Emperor will not med- 
dle with them again. . . . 

With perfect respect, &c,

C. Cadignan to R. King. 

Hambro, 13 Octob'r. 1797. 
Sir: 

Mr. Williams having informed you of the arrival here of M. 
Lafayette with his family, I shall only mention to your Excel- 
lency that he has accepted with gratitude the offer you charge 
me to make to him, which Mr. Williams has confirmed, and that 
he has to write to you about it. He has set off for the Holstein 
where he expects to stay till the weather permits him to embark 
for America, Mrs. Lafayette being very much indisposed. I did 
expect to have a letter tonight for you, but the danish post 
arrives only tomorrow ; so very likely I shall be able to forward 
it to you next post. 

Now, Sir, I must trouble you again for me. I am going to set 
off from here for england to meet again my little family and my 
business, in few days by a neutral vessel for gravesend, from 
what place I embarked in august last ; would you be so good to 
send a note to his grace Duke of portland to desire him to send 
an order to gravesend to let me get in as soon as I arrive there, 
as you had the goodness to do last april when I was at yarmouth. 
I am with respect your Excelency your most obedient 

C. Cadignan. 
Citizen of America. 

P.S. . . . They assure here the american plenipotentiaries 
arrived in france ; I hope they will be able to succeed notwith- 
standing the encore new revolution in that country. All the ger- 
man papers of to-day say that the hostilities were to begin again 
in Italy the 8 of this month, and Buonoparte is reported very ill 
by the paris papers of the 4th.

Lafayette to R. King. 
Wiltmold near Ploen in Holstein, October the 13th, 1797. 

His Excellency Mr. King, Esq. Plenipotentiary Minister 

from the United States at the Court of London. 
My Dear Sir : 

While I am happy in this Opportunity to offer you my affec- 
tionate thanks for the kind and friendly interest which you have 
been pleased to take in my behalf, I am sure your good heart 
will enjoy the account I am now able to give you that my family, 
my two friends and myself are totally out of the Coalitionary 
fangs. You know what have been for five years the applications 
from the American Government, the exertions of American Rep- 
resentatives abroad, and who, more than you, my dear Sir, has 
a right to say, et quorum pars magna fui? For those obligations 
my heart shall ever be bound by the ties of the most lively Grati- 
tude. You also have been acquainted with the measures taken 
by the French Commonwealth and her Plenipotentiaries from the 
Beginning of this long Negotiation with the Court of Vienna, and 
with the final Arrangement which has been agreed upon between 
the Baron de Thugue and my Aid de Camp Romeuf, whom Bona- 
parte and Clarke had sent to Vienna to put an end to the chicanes 
which for five months had deferred our being set at Liberty. In 
consequence of this we left Olmutz on the 19th of September 
and have been at Hamburgh put into American Hands, which I 
rejoice to see taking a part in this late Business, as they have 
taken so kind, early and constant part in everything that relates 
to my Captivity, the means to alleviate it and the applications to 
put an end to the long and unhealthy Confinement. It is impos- 
sible in the deplorable state of my Wife's Health even to think of 
a winter passage. We are going to pass this season in a retired 
place about sixty English miles from Hamburgh. The Healths 
of us all are in great need of repair : that of my Wife is by far 
the most injured. I need not tell you, my dear Sir, that my 
Restoration to Liberty has been much embittered by the unhappy 
news of the differences which have troubled the good Harmony 
so naturally subsisting between the American and French Re- 
publics. What I feel on the occasion it is superfluous to say — 
what I wish is obvious. But how the purpose can be effected is 



232 RUFUS KING. [1797 

the question in which my Head and my Heart are wholly, and 
at every minute busying themselves, not on account of the diffi- 
culties, it is more difficult indeed to set up a quarrel between the 
two Nations than to mend it, but on account of many circum- 
stances, which altho' they are merely personal or foreign to the 
American contest, cannot fail greatly to influence the Negocia- 
tion. Are those Commissioners arrived in Paris ? I think I shall 
by and bye, notwithstanding the late despotic measures, hear 
from france, but I also entreat you, as far as you think it con- 
venient, to let me know your opinion and expectations with 
respect to this unfortunate and afflicting affair. Cadignan has 
told me what you have been pleased in the name ot the United 
States to offer to lend to us should we want these pecuniary ad- 
vances. 1 the more gratefully accept them as the difficulties for 
Mdme. Lafayette to get money from france are still great, and as 
I have bound myself immediately to pay a sum of two hundred 
and fifty guineas, the secret use of it has a relation to our prison 
Business, which Cadignan will verbally explain. To him give 
me leave to refer it, as he intends soon to have the honour to 
wait on you, and contenting myself here to present you with my 
grateful and affectionate thanks, I shall only add, that with an 
eternal Remembrance of your kind interest in my Behalf, of 
which you see I take the liberty, occasionally to make use as 
frankly as it has been bestowed on me, and with the sentiments 
of the highest Regard, warm gratitude and affectionate friend- 
ship, I have the honour to be, my dear Sir, 

Your obliged Servant, 

Lafayette. 



CHAPTER XVIII. 

Embassy of Messrs. Pinckney, Marshall, and Gerry to France — Blount's Con- 
spiracy — Dr. Romaine's connection with it — Portuguese Treaty with 
France — Cession of Louisiana by Spain demanded by France — French 
Duplicity towards America — R. King believes the People of England will 
continue to Support the Government — Especially since the Failure of the 
Negotiation at Lisle — Communication to Lord Grenville relative to the 
Trade to British Territories in India — French Orders against American 
Commerce in the West Indies. 

It is not proposed to enter into the details connected with 
the embassy of Messrs. Pinckney, Marshall, and Gerry to 
France ; but it may be well to state the fact, illustrated by 
the following correspondence, which extends over many 
pages, that it was an endeavor, on the part of the United 
States, to settle the troubles with France which had now 
reached a point which involved an entire cessation of friendly 
intercourse. Mr. Adams, the President, contrary to the 
advice of his political supporters, decided to try an experi- 
ment, which he deemed wise, of sending three commission- 
ers to Paris, and through their efforts to bring about a 
solution of the questions pending between the two countries. 
As it is well known the mission failed in its objects, and M. 
Talleyrand, after a formal reception of the American Com- 
missioners, endeavored to bring about by corrupt means a 
settlement which he was unwilling to make by an open and 
honest discussion of the questions at issue. The basis of this 
plan was that the United States should apologize for all the 
matters complained of by the French, including the treat- 
ment of the French Vessels of war and privateers during the 
residence of Genet and afterwards, and especially the alleged 

233 



234 RUFUS KING. [1797 

grievances consequent upon the treaty with Great Britain ; 
should also make a loan to France, either immediate or 
prospective, and give a considerable sum in cash to be dis- 
posed of by M. Talleyrand for his own and the Directory's 
use. The correspondence shows the manner in which these 
propositions were received and indignantly rejected by the 
American Ministers, and the universal outcry in America 
against France, when the President, upon the call of Con- 
gress, laid before them the papers relative to the failure of 
the mission. 

In a letter of Mr. King to the Secretary of State, Decem- 
ber 23, 1797, will be found a statement made by the 
Directory, through M. Talleyrand, for a proposed peace 
with England, which will be found interesting in this con- 
nection. 

R. King to Genl. Pinckney. 

London, Oct. 17, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . I do not even yet permit myself to despair of the suc- 
cess of your mission, tho' anxious as I feel on that subject, it 
would be a very high gratification to learn from any circumstance 
that has occurred since your arrival at Paris that your hopes are 
somewhat increased. . . . 

The NewsPapers contain a correspondence between the Secy 
of State and Mr. Monroe, on the refusal of the Demands of the 
latter that the Reasons wh. induced his Recall should be assigned 
for the Purpose of a public Discussion. 

Tho' in some small particulars I am not partial to Mr. G. [erry] 
still I am thoroughly convinced of his Integrity, Patriotism and 
Honor : entire confidence in which serves to extenuate those sub- 
ordinate Defects to bear with and to get over which require only 
patience and a little management. I however know nothing con- 
cerning him for the last four years, which have wrought great 
changes in America as well as elsewhere. I speak of him as of 
former times. You will be satisfied with Genl. Marshall j his

character stands well on all points. Personally I know little of 
him, but his head is one of the best organized of any one that I 
have known. This I say from general Reputation, and more 
satisfactorily from an Argument that I heard him deliver before 
the fedl. Court at Philadelphia. . . . 

Yr. faithful Servt., 

Rufus King. 

R. King to Secretary of State. 

London 17, October, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

The violation of the constitution in the triumph of the three 
Directors over their Colleagues and the Majority of the two 
Councils, was an event neither surprising nor unexpected. The 
termination of the negotiation at Lisle was a natural consequence 
of this revolution ; and it is quite probable that the conferences 
at Udina have likewise been broken off, on which event, advanced 
as the season is, the Armies of France will be put in March for 
Vienna. 

Mess. Marshall and Gerry have both arrived in Holland about 
the middle of September, on the last of which month, in company 
with General Pinckney, they reached Paris, and according to the 
French papers (for I have received no letter from them since 
they arrived at Paris) they have had an interview with the Minis- 
ter of Foreign Affairs. I make no conjecture concerning the 
result of this mission ; you know what have been the sentiments 
and conduct of the Directory, and you also understand what were 
the opinions as well as what probably would have been the De- 
cisions of those in the two Councils, who have been driven from 
their offices ; the Legislature is now completely subservient to the 
Directory. 

The total Defeat, accompanied with the capture of the greater 
part of the Dutch Fleet by the English Squadron under Admiral 
Duncan on the Eleventh of this month, may have some influence 
in lowering the tone of the Directory ; but whether that or any 
other consideration will induce them to consent to arrangements 
with us, without which an open rupture appears inevitable, re- 
mains to be seen. I wish that I could discover any circumstance 



236 RUFUS KING. [l797 

that would allow me to expect with some degree of Confidence 
that we shall be able to avoid a War. 

. . . General La Fayette has been released and with his 
family are at Hamburgh, where according to a letter I have from 
Mr. Williams, they will probably remain till the Spring. It is 
more than probable that I may be called on for money from this 
quarter, I shall not hesitate to supply it, within certain limits, in 
the belief that my doing so will under all circumstances receive 
the President's approbation. . . . 

With perfect Consideration & Respect &c. 

Rufus King. 

R. King to Secretary of State, No. 51. 

London, 31st Oct., 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

In my number 45., I gave you some reason to expect that I 

might be able to obtain the possession of Chisholm's Papers. I 

believe that he is still here and in confinement ; but I have not 

succeeded in obtaining his Papers. Doctor Romaine was in this 

Country at the time of my arrival here ; I saw him several times, 

but knew nothing concerning his business, except that it was said 

he was an agent for the Sale of New Lands. Since receiving 

the information that he was supposed to be connected with 

Blount, I have endeavoured to trace his connections while last 

in England. From a person who in some measure possessed 

Romaine's Confidence, I am assured that he was introduced by 

the Count de Moustier (formerly the French Minister with us 

and with whom I remember that Romaine was in great intimacy) 

to the Marquis Las Casas, then the Spanish Minister at this 

Court, with whom Romaine had frequent conferences on the 

subject of " certain Lands belonging to Spain in the Western part 

of America." Romaine proposed to engage Las Casas in his 

project which was represented as promising immense Profit to 

the Adventurers ; Las Casas was to support the Scheme at 

Madrid, and by his influence procure the King's sanction. De 

Yrujo who, as I am informed was privy to these conferences, 

and who was soon going to America, was to act as Las Casas' 

Agent in that Country. What was finally arranged or concluded, 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 237 

I have not been able to learn. Perhaps Blount's conspiracy may- 
be connected with, and a part of, the Plan discussed by Romaine 
and Las Casas ; and Romaine may have been the Agent of 
Blount and his Associates. 

It would be extraordinary (did any event in these times merit 
that character) should there exist a connection between Blount's 
conspiracy, against which De Yrujo so rudely complained and 
the project between Romaine and Las Casas, the execution of 
which is said to have been confided to the Chevalier ! 

Romaine has been in correspondence with several People in 
this Country since his return ; but the notoriety of his implica- 
tion in the conspiracy of Blount, makes it difficult to discover 
the object of his correspondence. Chisholm could not be the 
man of consequence, whom Blount was to have sent to England. 
In a letter from Romaine to one of his Correspondents in London 
dated April 4, 1797, he says "There have some circumstances 
turned up, which I am fearful will make it necessary for me to 
visit England in May. I shall endeavour to avoid going but it 
is highly probable I shall be obliged to embark in one of the 
first vessels after the middle of May." And in a subsequent let- 
ter to the same person, of the 30th of April, he says " I informed 
you in my last that it was not improbable but you would soon 
see me in England ; I have not yet made up my mind but it may 
be that I may have to leave this in a fortnight." 

With perfect Respect, &c, 

Rufus King. 



R. King to Secretary of State, No. 52. 

Wholly in cipher. 

London, Nov. 9, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

The last letters from the British Minister in Portugal state, 
that de Pinto the Portuguese Minister has received a dispatch 
from their Envoy at Madrid, saying that his last conference with 
the Prince of Peace " (more diffuse and conducted with less re- 
serve than usual) had been concluded by the Declaration of the 
Prince, that after mature consideration the Court of Madrid ad- 



238 RUFUS KING. [1797 

vised that of Portugal to ratify without further delay the Treaty 
lately concluded with France." To prove the sincerity of this 
advice, the Prince adverted to the critical Situation in which the 
Government of Spain found itself. He said that the little in- 
fluence that they once had at Paris was lately, and especially 
since the 18th Fructidor, diminished ; that Del Campo was rarely 
permitted to speak to any of the Directors, and upon a representa- 
tion respecting the order for the Transportation to Spain of the 
Remnant of the Bourbons, in which he took occasion to say that 
their presence would be disagreeable to the Court of Spain, he 
was contemptuously answered that this would not be thought 
an objection to the measure. 

After mentioning the difficulty of the present situation, and 
the more unpleasant prospect of the future, the Prince added that 
Spain would not be able to oppose any effectual resistance to 
the measures that France will pursue on the refusal of Portugal 
to ratify the Treaty ; for although by different means she has 
hitherto avoided the Decision, the Directory have recently re- 
ceived their Demand for the Cession of Louisiana to France, 
" which," continued the Prince, "the Court of Spain no longer 
finds itself in a condition to refuse." 

I received this information yesterday from Lord Grenville, of 
whom I sometime since requested such intelligence as he should 
receive on this subject. 

With perfect Respect & Esteem &c, 

Rufus King.

London, Nov. 7, 1797. 
Dear General : 

I have deferred the acknowledgment of your Letter in the daily 
expectation of receiving from our Envoys in Paris such informa- 
tion as would enable me to state to you the present, as well as the 
probable, situation of our Affairs with France ; and tho' I am 
without this information, and therefore unable to make you the 
communications I otherwise should have done, I can no longer 
delay offering you my sincere and hearty congratulations upon 
your delivery from Prison, and being again at liberty. You know 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 239 

America so well, that it seems superfluous to say that this Event 
will inspire our Countrymen with the most lively joy, and I can- 
not be mistaken in assuring you, that your Reception there, as 
well as that of Madame LaFayette and your Daughters, whose 
virtues and Sufferings have equally excited our admiration and 
sympathy, will equal in affection and Respect your utmost wishes. 
I have much anxiety respecting Madame LaFayette's health and 
earnestly hope that it may be restored and confirmed in season 
for your Embarkation early in the Spring ; for I will not conceal 
from you, that in the present uncertain State of Europe, I shall 
not consider you safe, until you shall have landed upon the 
American shores. I expressed to Cadignan my Readiness in 
behalf of our country to make such pecuniary arrangements as 
you should find requisite ; I need not therefore add anything 
more on this subject, except to assure you that I am persuaded 
that such arrangements will receive the approbation of our Gov- 
ernment, which has never ceased to feel an interest in whatever 
concerned you. I pray you, my dear General, to present my 
most respectful Homage to Mad. LaFayette, and to accept the 
Esteem and Respect of 

Your ob't. and faithful Servant, 

Rufus King. 



John Jay to R. King. 

Albany, Nov. 7, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

I was a few days ago fav'd with yours of the 16th Augt. last. 
The attention of this country continues I think too much fixed on 
the negotiations for Peace. Many are of opinion that our em- 
barrassments will cease with the war. It may be so, but my mind 
is not free from doubts on that head. The prudence of pre- 
paring for the worst, is manifested by the experience of ages ; and 
yet we very indiscreetly neglect it. I wish we had a well com- 
piled selection of Switzerland's state papers respecting their 
diplomatic discussions with belligerent powers during the present 
war ; and the measures they have taken for their own security. 

It is an agreeable circumstance that De LaCroix's successor 
expresses himself in friendly Terms about american affairs ; but 



240 RUFUS KING. [1797 

I shall be mistaken if he does not act as may best suit him — what 
that may be I cannot pretend to say, nor at this distance to con- 
jecture. France is doing us much injury, but good will ultimate- 
ly result from it. We shall be taught a useful lesson, tho' perhaps 
at no inconsiderable expence. . . . 

Yours sincerely 

John Jay. 

R. King to Secretary of State. No. 53, 

London, November 12, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . The Directory at the instance of Portugal are understood 
to have prolonged the Time for the Ratification of the Treaty 
with that Nation, but on the day after the definitive Treaty with 
Austria reached Paris, they annulled the Treaty with Portugal, 
assigning as a Justification that it had not been ratified within 
the Time first prescribed for that purpose. Portugal must there- 
fore expect to be attacked, unless Spain (of which according to 
the information in my No. 52 there is no probability) shall be 
able to avert the Blow. The French army that shall be sent 
against Portugal will accelerate, if it does not accomplish, the 
destined Revolution of Spain. 

The Congress that in a few days will meet at Rastadt, for the 
Pacification of Germany, will bring to light some of the secret 
articles, supposed to exist in the Treaties between Austria and 
France and between the latter and Prussia. . . . 

The Chiefs of the Opposition in this Country do not attend 
Parliament, which manifests much firmness in the present posi- 
tion of the Nation, and which, in my opinion, will receive the 
support of their Constituents in the prosecution of the war ; until 
their enemy shall discover a disposition to end it. The late Naval 
Victory and the Dismantling of the French men of war at Brest, 
have in a considerable degree quieted the apprehension of inva- 
sion, notwithstanding a late Arrete of the Directory to assemble 
an army on the Coast of the Ocean, to be commanded by 
Buonaparte, and called "the Army of England." 

I employed a few weeks of the Autumn in travelling through 
the interior, including some of the Manufacturing Towns of this 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 24 1 

Country ; and tho' my means of making a correct Judgment were 
in many respects imperfect, I endeavoured to form an Estimate 
of the Public Opinion on the Subject of the war, which for a 
long time past, I have thought, could not soon be concluded. 
The result of my observations, is that a general desire of Peace 
prevails throughout the Nation, but that an opinion exists which 
is nearly, if not quite, as general, that this Government has 
sought Peace with sincerity, and that France has not been willing 
to make it on terms consistent with the safety and independence 
of England : hence I infer that the Nation, but without zeal or 
Enthusiasm, for they shew neither, will support the Government 
in carrying on the War, and that they will give this support in the 
Belief, that without it the Nation must sink beneath the Blows of 
their Enemy. God grant that a less passive temper may be dis- 
played in our Country, should unhappily the pending negotiation 
fail to restore harmony between us and France. 

I send you herewith ... a long Essay, taken from the 
Redacteur of the 19th of October, concerning the causes of the 
misunderstanding between us and France. This is supposed to 
be the performance of Thomas Paine, who has lately published a 
Justification, as he calls it, of the revolution of the 18th Fructidor, 
since which epoch the Press has been put under the control of 
the Government ; a circumstance that gives some importance to 
this absurd disquisition respecting the misunderstanding between 
us and France. . . . 

With perfect Respect & Esteem &c. &c.

John Jay to R. King. 

Albany, 14 Nov., 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . A late arrival has brought intelligence of the Explosion 
at Paris. It opens a wide Field for Speculation and conjecture. 
It is difficult for a demoralized People to have any stable Gov- 
ernmt ; human laws can reach only a small portion of human 
actions. I am anxious to know how our Comrs. have been 
received. To me it does not appear certain that the new Revolu- 
tion will injure us ; but the cloud is too thick to be penetrated. 
It seems that France is to be purified by fire ; if so, she is not 
yet ready to leave the furnace. We hear that Ld. Malmesbury 
has returned to England ; and yet I should not be surprised, if 
something like a Peace should be patched up this winter between 
France and Austria. I suspect the Emperor's Resources to be 
exhausted so much that it will not be in his power to provide for 
the Expences of such a campaign next year, as would become his 
Dignity & Interest — but this is all Guess-work. . . . 

Yours sincerely, 

John Jay.

London, 15th, Nov., 1797. 
Gentlemen : 

. . . Though my expectations of a satisfactory issue of 
your Mission was materially weakened by the Revolution of the 
fourth of September, yet I must confess that I was not prepared 
for the accounts which Col. Trumbull has given me. I will not 
however allow myself yet to despair of your success, though my 
apprehensions are greater than my hopes. I annex the Copy of 
my No. 52 to the Secretary of State. ... It may be con- 
sidered as a communication of considerable importance in en- 
abling you to judge of the views of the French Government. The 
Envoy of Portugal confirmed to me to-day this information so 
far as regards the demand which, he said, had been made in the 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 243 

shape of a Note, and not, as heretofore, verbally. He knew 
nothing of the answer that was given by the Minister of Spain. 
I likewise send you the copy of a Letter that some months past 
I wrote to Mr. Talleyrand, to which I received no answer. . . . 
Slight circumstances sometimes assist us in the discovery of 
important decisions. . . . 

The failure of the Negotiation at Lisle has undoubtedly added 
strength to this Government. The two Houses of Parliament made 
a joint and unanimous address to the King, in reply to his Speech, 
pledging the wealth and Strength of the Nation, in language of 
uncommon solemnity and force, to support the Crown in the 
prosecution of the War against an Enemy, whose enmity, says 
the address, is directed against their Laws, Religion and Liberty. 

What another Revolution in France may effect ; nay to what 
the Corruption of those who are now in Power may lead them to 
agree, it is not easy to pronounce ; but here, there is every appear- 
ance of a firm and steady perseverance in the war. 

With perfect Respect & Esteem &c. 

Rufus King. 



R. King to Secretary of State. No. 54. 

London, Nov. 18, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

" Si tout se vend rien ne se garantit." The fate of the late 
Treaty between France and Portugal would confirm this Truth, was 
it doubtful. Portugal tvas also required to pay down a sum of 
mo7iey to be distributed as a preliminary to JVegoliation and she ad- 
vanced it. By a secret article of the Treaty she was bound to make 
a loan to France, a part of which was paid at the Signature of the 
Treaty and was the money that enabled the Directory to march the 
Army which effected the Revolution of the 18th Fructidor. You may 
depend on this information*

244 RUFUS KING. [i797 

R. King to Lord Grenville. 

Great Cumberland Place, Nov. 20, 1797. 

My Lord : 

Your Lordship may probably recollect that after the Ratifica- 
tion of the American Treaty, but before the Act of Parliament for 
carrying it into effect, I took the Liberty to mention to your Lord- 
ship the Circumstances of an Insurance Cause in one of his 
Majesty's Courts, in which the Plaintiff, an American Citizen, had 
been non-suited in consequence of an opinion of the Court, that 
the Trade to the British Territories in Asia could not be carried 
on by Foreigners. Since the Act of Parliament, a new trial of 
the cause has been ordered, and the suit is about to be decided 
by the construction that shall be given in Westminster Hall to the 
XIII. Article of the Treaty. 

This question is of importance not only in respect to the 
Property immediately depending upon its decision, but far more so 
as it affects those voyages and commercial adventures which have 
been commenced under the Security of this article of the Treaty ; 
according to which, in the opinion of the American Government, 
it is free for their citizens to import in American Ships into the 
British Territories in the East Indies, any goods or Merchandize 
that may be imported into the same by the East India Company, 
paying the same duties as are paid by that Company and this 
without being subject to inquiry or Disadvantage in respect to the 
Country of which such Goods or Merchandize are the produce or 
manufacture, or whether they come directly from America, or are 
shipped in Europe or elsewhere. 

Had there been any Doubt of this interpretation, it would have 
been removed by the discussion that grew out of the restrictive 
clauses which the East India Company were desirous should have 
been added to the Act of Parliament, establishing the Provisions 
of the American Treaty, and to the Act concerning the Trade to 
the East Indies by nations in Amity with Great Britain. But not- 
withstanding my persuasion that the Parties do not disagree in 
the interpretation of this article of the Treaty, I am not without 
apprehension that an erroneous Construction may be attempted, 
and perhaps successfully, in the course of this Trial. 

Hence I have thought it to be my Duty to place the Subject 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE, 245 



before your Lordship, and to request your influence in order that 
the Court of King's Bench, before whom this suit is depending, 
may be seasonably informed of the Construction given to this 
Article of the American Treaty by his Majesty's Government. . . . 
Your obedient & very humble servant &c. 

Rufus King. 



R. King to Messrs. Pinckney, Marshall, and Gerry. 

London, Nov. 24, 1797. 
Gentlemen : 

No one detests more than I do the Conduct of France towards our* 
Country still I earnestly desire that we may remain in Peace. War 
would retard our progress ; which with all the disadvantages to wh. 
we are exposed, brings daily additions of wealth and strength ; and 
to the ceconomical and moral motives which should influence Na- 
tions to cultivate Peace, we may add the Danger to be apprehended 
from the Division of our People. I make these observations in order 
that you may justly estimate such information as with a view to the 
Negotiation in your Hands, I may send you ; for with all our im- 
partiality, our Prejudices will sometimes colour not only what 
passes thro' our minds, but even the objects that fall beneath our 
senses. 

Portugal gave ??ioney as a Preliminary to the negotiation of the late 
Treaty with France, by a secret article of which she also stipulated 
a Loan, part of which was actually paid at the Signature of the 
Treaty. This money enabled the Directory to march the army who 
effected the Revolution of the 18th. Fructidor. Spain is alarmed and 
Portugal trembles. England cannot furnish troops, without which 
Portugal must fall. The Court of Vienna have at this moment little 
confidence in the solidity of their Peace. This is no Task, and the 
war may again burst out. The Directory are not at Ease on this 
Point. Efigland sees all this, and, notwithstanding the disaffected 
State of Ireland, is resolved with Firmness to continue the war. 

I cannot give you my sources of information but I am not deceived. 

Yrs. &c. 

Rufus King.

246 R UFUS KING. [1797 

R. King to Secretary of State. No. 55. 

London, Dec. 6, 1797. 
Dear Sir: 

. . . / think that I am not mistaken in my Belief, that this in- 
security of Peace, and probability that the Congress of Rastadt will 
rekindle the war, has been formally communicated to this Court by 
that of Vienna, in order that measures of Concert, grounded on this 
expectation, should be pursued by the two nations* 

The Directory have given orders to divide the German Terri- 
tory on the left of the Rhine into Departments on the model of 
those of France, while by an Imperial Aulic Decree, the Emperor 
calls upon the Deputies of the Empire to the Congress to exert 
themselves with German firmness, jointly with him, to obtain a 
solid Peace, " on the basis of the Integrity of the Empire." 

At this critical moment has happened the death of the King of 
Prussia ; an event capable of producing the most important con- 
sequences. Some circumstances, tho' far from being conclusive, 
have already appeared, which induce those who wish it, to believe 
that the young King will pursue a course altogether the reverse 
of that of his Father. 

The new monarch is said to be attached to the Army, brave 
and emulous of the character of the Great Frederick ; he is 
moreover both frugal and moral, and in these Points the opposite 
of his Father. Events of the first magnitude follow each other 
with such rapidity that we shall even in a few days be able to 
appreciate the character of the new Sovereign. 

The Directory will be active on this occasion, unless, as is 
rumoured, they are embarrassed by a new Party at Paris that is 
forming itself against them. We are not yet able to discern the 
shape of this Faction, nor to distinguish the peculiar means with 
which it will act. But it is as certain that things must change, 
and that soon, as they have recently become what they are. 

On the 26th ulto. our Envoys had not been received by the 
Directory, nor had they advanced a step since their dispatch by 
Col. Trumbull : except that on the nth. they had by a Note to 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs requested that the Government 
would, without further delay, take the Subject of their Mission 
into consideration, and ten days after, not having received any 
answer, they sent Major Rutledge to inquire whether their request 

* Italics in cipher. 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 247 

had been communicated to the Directory, who was informed that 
it had, and that the result would shortly be made known to the 
Envoys. In the mean time the animosity of the French Govern- 
ment against our Country increases and the condemnation of our 
Ships and Cargoes is pursued with eagerness and rapacity. A 
Proclamation by the Directory of the 22d of November, which 
holds up the Government of England as a Conspiracy against 
French Liberty and charges it as influencing and corrupting 
every other nation, has this expression, " Parlez Americains, 
dites quels sont directement ou indirectement vos vrais domina- 
teurs." . . . 

Nothing material since my last has occurred in this country. 
The proposal of raising seven millions additional Revenue by 
tripling the direct assessments will be carried into execution. In 
the present State of England, we may find both admonition and 
Instruction. If we should be forced into the war in defence of 
our Property and Government, I hope that we may Profit by 
seasonable reflections upon the dangers to the State from too 
great an accumulation of public Debt. This country is now said to 
have arrived near to the Limits of the funding system, and with all 
its burden, bearing upon them, they are compelled to go back to 
the old Scheme of raising within the year their annual Expences. 
We shall not be able to borrow in Europe, and instead of bor- 
rowing at Home except for mere anticipations, why should we 
not, in a war of strict necessity, raise within the year the money 
to defray our Expenses ? I still entertain a faint hope that we 
shall escape the war ; the present State of things must soon 
change, and any change will mend our situation and Prospects. 

With perfect Respect & Esteem, &c.

248 RUFUS KING. [l797 

" Coast of France November 26, 1797. The Minister of Marine 
Pleville Lepeley has recommended to the Marine officers at Gran-

force, to delay the Departure of American vessels, and the expor- 
tation of American property which they daily expected orders to

Mr. Hammond said that he was ordered to declare that the in-

Philadelphia, Dec. 3, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

Inclosed is a Copy of a Letter I received from Mr. King . . . 
I presume that you are happily fixed as Mr. King's Secretary, so 
that your accompanying Mrs. Tilghmam to England has proved 
a most lucky circumstance, as She was thereby fortunately re- 
lieved from a great Weight upon her mind. You will arrive in 
London most seasonably to take upon you the Duties of your 
Office. 

Mr. Henry is elected our Governor ; it is not yet known here 
who will succeed Him in the Senate ; from what I collect the 
Contest will probably terminate between Messrs. Joshua Seney 
and Wm. Winder, the first a decided Jacobin, the other a doubt- 
ful Character. It is truly lamentable that We should be driven 
to this Dilemma. It is said there is a Majority of Antis in our 
House of Delegates. Tom Martin was chosen by a great 
Majority. Mr. Josh. Seney has declared Himself a Candidate 
for the House of Representatives of Congress at the next 
Election. 

There was no opposition to the Answer to the President's 
Speech. What the Plan of the Antis is this Session, I have not 

249 



250 RUFUS KING. [*797 

heard. Messrs. Jefferson and Giles are not yet come ; I suppose 
nothing decisive will be fixed upon untill their Arrival. Our 
Speaker has given up the French since their last Revolution. 

Congress can do nothing decisive untill They hear from our 
Commissioners at Paris ; should our Differences not be accom- 
modated, I flatter myself We shall be more united than We have 
hitherto been ; there will however be a Party in Favor of the 
French let their Conduct towards Us be what it may. 

I have lately received a Letter from Mr. Perry, who is now at- 
tending our Legislature ; in which is the following, " Mr. King 
has truly rendered the State of Maryland vast Service respecting 
our Bank Stock in England. He has now got it in a very good 
Way for our laying our Hands upon it. He has really taken 
great Pains in examining into this Business, and has by a single 
Letter given Us a much clearer View of the whole Business than 
we have been able to obtain from Mr. Chase from his first Com- 
mencement of the Business. Mr. King has rendered Himself 
very popular with us." This Information was doubly gratifying 
to me. 

Mr. Edwd. Lloyd was married to Miss Murray on the 30th 
ulto. and is to settle at Wye. You have no Doubt heard that 
your Father is on the Eve of Matrimony. The Hessian Fly has 
increased twofold upon Us this Fall. Pray present me to Mr. 
King in Terms of the most affectionate Regard ; tell Him I feel 
in the most grateful Manner his friendly attentions to me. Mr. 
Sitgreaves and Myself are alone at Mrs. Williams, and eat when 
at Home of the excellent Cheese which Mr. King was so kind as 
to send Her. I shall be happy to hear from you. 

Yrs Sincerely &c. 

W. Hindman. 



T. Pickering to R. King. 

Department of State, Dec. 5, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . Another grievance which has for some time past 

excited much complaint, is the proceeding of the Judge of the 

Court of Vice-admiralty in St. Domingo. This Court was erected 

by Governor Simcoe, who appointed a Mr. Richard Cambauld 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 25 I 

the Judge. From what I have heard of this man's character and 
the inferences to be drawn from his proceedings, we must con- 
clude that Governor Simcoe did not know him. . . . It is 
not only against the frequency of the captures that are made, 
that complaints have been preferred, but the Judge is represented 
as a man who does not support the decency belonging to that 
character. He has an extraordinary facility in condemning, and 
it is unpleasant to our sea-faring citizens to see those naval 
officers, who are interested in the condemnations, sitting on the 
bench with the Judge, and, as they imagine, influencing his 
decisions. ... It may be questioned whether this Judge 
possesses a competent knowledge of his profession. 



Geo. Washington to R. King. 

Mount Vernon, Dec. 6, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

Your favor of the 6th of September has been duly received, 
and for the information contained in the enclosure, respecting 
Genl. Lafayette, I offer you my thanks. The footing on which 
his releasement is placed by the Emperor, & the succeeding 
event in Paris, on the 4th of September, render his proceedings, 
after he gets to Hamburg, problematical. 

Should these circumstances (for it is not easy to say what 
effect the latter may have on his prospects in France) induce him 
to steer his course immediately for this Country, it will be a mat- 
ter of some regret to him, & his son, that they shall have passed 
each other on the Ocean. 

Deluded (though not designedly) by premature information of 
his parents liberation & journeying to France, by a correspondent 
at Hamburg, his eagerness to embrace them, and his Sisters, in 
the first moment of their reception in France, — the fear of a win- 
ter passage (should he delay his departure) ; — and persuasion, as 
he left his native country under the authority of the Government, 
that he had nothing to apprehend from his return to it ; — over- 
came my advice to him to await a direct account from his father ; 
which would not only have ascertain'd the fact, but might also 
have pointd. out a course which he would have him pursue. — 



252 RUFUS KING. [1797 

Nay, I went so far as to tell him, that although it was not proba- 
ble, it was nevertheless possible, he might be disappointed of his 
object, by the means which seems likely to have happened ; but 
his purpose, from the considerations already mentioned, were not 
to be diverted ; and being excited by the purest filial affection, 
for he is realy a sensible, amiable, and valuable youth, I shall 
feel much for the disappointment of both parties, if they do not 
meet in Europe. With the highest esteem & regards, I am, My 
dear Sir, 

Your Most Obedt. & Obliged Hbl. Ser. 

Geo. Washington. 



R. King to T. Pickering.

London, Dec. 8, 1797. 

Count Rumford, late Sir Benjamin Thompson, whose name and 
history are probably known to you, and whose talents and ser- 
vices have produced the most beneficial Establishments and 
reforms in Bavaria, was lately named by the Elector to be his 
Minister at this Court. On his arrival he has been informed that 
being a British Subject, it was contrary to usage to receive him 
and that therefore he could not be acknowledged. 

The intrigues and opposition against which he had for some 
years made head in Bavaria, probably made him desire the mis- 
sion to England ; the refusal that he has met with, has decided 
him to return and settle himself in America. He proposes to 
establish himself at or near Cambridge, to live there in the 
character of a German Count, to renounce all political expecta- 
tions, and devote himself to literary pursuits — his connections in 
this Country are strictly literary, and his knowledge, particularly 
in the military Department, may be of great use to us. The Count 
is well acquainted with, and has had much experience in the 
establishment of Cannon Founderies ; that which he established 
in Bavaria is spoken of in very high terms, as well as certain im- 
provements that he has introduced in the mounting of flying 
artillery. He possesses an extensive military Library, and 
assures me that he wishes nothing more than to be useful to our 
country. I make this communication by his desire, and my wish 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 253 



is that he may be well received, as I am persuaded that his Prin- 
ciples are good and his talents and information uncommonly ex- 
tensive. It is possible that attempts may be made to misrepresent 
his political opinions : from the enquiry that I have made on this 
head, I am convinced that his political sentiments are correct. 
Be good enough to communicate this letter to the President. 
With great respect & esteem, &c, yours faithfully, 

Rufus King.

I called in on Mr. Chisholme yesterday evening in order to 
obtain from Him the names of the Persons in Ama. who may 
have been implicated in the plan of surprising the Spanish Posts, 
&c, and I took in with me Majr. Geo Barnes, a native of Vir- 
ginia, now in London selling a large quantity of Georgia and 
Tennessee Lands (about which I understand he had wrote to you) 
and from his being acquainted with Mr. Chisholme when He was 
at Phila with the party of Indians making the Southern Indian 
Treaty. I think I am in a fair way thro' him of obtaining most 
of the names implicated in schemes for wresting the Southern 
Territory from the Spaniards, & of which Mr. B. and Mr. C. 
spoke freely before me. Mr. Chisholme has heretofore uniformly 
told me he would expose every matter & plan relative to that 
transaction save the exposition of names, and hinted at several in 
N. York as well as Phila who were concerned therein. He 



254 RUFUS KING. [1797 

showed me a letter rec'd yesterday from Mr. Moore of Ld. G's 
office, dry & guardedly written, as if in ansr. to one from 
Chisholme, asking for supplys, or that He, Mr. C, should be 
obliged to seek for aid & assistance through other channels, 
meaning, as I conceived, through you. I went to him by ap- 
pointment to be the bearer of a letter, which states his case & 
purposes, in some measure, together with a larger bundle of 
sealed papers. I read the letter before he sealed it, but had no 
view of the other papers. I delivered them to yr young man 
Sutton last night & He will wait upon you to day abo't 12 o'clk 
with them. I think it best to apprise you of this by a messenger 
wch. I now send. 

I will get Mr Barnes to go in from time to time to Chisholme 
and doubt not he will be able to get at names &c &c. 

Neither of the three parties know I have any communications 
or acquaintance with you, and so it had better remain for the 
present ; I will attend to any request of yours as to what queries 

or questions to put to Mr C thro' the other two Gentl, for T 

was obliged during my conversations with him to co-incide in his 
opinion that the giving up the names of his friends & party would 
not be perfectly fair. He however told me last night He w'd do 
it provided they were held back from the Spaniards in that 
quarter of the Country. 

I am in haste & with esteem

Sir : 

Mr. Chisholme in many instances seems wild and incoherent, 
altho he has rather spoke out to Mr B. (the Gentl I mention'd in 
my last letter) respecting the names of some of His Colleagues. 
He wrote me the inclosed supposing from a slender acquaintance 
with the Duke of Portland & in that office, I could solicit for him 
some appointment in upper Canada, but this is totally out of the 
question ; His plans & expectations must have been more de- 
veloped to you by the letter & papers I took from him to Mr 
Sutton wch. I suppose you have seen. 

The following are the names I have discovered of those persons 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 2$$ 

concerned with them & wch. may lead to some quest for the dis- 
covery of others viz. at N York, a Captain Mitchell — Capt Sted- 
man (who wrote the Expedition to Surinam) — Doctor Romain 
(who entered into the plan and made his Unkle, Mr. Vandam of 

London, acquainted therewith) — a Mr Morris then in N. 

York but formerly of Kingston Jamaica, and anor name wch. is 
blotted in my memdm. 

Governor Blount seems to have been the chief or main spring, 
also a Colol. Ore in the Tennessee — a Colol. Wm. Whitley in 
Kentucky was promised him w'd join in the plan. 

N. B. he has promised to give the plan in writing to Mr Sutton 
and you will of course see it. At Philadelphia — a Mr Nicolas (a 
ship owner of Newhaven in Massachusets who would send ar'ond 
vessels to Florida & Orleans). From Phila he wrote to Colol. 
Brandt, and The Corn Planter upon the business, & they came to 
Phila. bringing with them a Mr. Street, a member of the Assembly 
of upper Canada. — Capt. Johnson and a Mr. Smith, an Indian 
Interpretor — Chisholme sent for Captain Mitchell before men- 
tioned to Philaa, and Mitchell there spoke to Major Craig of 
Pensylvania, and Mitchell was then sent by the party to The 
Mississippi to sound the people there & get plans &c. of the Forts 
& posts. — also saw & open'd the matter to Capt Collins at Phila 
but who resides in Marblehead. — also a Mr. Blackburne of 
Richm'd in Virginia. The plans were all concerted with & known 
to Mr. Liston, the English Envoy some time between ist Nov. 96 
and Mar last, at which time Capt Chisholme sailed for England. 
to concert measures here in Eng'd, and brought introductory let- 
ters to Lord Grenville, Mr Dundas, Mr Hammond & others., all 
close packed up in sheet lead so as to be easily sunk if he was 
taken at sea, and he had artificial Intrody letters to Mr Liston's 
friends in Hambro' to cover him from detection if taken at Sea. 
I wonder much at the confidence placed in such a Man ! — but the 
plan seems to have been deep & well laid. Mr Chisholme seems 
to be poor, & abandoned by his ministerial Friends at the Treas- 
ury & is of course very anxious to get out of Prison. There is a 
mode of getting his release & which is frequently & every Term 
done in the Courts here, wch. you may not be apprized of — It is 
by getting him Baild out by Jews, or men who openly do it for a 
certain percentage on the Sum, & never after look for the person 
so bailed, nor can he be troubled or run to Execut'n for some 



256 RUFUS KING. [1797 

3 or 4 terms after He is bailed out. — In this way I think He may- 
be released for 9 or 10 jQ advance to such Bail upon their pro- 
ducing His discharge. Whether he is worth this, or not is the 
question. 

Least some doubt may arise in your mind respecting a pass- 
port for, or helping out another person to America (as express'd 
in Chisholme proposals) I think I can confidently assure you it is 
for Mr. D. y. Sutton J^nr, (the young man who has waited on 
you) and the reason is this. By extravagance and some boyish 
indiscretion, he is an alien from His Father's affections & actually 
forbid appearing at his house No 18 Great St Helens. His 
Father is a respectable Quaker Mercht who lived many years in 
Alexandria (wch. is in sight of my estate at Digges' Landing on 
the Potomack just fronting Mount Vernon & in sight of Wash- 
ington City) where the father now is collecting & remitting home 
debts. — His Son (the young man in question) was born there & 
was brought up in Virga. but for some 3 or 4 yr's back has been 
a Clk. to his Father in London, who unfortunately left him in too 
great a trust & I know his wish is to get out to Ama. — with Chis- 
holme or with any one rather than meet his Father, whom I ex- 
pect dayly in London. The way he got acquainted with 
Chisholme was by being put into the same prison for a Taylor's 
Bill of 12 or 15 £ which I soon got compounded & procured his 
discharge about 3 weeks ago The Taylor willingly taking half 

the sum. 

I am with great respect Sir

I thought it better to send this information to you as young 

Sutton will probably call on you to Morrow forenoon with further 

communications from Mr. Chisholme.

London, December 10, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

It was not until Chisholm despaired of receiving further sup- 
port for himself or his Plan from this Government that he con- 
sented to open himself to such person as I should send to him for 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 257 

that purpose. Major Lenox by my desire went to him and wrote 
down from Chisholm's relation the Paper called his Declaration. 
The outlines of the Paper and the answers to the twenty nine 
Questions which follow it, were taken by me from Chisholm at the 
House of Major Lenox, and in his presence. The whole has been 
signed and sworn to by him in the presence of Major Lenox and 
myself. Chisholm required that none of the names of the Per- 
sons residing within or on the borders of Florida should be com- 
municated to the Spanish Government, and I gave him a Promise 
that no such communication should be made. He also requested 
me to lend him a small sum of money to enable him to discharge 
a few trifling Debts, and likewise to assist him in procuring a Pas- 
sage to New York. I have complied with these requests, taking 
from him a Receit, in which he agrees that the loan shall be de- 
ducted from a Balance that he says is due to him from the U. S. ; 
and in case such balance should be insufficient that he will repay 
the loan to you or to your Successor on Demand. On asking 
him if he has any objection to be re-examined in Philadelphia, he 
said that many individuals were concerned in the plan, and that 
if he should become a public witness, his life might be endan- 
gered, since there were men engaged with him who would take it . 
that if he should return home by the way of New York he would 
call on you, and in case the Government would give him security, 
that he should not object to being examined ; but that he wished 
rather to avoid such examination, and to get back to the Creek 
Nation with whom he would employ all his influence in favor of 
the U. S. to whom he was desirous to become a citizen. 

He is strongly impressed with an opinion that Blount had made 
associates with whom he had no acquaintance ; and that it was 
their intention to have managed the affair without his Agency ex- 
cept in a subordinate capacity ; and I have some reason to think 
that Romaine had begun a correspondence with some Persons of 
pecuniary importance in this Country respecting his Plan. 

I am persuaded from the whole Tenor of the Examination of 
Chisholm that he had no intention of asking aid from the French, 
or any other Foreigners except the British. This idea, as well as 
that of the Indians, was that Liston, from the nature of his office, 
would have had Authority to adopt their Plan, and to make the 
necessary corporations to carry it into execution. The voyage to 

VOL. II. — 17

England proceeded from the Disappointment concerning the 
extent of Liston's Powers, and a jealousy of Blount. 

I have had very satisfactory reasons to be convinced that this 
Government from the first disapproved of the Scheme ; a circum- 
stance that may, with a little pains, be turned to profit with the 
Indians, who on our whole Frontier were acquainted with the 
Plan. I will take care to advise you of the vessel in which 
Chisholm takes his passage.*

Dear Sir : 

In a letter that some months' past I wrote to you in answer to 
one that I received from you concerning your Right to hold and 
employ in the trade between this Country and the United States 

* In the folio A, p. 378 of R. King's letters are " The Declaration of John D. 
Chisholm " and " The General Outlines of the Plan referred to in my Declaration 
of the 29th May, 1797," p. 385, and on p. 386 " Questions proposed by Rufus 
King and answered by John D. Chisholm at the house, and in the presence, of 
Major David Lenox on the Fifth day of December One thousand seven hun- 
dred and ninety seven." This last paper is signed by John D. Chisholm — in 
his handwriting — an original paper. Then follows p. 391 — a statement, over 
the name of Rufus King, Min. Plenip., etc., and before him, that John D. 
Chisholm did swear to the truth of the Declaration, etc., to the truth of the 
paper called the General Outline, and to the truth of the foregoing twenty-nine 
interrogatories, all of which he subscribed, London, Dec. 9, 1797. 

Among the papers is the letter from Mr. Liston (original in the possession of 
Mr. King) dated Philadelphia, March 16, 1797, to M. Goverts, Esq., recommend- 
ing John Chisholm, a native of Scotland, to him. 

There is also a copy of " a memorandum for Mr. Chisholm (original in pos- 
session of R. King) by Mr. L. on his arrival at Hamburg." 

At the end of these papers is this : " P. S. The originals, of which the above

American Ships, I distinctly gave to you my opinion, that being 
an American Citizen and Consul according to our Laws, you are 
authorized to hold and employ in any Trade American Ships 
equally with a citizen of the United States resident within the 
same. I am still of the same opinion, and according to my view of 
the subject, the English Government, so far as regards an Ameri- 
can Citizen who has been appointed and admitted as an American 
Consul within the British Dominion, ought not to discriminate 
between him and an American citizen resident within the United 
States. But I understand that the Law officers of this Govern- 
ment hold a different Opinion ; according to which the Rights of 
American Citizens in respect to Commerce are deemed to belong 
only to American Citizens, whose Domicil or Commercial sta- 
tion is within the United States ; and on this ground I have heard 
the Civilians, being consulted by Mr. Johnson, informed him that 
they did not think him capable of holding American Ships, he 
being domiciled in England. The same principle has been em- 
ployed to condemn in the Admiralty the Property of our Consuls 
resident in France ; and in a very recent case, the Property of 
Mr. Bowen, our Consul at Amsterdam, tho' the Property was found 
on board an American Ship, owned by Citizens residing in Massa- 
chusetts. Under these Circumstances I should hesitate to rec- 
ommend to you to rely with much confidence upon what I 
conceive to be your commercial Rights ; but which, as well in 
respect to the Safety of your Ships as to the Security of your in- 
surance, may be liable to interruption. I shall in a short time 
ascertain by the measures which I have adopted concerning 
Johnson's ship, the final decision of this Government.

Dear Sir : 

Your favor of the 24th ultimo arrived safe. I wish you would 

not merely give us information of facts, but state explicitly your 

sentiments ; they would be of great service to us, and you was 

rather enigmatical. Your facts however are very important, 



260 RUFUS KING. [*797 

and frequent information will be essentially useful. We are not 
yet received, and I think it is very probable we shall not be. It 
is said Barras and Neufchateau are for receiving us, and attempt- 
ing to obtain money from us by negotiation. Merlin and Rewbell 
think it will be in vain, and are for sending us away immediately. 
La Reveilliere is undecided ; but the whole of them are undoubt- 
edly hostile to our Government, and are determined, if possible, 
to effectuate a change in our administration, and to oblige our 
present President to resign. With regard to our Citizens here, it 
is in contemplation to send away from France every American 
who cannot produce proof of an implicit approbation of the 
present measures of France, and of a decided aversion to the ad- 
ministration of our Government. Attempts are made to divide 
the Envoys, and with that view some civilities are shown to Mr. 
G. and none to the two others. I am in hopes such attempts will 
be without success. The American Jacobins here pay him great 
Court. Since writing the above, we have received another unoffi- 
cial Message from Mr. Talleyrand to meet the same Persons as 
had formerly conversed with us, without their being officially 
authorized. This we have pointedly and unanimously refused ; 
declaring we would have no communication on the subject of our 
Missions with Persons not officially authorized to treat with us. 
As I have not time by this opportunity to write to Col. Pickering, 
be so good as to communicate this Letter to him in cipher unoffi- 
cially from me, and be assured I am yours Sincerely,

tions upon the Importance of Peace. From the tenor of Genl. P., I 
infer, little valuable as my sentiments are, that they have on this 
occasion been misconceived and treated with more respect by Mr. 
Gerry than they merited. 1 have corrected this Error in a Letter to 
our Envoys, communicating to them the extraordinary fads con- 
tained in my No. jp* which accompanies this Letter. You will 
consider this as well as the Letter from Genl. P. to me as unofficial,

Dear Sir : 

This Cabinet last night, after several days consideration, gave a 

decided negative to a proposal of Peace made by the Directory 

thro' Talleyrand ; the Project was in detail, and the Terms more 

favorable to England than those demanded by Lord Malmesbury 

at Lisle ; the price was a Bribe of a Million Sterling to be divided 

among Directors, Ministers and others. Talleyrand's Department 

was to share one hundred thousand Pounds Sterling. I could 

name the Persons employed, the Stages and every circumstance 

of the Overture ; so that you may place perfect confidence in the 

information. This decision has been made at a time when it is 

uncertain what part will be adopted by the new King of Prussia, 

when England would be glad to make a solid Peace, and if 

economy alone had influenced her, would have paid the Bribe to 

obtain it ; in case she could have had confidence in the corrupt 

Agents with which she might have made the Bargain. This and

Gentlemen : 

I hope that my letters of Nov. 15 and 24, and of the 7th instant, 
have come to hand : in that of Nov. 24, I took notice of those 
considerations which render the Preservation of Peace so import- 
ant : more might be added on the same subject. But France 
perseveres in the capture and condemnation of our Ships, she 
continues to decline to treat with us, and even to receive our 
Envoys, while she employs all the influence left her to discredit 
our Government and to divide our People. 

If we are denied the Right of Embassy, if we cannot navigate 
the Ocean in Security, and if, moreover, we are not free to choose 
our own Governors, unless they are agreeable to France, and at 
the same time to remain in Peace ; our Reputations in the Eyes 
of others, our Duty to ourselves, and above all Self Respect and 
natural Independence command us to endeavour to protect and 
preserve these high Privileges, even at the expence of Peace. 

Earnestly as we desire the preservation of Peace, the Time is 
near at hand, when we must look and act with firmness upon the 
alternative. France may be inclined to practice a dilatory and 
insidious Policy ; it is in your power to disappoint the former, and 
I have the consolation to believe that the latter will be attempted 
in vain. Confidence on this Point is derived as well from the 
Respect due to your Judgment, as from the Persuasion that you 
will think and act in Concert ; the want of which in some of our 
former commissions has been injurious, as well as disreputable, 
to our Country. The Events of every Day confirm the propriety 
of your resolution not to treat with any unauthorized Person ; 
and on the Subject of Bribes and Loans, I do not perceive that, 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 263 

under any circumstances, you can consent to them : To Ransom 
our country from Injustice and Power, would be to invite Dis- 
honor and injury, because there can be no guaranty against 
them. This Cabinet, last night, after several days consideration, 
gave a decided negative to a Proposal of Peace from the Direc- 
tory thro' Talleyrand. The Project was detailed, and the Terms 
more favorable than those demanded by Lord Malmesbury at 
Lisle. The Price, a Bribe of a million Sterling to be divided 
among Directors, Ministers, and others : Talleyrand's department 
to have shared one Hundred Thousand Pounds. I could name 
the Agents, the Stages and every circumstance of the overture ; 
you may place entire confidence in the Fact. This Refusal has 
been made at a time when the Part that shall be taken by the new 
King of Prussia is unknown, when England would be glad to ob- 
tain a solid Peace, and if economy alone influenced her, would 
have paid the Bribe to procure it ; in case she could have put 
confidence in the corrupt agents with whom she might have made 

the Bargain. 

With great Esteem & Respect &c.

Dear Sir : 

I received yours of the 14th yesterday, have changed the cypher 

and shall have * an opportunity in a day or two to send it with an 

unofficial letter to Col. Pickering. If I do not wholly mistake its 

import, we are in danger fro?n a quarter, in which 1 confess I have 

not felt wholly secure, but when I thought Integrity and honest, tho* 

sometimes mistaken, Patriotism would overcome a 7niserable vanity 

and a few little defects of character, that I have for a long time 

known to exist, and which I now fear have been discovered by those 

who will be assiduous to turn them to mischief. You must not appear 

to suspect what you may really k?iow ; you must appear to act as you 

would do — did the most perfect Harmony exist — you must in short 

save him and, in doing so, prevent the Division that would grow out

of a Seism in your Commission. His Integrity is incorruptible : and 
the true Interest of his Country will be seen and prevail, unless Pride 
shall be put in opposition to Duty, or Jealousy shall mislead a mind 
neither ingenuous nor well orga?iised, but habitually suspicious, and, 
when assailed by personal vanity, inflexible. I earnestly hope that I 
overrate your Embarrassments. The observations in my letter of 
the 24th of Nov. were written after retracing in my mind the charac- 
ter for whom they were intended. My letter of yesterday will knock 
away the scaffolding that may have been built with them. Take care 
that means are not employed to protract the negotiation till our com- 
merce ruined by Depredations shall not be worth protecting. The 
Commence?nent of the New Year should bring the Business to a 

crisis. 

Very sincerely yrs.,

R. King to Elbridge Gerry. 

London, Dec. 24, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . Our latest news from home is of the 17th Novr., when 
Congress had not made a Quorum. The account of the revolu- 
tion of the 4th of September reached the U. S. early in Novr., 
and seems to have materially weakened the Hope of a satisfac- 
tory issue of your mission. The continued depredations upon our 
Commerce had the effect that might naturally have been looked 
for, and temperate men have become anxious lest a long and 
patient negotiation should be followed by an open rupture. I 
omitted in my letter of yesterday to you and your colleagues to 
state that hitherto our Ships, when rescued by the Br. Cruizers 
from those of France, have been restored without payment of 
Salvage, tho' in some instances small complimentary presents 
have been made to the Recaptors. Since the Tribunals of France 
have in the last resort confirmed the condemnation of our Ships 
and Cargoes for the defect of a Role d'equipage, the Recaptors 
have libelled in the Admiralty of this Country our recently re- 
captured Ships, not possessing this Document. What will be the 
Decision I am unable to say, and perhaps it may be influenced 
by future Events. In the famous case of the Spanish Register 



1797] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE, 265 

Ship, recaptured by the English from the French in the begin- 
ning of the present war, the whole Ship and Cargo were con- 
demned ; acting upon the Rule, which Spain observes, that 24 
hours' possession by an enemy changes the Property. Our case 
and that of Spain are not the same, for tho' we adopted the Rule 
of the 24 hours, we are not at war, and therefore there can be no 
Enemy Possession. You will however perceive that be the 
salvage much or little, the mischief to our commerce is daily 
augmenting, 

With sincere Respect and attachment &c.

R. King to Secretary of State. No. 60. 

London, Dec. 28, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

. . I was in hopes that I should have been able before 
this time to have informed you that the tedious question respect- 
ing the Maryland Bank Stock had been brought to a satisfactory 
issue. But on further examination, it has been found that altho' 
Russell's claim for Losses supposed in Maryland was liquidated 
by the Commissioners, who ascertained the Claims of the Ameri- 
can Loyalists, the payment was suspended until it should be de- 
cided whether he was entitled to indemnity out of the Maryland 
Bank Stock of which he was a Trustee for Maryland. 

The Chancellor said to me a few days since, you will have no 
objection to satisfy Russell's claim upon a transfer to you of the 
Maryland Bank Stock. I replied that I was sorry to say that I 
had entertained a mistake in supposing that the claim had been 
satisfied ; but that I did not think myself authorized to engage to 
pay it : that if contrary to what I had wished might have been 
the case, and contrary to what I could not but consider as good 
Policy, it was determined to make the Payment of Russell's claim 
a condition of the Transfer, I must request that a Letter might 
be written to me to that effect, which I would immediately send 
to you, in order that the opinion of the State of Maryland might 
be had. The Chancellor made me no direct reply, but I thought 
he acquiesced in the propriety of a letter being written to me, 
conformable to my suggestion. 



266 RUFUS KING. [*797 

I have spoken to Lord Grenville on the subject, and have en- 
deavoured to present to his mind those Considerations, which, 
were I in his situation, would influence me to transfer the Stock 
without any deduction. It may not be amiss to apprize the 
State of Maryland of the present posture of the business, to 
which I shall continue to give every attention that I shall think 
useful to accomplish the object of their just and reasonable 
expectations. .

Dear Sir : 

. . . I have not now the least hope that we shall make any 
Treaty with this Government ; for in order to do so tribute under 
the disguise of a loan or some other disguise, and a private 
douceur of fifty thousand pounds Sterling must be stipulated ; 
and these degrading terms must be humbly offered by us even 
before we can be received ; and, I have been given to understand 
by a person who wished us well, and is intimate with Mr. Talley- 
rand, that if we were to remain here for six months longer, we 
should not advance a step farther towards our negotiation till 
these matters are agreed on. 

In the mean time depredations on our Commerce are threatened 
to be continued, and that Frigates and armed vessels from St. 
Domingo shall ravage our Coasts. In a conversation which Mr. 
Gerry had with Mr. Talleyrand, he told him the offer of a loan 
must come from us. We still intend to prepare and transmit by 
the 10. of next month to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, a State- 
ment of the; Claims of our Country, and declare our desire to 
enter into a discussion of their Complaints, and to do justice in 
all the points wherein we shall be convinced that justice is due ; 
and if they shall still continue not to receive us, and enter into an 
Investigation of the objects of our Mission, and matters remain 
as they are, it is my opinion, and my colleagues tell me it is theirs

Dear Sir : 

Every appearance on the Continent is marked with the as- 
cendancy of France. Vienna will no longer resist, but will co- 
operate with France in the Plan of Partition arranged at Campo 

268 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 269 

Formio. The King of Prussia, who is supposed to entertain 
different sentiments from those of his Father, is surrounded by 
the Ministers, and fettered with the Councils, of the last Reign, 
and therefore will not, as Germany wishes and solicits, put him- 
self at their Head to oppose France. 

No recent Change has taken place in Portugal or Spain. This 
Government has consented that Portugal shall make the best 
Bargain in her Power, notwithstanding her Treaties with England. 
She is therefore now desirous to confirm the Treaty sometime 
since signed at Paris ; but the Directory seem disposed to exact 
more rigorous Terms, and Spain is under great apprehensions for 
the existence of her System, should France march an Army 
against Portugal. 

Here, tho' there is apparent Union, there is no animation ; or 
if any, it is far below what, under the present circumstances of 
the country, it ought to be. 

Preparations are made to resist the threatened Invasion, which 
will undoubtedly be attempted on a large or small scale in some 
part of the Three Kingdoms. These preparations are conducted 
in a manner that proves to my mind, that there is no serious ex- 
pectation that they will be necessary ; an error that may be dis- 
covered should the attack prove formidable. . . . 

Lord Grenville mentioned to me a few days since, that the 
Commissioners under the V. article of our Treaty with this 
Country, had suggested the expediency of an additional Article 
for the purpose of dispensing with the Provision that required 
them to ascertain the Latitude and Longitude of the source of 
the St. Croix River. Upon examining our First Treaty, it was 
seen to be important that the source of this River should be 
accurately ascertained, as it is the point from whence a North line 
is to proceed to the High Lands that divide our Territory from 
Canada ; and unless this point be ascertained by taking the Lat. 
and Longe., or by erecting some durable monument, it may here- 
after become the occasion of future disagreement and misunder- 
standing, especially as we know that what in the wilderness 
appears to be the Head of a River will, when the Country is 
opened and cultivated, retain no marks of having been so. Lord 
Grenville concluded from this view of the Subject to authorize 
Mr. Liston to consent to form an additional article which should 



270 RUFUS KING. [1798 

leave our Commissioners free to erect a durable monument at the 
scource of the River St. Croix, which should occasionally be 
visited and kept in repair at the expense of the two Nations. . . . 

This gave me an opportunity of going into the Question re- 
specting the Impress, of Seamen engaged in our Service ; the 
conversation, tho' understood to be only personal, was more 
satisfactory than any former one on this subject. . . . 

If, as now I believe, our Mission to France shall totally fail, it 
will be very important in guiding my opinions and conduct, that 
I should be early and fully possessed of the views of our Govern- 
ment. ... I omitted above to take notice of the Situation of 
Switzerland, which according to present appearances is destined 
to be soon revolutionized in order to be recast in the French 
Moulds. We have been mistaken in the conduct of these Can- 
tons ; their System has been a temporizing one ; France has 
dictated to them during the whole of the war, and the hour is 
arrived when she seems resolved to overturn the Helvetic 
system. . . . 

With Respect and Esteem &c.

Lord Grenville to R. King. 

Private. 

Cleveland Row, Jan. 13, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

The decree of the Convention, which we may suppose will be 
the necessary consequence of the Message of the Directory, seems 
to decide the question of Peace & war, with you, as it is evidently 
impossible that America can under the present circumstances of 
Europe carry on any trade whatever, subject to the confiscation of 
her ships if they contain English goods on board, or goods which 
the captors may deem English. This is carrying the principles of 
maritime War to an extent to which no Country ever thought 
of carrying them & which must render the existence of a neutral 
trade, particularly in the case of the U.S. absolutely impossible. 

As I conclude you will think not a moment should be lost in 
apprizing your Government of this circumstance, for the security 
& protection of the commerce of the U.S., I have desired that 



1798J LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 27 1 

the packet, which I am sorry to hear is still detained at Falmouth, 
may have orders to sail the instant that they shall receive any 
dispatches you may have to send, and if any other steps can be 
taken by us that can be of use to you, I beg you will let me know 
it ; and that you will be assured of my constant desire to obey 
your commands on all occasions & to prove to you the senti- 
ments which I have so often expressed on the subject of the U.S. 
Ever, my dear Sir, most sincerely & faithfully yrs. 

Grenville. 

R. King to Secretary of State. No. 62. 

London, Jany. 14, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

The present composition of the French Legislature, as well as 
the Terror of the last Revolution, leave no doubt that the Coun- 
cils will pass a decree comformable to the Message of the Direc- 
tory of the 4th inst : the consequences of which will be the 
general capture of all neutral Ships ; since there are very few in- 
deed which have not as a part of their Cargo articles which are 
or may be alleged to be of the manufacture of the British Terri- 
tories in the East or West Indies or in Europe. Had I before 
entertained any remaining hope of an amicable settlement of our 
disagreement with France, this last proceeding would completely 
extinguish it. 

I have no letters from our Envoys since the 30th ulto. ; but I 
consider that they will now think it requisite to bring their Mis- 
sion to an issue ; if not that which has been earnestly desired, 
it must be one that will correspond with the opinion pronounced 
by the President, and which our Interest and Honor, under 
present circumstances, call upon us manfully to maintain before 
the rest of the world. . . . 

I am called upon by the Masters of our Ships here for advice 
and direction what their conduct is to be. They propose to arm 
their vessels ; I have hitherto said tho' our Commerce were sorely 
vexed and plundered, still we were not at war, and further, that 
as they were not permitted to arm at home I could not give 
them any authority to do so abroad. But will not this new Pro- 
ject, of France totally change the State of our Relations ? Will 



272 RUFUS KING. [1798 

it not necessarily compel us into, and is it not indeed, war ? Our 
Ships returning home from England, if met, will be captured and 
condemned, because their cargoes will be British Manufactures. 
If they are armed and sail together, they may escape small 
cruizers ; and if they are captured, they will not share a worse 
fate than they would have done, had they been taken without 
arms. I shall consider this subject with attention and will exer- 
cise a discretion that the exigency seems to demand. It would 
certainly be more agreeable to me to have it in my power on all 
occasions, and especially on those of the highest moment, to find 
my Duty in observing the well considered Instructions of the 
President. But there sometimes occur, and more frequently at 
this period than formerly, events so wholly unlooked for, that the 
subordinate Agents of a Nation may be called upon to act always 
with a sound and prudent Discretion, in cases, the Decision of 
which belong to the highest Department of the Government. 
While on the one hand I shall regret the existence of the occasion, 
I shall not hesitate on the other to do what, under its peculiar 
circumstances, shall appear to my Judgment to be necessary to 
promote the National Welfare. . . . This Government, for I 
am so assured, will, if I desire it, detain our Spring Ships, until 
they shall be all laden and ready to Sail, when they will convoy 
them to our Shores. Perhaps this may be a more eligible Plan 
than that of arming them, which will be expensive and a security 
only against small Privateers. If our Ships sail under Convo)'', I 
am informed that they may be insured at 15 pr Cent, to return 
ten, if they arrive, whereas they will without Convoy be obliged 
to give from 13 to perhaps 18 pr Cent premiums for their 
Insurance. . . . 

With perfect Respect and Esteem 

Rufus King. 

R. King to Lord Grenville. 

Great Cumberland Place, Jany. 15, 1798. 
My Lord : 

I pray your Lordship to accept my acknowledgments for your 
very obliging Letter of the 13th inst. Your Lordship will be satis- 
fied from the Tenor of my opinions that I must see the proposed 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 273 

Measures of France in the same light as they appear to you ; and 
under these impressions I have prepared, to be sent by the Packet, 
a Despatch for Col. Pickering, which will apprize him of the Law, 
which without doubt has been, or will soon be passed by the 
French Legislature. 

I have likewise intimated to him that, as I have reason to be- 
lieve, your Government will be willing to grant, according to my 
present view of the subject it is my intention to ask, your co- 
operation to detain and collect our Spring Ships, in order that 
they may be sent home under convoy ; a precaution that will be 
indispensable in case the Law, called for by the Directory shall 
be enacted. . . . 

With perfect Respect & Esteem &c 

Rufus King. 

R. King to Lord Chancellor. 

Private. 

Great Cumberland Place, Jany. 19, 179S. 
My Lord : 

. . . Disinterested and generous actions are in the end 
commonly beneficial to those who perform them ; and I am con- 
fident the People of America are not less than others sensible to 
their influence. Your Lordship's Candour will apply this 
observation as it is meant, to the occasional Relaxation of Strict 
Rights and to those mutual accomodations and tokens of good will 
and Friendship, often called for by the Individuals and some- 
times by the Governments of Countries, between which such ex- 
tensive Connections exist as between Great Britain and the 
United States. Whether the Case of the Maryland Bank Stock 
may be considered as falling within this description, will depend 
upon your Lordship's decision ; and without discussion of the 
merits of the conflicting claims to this property, which from their 
character cannot be judicially ascertained, I take the liberty to 
remark that the Question is the only one, in any manner con- 
nected with the Treaty of 1783, that has not been satisfactorily 
settled, or is not in a course of amicable adjustment. 

Your Lordship sometime since intimated to me that it seemed 
reasonable that Maryland should compensate Russell's family for 

VOL. II. —18 



274 RUFUS KING. [1798 

their losses, which being done, no further impediment would pre- 
vent the Transfer of the Stock. If your Lordship should con- 
tinue to be of this opinion, my belief certainly is, that Maryland 
would compensate Russell's Family and accept the Transfer ; 
but, my Lord, this course would be attended with delay, and the 
present seems to be the true moment to conclude the Business. 
Besides, I am too well acquainted with the Sentiments of the 
State of Maryland not to know before-hand that a considerable 
and disadvantageous difference in the public opinion would exist 
between a conditional and an unconditional transfer of this Stock : 
the former would furnish occasion to those who may be inclined 
to use it, to complain of rigour, perhaps of injustice, and to dep- 
recate the benefit which even that mode would secure, while the 
latter would have a salutary influence in producing cordiality, 
good Humour and Kind Offices towards England in a community 
of very considerable and merited importance in the American 
Union. 

I should have no objection in case of an entire transfer of the 
Stock, should it be deemed advisable, to reccommend to the 
State of Maryland to satisfy Russell's claim, and I should hope 
that such Recommendation would not be in vain. The amount 
of this Claim is not considerable, and nothing in my estimation, 
when compared with the political considerations with which it is 
connected. What Maryland might with Reluctance grant in the 
shape of a Condition, she may cheerfully give from her own spon- 
taneous sense of equity. 

With perfect Consideration and Respect &c. 

Rufus King. 



R. King to Secretary of State. No. 63. 

London, Jany. 27, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

I am still without any knowledge of the situation of our En- 
voys, since the commencement of the present year ; this is the 
more regretted as the Period is near at hand when our Spring 
Ships will be ready to sail from the ports of this country : pre- 
vious to which I must decide whether they are to be put under 
Convoy or to sail with the increased Risque of Capture and cer- 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 2?$ 

tainty of condemnation. A Commission of the English Mer- 
chants concerned in the American Commerce, have applied for a 
Convoy for the Trade of America, which will be granted : but the 
Masters of the American Ships will hesitate, perhaps refuse, to put 
themselves under this Convoy, unless I shall give them positive 
instructions to do so. I think this week cannot pass over without 
nry hearing from our Envoys, if I shall not have the pleasure to 
see them. 

Great preparations are certainly making to execute, as well as 
to defeat, the threatened Invasion. The Treaty of Campo-Formio 
appears to be going into full execution, as well in Italy as upon 
the Rhine and in Germany. The late affair at Rome is to be the 
occasion of extending and establishing the new order of things 
throughout Italy. 

The Emperor, according to every appearance, and some of 
them by no means equivocal, will act in full concert with the 
Directory in their Schemes of Partition. The Swiss Cantons are 
in such a situation that they will exceed the hopes of their friends, 
if they shall be able to prevent the dissolution of their Confede- 
racy, or the plunder and overthrow of their Country. They are 
too rich as well as too happy to be suffered to remain in Peace : 
and the usual means have therefore been employed to divide and 
debauch their people. Perhaps they also have been disposed of, 
as Venice and certain portions of the Empire have been. It is 
no longer expected that Prussia will act with much decision or 
vigour in opposition to France and Austria. The maxims of the 
two last Reigns would rather lead to the belief that she would not 
find many scruples in even becoming a Partner in the Division of 
the Spoils. It is however said that Prussia, in concert with the 
North of Germany, including Denmark, will resist the project of 
France upon Hamburgh and the other Hanse towns ; and hopes 
are therefore entertained that the valuable Commerce of this 
Country thro' the Elbe will remain open. 

I certainly wish that this may be the case ; but if France per- 
severe in her Demands, and she is not likely to relax in them, I 
think she must succeed. Neither of the Envoys of Sweden or 
Denmark have received any Despatches from their Courts since 
the new Edict of France concerning the Navigation of Neutrals. 
The fate of Portugal is yet unascertained. Their Ambassador at 



276 RUFUS KING. [1798 

Paris is confined in the Temple. The System of Russia is de- 
cidedly to keep out of the war ; but it remains to be seen what 
effects upon the Government and among the inhabitants of Rus- 
sia may proceed from the adoption of the Body of French Sol- 
diers under the Prince of Conde. A single Frenchman is said, 
during the late Reign to have nearly effected a Revolt in the 
Russian Fleet upon the Black Sea ! ; and the Corps of Conde 
has been employed in opposition to the opinion of a Minister of 
the Russian Cabinet, who is believed to be the ablest Statesman 
of his nation. . . .

My Lord : 

I have the honor to send enclosed to your Lordship a copy 
of my full Power, on the part of the United States to agree to 
and conclude an additional article to our Treaty of Amity, 
Commerce, and Navigation, which shall leave the Commissioners 
acting under the fifth article thereof, at liberty to ascertain and 
describe the true River St. Croix, without particularising the 
Latitude and Longitude of the Source of that River. 

. . . It is desirable, if an additional article shall be con- 
cluded, that it should be done in season to be laid before the Sen- 
ate of the United States in their present Session. I shall be ready 
to confer with your Lordship upon this subject at any time that 
you shall have the goodness to name.

This is a long letter calling, under instructions from the Presi-

the American Trade in the West Indies by the irregular Capture 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 27 J 

of American Ships and Cargoes, and their illegal condemnation 
by the Court of Admiralty, erected by General Simcoe at St. 
Domingo — to the dissatisfaction that these Depredations must 
have produced in America, to the mischief that by a sudden 
interruption of supplies may fall upon the British Possessions in 
the West Indies," and requesting his Lordship's attention to put 
an end to them, in case they are unauthorized or to regulate his 
(the judge's) conduct in case they are authorized and to state how 
that redress may be obtained, which he refuses to give the means 
of obtaining. 

Having often experienced your Lordship's ready attention to 
the Representations that I have made on other occasions, I take 
the liberty of suggesting that I shall be particularly obliged to 
your Lordship for an answer to this Note in season to be sent by 
the earliest Conveyance to America, it being my earnest desire 
that the dissatisfaction that has been excited, may cease as soon 
as possible.

Dear Sir : 

Acknowledging a receipt of a note from Ld. G. on the advisabil- 
ity of transferring the Negotiation about the St. Croix River ques- 
tion to the U.S., in which under other circumstances R. K. says 
" the negotiation here is a saving of time." 

He says : " By the enclosed Copy of a letter that I have received 
from Col. Pickering your Lordship will observe that the Latitude 
and Longitude of the Mouths of the two Rivers have already been 
ascertained ; and there is reason to expect that the Surveys will 
also be compleated before the meeting of the Commissioners in 
June ; when they might be able to finish their Business ; if they 
shall have been freed from the necessity of ascertaining experi- 
mentally the Latitude and Longitude of the Source of the two St. 
Croix." He therefore urges making the article here in London to 
save time.

. . . P. S. I enclose four depositions concerning the con- 
duct of Richard Cambauld, Esq., Judge of the Vice-admiralty 
Court at Cape Nichola Mole. In the view of the American Mer- 
chants his character is to the last degree infamous. I expect to 
obtain Evidence of his Corrupt practices, but hope without this 
that he may be removed from a bench which he dishonors. I am 
informed that Lord Dunmore, late Governor of the Bahama 
Islands, knows him well, and can bear witness to his duplicity and 
dishonorable actions there. I have also private information that 
at Nova Scotia, where he lived some time, he had lost all reputa- 
tion, and was pronounced a swindler and an unprincipled man.

Dear Sir : 

In my answer to General Pinckney's letter of the 14th Deer., I 
expressed my apprehensions that they would experience great 
embarrassments from a certain quarter but that they might rely 
with perfect security upon his integrity and that for the rest they 
must be patient and endeavour to prevent a seism among them- 
selves. The General in a letter of the 2 2d ulto. tells me that I 
had by no means overrated their embarrassment, but that they 
had and should follow my advice. He adds that the letter will 
soon be presented. 

With perfect regard &c.

R. King to Secretary of State. No. 64. 

London, Feby. 7, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

My last letter from Paris is dated 22d ultimo. The Law called 

for by the Directory on the 4th, after having passed the Council 

of the Five Hundred, was on the 18th adopted by the Council of 



I79 8 ] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 2jg 

Antients, and is now in full operation. It does not appear that 
any debate or division took place in the Council of Antients upon 
the passage of this Law. A Report was made concerning it to the 
Council of five hundred, where it passed with unanimity. I send 
you inclosed a copy of this Report. The Personalities which it 
contains have an object too plain to be misunderstood, and are 
part of the plan systematically pursued to change the Executive 
Head of our Government. 

The last mails confirm the information that I have before given 
you respecting the critical situation of Switzerland. . . . The 
German Deputies at Rastadt have, according to the Requisition of 
the French Ministers, been furnished with full powers to conclude 
a Convenient Peace, instead of one founded upon the integrity of 
the Empire. ... In the present France recedes from the 
Projects against Hamburgh. Prussia, in concert with the North 
of Germany, have manifested a disposition to prevent the French 
from passing what is called the line of neutrality ; and this Com- 
bination must be dissolved before the Hanse Towns shall be 
subjected, as they finally will be, to the Controul of France. 

The Dutch have shown too little Energy ; and even in their 
Revolutionary State, have displayed too much of the Deliberation, 
which forms an essential part of their national character, to suit 
the new order of things that reigns in France. Hence it has been 
necessary to effect a change. Charles La Croix, the late Minister 
of Foreign Affairs, was accordingly sent to replace Citizen Noel 
at the Hague, where, under his Direction, a Revolution took place 
on the 2 2d of January, upon the exact model of that which 
occurred at Paris on the 4th of September. . . . It is plain 
that in future Holland must without deliberation obey the orders 
of France, among the first of which will be an Instruction to adopt 
the French Code of Laws concerning the Trade of Neutrals. 

. . It is difficult to form an opinion of what is doing in 
France. But Private Letters confirm the Probability that another 
struggle is about to take place between the chiefs of the Party who 
came uppermost in the last Revolution. . . . It is now more 
than a month that from day to day I have expected to hear that 
our Envoys had quitted Paris ; and notwithstanding I have not 
been authorized by a single circumstance within my knowledge to 
believe that they will be successful in preventing a war, still their 



280 RUFUS KING, [1798 

continuance at Paris has had an influence upon my Conduct. 
Perhaps you may think that I have been too cautious, and that 
with my Knowledge of the opinion of the President upon the sub- 
ject of Convoys, I ought not to have hesitated in asking this Gov- 
ernment to grant them. The truth is, that for many weeks past, 
I had a firm persuasion that our Mission to France would wholly 
fail of success : that the Directory themselves wished to see an 
end to it : and they were only waiting and watching for an osten- 
sible reason, either in the conduct of the Envoys, or of others, to 
send them away. In this view of the Subject you will see that my 
application for a Convoy, which, in less than a week, would have 
been known at Paris, was a step by no means free from objection, 
inasmuch as it might, and probably would, have been represented 
and acted upon as a measure on our part of Perfidy and even of 
aggression ; and that too, while in the public Eye our Ministers 
were at Paris for the purpose of an amicable settlement of the 
Disagreement between the two Countries. So long as I viewed 
the Question in this Light, and things continued in the situation 
in which they had stood for several months, I declined any direct 
interference on the Subject of Convoys ; taking care to inform 
such of my Countrymen as applied to me, that I thought it probable 
that Convoys would be offered and that they, as Private individ- 
uals might without prejudice to their country, accept the Protection 
that they would afford. 

But since the adoption of the Law concerning Neutrals, which 
is particularly aimed at our Navigation, and will be followed by 
the Dismission of our Envoys, the Question has assumed a new 
shape ; and it would, in my judgment be weakness, instead of 
prudence, to hesitate under present circumstances, in adopting 
measures of effectual security, from an apprehension that they 
might give displeasure, or be deemed unfriendly, to those whose 
conduct towards us has no other character than that of unjust 
aggression and war. . . . 

Nothing that has for some time past fallen within my Observa- 
tion, has led me to believe that this Government have any expec- 
tation of, or that they are engaged in any measures with a view 
to, Peace. The triple taxes will be productive, and the voluntary 
Subscriptions considerable. The Country appears to be calm 
and without anxiety upon the subject of Invasion ; indeed there 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE, 28 1 

has been an unusual stability for the past three months in the 
public Opinion, notwithstanding all the Manifestoes and Demon- 
strations that France has made of her resolution to bring the war 
to an end by dictating a Peace on the Banks of the Thames. 

/ have had some reason to believe that the prospect of our being 
engaged in the war, has renewed the project that * on more than one 
occasion has been meditated against South America. I think I am 
not mistaken in this conjecture. Miranda who was certainly en- 
gaged in this scheme at the time of the affair of Nootka and who has 
since served tender Dumouriez in France, came to this country a 
few weeks since. He has been with the Ministry and is here by 
their Desire or with their Permissio?i ; the object is the complete 
Independence of South A?nerica to be effected by the co-operation of 
England and the U. S.

Mr. Pickering, in a letter dated February 7, 1798, sends 
to Mr. King, at the request of Mr. Chase, their agent, the 
resolves of the Legislature of Maryland of January 19, 
1798, relative to the stock of that State in the Bank of Eng- 
land. These resolutions give him full power to act in be- 
half of the State, and suggest a course of conduct based 
upon advices they had received from Mr. King as to the 
probable action of the British Government, and Mr. P.

resolution follow : 

" Resolved that the General assembly of Maryland approve the 
exertions of Rufus King to procure an unconditional transfer of 
the Bank Stock due this State in the hands of the Accountant 
General of the High Court of Chancery of Great Britain, and for 
his maintaining the absolute and unqualified right of this State to 
the said Bank Stock.

relinquishing the States' Right to any part of said Bank Stock, 
but declaring a detention of any part thereof by the Crown of 
Great Britain to be contrary to justice and in violation of the 
Treaty of Peace of 1783 between Great Britain and America. 

" Resolved that Rufus King do not accept on the part of the 
State the transfer of said stock, if the release or dereliction of the 
States' Right to any part be insisted on as a condition precedent 
to the transfer of the residue. ..."

Dear Sir : 

. . . We have no accounts from home since 7 th of Jany, 
nor is my intelligence much later from Paris. I have experienced 
no small Difficulty in deciding what ought to have been my con- 
duct in respect to American Property about to depart from this 
Country for our's, and which is now liable to Capture and Con- 
demnation by the french ; fortunately the Business has taken a 
turn that for the present does not require my interference. It is 
not therefore expedient nor would it under any circumstances be 
necessary, to give you the course of my Reflections, since you 
will readily see the subject in all its Relations. Whether correctly 
or otherwise you can but decide, they have had an influence in 
persuading me that it is time we should distinctly understand 
what are the real views of France towards our Country. I wish 
I could derive any satisfaction in my conjectures, I had almost 
said my fixed opinions, on this important Subject. I reject all 
Quixotism in Politicks ; but national honor, rightly understood, 
is national Power — and if the former is degraded, the latter will 
be despised. 

With sincere regard I am & yr. ob. & faithful serv. 

Rufus King.

to his Reports of the Prospects and situation of the U. S. Do 
you understand this, my dear Judge ? 1 hope that you and my 
more sanguine friend and successor have seasonably changed into 
Dollars and eagles, a few thousand of your many acres ; for with 
all my infidelity, I sincerely wish that the result of your specula- 
tions may far exceed even your own expectations of Profit.* Re- 
member that war will bring depreciation, and how we are to 
escape it, my poor eyes cannot discover. The prayers of Prot- 
estant Christians are answered by the downfall of the Pope, and 
what is strange to relate the faithful Swiss are involved in the 
same ruin. 

The poor Dutch after passing thro' Purgatory, are condemned 
to weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth, Spain and Portugal are 
soon to meet their fate, and God only knows the number of days 
that remain to those who are last to be destroyed. 

I will hope that we are nearly cured of the folly of admiring 

the progress of this scourge of the human kind. . . .

R. King to Secretary of State. 

London, Feb, 26, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

Two points have within a fortnight been settled in the English 

Cabinet respecting South America. If Spain is able to prevent the 

overthrow of her present Government and to escape being brought 

nnder the entire coniroul of France, England (between whom and 

* Col. Troup says in a letter of 8th of June, 1798 : " I read your remarks 
about our land speculations a few days ago to Lawrance, who was here to re- 
cruit his health. He winched at them. Within eighteen months he has been 
obliged to assume for his brother land speculators near 18,000 dollars which 
has worked him almost to an oil. ... I have been in one respect fortu- 
nate ; I have lost nothing by any person — in another I have been unlucky — my 
estate is altogether landed and for some time past it has been locked up, and is 
still very unprofitable. The country is however filling up as rapidly as ever. 
To settlers it still brings the same prices as usual, but payments are not so 
regularly made as formerly." 



284 RUFUS KING. [1798 

Spam, notwithstanding the war, a certain understanding appears to 
exist) will at present engage in no scheme to deprive Spain of the 
possession of Sth. America. But if, as appears probable, the army 
destined against Portugal, and which will march thro' Spain, or any 
other means which may be e?nployed by France, shall overthrow the 
Spanish Government, and thereby place the resources of Spain and 
of her Colonies at the disposal of France, England will immediately 
commence the execution of a Plan long since digested and prepared 
for the compleat independe?ice of Sh. America. 

If England engages in this Plan, she will at Philadelphia propose 
to the U. S. to cooperate in its execution. Miranda will be detained 
here, under one pretence or another, until events shall decide the 
conduct of England. 

The revolution of Spain is decreed j the attempt will be made, and 
the success is scarcely doubtful. The President may therefore expect 
the overture of England, and will, I am persuaded, act upon it, wider 
the influence of that wise and comprehensive policy, which, looking 
forward to the Destinies of the New World, shall in the beginning 
by great and generous Deeds lay deep and firm the foundations of 
lasting accord between its rising Empires. If possible, I will bring 
together and seasonably arrange and send to you such information, as 
I have been able to procure upon this interesting and very consequen- 
tial subject, having found out and acquired the confidence of certain 
jFesuits, ?iatives of Sth. America, who with a view to its independence 
are and for several years have been, in the service and pay of Eng- 
land. I have cofiversed with them and seen the Reports which they 
have prepared for their employers. These communications throw 
much light upon the population, the resources, the oppression and the 
temper and character of the Spanish Americans* 

. . . By what means the Dutch Money Lenders have been, 
or are to be, induced to transfer to the French their American or 
other Funds, I am not informed. But a few days since a French- 
man, under a German Name and Passport, arrived in London 
from Paris : the object of his voyage is to ask of certain Capital- 
ists here whether they will purchase or advance Money upon the 
Bonds of the United States held by the Dutch and Antwerp 
Money Lenders upon their being assigned and transferred to 
them in a way that shall be entirely satisfactory ? One of our

1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 285 

Countrymen, whose pursuits are regulated by a faithful attach- 
ment to his Country, and who has been invited to participate in 
the purchase of these Bonds, consulted me upon the propriety of 
the measure. I had no hesitation to dissuade him from engaging 
in it : because in the present situation of Holland, it appears to 
me desirable to preserve the influence, be it great or small, arising 
from the property which Individuals of that country hold in our 
funds ; and because, moreover, in the present Disposition of 
France towards us, we cannot with prudence desire to Contribute 
to the supply of the means which may enable France to multiply 
their unjust aggressions against us and others. Our Debt to 
the Money Lenders of Amsterdam and Antwerp, exclusive of 
what they hold in our Domestic Stock, amounts to Eleven Mil- 
lions of Dollars, not more than two hundred and fifty thousand of 
which is liable to re-imbursement during the present Century. 
The preservation of this Debt, in its present shape, may operate 
to restrain measures of hostility that otherwise may be adopted. 
It was doubted by some persons, whether the payment by antici- 
pation of our Debt to France was a prudent Policy : as an inde- 
pendent measure of finance, it was beneficial ; but the political 
mischiefs of the arrangement deserved to have been taken into 
the question, since they might be found to outweigh the Argu- 
ment of ceconomy. . . . Notwithstanding the increased prob- 
ability that we shall be drawn into the Vortex, our Stocks have 
risen in their price and are now sought for by some people, who 
have heretofore thought nothing out of England secure. . . . 

Annexed you have Copies of three notes which I have received 
from Lord Grenville. The first is an answer to my note respect- 
ing the Proceedings of the Vice-admiralty Court of St. Domingo. 
As this Court was not legally constituted, its proceedings are 
void ; and those who have suffered from its acts are referred, as 
in the Martinique cases, to the High Court of Admiralty for 
redress. . . . 

On the 3 1st of January our Ministers at Paris, who were still unre- 
ceived and therefore unauthorized to hold a regular communication 
with the French Government, sent to the Minister of Foreign 
Relations the letter which they have informed you they were pre- 
paring for that purpose. On the 19th of February they had re- 
ceived no answer, nor had any notice been taken of them or their 



286 RUFUS KING. [1798 

letter by Mr. Talleyrand. . . . There is really no hope that 
France will return to reason in our affairs ; and we should take 
care not to be deceived by any false appearances that perhaps she 
may think it politic to pursue. Her conduct can only be explained 
by supposing that she thinks that we have neither Union, nor 
courage, nor character to resist any outrage that she may choose 
to practise towards us ; and is it strange that she and others should 
entertain this opinion, if they believe the late publication by Mr. 
Monroe, who proves his Patriotism by an attempt to revile and 
degrade his Country in the eyes of the whole World ? 

With perfect Respect and Esteem, 

Rufus King. 



A. Hamilton to R. King. 

Probably March, 12, 1798. 

It is a great while, my Dr. friend, since I have written you a 
line. You will not I am sure impute my silence to any cause im- 
peaching my friendship, for that must be always cordial and 
entire. The truth is that my professional avocations occupm ye 
to the extent of the exertions my health permits, and I have been 
unwilling to sit down to write you without leisure to say some- 
thing interesting. But I now depart from this rule that my perse- 
vering silence may not make me sin beyond Redemption. I have, 
however, only time to tell you that your friends are generally well 
& as much attached to you as ever ; & that I hear of no cabals 
against you. 

Being just returned from Albany, I would say nothing about 
the political juncture as it is affected by the unpleasant advices 
from our Commissioners in France. I will only say that the pub- 
lic mind is much sounder than that of our Representatives in the 
national Council & that there is no danger of our actively dis- 
gracing ourselves, that is, by any unworthy compliances with the 
exorbitant pretensions of " The Great Monster." *

In Cipher. 

Paris, March 14, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

I hope you have received safe our No. 6. to the Secretary of 
State with its inclosures. We had prepared the letter therein 
mentioned. It was agreed to by all of us, after it had been 
altered so as to meet the apparent sentiments of all. General 
Marshall and myself signed it, yet Mr. Gerry delayed adding his 
Signature, and at last declined it, on a conversation he had with 
Mr. Talleyrand's Secretary, wherein the terms of a loan to be stip- 
ulated by us now, but not to be paid until after the war, were sug- 
gested. This, when communicated to us, General Marshall and 
myself altogether disapproved. Mr. Gerry thought it admissible 
if stipulations were made that it should not be transferred until 
after the war. On a conversation with Mr. Talleyrand himself, it 
clearly appears that the intention was to make this loan a present 
aid ; but to conceal the intention by deferring the time of pay- 
ment. Mr. Gerry declared he was convinced of it and was 

287 



288 RUFUS KING. [1798 

against it ; but I think he will not sign the letter he agreed to, nor 
consent to ask for Passports until he hears from our Government. 
The intention here is, with regard to the Envoys, to get General 
Marshall and myself away and to keep Mr. Gerry ; with regard to 
our Country, it is to get money if they can ; but, if not, then to 
keep American affairs in suspense till the Expedition against 
England is determined. 

I remain with great truth your Sincere & affectionate 

Charles Cotesworth Pinckney. 



R. King to Secretary of State. No. 69. 

London, March 17, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

Lord Grenville informed me at the last Conference, that he was 
concerned to learn from their Commissioners that an opinion was 
entertained by their Colleagues, that they had power to receive 
and, immediately after the expiration of Eighteen months from 
the opening of the Commission, to decide all questions within 
the Purview of the Treaty, whether the same were depending 
before, or had been decided by, the Courts of Admiralty. 

He said that he was at a loss how the Commissioners could upon 
their Oaths say, in cases depending in the Courts of Admiralty, 
that Compensation could not be had and received in the ordinary 
Courts of Justice ; and unless upon their Oaths they could say so, 
they had no authority to proceed to decide such cases ; they 
might receive the Claims, but unless the delays of the Admiralty 
were such as amounted to a denial of Justice, they must defer 
their decisions until the Admiralty had given theirs. His Lord- 
ship added that, if the opinion alluded to should be persisted in, 
he did not see how they could authorize their Commissioners to 
assist in giving the awards. 

I said that I was not prepared to discuss the question ; that I 
had hoped, after the apparent Disagreement, which on a former 
occasion had occurred, that we should not again be obliged to 
search for the interpretation of this Article of the Treaty, but that 
the same would have been left to the Commissioners ; that I 
must however observe to his Lordship, that as far as I had formed 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 289 

any opinion upon the subject, it differed from his ; that I had 
more than once intimated this opinion to him, as a motive to 
greater Dispatch in the Admiralty Courts ; that many of our peo- 
ple had been long attending here for a Decision of their Causes ; 
that according to the progress hitherto made in the Admiralty 
Courts, the cases within the provision of the Treaty, would not 
all be tried at the end of seven years from this time ; that the 
Claimants had waited with the more patience, because they have 
been led to believe that the Treaty ascertained a Period when the 
Commissioners would have authority to take up and decide their 
claims. That I did not recollect that the Commissioners had a 
Right to receive any Claim, the merits of which they could not 
immediately decide ; and that all Claims must be preferred within 
Eighteen months from the opening of the Commission. 

Besides the assignment which the Commissioners may award 
will enable the British Government to pursue the Captors, and to 
recover from them the money that may, under the award of the 
Commissioners, be advanced to the Claimants in their Behalf ; 
that after waiting four years, which was the situation of most of 
the Claimants, the inconvenience of longer delay should be born 
by those who could prevent it, and not by those who had no 
means of expediting the Proceedings of the Admiralty. I con- 
cluded the conversation by saying that, after conversing with our 
Commissioners, I would examine the Subject, preparatory to a 
future interview with his Lordship. 

You see how this Question bears upon that of the like character 
respecting the Debts ; and tho' I have not time to present it to 
you in the extent I wish, I think you will perceive that it is of 
such magnitude, that I must particularly desire to receive as early 
as possible the President's opinion respecting the Construction to 
which we shall adhere. 

Is it not probable that this Government, should they persist in 
the opinion intimated by Lord Grenville (which for plain reasons 
will be zealously and loudly supported by the whole body of 
Civilians), may be willing to agree that after a certain period, 
within which they will oblige their Courts to proceed witti expe- 
dition, the Commissioners shall proceed and decide all the Claims 
that shall have been brought before them, whether they shall have 
been decided by the Admiralty Courts or not ? 

VOL. II. — 19 



29O RUFUS KING. [1798 

This suggestion occurs while the pen is in my hand ; I have 
not considered it, nor do I know that it merits consideration ; 
my belief is that we may without risque, insist upon what we shall 
judge to be the fair and just interpretation of the Treaty. As I 
know nothing of the situation or amount of the Claims before the 
Commission at Philadelphia, I can form no estimate of the weight 
of those political considerations which may exist in that quarter, 
nor consequently of the influence they ought to have upon our 
proceedings here.* . . . 

The Bill will be soon brought before Parliament, imposing a 
2J per Cent Impost upon the Exports & Imports of Great Britain 
. . . to afford Convoys to the Trade . . . and to defray 
the expence thereof. Neutral nations who shall convoy their own 
Ships, ... by giving notice of their intention from time to 
time to afford such convoy, will be exempt from the payment of this 
Impost. . . . Should the System be adopted, will it not be much 
cheaper as well as in other respects wiser, for us to Convoy our 
own Trade than to pay the impost and sail under English Convoy. 

It is proper that I should hint to you that the long absence of 
Mr. Liston from Philadelphia during the President's residence 
there, and while Congress are in session, is not approved of, and 
by this opportunity he would be told so. . . . 

With perfect Respect and Esteem, 

Rufus King. 



G. Cabot to R. King. 

Brookline, March 21, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

Before I had the pleasure of reading your letter of the 14th 
Jany intelligence had been received from France respecting their 
Decrees against Neutrals. This last step was all that remained 
to be taken to fulfil the intentions formed by the Directory 2 years 
ago & of which I was informed by the D. de L. in July 1796. — 
The project seemed then to be too extravagant to be believed ; 
however I fully believed myself in its reality & accordingly men- 
tioned the affair to you soon afterward, but as you have never 

* This subject was renewed at a later period, and received at that time a full 
discussion and satisfactory settlement. — Ed. 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 291 

noticed it I suspect my letters (for I think there were two) 
which contained the information may have miscarried. I thought 
it proper soon afterward to acquaint Mr. Wolcott with the sub- 
stance of my conversation with the D., & Mr. Wolcott has since 
written to me that there was abundant evidence of the truth of 
what I had heard. It is impossible to compare all this with 
Monroe's representation & not feel indignant at his perfidy or 
chagrined at his folly. It is natural to suppose that the accumu- 
lated injuries of France toward this country & her undisguised 
resolution to establish her power over every nation that she can, 
would have excited a general resentment, and that the sense of 
common danger wou'd have united us in our measures of defence, 
but I fear it is otherwise. It appears to me that arming for de- 
fence is less popular now than it wou'd have been in June last ; 
the servile temper of our Representatives not only dishonor'd 
them but dispirited the people & at this moment it is not easy to 
conceive of any indignity to which they wou'd not submit & 
which a powerful party wou'd not palliate. You have doubtless 
seen thro' the whole contest that the British Treaty is made the 
pretext & you undoubtedly see the policy of this, & altho' there 
is no man of information who openly attacks any article of the 
Treaty yet still the ignorant are played upon & their prejudices 
kept alive ; & this expedient more than any other countenances 
their apathy to the outrages of France. 

It is a humiliating thought, & I reluctantly avow it, that our 
fate depends essentially upon the issue of the struggle between 
Britain & France. I think however that the future prosperity & 
security of Britain requires that the U. S. shou'd be kept out of 
the fangs of the great monster if possible & therefore I rely that 
British policy will do more for us than we are willing to do for 
ourselves — it wou'd indeed be extreme weakness in the British 
Cabinet to suffer the Govt, of this country to pass into the hands 
of France if they can possibly prevent it, for this country wou'd 
make weight in the scale sufficient to make the final preponder- 
ance on which ever side it shou'd be placed : the interest of both 
those nations will best comport with what is certainly our own & 
that is perfect Independence. 

I don't see how you can, nor do I think it advisable to try to 
use force of any kind to oblige the vessels to take convoys. I 



292 RUFUS KING. [T798 

hope however you will be successful in inducing them to accept 
and the Govt, to give protection. It is for the interest of all con- 
cerned that this shou'd be done & the idle desire of each to be 
first home shou'd be sacrificed to the common safety. I shall not 
be surprised however to learn that some intractable spirits break 
away & get captured. A few such ships wou'd greatly encourage 
the predatory efforts of the French and wou'd multiply our 
future losses. 

Congress are soon to decide on the kind & extent of defensive 
armament & it is possible that in the course of the season they 
may put the Frigates & some smaller Vessels out to protect our 
Coast — shou'd this happen there is some little risk of a rencounter 
with british arm'd ships. It is unfortunate for the tranquillity of 
nations that the Naval officers are obliged often to act without 
much deliberation & upon presumption instead of clear evidence ; 
they are, too, men of more nautical than political skill & their 
courage which is generous and ingenuous too often disdains 
caution, hence there may be danger of a misunderstanding if the 
Commanders of both sides are not perfectly well instructed with 
their rights and duties. 

The misfortunes of our friend Payne must disquiet Gore as it 
does me and all his friends, but while you sympathize with him 
you will not regret that the cursed land speculations did not de- 
bauch your prudence. 

Yours sincerely, 

G. C. 



G. Cabot to R. King. 

Brookline, 23d March, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

Since I wrote you on the 21st I have been favored with your 
letter of the 9th of Jany & as my letter is not gone I open the 
cover to add my acknowledgement of the great favor you have 
done in communicating the desponding & gloomy sentiments you 
feel. What (am I to understand) can have been done or medi- 
tated to be done by the French worse than I have for years 
imagined ? I must take your word as I already have the word of 
the Secy of State that there is a degree of atrocity beyond my 
conception. 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 293 

I am mortified at the stupidity of several of the European 
Cabinets who seem to have consented to be annihilated by & by, 
if they can only be allowed to enjoy at the present a temporary 
respite : but my whole reliance for effective force has been upon 
England. Doubtless if they yield, the whole civilized world falls 
a prey to France ; but is it possible the people of property & 
sense there at this late day shou'd hesitate to spend the last shil- 
ling & hazard the last life rather than submit to their merciless 
enemies ? If those people are so weak yet the Govt, is not, & if 
this is not afraid to do all it can it will do enough. I have never 
doubted the competency of G B to withstand all the power that 
France can bring against her, but as I have not thought that the 
efforts of the British were as great as they ought to be, or so well 
directed as they might be, I have seriously wished a thousand 
times that the French wou'd be mad enough to attempt an Inva- 
sion. This it appears to me wou'd be putting their cause at issue 
when according to all human calculations their defeat & destruc- 
tion wou'd be inevitable. All the friends of order & virtue 
throughout the world ought to be willing to trust the success of 
such a conflict because they can never expect a trial of force on 
better terms. 

The English nation is well constituted & well situated in every 
respect to make the defence required : she has too abundant 
means of men & money, skill & spirit & all these will be suffi- 
ciently exerted if an attempt is made to conquer her. But I have 
no idea that any such attempt is even thought of by the Directory 
of French Affairs : they will do wicked things but not weak ones. 
For myself I have attributed all the gasconading of France to in- 
ternal projects & necessities : — but be this as it may the English 
are contending for existence as a nation & therefore they ought to 
act worthy of the greatness of the Stake : their constitution must 
be preserved but the Parliament ought to clothe the Executive 
with all power for such a period as the danger may last, & the 
people shou'd be brought to acquiesce & support their system by 
constant & judicious publications & kept steady by a prudent use 
of force — a force however not to be overcome by Faction. I 
shou'd imagine that it would not escape the sagacity of the Eng- 
lish that all the Decrees against English Manufactures operate 
chiefly upon the Neutrals who buy them, & that instead of dimin- 



294 RUFUS KING. [1798 

ishing the demand upon the English artists, if many vessels are 
captured, the demand will be increased ; indeed it will be scarcely- 
possible to prevent the increase of English Industry if the Order 
of the Nation is pursued, for it is the only country in Europe 
where men will feel that the fruits of their labor will be secured 
to them & will not be wrested from them wantonly or unjustly. 
God bless you !

R. King to W. V. Murray. 

London, March 31, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . The French have in my opinion formed their plan, 
and will not depart from it, respecting our Country. They 
reckon (I hope and believe erroneously) upon many friends and 
Partizans among us ; and those who are in the secret do not hesi- 
tate to say, if they can gain " un point d'appui " in our Country, or 
upon its borders, that they can easily make a fourth of September 
at Philadelphia ! Foolish and extravagant as this opinion is, the 



I79 8 l LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 295 

extraordinary events and success of their Enterprises in Europe 
dispose the Directory to believe it. 

Being firmly convinced that they have made up their minds 
concerning both South and North America, I regret the humiliat- 
ing continuation of our friends at Paris. If I could hope even that 
there was any chance that we should adjust our affairs, or that 
France would be persuaded to abandon the projects that she has 
conceived, my earnest desire that our Country should not become 
a party in the war would lead me to applaud their patience ; but 
as I utterly despair of their success in this Respect, I think I see 
mischief in their remaining at Paris. Until they leave it there 
will be no adequate Preparations for the alternative, and the 
events which follow each other with such rapidity in Europe and 
which are to precede the Labor intended to be performed in 
America, make me fear that they may find us, as they lately found 

Switzerland, unprepared. 

Farewell yrs. very truly 

R. K. 

P. S. Be cautious of Genl. Eustace ; he is a very troublesome, 
but I do not think in any way a dangerous, character. He was 
sent out of England, and his conduct towards me was rude and 
ungentlemanlike. He began his acquaintance with me with the 
Tale that I perceive he has related to you, respecting Monroe, 
Fulton and others. By Monroe's Book I observe that Eustace was 
one of his addressers when he was replaced by General Pinckney ; 
Be assured that he is a more suitable acquaintance of Monroe than 
of you or me. He will be a Tale bearer between you and others, 
with whom he may seek an acquaintance, and is base enough for 
the office. In the end he will quarrel with you, either because you 
will not lend money, or countenance him in Pretensions that he 
will have no right to make. 

Mr. Pickering announces to Mr. King, in this letter, the 
receipt of despatches from the envoys in Paris to the 8th of 
January, the last declaring " that there existed no hope of 
their being officially received, or in any way accomplishing 
the object of their mission," and saying that they were de- 
sirous of doing what they could by remaining at their post 
to effect a reconciliation, and were to write a letter to Min- 



296 RUFUS KING. [1798 

ister of Foreign Affairs on the 10th January, requesting the 
Government to open negotiations with them or grant them 
passports. " Nevertheless it has been thought expedient to 
transmit them a letter of recall," which had been done. 



T. Pickering to R. King. 

"Department of State, April 2, 1798. 

" . . . A copy I now inclose to your care, with a copy for 
your own information, of its contents. It is very desirable that 
the Envoys should speedily receive the Letter of Recall, if they 
still remain in France. We hope and trust they are not there ; 
for their personal safety, or at least their liberty might be in- 
volved, while in the power of a Government which at its pleasure 
violates the Law of Nations and imprisons Ambassadors with 
as little ceremony as it arrests its own subjects. But to return 
to the main object of this letter. What ought we under existing cir- 
cumstances to propose to the British Government j or, if to avoid a 
present overture on our part be eligible, what offers are likely to be 
made by that Government, and, if made, what answer shall be given 
them ? 

" In the first place, threatening as is the aspect of our affairs with 
France, the President does not deem it expedient at this time to make 
any advances to Great Britain. The interest of her own commerce 
will on some occasions lead her to afford convoys to ours. In your 
Letter of the 14th of January you say you are assured this will be 
done in respect to our Spring Ships if you request it and Mr. Leston 
has lately shown me a Letter from Admiral Vandeput who commands 
the British Squadron on our Coasts by which it appears that the 
Admiral had anticipated the Minister s request to furnish Convoys to 
American vessels, having ordered his captains ' that if they should fall 
in with any ships or vessels of the United States coming from India 
(and not from the ports of any of his Majesty's enemies) or any ships 
or vessels coming from any of his Majesty's Dominions to see them in 
safety to the nearest port, protecting them in like mariner as if they 
were the ships of his Majesty's subjects? This request was 
voluntary on the part of the British Minister. All this is very 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 297 

convenient in our present defenceless condition, but how disgraceful to 
the United States if we co?itinue to depend on the protection of the 
British Navy without any reasonable exertion on our part to protect 
ourselves." * 

After discussing the conduct the United States should 
adopt in case of open hostilities between France and the 
United States, as to our relations with Great Britain, Mr. 
Pickering says : 

" You will observe that the President has withdrawn his restric- 
tion as to the arming of merchant vessels of the United States. 
. . . Many Merchants, I understand are beginning to arm ; 
but guns are scarce, and all the requisite articles are dearer here 
than in Europe. It will, therefore, be expedient for you to rec- 
ommend to the Masters and Agents of our vessels in Europe, 
who are inclined to arm, to do it there. It will also be well to 
encourage their bringing home Gunpowder, Saltpetre, Lead, 
Copper, sail cloth and hemp, and whatever else is necessary for 
equipping Vessels of war. The owners of Iron works are pre- 
paring to cast cannon, and in the course of a year there will be 
an ample supply." 

44 April 6. 

" There is still an evident opposition on one side of each House, to 
provide for any thing beyond our internal defences j and the exhibi- 
tion of the dispatches from the Envoys seems not to have produced the 
proper effect j for while the most inveterate opposers of the Govern- 
ment now acknowledge its sincerity and the propriety and even liber- 
ality of its measures to effectuate an accommodation with France, and 
add that she has given us abundant cause to declare war against her, 
they say it is not expedient, and therefore we must not attempt to pro- 
tect our commerce, because its defence will be a war measure and will 
issue in open war. But this spirit I hope will be changed* The 
dispatches from our Envoys, communicated on the 3d. instant in 
confidence, are ordered to be printed, are now in the press, 
and in two or three days will be published. The indignant 
voice of the people must irresistibly urge the adoption of efficient 
measures of defence by sea as well as by land."

298 KUFUS KING. [1798 

William Bingham to R. King. 

Philada., April 2, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, which con- 
veyed the pleasing Intelligence of a well founded Expectation 
that the British Government would afford, by Convoys, a Protec- 
tion to our Mercantile Navigation, as far as our own Shores. 
This management is very gratefull to our Citizens, & will in a 
great Measure circumvent the Views of the French Directory, in 
curtailing our Trade in British Merchandize, which will be 
exposed, in proportion to the Increase of Temptation for 
plundering it. 

Their late Decree on this Subject, combined with the refusal 
of their Executive to enter into friendly Negotiations with our 
Ministers, has made a very Serious Impression on the American 
Mind. 

The necessity of adopting an efficient System of Self Defence 
has become Strikingly evident. But the Extent & Character of 
this System will occasion warm and agitated Debates. 

The prevailing opinion is in favor of immediate energetic 
Measures, for the Protection of our Trade, that will not eventuate 
in open & declared War : for the convulsed State of Parties, the 
confined Resources of the Country & the Indisposition to increase 
them, as well as the Power of the Nation with whom the Contest 
would exist, have created an unusual Alarm, with respect to the 
Consequences that might result. 

Oar first vigorous Step will be the Equipment of public armed 
Vessels for the Protection of our Neutral Rights of Commerce, 
by convoying our Merchant Ships, laden with Articles, not 
Contraband by the Stipulations of Treaties, or the general Law 
of Nations, when bound to the Ports of a belligerent Power. In 
the mean Time, the President has revoked his Circular Letter to 
the Collectors which restrained the Armament of private Mer- 
chant Ships, & has adduced as a Reason for this vigorous & 
responsible Measure, the Change that has recently taken place in 
our political Situation. 

A call has been made in the House of Representatives for the 
Dispatches from our Commissioners in France, & I expect the 
President will comply with the request. These Communications 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 299 

will present a very minute Detail of their Proceedings, & I am 
inclined to believe Matter of a very confidential Nature. 

The Act of Parliament to carry the British Treaty into Effect, 
has excited a considerable Sensation, of no very friendly Ten- 
dency. By a rigid Adherence to the Letter of the Articles, 
Great Britain has departed from that System of Commercial 
Policy, which regulated her Conduct at a Period, antecedent to 
the Treaty, when our Passions & Animosities were mutually in- 
flamed towards each other. 

Our East India Trade is in a worse Predicament than formerly. 
We are precluded from carrying the Produce & Manufactures of 
her Possessions directly to Europe ; whereas the Vessels of all 
Neutral Powers in Amity with her are Subjected to no Restraint 
of this Kind. The additional Delay, & Expense of double 
Freight & Insurance, by the circuitous Route of the United 
States, present an insuperable Barrier, to the carrying Trade, 
betwixt the East India British Factories & Europe, in American 
Bottoms. 

The Equalization of the Tonnage Duties places us on a footing, 
relatively very unfavorable, as our Vessels are exposed to the 
Payment of double-light Money & other heavy Port Charges, 
from which their Shipping are exempt in our Harbors. 

But what is deemed very prejudicial & obnoxious is the Im- 
position of 10 <f> additional Customs on Cargoes imported into 
England, in American Vessels. This will be an absolute Prohibi- 
tion of our carrying Trade, employed in the Exports of a Variety 
of Articles, as the Competition will be too unfavorable. Indeed, 
whenever the British Customs are higher ad Valorem, than our 
Imports, a definite per Centage cannot be called a mutual Equiv- 
alent, so as to operate as a countervailing Duty ; there must be 
Inequality in favor of one Party & to the Injury of the other. In 
the Article of Tobacco, which is meant to be favored, the addi- 
tional Duty will tend to an entire Exclusion of our Tonnage in 
the Carriage, as it will amount in peaceable Times to 50 <f in the 
Value of the Freight. 

Besides, the British Manufactures, by their Nature, occupying 
little Space, employ but a Small Quantity of Tonnage in their 
Transportation, & therefore their Prohibition is an Evil, not 
extensively felt ; but the bulky Produce of this Country, destined 



300 RUFUS KING. [1798 

to England, as Remittances in Exchange for their Manufactures, 
requires an Immensity of Shipping : the Result therefore of the 
Arrangement will operate very unequally, by the difference in the 
relative Quantity of Tonnage that will be respectively excluded in 
Consequence of it. 

This is certainly a great Departure from the former System of 
G. Britain, which tended to attract into her Ports, by the most 
encouraging Overtures, American Vessels, who came into them 
to exchange their Produce & raw Materials for Manufactures. 
As the Treaty cannot exist, but for a Short Period after the War, 
it appears that Great Britain, by so rigidly carrying it into Effect, 
wished to establish a Fund of Pretensions ; so that whenever a 
new Negotiation shall take place, She may, by departing from 
the existing State of things, have the Appearance of relaxing & 
making a Concession. 

I find the Antifederalists disposed to take Advantage of all 
these Circumstances, in order to justify the Clamors they excited 
against the British Treaty, & I regret that any Opportunity has 
been afforded to them, considering the critical State of our Affairs 
at present. 

An American Vessel was yesterday despatched to Havre, by 
our Government, with a View of presenting an opportunity for 
our Commissioners to return. But I am rather disposed to 
believe they have already taken their Departure. 

With much sincerity & esteem &c. 

Wm. Bingham.

Gentlemen : 

// should be known to you that So. America is on the Eve of Rev- 
olution. England has prepared, and waits only for the Events that 
the march of the Erench ar?ny into Spain will effect, to send an ex- 
pedition to commence the Revolution which shall make South America 
independent. If it is not assured to become independent by E?igland y 
the work will be do?ie by France, who will introduce there her de- 
testable principles, divide it into small Republicks,put bad men at their 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 3OI 

head, and by these means facilitate her meditated enterprises against 
us. We have an immense Interest in the Event, as well as in the 
manner in which it shall be accomplished. England will, at Phila- 
delphia, ask the co-operation of the U. S. France has formed, and 
will not be diverted from, her Plan respectifig the U. S. Your 
mission must therefore fail, and if so, the sooner the better, thd* I 
understand that Humphries has received assurances that our Treaty 
ivith Spain will be carried into execution ; I do not believe it. France 
expects to find " un point d'appui " in Louisiana, and to begin from 
thence her operations against the United States ; the Treaty must 
then remain unexecuted j it will serve the same purpose as the obsolete 
Treaty respecting the Pays de Vaud, or the antient Disputes between 
Rome and Naples. 

The French System once established in So. America and the West 
Indies, we shall be in perpetual risqtie j on the other hand, the inde- 
pendence of So. America on wise principles, will put an end to the 
Old Colony and Com?nercial System, and with obvious Combinations 
presents Wealth and Security to the U. S., and a new balance among 
nations. This communication is most strictly confidential. . . .

Dear Sir : 

The same Doubts and Hesitations which restrain him from joining 
in measures of decision, would operate more powerfully if he was 
quite alone j and should their views of getting rid of you and General 
M., and of keeping him be effected, nothing would be gamed, for he 
never would conclude anything. Don't from hence infer that I think 
you should leave him behind ; the seism would be full of mischief. 
You must still endeavour to preserve him j it cannot be long before 
you hear from Philadelphia, and I think there will not afterwards 
be any hesitation. The Letter to you and Colleagues, you will com- 
municate to G. or not as you think advisable.

R. King to E. Gerry, Esq. 

London, April 2, 1798. 
My Dear Sir : 

I have had the pleasure to receive your Letter of the 10th 
ultimo, and have delayed writing to you in hope that I should be 
able to send you some late and important intelligence from Phila- 
delphia : but the prevalence of Easterly winds, which has I hope 
carried our Spring Ships nearly half way home, has kept back 
those on their Passage to Europe. 

My last Letters are to the beginning of February, when every- 
thing seemed at a stand, in expectation of receiving decisive 
information from your Commission. This state of the public 
mind is, in my apprehension, full of perplexity and of real Danger. 
I reason thus ; France has settled her Plan respecting America, 
and, as might be expected, it is a bold and comprehensive one, 
including both South and North America. She is not likely to 
be diverted from the attempt to carry this Plan into execution ; 
her preparatory measures are probably now in operation, and she 
only waits for certain Events, prior in their order, to commence 
with activity the Enterprise. The safety of America will depend 
upon her being prepared in Season to defeat the Projects of 
France ; so long as she expects success in negotiation, she will 
neglect those preparations, without which we may be exposed to, 
and experience, great National Calamity. 

I ask myself, but without obtaining a satisfactory answer, 
whether there remains one rational Hope of a favorable issue of 
your Mission ? The interest, independent of the earnest wishes, 
of our country to keep out of the war, rendered every effort for 
the purpose a sacred duty, and all the world must admit that our 
Envoys have persevered in their endeavours with unexampled 
patience, and under the most discouraging, as well as humiliating 
circumstances. But does not the public welfare, as well as the 
National character, prescribe limits to Submission ? and without 
trying the Question by those maxims which belong to the laws of 
Honor, the observance of which, however, can never be indifferent 
to nations, ought we from any motive to persist in asking what 
we have reason to believe, nay are convinced, will not be granted ; 
when by doing so, our Country may be made to doubt the exist- 
ence of Evils, that are daily maturing and which may burst upon 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 303 

us when we are not prepared to resist them ? Is not the main end 
of every Embassy the promotion and confirmation of the public 
Interest and Safety ? In the supposed state of your's does not a 
longer residence in France expose both to considerable risque 
and would not each be secured by the termination of your Mis- 
sion ? It does not necessarily result that war must follow your 
retreat from France ; on the contrary I am inclined to believe, 
that if war is avoided, and our Complaints treated with Justice, it 
will be by a Demonstration of that Preparation, Union and Firm- 
ness which shall undeceive the French Government and lead them 
to abandon their unjust Views and Pursuits respecting our 
Country. 

I have involuntarily been induced to write what is passing in 
my mind, but on casting my eye over it, I hesitate in sending it 
to you, lest it should have the air of an unbecoming interference 
in a Business committed to others, whose Judgment is in every 
respect better and safer than my own. Yet as I feel real Concern 
upon this Subject, and as the fate of Nation upon Nation that is 
fallen beneath the Power of France encreases my anxiety for the 
safety of our own, I have thought that I might safely rely upon 
your friendship for an apology for Reflections, so little solid, I 
fear, in your mind, but which are the unbiassed sentiments of 
mine. 

With the most sincere Esteem & attachment &c. &c. 
Your friend & faithful servant 

Rufus King.

R. King to Secretary of State. No. 71. 

London, April 6, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

Denmark is not safe* French Principles have many advocates 
there, and the Danish Government, like others connected with the 
German System temporizes, acts by expedients and is without 
vigour. The French Envoy at Copenhagen who is the same Per- 
son that read to Louis the Sixteenth his Sentence of Death, possesses 
great influence, and step by step increases it ; little things, and 
such as in themselves are of no importance, are, from time to 
time, conceded to the demands of France ; these prepare the way 
for, and are followed by, more important Requisitions, which in 
their turn will be complied with. France claims, and will attempt 
to impose, contributions upon every Nation with whom she has a 
connection : her armies exhaust the Countries in which they ob- 
tain a footing ; and her Diplomacy acts where her army does not 
penetrate. Thus Hamburgh and the other free cities, who since 
the beginning of the war have paid considerable Sums to France, 
have lately, and while their Deputies were at Rastadt negotiating 
Peace, been asked for Twelve Millions of Livres, which after 
seeking advice at Berlin and Copenhagen they agreed to pay. 
Denmark herself will soon be required to make a loan to France, 
and in my opinion will not refuse. Sweden is in no better condi- 
tion than Denmark ; her Government is liable to convulsions ; 
these under the present divisions among her people are not less 
extensive, nor more mild in their character than heretofore. The 
King is without experience, possesses the sovereign authority under 
a doubtful title, and by several acts of his reign has shewn a deference 

* Italics in cipher. 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 305 

for France inconsistent with a due respect for his own authority or 
for the indepe?idence of his Nation. The recent appointment of the 
Baron de Sthael as his Envoy in France is an act of this character. 
After the Directory had refused several Swedes who were proposed, 
they intonated a desire that the Baron de Sthael should be sent to 
them., and, to secure his appointment, caused it to be understood 
that they would receive no other person. 

It was from these and si?nilar proceedings in Denmark and 
Sweden that in my No. 69, I stated it to be my opinion that 
neither of these Poivers would resist with Decision and Energy 
the depredations that France has resolved to commit upon the 
Commerce of all neutral States. 

For several weeks past we have heard nothing of the army to be 
sent against Portugal. . . . The battle of Loupin decided the 
fate of the Swiss. . . . The Swiss Soldiers in common with 
the Peasantry have submitted to be disarmed by their Con- 
querors, . . . provisional Governments are everywhere 
established, and the deluded populace are promised ... to 
be constituted a Republic one and indivisible ! United the Swiss 
were invincible and free ; divided they have lost their Country 
and ingloriously submitted to become the Slaves of their Conquer- 
ors. What a lesson, as well as example, does their History furnish 
to America ! . . . A French Emissary,* who has lately pub- 
lished his Travels thro' the United States, in which he takes 
frequent occasion to contrast the zealous attachment to France of 
the People with the conduct of our Government, says, " That 
France wants only a footing upon the Continent to regulate the 
Destinies of the Citizens of the United States." With these false 
representations, confirmed not only by some of our own Citizens, 
but supported by the uniform success of the Directory in other 
Countries, ought we to be surprized at the opinion that they will 
be able to bring about a fourth of September at Philadelphia with 
as little difficulty as it was effected at Paris ? 

South A??ierica must soon pass through a Revolution : we have an 

immense i?iterest in the Event, as well as in the manner in which 

it shall be effected. In a former letter I have co??imunicated to you 

the views and intentions of England, who will not provoke the revolt 

in case Spain shall be able to save herself from a Revolution, and 

* Volney.

keep the French out of Portugal, and t/10' there seems little proba- 
bility that this will be the case, England since the arrival of Miranda 
here, but without his knowledge, has informed Spain that she will not 
countenance or assist the Spanish Colonies in becoming independent 
but that she will join her in resisting the endeavours of others to 
accomplish it, provided that Spain will oppose the views of France 
against her own Dominions and those of Portugal. At the same 
time that this communication has been made to Spain, an Expedition 
has been prepared, and the correspondent arrangements at Trinidad 
have been ordered, for the purpose of beginning the Revolution of 
So. America j in this Event, as I have before intimated to you, Eng- 
land will at Philadelphia open herself to, and ask the cooperation of, the 
United States. Miranda who is impatient with the delays that he 
experiences, as well as ignorant of the provisional Decisions of this 
Cabinet, has concluded to send his friend and associate Mr. Caro to 
Philadelphia with a letter for the President, and I have given him a 
letter to identify and introduce him to you. Conjecturing the inten- 
tions of France, and knowing with precision those of England, we 
shall be better able in season to consider and regulate the conduct that 
it shall be proper for us to pursue* 

The disaffection has become so general in Ireland that on the 
30th ultimo, a Rebellion was declared to exist and the whole 
country is put under Martial Law. The preparations for Invasion 
are continued and will, it is believed, be attempted in Ireland ; 
tho' from the number, distribution and superiority of the British 
Fleet, it is inconceivable how it can succeed. Ireland is full of 
Troops, and without the protection of the Navy, will be able to 
defend itself from Invasion, if the Irish Soldiers, who form a con- 
siderable portion of the Army, can be depended on. . . . 

The Court of Appeals have reversed the decree of the High 
Court of Admiralty which condemned the arms claimed by Gen- 
eral Allen ; have decreed that the arms be delivered to the 
General on Bail, and that he give further Proof respecting the 
purchase of them, particularly respecting the 100,000 Livres, 
which the Contract states to have been paid by him to the French 
Government. . . .

which the annexed is a copy. I cannot express to you the dis- 
gust and indignation with which I have read it : tho' it only con- 
firms my opinion, long since formed, that France had settled and

My Dear Sir : 

A few days ago we received an answer from the Minister of 

Foreign Affairs to a long letter we some days ago addressed to 

him ; towards the end of it is the following paragraph : " C'est 

done uniquement dans la vue d'applanir la voie des discussions

que le soussigne" est entre dans les Developpements qui precedent. 
C'est dans lameme vue qu'il declare aux Commissaires et Envoyes

concevoir sur eux, le Directoire Executif est dispose a traiterazw 
celui d'eux trots, dont les opinions, presumees plus impartiales, 
promettent, dans le cours des explications, plus de cette confiance 
reciproque qui est indispensable." 

We shall reply to the whole letter and this part in particular j 
we shall say that being appointed from the three great portions of 
America, the interests of each part of the United States might be par- 
ticularly attended to, neither of us think it proper voluntarily to quit 
the Duty imposed upon him by his Country, nor to venture to take him- 
self alone the burthen of a Negotiation committed not to one but to 
three. Notwithstanding we all agree in this Sentiment, I have rea- 
son to think Mr. Gerry means to stay. General Marshall and my- 
self will be ordered away but, * as my daughter is exceedingly ill 
and her physicians have directed that, as soon as she is able to 
travel, she may be removed to the South of France, it is probable 
that Mrs. Pinckney, my Daughter and myself may be permitted to 
take that route, in which case I shall stay some weeks at Nismes, 
thence go to Bagneres to drink the water and then proceed to 
Bordeaux and embark from thence for America. 

With great Respect and Esteem, 

Charles Cotesworth Pinckney.

A letter that I have this minute reed, from Paris confirms my 
Opinion, long since formed, that France had settled and would 
not be diverted from her Plan respecting America. Is it not sot- 
tish, as well as incredible, that we should any longer hope even 
for success from our Mission ? After all the Humiliation that our 
Envoys have suffered, after the unceasing intrigues to divide 
them, and thereby to divide us, after having humbly waited more 
than six months in the Halls and Antechambers of the Direc-

Renegado retained in the service of the Minister, two of them (P

lieve that he will become a converted Dupe) will be allowed to

be heard in Excuse of our Errors and in mitigation of our Punish-

affairs. 

The session has been a disagreeable one & hitherto almost 
wholly unproductive. The house is almost exactly divided — 
there are 52 determined and rancorous Jacobins, and 54 who pro- 
fess attachment to the government, or in other words, confidence 
in the Executive ; of them, however, four are of that particular 
cast of character, whimsical, kinkish & unaccomodating, which 
renders it impossible 10 calcinate, with any degree of certainty 
on the success of any measure dependent on their votes ; while 
their adversaries, under the controul of the Genevese,* are a well 
organized & disciplined Corps, never going astray, or doing right 
even by mistake.

The Speaker has become violently federal, for New Jersey not- 
withstanding every effort to seduce her re?nains firm and united. 
The Senate since I first knew it has considerably improved. 
Governor Bradford from age, or other causes had become discon- 
tented & petulant. Mr. Green, except that he obeyed the in- 
structions of the State of R. I. in moving & advocating a repeal 
of the Stamp Act, in which I am sure he sacrificed at the shrine 
of popularity, has never deviated from a right line. Chipman, 
from Vermont, the successor of Tichenor, or rather, as you knew 
the Senate, of old Robinson, is firm, & indeed, intelligent. 
Hobart, who replaces Burr, you know. (By the way it is said 
that Burr is irretrievably ruined by Speculation.) Lawrance is as 
you knew him so-so. Generally right — sometimes egregiously 
wrong. Stockton from New Jersey ranks high among the able 
& virtuous men of our Country. Clayton, in the room of Vining, 
is a worthy & respectable man after whom there is no necessity, on 
important questions, of sending the door-keeper. Lloyd is worth a 
thousand of his Predecessor. Henry — he is a sure shot, and 
Hunter, in the room of B — rarely, now, votes with the disor- 
ganizes. 

The President, under circumstances the most trying, and dis- 
couraging, has acted, from the time of his inauguration speech, 
a noble part. No instances of impatience, no whining croaking 
complaints, regardless of the infamous attacks that have been 
made on his character, he has exhibited a manly fortitude & dig- 
nified composure. His conduct has, indeed, increased the con- 
fidence of the friends of the government, and I am very much 
mistaken if it has not commanded the respect of his adversaries. 

You will readily believe that the situation of our Vice-President 
cannot be a very pleasant one. More than once he has heard, in 
debates, and in terms which could not be mistaken, Philipics pro- 
nounced against the author of the letter to Mazzei. He is, I 
have no doubt, the very life and soul of the opposition. 

You will have seen the President's Message in which he com- 
municated to the Legislature the result of the mission to France. 
Directly the reverse, of what might reasonably have been ex- 
pected, was the effect. Anderson soon moved a resolution, in the 
Senate, to call on the President for his instructions to the En- 
voys & for their communications to him. About this time it was 



312 RUFUS KING. [1798 

whispered that those dispatches contained evidence, not very- 
honorable to the purity of french republicans. The motion of 
course was permitted to sleep. In the meantime impressions were 
attempted to be made, and not altogether without success un- 
favorable to the Government. It was said that the whole policy 
of the Executive, from the commencement of the french revolu- 
tion, had been unfriendly to, & intended to produce a rupture 
with, that power ; that neither the instructions given, nor the 
agents employed were intended to produce an amicable adjust- 
ment, and in short, that the President dared not expose his con- 
duct to the public. It was added, that the measures recommended 
were warlike, and might impose a necessity of declaring war, of 
which the Legislature was exclusively the Judge, and as such en- 
titled to all the means of forming a correct opinion. This reason- 
ing incessantly enforced, was not without effect, and Mr. Allen 
was induced, from a conviction of the impossibility of taking any 
effective measures while the existing temper prevailed, of moving 
an address for the papers. The President determined as was 
foreseen he would determine, and the papers were laid before 
Congress. They are undoubtedly forwarded to you. On the first 
view the whole faction was overwhelmed with confusion. The 
leaders, in both houses, declared a perfect confidence in the in- 
tegrity & wisdom of the President, and a conviction of the profli- 
gacy of their former friends the french. Many of our friends 
believed them sincere and expected an Union of Councils and 
Exertions. But already their tune is changed, & they will en- 
deavor to fortify their supporters against the impression. They 
say that Talleyrand is a very corrupt & unprincipled Scoundrel, a 
friend of Royalty & that this conduct might naturally be expected 
from the Company he kept in this Country. That, however there 
is no evidence that he acted by the orders of his Government. 
Some go further & say that all we can justly complain of, is, the 
non-reception of our Envoys, which might justly have been ex- 
pected from France for the injuries she had received from our 
Government. 

There were certainly strong objections against publishing the 
communication & which would have been conclusive, if with- 
holding the publication, could have prevented its publicity. But 
the substance was known before the order of the Senate for that 
purpose. The mischief was, therefore, done, and the only ques- 



179^] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 313 

tion was, whether we should avail ourselves of the opportunity- 
afforded us of acquiring confidence in the Government and Union 
among the people. The effects as they respect both these objects 
will, I believe, be considerable. 

The Senate has this day passed a bill authorizing the President 
to procure 16 ships of 22 Gunnseach to be employed as Convoys. 
There is also before the house a bill for the establishment of a 
foundery. The measures which I hope will take place are the 
passage of those two bills ; the procuring arms, ammunition & 
cannon. A fortification of our ports, raising immediately a 
corps of artillerists & another of cavalry, an authority to raise 
30,000 men to be added to the Military establishment & to accept 
the tender of voluntary Corps. (This last a measure of security 
to the great towns principally.) To authorise the capture of any 
french armed Vessels which shall attack any of ours, & all such 
as shall be found within 20 leagues of our coasts — A legislative 
declaration that all treaties with france are become void — A com- 
prehensive alien act, and revenue sufft. to sustain the necessary 
expenditure, and preserve the public credit. If something like 
this cannot be done, I shall not deem the public safety pro- 
vided for. 

Chancellor Livingston has started in the election ground in 
New York against Mr. Jay, but I hope without any prospect of 
success. — In Massachusetts Sumner is reelected by an immense 
majority. 

The Bubble of speculation is burst, which I deem a very happy 

circumstance, tho' vast numbers and among them many worthy 

people are involved in ruin by it. — Our old friend Mr. Morris has 

been sometime in gaol. Nicholson is confined in his own house — 

Wilson is ruined. . . .

My Dear Sir :

Genl. James Lloyd is Mr. Henry's Successor in the Senate, & 
inferior to no Man in Federalism & real Love to his Country. 
He is a Gentleman of good Talents, amiable & of unexceptional 
Character, & by our Friends deemed a great Acquisition. It 
was said that our Friend Henry expressed himself shortly after 
his Appointment as Governor, too warmly in Favor of Mr. Jef- 
ferson, which injured Him much with the Federalists in the 
Legislature of Maryland, & it was supposed prevented his Brother- 
in-Law Mr. Winder from succeeding Him, as Genl. Lloyd had 
but one vote more than Him. 

In a Letter which I wrote to Mr. Hemsley last Deer., I re- 
quested Him to inform You, that I had received a Letter from 
the President of the Senate of Maryland, saying that You had 
rendered Yourself highly popular in our State, by your friendly 
& useful Attention to our Bank Stock, & had given the Legisla- 
ture the highest Satisfaction ; this is the present Reward You 
must accept from the State for the Services You have rendered 
Her, the Time may come when You will receive the highest 
Retribution. 

I fear poor Murray has an unpleasant Time, you can best tell 
what the Dutchmen will do with Him. 

I hope our Commissioners are not now in France : the Publica- 
tion of their Dispatches I flatter Myself has done much Good to 
our Country, it must sink the Jacobins & tend much to unite Us ; 
I am told the Opposition Party of our House have lately had a 
Caucus, at which They agreed upon strong internal defensive 
Measures ; when We get upon Vessels of War for the protection 
of our Commerce I fear They will give Way. A Bill has just 
come to Us from the Senate for fitting out fourteen armed Vessels 
not exceeding 22 Guns ; the Antis in our House count upon 51 on 
their Side, We 55, so that if the Federal Members would all 
attend & be as firm & united as the Opposition, the Power is 
with Us ; I flatter Myself that many of the Opposition will be 
constrained to do right, as the People at large will not longer 
endure the Injuries committed on Them by the infamous & 
abandoned Men who now govern France. . . .

General Pinckney's last Letter, I have reason to apprehend that

to entreat you to take England in your way and give me the

I have received your Letter of the 28th ulto. by Mrs. Mount 

Florence, and the next day had an opportunity of forwarding the 

enclosed Letters for the President and Mrs. Gerry by a ship that 

was on the point of sailing for Boston. 



316 RUFUS KING. [1798 

In the Letters that I have lately written, you will perceive that I 
long since despaired of Success for the Mission to France, be- 
cause I believed that the Directory had settled a Plan concerning 
America, from which they wld. not be diverted, and which was 
incompatible with our independent Rights and just Pretensions ; 
your Last Letter confirms my opinions. How you were to be 
withdrawn from the Stage, I could only conjecture ; but I 
never doubted, if the Directory were to regulate your exit, that 
it would be done with a reference to their own views, and not to 
the propriety that belongs to the proceeding or to the Justice 
due to our Country. They could not, in my apprehension have 
devised a more insidious and more mischievous Plan than that 
which they have chosen. It is impossible to believe for a 
moment that, with a view to a negotiation, they can really prefer 
one to another of our Envoys ; when measures are in view, per- 
sonal attachments and aversions do not impede their accomplish- 
ment. The proposal to send away two and retain one of you is 
treacherous, and if acceded to, may be injurious ; but in my belief, 
will be disgusting and universally condemned by our Country. 

I see this subject in so strong and unclouded a light, that 
I avail myself of the authority of a long friendship to entreat you 
to distrust your own mind, if it has suggested a doubt even con- 
cerning the only course that remains for you to adopt. You 
must either all go, or all stay. There is a plain line of propriety 
and duty in this alternative, any other course may ensnare us. I 
have not the smallest knowledge of our Country, and will forever, 
hereafter, disclaim every Pretension to judge beforehand of its 
opinion, if the President does not with the united will and appro- 
bation of his Constituents immediately recall the individual who, 
separating from his Colleagues, shall consent to remain at Paris 
after they, without cause, shall have been sent away. 

The freedom of this Letter would require an apology, did it 
not proceed from a pure zeal for the Welfare and Honor of our 
Country, and was I not convinced that it is the office as well as 
the Right of Friendship to avoid reserve upon Subjects in which 
the reputation and happiness of our friends and Country may be 
deeply affected. 

With the most sincere Esteem and attachment &c.

Dear Sir : 

I yesterday received a letter from General Pinckney, a copy of 
which is annexed, confirming my apprehension of an open seism 
in the Mission, and of Mr. Gerry's determination to separate from 
his Colleagues. Mr. Talleyrand's Letter to the Envoys ought to 
have removed every doubt respecting the intentions of the Direc- 
tory and must open the eyes of all who are not obstinately blind to 
the views of France concerning our Country. I can entertain no 
doubt of the course that the President will adopt on this extra- 
ordinary occasion ; I shall send this with a Dispatch to Ports- 
mouth this evening. . . .

G. Cabot to R. King. 

Brookline, April 16, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . Yesterday I received a paper containing the proceed- 
ings of our Envoys at Paris ; they exhibit a degree of depravity 
in the French Govt, which very few people can believe. I owe 
to you & to Mr. Pickering the confession that the Directorial 
Conduct is much more gross than I apprehended, but to myself I 
owe the declaration that they can not possibly be more wicked 
than I supposed them. I wish it were possible for me to give 
you any correct opinion of the effect which these communica- 
tions will produce on the temper & spirit of our Country — you 
have concluded that they will silence the clamours of Jacobinism 
& unite all Parties ; doubtless they ought to do this & to excite 
a sentiment of universal indignation & resentment which if prop- 
erly guided wou'd secure us against every essential danger ; but 
I dare not pronounce that such good fruits will be reaped. I

have great fear as well as some hopes. It is natural that we 
shou'd wish to avoid a contest (if possible) where so much is to 
be suffer'd & everything endanger'd — & it is not unnatural that 
our people shou'd shut their eyes to injuries rather than acknowl- 
edge that they see them & thus admit the indispensable obligation 
to repel the?n, ox provide to repel them. I have endeavored to con- 
vince those I meet that an avowed determination of desperate 
resistance wou'd secure us in any event & if we are united wou'd 
prevent an attack, but there is an extreme reluctance to do any- 
thing which may imply that we are in danger of meeting those 
terrible calamities which French Ambition is inflicting on other 
Nations. . . . 

Your affectte. friend

T. Sedgwick to R. King. 

Philadelphia, May i, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . The effects of the publication of the instructions to 
our Envoys to france, and their dispatches to the Executive on 
the people, as far as my information extends, has been prodigious. 
It is, however, said that the city of New York is an exception to 
the general state of the public mind in the eastern district of this 
Country : and that it is probable that Edward Livingston is 
reelected against our Friend Philip Livingston, who was opposed 
to him. There never has been, probably in the United States an 
election so actively nor so acrimoniously contested as the last in 
your State. We are consoled by the concurring information, 
which we received from every quarter, that Mr. Jay has suc- 
ceeded by a great majority. 

The depredations on our commerce and the numerous failures 
which have resulted from speculation and the spirit which 
created and accompanied it, unfortunately, pervaded more gener- 
ally than you can well imagine the mass of our people, and have 
created much embarrassment, and probably more in New Eng- 
land than elsewhere, because there the spirit was most ardent, 
and the means most general. I was yesterday informed that 400 
actions were entered at the last court of common pleas in Berk- 



l^gS] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 319 

shire, about three times the usual number at the corresponding 
terms. This is generally the case in New England. It is unfor- 
tunate that this should be the case at this time, yet I have no 
doubt, that the people will, in that part of the United States, if 
the government is faithful, act with spirit & effectual decision. 

The leaders of the opposition, and indeed the whole corps, 
were astonished & confounded at the evidence exhibited at once 
of the purity of the Executive, and the profligacy of their be- 
loved friends the french, and they have made proportional exer- 
tions to defeat the natural effects. Letters from several members 
of the house, containing many false statements, in point of fact, 
and more false reasoning, have got into the hands of the friends 
of Government & been published. It is no longer wonderful 
that the people thus deceived & misled have been in opposition 
to the measures of the government — a government which they 
have been taught to believe was perfidious in its conduct to other 
nations & insidious, indeed traitorous, to its constituents. 

Till this morning I thought that Letters by the packet might 
have been received at the post office to-morrow, but I am in- 
formed that this is the last day and I have indulged myself in 
this scrawl to you while waiting for a committee which is directed 
to report an alien bill. 

I am yours sincerely

R. King to American Students in the University of 

Edinburgh. 

London, May 2, 1798. 
Gentlemen : 

I have had the honor to receive a letter without signature, but 
which purports to be from the American Students at the Univer- 
sity of Edinburgh, inclosing sundry papers from, and asking my 
interference in behalf of, a number of Americans taken in arms 
and confined as Prisoners of war in Scotland. 

Having heretofore without success applied to the British Gov- 
ernment for the discharge of several American Citizens who had 
been taken in French Privateers, I have no reason to believe that 
^ Repetition of the like application in behalf of those, in whose 



320 RUFUS KING. \M9% 

favor you kindly take an interest, would receive a different an- 
swer ; more especially as the motives which are alleged to have 
engaged the latter in the Privateering Service of France are no^ 
more justifiable than those which influenced the former. It 
would give me much satisfaction to comply with any Request 
that you should approve or recommend, but you must be sensible, 
that as Great Britain has a perfect Right to treat as prisoners of 
war all Persons taken in arms against her, we can have no such 
Right to demand xht release of our fellow Citizens, who from any 
motive, may have changed their neutral for an enemy character. 

Having been denied when we asked their Release as a Favor, 
we ought not to expose ourselves to a second Refusal. 
With Sentiments of Esteem & Regard &c. &c

T. Pickering to R. King. No. 71. 

Department of State, May 3, 1798. 
ear Sir : 

It is probable that France will continue her actual hostilities 
against the commerce of the United States, without a formal 
declaration of war, and new pretences may be advanced for 
decrees that will embrace the remnant of our vessels not compre- 
hended in former Decrees. Of such new Decrees or of plans 
aimed against our Commerce generally, or of open war, you are 
likely to gain the earliest information ; and the immense import- 
ance of transmitting it speedily to the American Government is 
apparent. It is therefore the desire of the President that in the 
two former cases at your discretion, and in case of open war 
without fail, you would dispatch a fast sailing vessel with the in- 
telligence to the nearest port she can make in the United States, 
from whence the person charged with your dispatches must send 
them forward in the most expeditious manner to the seat of 
Government. . . . We have authentic intelligence from New 
Orleans that the Posts of Walnut Hills and Natchez have been 
evacuated and that our Troops are in possession. A Letter from 
Mr. Ellicott advises me that he was packing up his instruments 
and baggage to move down to the 31st Degree of Latitude, ex-

London, May 11, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . Tho' Mr. Gerry joined his Colleagues in the Declara- 
tion to the French Government, that no one of them was author- 
ized to take upon himself a negotiation confided to them all, it is 
the opinion of Major Rutledge, who arrived here a few days since 
from Paris, as well as of others, that a public reception will be 
offered to Mr. Gerry, and that every effort will be employed to 
amuse him and to mock his Country with the parade of an insidi- 
ous negotiation. I cannot refrain from expressing a hope that this 
humiliating scene is soon to close and that instructions are now 
on their way to Mr. Gerry to follow his Colleagues, from whom 
his own honor, and, what is more, the public welfare forbid that 
he should ever have separated. 

. . . A very important event has passed at Vienna. Berna- 
dotte, the French Ambassador at Vienna has withdrawn from 
that City in consequence of a popular movement of which you 
will see the accounts in all the Papers. We as yet know nothing 
of the Resolution of the Directory on this subject. . . . The 
Emperor is strong in Italy, and his military establishment is much 
improved since the Peace. Both he and the King of Prussia are 
said now to see more clearly than heretofore the Dangers with 
which they are threatened. But whether they can suppress the 
little Interests and miserable Jealousies that France keeps alive 
and excites between them ; whether they are capable of uniting 
upon one great, disinterested but all important idea, is more than 
my limited information permits me to determine. Without a 
coalition against France, and that a speedy one, all that is South

of the Baltic must be revolutionized and fall beneath the Power 
of France. . . . 

Ireland is in a wretched state ; martial law prevails throughout 
the country, and every day supplies new proofs of the intimate 
connection that subsists between the Chiefs of the Malcontents 
and the Directory. . . . Several persons have been taken up 
and confined ; . . . the Government are said to have ob- 
tained proofs of a Conspiracy formed by some of the Members of 
the Corresponding Societies to assist the French in case of a 
descent, to set fire to London. . . . The trial of O'Connor 
and the other Persons indicted for Treason will come on the week 
after next ; after which the Government will publish the Proofs 
of the Conspiracy. 

At a late meeting of the Whig Club, Mr. Fox gave us a Toast 
" The Sovereignty of the People " ; and the King on Wednesday 
last struck his name out of the List of Privy Councillors. ... 

With perfect Esteem & Respect &c. 

Rufus King. 



R. King to Col. Hamilton. 

London, May 12, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

It will not surprise you that an open seism accompanied by 
mutual reproaches took place between our Envoys before they 
separated. Mr. Gerry remains at Paris and there is a strong 
opinion that great pains will be taken to persuade him to consent 
to a public reception in order to deceive and mock his Country 
with overtures of an insidious negotiation. Marshall and Pinckney 
left Paris about the middle of April ; the former I hope is on his 
passage to Philadelphia, the latter will embark early in June. 

You will be at no loss to understand this state of things. 
Nothing but vigour and energy will save our Country. Unanimity 
cannot be expected. Moderation and forbearance with all the 
virtues that meekly follow in their train have been faithfully 
employed and without success. It is now time, and the wretched 
Pictures exhibited by the Countries where France has introduced 
her detestable Principles, should admonish us to give up half-way 
measures with half-way men ; they do not belong to the Times in 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 323 

which we live. The people of America will support their Govern- 
ment, if that Government acts with decision, if it appeals to the 
Pride, the Patriotism, and the Honor of the Nation ! But if it 
temporises, if it wastes itself in words, if it stops short of the 
only course that remains for its adoption, consistently with the 
public Safety, the next Election will convulse the Country, and 
may, as the Directory intend and expect it shall, give the Govern- 
ment to those who will deliver it up to the same ruin that con- 
tinues to desolate Europe. 

There is a slight appearance that things are mending upon the 
Continent ; but little interests, little jealousies and little men, 
whose united influence is opposed to the only effectual Remedy 
for the mischief, forbid us to expect it until the Evil has spread 
still wider : for so wretched are the Governments on the Con- 
tinent, not yet subverted, that the best hope is from the People 
who are cured when the Fire has passed over them. 

I received a short Letter from you a few days since without 
date, which gave me great satisfaction, as it authorized the hope 
that the public opinion was sounder than that of its Representa- 
tives. War will encrease the public Taxes ; these are unpleasant 
Subjects for meditation ; the Passions must be attended to ; they 
must have an object, there is a great one. I can't explain myself. 
I have had no occasion for reserve with the Secretary of State, 

because I write to him in cipher. 

Yours &c. 

R. K. 



R. King to the Right Honble. the Lord Chancellor, &c. 

Great Cumberland Place, June 1, 1798. 
My Lord : 

I have been informed, and in a way that leaves no doubt of the 
fact, that Mr. Mollison, in behalf of the family of Russell, has 
lately received from the Exchequer, full compensation for the 
losses of that family in Maryland, and that no further opposition 
will be made in their behalf against the transfer of the Bank Stock, 
of which Russell with others were the Trustees. 

Having so often troubled your Lordship on this subject, I am 
unwilling to say a word more respecting it, being persuaded that 



324 RUFUS KING. [i79& 

no unnecessary delay will retard its Settlement : but as I supposed 
that the Claim of the Russell family has been the only impediment 
to be removed, and as that no longer exists, I take the liberty to 
express to your Lordship my earnest desire to be able to inform 
the State of Maryland what is likely to be the result of their ap- 
plication, and I should be very particularly obliged to your Lord- 
ship, to enable me to give this information by the Packet that sails 
in the course of next week. 

With perfect Consideration & respect &c.

J. A. Smith to R. King. 

Dublin, June i, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

The person above all others, to whom I ought to have written is 
yourself, for it is to the respect which was paid to your name, that 
I am indebted for all the attention whh. I have received since my 
arrival in this country. I will not attempt to apologise for that 
which cannot be excused, and will only declare that although I 
have not been attentive in expressing them, I have never ceased to 
feel all those sentiments of gratitude so justly due to the politeness 
I experienced from you. The fact is, I have been a thousand 
times on the point of writing to you, but was loth to trouble you 
with a letter without giving you some account of the situation of 
this country, the Truth of which might have been depended upon. 
But such is the curious manner in which things are conducted in 
Ireland, and such is the chaos of misrepresentation, that I have 
been always kept in a state of uncertainty, and had only the satis- 
faction of finding that others whose penetration was far superior 
to my own were in the same predicament as myself. 

The history of most countries is stained with crimes, but that of 
Ireland, more particularly, presents a picture of violence and 
wrongheadedness, both on the part of the governors and governed. 
The administration of affairs has generally been committed to a 
set of men who have seldom hesitated to sacrifice the inter- 
ests of the country to their own ; while the people, in many parts 
extremely wretched, and consequently idle and addicted to 
drunkenness, have been forced by the oppression of the middle 



1 7 98 J LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 325 

men, or squirearchy, as it is termed, to acts of outrage often at- 
tended with robbery and murder. Hence the origin of the White 
Boys, the Steel Boys, the Oak Boys, &c. At length arose the 
Volunteer associations, who at first conducted themselves with 
the greatest propriety, and obliged England to acknowledge the 
Independency of the Irish Parliament ; but soon they were seen 
attempting to overawe and intimidate that very Parliament, the 
freedom of whose deliberations it had been their great object to 
establish. 

Things remained after this for some years in a state of quiet, 
during which period the country rapidly improved. It was soon, 
however, discovered that the Parliament was not more indepen- 
dent from the acknowledgement which had been made, but that 
by far the majority were named by the Peers and wealthy com- 
moners in the interest of the Crown. In a word that the corrup- 
tion which had been introduced into this country for the purposes 
of Government had increased instead of diminishing. A desire 
of reform manifested itself in the North, under which expression 
and catholic emancipation were classed all the grievances that still 
remained to be redressed. The Jealousies arising from a differ- 
ence of religion, and which had been the cause of so much mis- 
chief, were laid aside and a society was formed of " United 
Irishmen," whose views at first, I believe, were moderate and con- 
stitutional. Conciliation might then have been used with advan- 
tage. But perceiving that Govt, treated their petitions with 
contempt they were induced at length to turn their thoughts to 
France. It was at this moment that their most respectable mem- 
bers quitted them, and they were left to leaders for the greatest 
part, equally without Consideration or Principle. The military 
were now let loose upon them, and after a great deal of wanton 
cruelty and devastation, of which the most wretched were gener- 
ally the victims, the North was put down, but remained in a state 
of sullen tranquillity. In the meantime the contagion was com- 
municated to the South, where it found infinitely more bigotry 
and misery to work upon. The wretched inhabitants, suffering 
under the violent measures of Govt., were easily prevailed upon by 
persons, probably in the interest of France, and determined to go 
to all lengths, that it would be a meritorious thing to overturn the 
Government ; and when they were told that they should be free 



326 RUFUS KING. [l79& 

from Tythes and have land for nothing, there was no withstand- 
ing the temptation. It was now thought proper to permit the 
Troops to live at free quarters, and the most dreadful Cruelties 
were practised to enforce confessions. 

The advocates of revolution thought this the moment of rising, 
and, we are told, that a conspiracy was discovered having for its 
object a general Insurrection and Massacre in the City of Dublin, 
as well as in the country around. How far this is true I am in- 
capable of judging, but this I am willing to believe that a revolution 
in this country would be attended with circumstances the most 
atrocious. In this state of anxiety we remained until Thursday 
Morning, the 21st May, when the City of Dublin was thrown into 
the greatest consternation by the information that the mails had 
been stopped and that a partial Insurrection had taken place in 
the County Kildare. You will have read in the papers of the 
Massacre of the Troops in the Barracks at Prosperous, of the 

attack on the gaol at and of the cruelties committed by the 

Insurgents at Hacketstown. Dunsaghlin Goreys &c, and you will 
be equally shocked on the other hand at reading the accounts of the 
different attacks made upon these wretches at Tara Hill, &c, where 
three or four hundred have been put to death at a time, with the 
loss of six or eight men. A company of Yeomanry Horse among 
whom was the young Earl of Ormond proceeded to Dunboyne 
on an information that the Insurgents had appeared there. They 
found, I am told, fifteen persons sitting in the churchyard, whom 
they immediately put to death ; they then proceeded some dis- 
tance on the road, and finding others whose appearance displeased 
them, they treated them in the same summary manner. In short 
nothing can be more shocking, and in many instances more absurd, 
than the scenes that are passing in this country. Notwithstanding 
the great force under the command of Govt., the communication 
with the South was interrupted for six days, and was at length 
opened by Sir J. Duff, who marched from Limerick with three or 
four hundred men, and is supposed to have put to death a great 
body of those wretches to which Genl. Dundas had granted a cap- 
itulation. The City of Dublin in the meantime presented a scene 
of indecent and ridiculous confusion, which left little doubt that 
if a small body of French troops had landed, Ireland would have 
been lost. People were seen parading the street in the middle of 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 327 

the day with pistols in each hand ; yeomanry galloping backwards 
and forwards ; numbers of persons taken up, flogged and other- 
wise tortured to force confessions ; dead bodies exposed in the 
Castle yard and crowds flocking to gratify their curiosity, and 
observing by what stroke in " the sword exercise " they had been 
killed. Several persons hanging at the lamp posts, and dreadful 
reports that the Catholics had determined to murder all the prot- 
estants, and that a great many servants had purchased arsenic 
for the purpose of poisoning their masters. In short, my dear Sir, 
it would be difficult to convey to you an idea of the dreadful sit- 
uation to which this unfortunate country has been reduced, and 
the little probability that it will soon be restored to tranquillity. 

The seeds of suspicion and discontent are too widely sown. 
As an instance of this, I will only mention the case of Mr. Brown, 
gentn. of property in the County Kildare. As soon as the alarm 
was given he joined the Yeomanry and fought with great bravery 
agt. the Insurgents, when a few moments after he was served with a 
warrant as one of those persons who had been seen (as it was 
reported) at their head. Other gentlemen have fallen under the 
same suspicion and have been arrested by Govt., and I was told 
yesterday that a gardener of Mr. Grattan was flogged at Bray, 
until he was induced, probably to relieve himself from immediate 
pain, to utter expressions unfavorable to his master. Among 
other curious papers of the day, you will see one of Alderman 
James, who has opened an office for receiving Information, where 
secrecy is promised and rewards in proportion to the magnitude 
of the Information. . . . The town of Wexford is supposed 
to be in the hands of the Insurgents and Govt, are marching 
troops in hopes of surrounding them. Those that were in force 
in the Mountains of Wicklow, disappeared on the approach of the 
military. I have just seen a private letter from a gentleman who 
lives within 8 miles of the town of Enniscorthy, giving the dread- 
ful account of the murder of 14 families by the Insurgents. They 
did not spare even the children. From his window he saw the 
houses in flames. He has barricaded his own and with the assist- 
ance of a party of military, is determined to defend it. It is said 
that 2 companies marching across the country with two howitzers 
were attacked and obliged to retreat with the loss of one of the 
howitzers. Should the Insurgents have contrived to give infor- 



328 RUFUS KING. [1798 

mation to the French and these last risk the landing of a few 
troops, the country, I fear, would be lost. Ryan who was wounded 
by Ld. E. Fitzgerald was buried this morning, a great body of 
yeomanry attending his funeral. 

You will excuse this long letter, my dear Sir, and believe me 
very truly your obliged Humble Ser. 

Post Office, Dublin. 

The North, as Ld. Charlemont assures me, is perfectly tranquil. 
The publication of the Correspondence of Mr. Pinckney, in which 
America appears to so much advantage, and the corruption of the 
Directory so completely unmasked, has been of great service to 
them in opening their eyes to the insidious policy of the tyranni- 
cal Republic. My best compliments to Mr. Rutledge. 



T. Pickering to R. King. 

Private. 

Philadelphia, June 2, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

I have one minute to inform you that I have received your 
letters no. 69. and your Nos. 71 . . . together with your private 
letters of April 7, 9 and 16, accompanied by General Pinckney's 
to you of March 14, 27 and April 4. 

You have expressed the indignant feelings which their perusal 
must excite in the breast ot every honest and independent mind. 

G s conduct is unpardonable. I hope the Directors did not 

permit General P. to visit the south of France, because I hope 
that both he and General M. were out of France before April 
expired. 



Robert Troup to R. King. 

New York, 3d June, 1798. 
My Dear Sir : 

. . . By this time you have doubtless seen in the public 

prints the despatches from our Envoys in Paris to our Government. 

The incessant efforts of the democrats to impeach the integrity of 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 329 

our executive — the misguided zeal of many of our virtuous fellow- 
citizens in favor of France — and the urgent necessity for greater 
unanimity induced the publication of the despatches. The pub- 
lication was made by the Senate with a majority of two votes. 
The democratical party in the House of Representatives were 
very clamorous for the publication until they became acquainted 
with the intelligence communicated. From that moment they 
opposed the publication, and finally they carried a majority against 
the measure. The Senate finding this to be the case instantly 
directed the publication. The crisis of our affairs compelled the 
Senate to overlook all former precedents and to take upon them- 
selves the responsibility of a novel and extraordinary act in 
diplomatic concerns. The act has produced the most magical 
effects. A spirit of warm and high resentment against the rulers 
of France has suddenly burst forth in every part of the United 
States, and addresses from all bodies and descriptions of men are 
pouring like a torrent upon the President and both Houses of 
Congress. 

I suppose the fact to be that since man was created and gov- 
ernment was formed no public officer has stood higher in the 
confidence and affection of his countrymen than our present 
President now does. His firm and manly tone of conduct has 
regenerated all the energies of our revolutionary character and 
placed us, I hope, upon an eminence from which we shall look 
down with contempt and safety upon the machinations and power 
of the French Directory. So irresistible has been the current of 
public opinion in favor of the government that within a fortnight 
past it has broken down the opposition in Congress. 

A very important bill for authorizing the capture of French 
privateers upon our coast passed a few days ago without oppo- 
sition ; and yesterday we received an account from Philadelphia 
that a Bill for suspending all commercial intercourse between us 
and France and its dependencies until the adjustment of our dif- 
ferences, passed through the Committee of the Whole, in the 
House of Representatives, without debate, and no doubt is enter- 
tained that it will formally pass into a law. 

The democratical cant now is, — the friends of the government, 
as they call themselves, have at last succeeded in their favorite 
object of a war with France ; they must fight their own battles ; 



330 RUFUS KING. [1798 

we will take no part in them. What excellent Republicans ! to 
say they will not aid in carrying into effect the measures agreed 
upon by a majority of their representatives, — this, however, is in 
character with all they have heretofore done — and I fear will be 
with all their future conduct. 

Considering the strength of the opposition and its deadly ani- 
mosity against the administration, the government has accom- 
plished miracles — a provisional army is directed to be formed — 
our frigates are beginning to guard our coast — purchases are 
making of merchant vessels for the purpose of equipping and 
sending them to sea as auxiliaries to the frigates — magazines are 
forming — a bill of direct taxes is on the point of passing — and 
generally a system of defence is getting into operation. ... In 
a word, my good friend, I can assure you that we consider the 
present crisis as the most awful since the days of vandalism. If 
the storm now raging in Europe should travel across the Atlantic 
and spend the remnant of its force upon us, we shall meet it with 
fortitude. All extremities will be encountered, and every sacri- 
fice made to preserve our sovereignty, our constitution, our liber- 
ties civil and religious. Be under no apprehensions, therefore, 
that we shall disgrace our ancestors, or the founders of our free- 
dom. We know by the melancholy experience of the Republics 
in the neighbourhood of France the inevitable ruin that awaits us 
if her principles should ever be planted in our soil. . . . 

For my own part I have made up my mind decidedly not to 
survive the independence and freedom of my country — and in 
speaking this language I deliver you the sentiment and fixed 
resolve of all your friends in the circle of my acquaintance. . . . 

Hamilton is well and is all sensibility to the honor and interests 
of our country. His practice is extensive and lucrative. . . . 
For this twelvemonth past this poor man — Hamilton I mean — 
has been most violently and infamously abused by the demo- 
cratical party. His ill judged pamphlet has done him incompara- 
ble injury. . . . 

God bless you and yours 

Rob. Troup.

Wm. Bingham to R. King. 

Philadelphia, June 5, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

The Publication of the Instructions which evinced the Sincerity 
of the Government in its wish to make Peace with France, by an 
Acquiescence in Terms, which induced an abandonment of its 
Rights, has opened the Eyes of the People, & convinced Some 
of the most blindly obstinate, of the Delusion they lay under. 

The Spirit of the People is roused, & the Enthusiasm which 
prevails would astonish those Persons who recently contemplated 
the apparent Apathy of the American Character, suffering the 
greatest Indignities without indicating a Disposition to resent 
them. 

I wish the French Duke * was here, & if his Chagrin, arising 
from disappointed Hopes in this country, had not riveted his 
Resentments, he might be led to change those unfavorable 
Opinions which he has expressed on our Subject in a Work re- 
cently published at Paris. When he first arrived in this Country 
he sought it as an Asylum, & was so highly gratified, that he was 
extravagant in its Praises. But when he saw a Prospect open for 
his Return into France, & supposed that he could facilitate his 
Views by his abuse of the United States & the People, he re- 
garded every Object with a jaundiced Eye. This Opinion of his 
Conduct arose from my own Observations & I have been told, is 
confirmed by the Publication of his Book. ... I hope some 
Answer will be made to it ; for, such Sentiments, falling from so 
great a Height, may make a considerable Impression, & be in- 
jurious to the American Character ; it is said he has prefixed his 
Name to the Work. 

By the Addresses from all Quarters of the Union you will ob- 
serve that the People are ripe for the Support of the most decisive 
Measures of the Government. There is more danger at present 
of overstepping the Bounds of Prudence, than of falling Short, in 
the Adoption of such a System, as the Occasion may call for — 
The Friends of this Country will greatly rejoice at finding so little 
of the Jacobinic Spirit prevailing in it & the Knowledge of this 
Circumstance will impress Europeans with additional Confidence. 

* Due de Liancourt. 



332 RUFUS KING. [1798 

We are much alarmed for the Fate of our Commissioners. If 
they have not left France previous to the Knowledge of the Pub- 
lication of the Dispatches, I dread the Consequences. We wait 
with great Anxiety for the Result. 

Yours, 

Wm. Bingham. 



John Lawrance to Rufus King. 

Philadelphia, June 5, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

Since the publication of the five dispatches, from our Ministers 
at Paris, in which Messrs. X Y & Z display so great a share in 
the Negotiations, public Opinion has undergone a material change, 
in our Country, and from the Evidence, furnished from the various 
parts of it, I believe we shall exhibit, when seriously called upon 
to act, a Conduct not unworthy of a People, contending for the 
preservation of their Independence and Government. As unim- 
portant as the French now consider us, we may convince them, in 
the progress of our Controversy, it was better for them to have 
preserved the good will of this country, than created its enmity : 
from the former, much was to have been gained ; and from the latter 
more may be lost than they have apprehended : however, I now 
consider, as they are unwilling to turn from the Error of their 
ways respecting us, we must do what may be necessary, to do our- 
selves Justice, — we have hitherto acted on the defensive except on 
our Coast ; how soon we must act otherwise, cannot be long in 
doubt : and acting under a conviction of great Injustice, Insult and 
Injury, we may create more inconvenience to them, than they 
have expected — we shall experience some, undoubtedly our- 
selves : but we must remember the Objects of the Contest, and 
cheerfully submit to whatever may be deemed proper, to accom- 
plish them. The public prints will inform you of the Acts passed 
by the Government. Many have been passed relative to our 
Army & Navy. We shall soon, I hope, be respectable in both, 
and what is yet necessary to be done, I expect will be produced 
before we rise. — Union and Firmness I hope will prevail, and 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 333 

carry us well through the contest, however arduous it may be. 
This Contest has been forced on us unjustly and which we have 
taken every honorable and proper mode to prevent. — So much for 
public Concerns. . . . 

Yours very sincerely 

John Lawrance. 



G. Cabot to R. King. 

June 6, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

The time has come that the people of this country are awaken- 
ing from those slumbers which resembled death more than sleep 
— you will see & admire the spirit of the President & which he 
daily infuses into the people. — I have been extremely mortified at 
the continuance of our Envoys at Paris & for which I shou'd not 
have been able to account satisfactorily without the intimations 
you have given — however it has been our fate to be assisted by 
our blunders sometimes as well as by our wisdom & it may yet 
prove beneficial to the country that some of the Commissioners 
are superlatively fastidious. — judging from the external com- 
plexion of the Diplomacy it is universally understood here that 
Mr. is no less chagrined than his colleagues with the 

arrogance of the f rench Tyrants & this idea has certainly operated 
powerfully to silence many Fractious People who cou'd never be 
influenced by better motives. The News papers will tell you 
every thing & therefore I need tell you nothing of a public nature, 
but as I have long been one of the Desponding Patriots I ought 
to say to you that things are going better than I had feared & that 
I do not wholly despair of seeing a tolerable degree of Union & 
firmness in defending our Country & vindicating its rights — in a 
word I think we shall stand fast unless G Britain yields ; I go no 
further at present altho' I am persuaded if we would act as we 
ought no nation in the world can subjugate us — if the temper of 
the House of Reps had been right last year at the time of the 
extra Session, I am persuaded our danger wou'd have been less & 
G. B. wou'd certainly have felt a little more encouraged to make 



334 RUFUS KING. [i798 

those immense efforts which she is called to make in defence of 
her own existence & that of civilized society : I feel confident 
however that (under God) her force is fully adequate to her pro- 
tection & I have constantly believed that it wou'd be well for us 
& all the &;zconquered nations that France shou'd with all her 
Energies attempt an Invasion of England — I think the Expedition 
wou'd issue in the ruin or disgrace of the french force, & if it 
shou'd, the subjugated nations wou'd be immediately free — cer- 
tainly if the contest is on the Sea the chance must be in favor of 
the English even if their numbers are inferior & I shou'd think 
the British Govt, very improvident indeed if it does not make a 
certainty of having a Naval force always equal in strength to any 
that the French & the enslaved Nations can possibly bring against 
them — I say this because it is completely in the power of the 
british to provide such a force of themselves, without drawing 
any assistance from Russia or any other power, whose aid is never- 
theless to be obtained if possible on almost any terms. — I have 
never yet realized nor can I believe that the french will trust 
themselves on the Sea — with all their boasting they fear the Eng- 
lish on the Sea more than they themselves are feared on the land, 
& at this late period of the war when the English Naval power is 
at its acme it wou'd be rashness & folly to encounter it with an 
unformed & unskilled fleet. I look therefore for some other de- 
velopment of this great scheme. You will see that the U S are 
equipping & have already sent out some Cruisers to pick up the 
french privateers & Buccaneers who infest our Coast — if Congress 
will authorize 50 instead of 12 such Vessels, many of which may 
be very small, the Coast will be kept clear, & a good body of men 
will be ready to act against those who shall attempt to transport 
troops here by & by, if such a thing shou'd happen — I trust that 
in this kind of warfare our people will prove equal to any in the 
world. — at this moment there is more tranquillity here than usual, 
the clamour of Faction is in some good degree silenced & a 
sober attention to the interesting affairs of the nation seems to 
suspend many slight differences among individuals — there was 
more of the Jacobin Spirit in this vicinity than any part of New 
England except at Portsmouth — it has subsided or changed very 
much & I pray God it may never revive or return. — 

Believe me ever your sincere friend.

London, June 6, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

The fate of Switzerland is an instructive lesson to America. 
The Newspaper Reports of the ruin of that brave and innocent 
People are so detached and imperfect, that I thought it would be 
useful to obtain a connected and plain account of this afflicting 
Event. I explained my wishes to Sir Francis D'lvernois, who im- 
mediately prepared the Letter, a translation of which I have the 
honor to send you. This Letter is addressed to you, and the 
original will be forwarded by the next opportunity. Sir Francis 
desires that it may be understood that he can have no objection 
to the Publication of it with his name or in any other way that 
you shall judge best calculated to promote the welfare of our 
Country. 

With perfect Respect & Attachment, &c. &c.

336 RUFUS KING. [l798 

R. King to Secretary of State. No. 75. 

London, June 6, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

The President's Message of the 5th of April and the Instruc- 
tions and Despatches of the Envoys were published here on the 
15th of May, and immediately afterwards translated into French 
and thro' a variety of channels sent into France. We have the 
Paris papers to the 30th of May, which are entirely silent upon 
the affairs of the United States, and private letters give us no 
information respecting either Genl. Pinckney or Mr. Gerry. 

The Government vessel despatched with a letter of Recall to 
the Envoys arrived at Havre on the nth of May. I have heard 
by the way of Holland that about the 14th of May, Mr. Gerry 
informed some of our Countrymen at Paris that Talleyrand had 
told him that the Directory would soon enter upon the affairs of 
the United States, and that he (Mr. G.) thought it probable that 
the Directory could now consent to terms that we could with 
honor and advantage accept. From the same quarter I have 
been informed that two American Vessels have lately been re- 
leased in some of the Tribunals of France ; and I can readily 
believe both accounts. Many persons here who applaud and ad- 
mire the conduct of our Government towards France (and it has 
the singular good fortune to be approved by all parties) have 
supposed that the Directory would declare war against us. As 
this would not increase, but probably diminish, the plunder that 
she commits upon our commerce, and as it would moreover shut 
up the mouths of her Partizans and compel them even to unite 
against her, instead of a declaration of war, she will, in my opin- 
ion, release some of our ships, appear to recede from some of her 
demands, and send you a soothing and insidious message by Mr. 
Gerry, who, in vindication of his own conduct, must appear to 
believe the sincerity of that of France. . . . 

In Ireland, which I still continue to believe to be the object of 
the Toulon Expedition, the Rebellion is not yet overcome. Many 
partial engagements have taken place between the Loyal troops 
and the Rebels, which have in almost every instance ended in the 
overthrow of the latter. . . . There is great reason to believe 
that the Irish Malcontents expected the descent of the French to 
have taken place about the 2 2d of May, and that the insurrec- 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 337 

tions which broke out in different places at that period are to be 
accounted for by this expectation. 

The Rebels are either without arms or very badly armed, and 
are therefore easily overcome by the royal Troops. . . . The 
prematurity of the Insurrection has given to the Government a 
very great advantage, and should the descent hereafter be made, 
the danger will be greatly diminished by the recent overthrow of 
the Rebels. . . . 

. . . Though some doubts are entertained respecting the 
authenticity of the Manifesto that has been published in the 
Newspapers, in which the Emperor (of Russia) says he will im- 
mediately equip 22 Ships of the line and 250 Gallies in defence 
of the freedom of the Trade of the North of Europe, it is certain 
that he has recently expressed to England a fixed Resolution to assist 
her as far as possible in the war against France j that his Ambas- 
sador at Vienna has likewise urged the Emperor to make the requi- 
site remittances to England to fulfil his pecuniary engagements there, 
and that according to all appearances he is zealously endeavour- 
ing to persuade Austria and Prussia to unite with Russia and 
England in a new league for the safety of Europe. 

Notwithstanding the mysterious Policy of Vienna, it is believed 
that this Court is not blind to its proper interest and that with the 
Court of Peter sburgh it is inclined to form a new Coalition against 
France, which is prevented only by the persevering repugnance 
of Prussia* . . . 

With perfect Respect & Esteem, &c. 

Rufus King. 



R. King to A. Hamilton.! 

London, June 6th, 1798. 
My dear Sir : 

We have certain intelligence that the Toulon fleet has sailed. 
The number of troops, of transports and of men of war are vari- 
ously stated, but it is known that Bonaparte commands, and that 
the fleet is a very great one. Its destination is the subject of in- 
quietude and of conjecture. A few days will bring us more per- 

* Italics in cipher. 

f Works of Hamilton, vi., 298. 

VOL. 11. — 22 



338 RUFUS KING. [1798 

feet accounts, and from the force and position of the British fleet 
under Lord Vincent, the public are in daily, not to say hourly, 
expectation of hearing that he has discovered and destroyed this 
boasted armada. 

If Ireland is the object, the insurrection has been ill-judged 
and premature. In almost every instance, the insurgents have 
been dispersed, and the quarter round Dublin is now restored to 
the king's peace. Still however, if a moderate French force, 
with a supply of arms, could now be thrown into Ireland, the 
issue would be dubious, so deep and general is the desertion. 
Great Britain is unquestionably in a better and more secure, as 
well as more united state, than she has been since the commence- 
ment of the war. With her the question with France is at issue, 
and so far as regards Europe, upon her alone must it essentially 
depend. For upon the continent, French principles and French 
influence seem still to extend themselves in every direction. 
Though it is more than a fortnight since the publication of the 
instructions and dispatches of our Envoys must have been re- 
ceived in Paris, neither their papers, nor letters from France take 
any notice of them. Gerry is still there, but about to return 
home, and, if I mistake not, will be the bearer of a soothing and 
treacherous message from the Directory. Be upon your guard. 
France will not declare war against us. No. Her policy will be 
to pursue the same course she already has done and which has 
served her purpose in Italy and among the honest, but devoted 
and ruined Swiss. 

I will say, that, if after all that has occurred among ourselves 

and in other countries, we are content to be duped, and cajoled, 

and betrayed, we shall deserve the fate which they are preparing

R. King to Secretary of State. No. 76. 

London, June 7, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . It is a disappointment to me that I am not able to in- 
form you that anything is yet arranged concerning the Question 
before the Commissioners. Their business is now actually at a 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 339 

stand. I continue to press Lord Grenville upon the subject and 
he renews to me a sincere desire that measures may be fallen 
upon to expedite the Decisions of their Courts and in this way to 
avoid the Question concerning the Powers of the Commissioners. 
, . . I have hitherto forborne, from motives that you will be at 
no loss to conjecture, to express to you the dissatisfaction and even 
the disgust that I often experience in * our intercourse and connec- 
tion with this Government. The indijference, the procrastination and 
in short the exclusive principles by which they cotisider almost every 
question that is brought before them, should admonish us, as it has 
done every other Nation, to depend upon ourselves as much, and upon 
others as little as possible. With these sentiments (which the 
experience of my residence here has contributed very much to 
confirm) you will conclude that I have been much gratified with 
the political views developed in your No. 7. ; and in correspond- 
ence with them, I have always carefully avoided, particularly 
upon the Subject of Convoys, to ask anything which could be con- 
sidered as a mere favor solicited by us and gratuitously conferred by 
them. I will resume this subject when I give you an account of 
the answers that I shall receive from Lord Grenville respecting 
certain parts of your No. 7.

French Consul at Charleston. 

With perfect Respect & Esteem, &c.

The two letters from which extracts are given below are 
interesting in many respects, as showing the feeling in 
Charleston towards the French Republic at the time, and as 
foreshadowing some of its plans. A large portion of each is 
of a merely personal character and is therefore omitted here. 
M. Bosc, in the confidence of friendship with his correspond- 
ent, exposes his unwillingness to go to Wilmington, whose 
commerce is of no value, and then speaks of a desire to be 
transferred to some other post, which would be more ac- 
ceptable in every sense. He says, referring to two letters 
previously written :

. . . Toutes deux te parloient de ma situation morale et 
politique, et t'invitoient de me faire sortir d'un Pays, ou regne 
l'esclavage et ou je suis signale comme un Philantrope, par con- 
sequent comme un homme dangereux. Le vice-consulat de 
Wilmington est a. supprimer pour son inutilite. 

Je te demande de nouveau, mon cher, de me faire employer en 
Floride ou en Louisiane, si ces contrees sont reunies a. la Re- 
publique, et dans le cas contraire dans toute autre colonic 
J'imagine que depuis le i8 e Fructidor les causes qui s'opposoient 
a ce que ma Severite Republicaine fut preferee a la Souplesse 
Contre Revolutionnaire de certain individus n'existent plus ; que 
la totalite du Directoire sent la necessite de ne mettre dans les 
places superieures que des amis eprouves a. la liberte, que les 
Patriotes de 1789. Je ne crois pas qu'on me conteste ces qualites, 
que ta es la pour rappeler. Depuis mon arrive ici je n'ai eprouve 
qu'une fois regret d'etre sorti de la France ; c'est que j'ai appris 
le mort de Louvet et l'affreuse situation de la France. Mais 
quoique moins eloigne d'y retourner depuis que mon ami s'est un 
peu calme apres que les contre-revolutionnaires sont demasques^ 
je desire encore passer quelque temps dans des pays nouveaux. 
Je concois la probability de faire servir mes connaissances et mon 
gout pour les arts agricoles aux progres d'une Colonie dans 
laquelle j'aurois de l'influence. Celle de la Floride me sourit 
plus que les autres, parce qu'elle est toute entiere a former, les 80 
Families qui forment en ce moment la population de la campagne 
se disposant a passer avec leurs esclaves dans les autres posses- 
sions Espagnoles, si la cession a lieu. L'histoire naturelle y est, 
dit on, fort riche et les details de l'etablissement de construction 
que le Ministre de la Marine y formera, sans doute, me donneroi- 
ent cette activite d'occupation dont je sens le besoin et que je ne 
puis jamais esperer de trouver a Wilmington. 

Chaque jour la situation des Francais, amis de leur pays, devient 
plus desagreable en Amerique. L'influence Angloise domine en- 
tierement, et si je ne suis pas individuellement insulte, c'est que 
je ne sors pas de Michaux, que je ne vais a. la ville qu'une fois en 
15 jours, pour seavoir des nouvelles et recevoir mes communica- 
tions officielles. Les emigres de St. Domingue m'ont pris si fort 
en haine depuis que leurs esperances contre-revolutionnaires sont

evanouies, que quoique fort peu me connoissent de vue, ils me 
dechirent continuellement et cherchent de faire passer leurs 
fureurs dans l'ame des Americains. Mon ignorance de la langue 
Angloise fait reellement ma meriteuse sauvegarde, mais on me 
fait craindre l'arrestation, si la guerre est declaree. J'en ai parle 
au ministre dans ma precedente depeche et je lui ai parle encore 
dans celle que je suis ici, moins parceque j'ai peur, que parceque 
je crois qu'il est de la Dignite de la Republique de faire respecter 
ses Representans, quelque mince que soit le rang qu'ils occupent 
dans la Hierarchie des Pouvoirs. Adieu, cher ami. . . .

Citoyen Ministre : 

. . . Depuis ma derniere Lettre, l'Esprit public s'est beau- 
coup tourne contre nous. Les Huletans des Campagnes qui 
nous environnoient, ont ete particulierement seduits par les 
calomnies des amis des Anglois. Frequemment la Cocarde Na- 
tionale est insultee par des propos injurieux a la Republique. 
Les Bruits les plus absurdes, les nouvelles les plus extravagantes 
sont repandues a dessin de nous perdre de plus en plus dans 
l'opinion. Un voyage que vient de faire en cette ville l'Ambas- 
sadeur d'Angleterre, probablement pour organizer une Expedi- 
tion contres les Florides, si la Guerre a lieu, a acheve notre 
Discredit. Tout le monde craint pourtant la Republique. Les 
Proprietaires d'Esclaves surtout redoutent, que la Suite d'une 
Declaration de Guerre ne soit une descente d'une armee des 
Noirs de St. Domingue, contre laquelle ils scavent qu'ils n'auroient 
pas le secours des leurs. Ma position n'est rien moins qu' agre- 
able dans les circonstances actuelles. J'ai ete signale par les 
Emigres de St. Domingue comme un Philantrope, un Jacobin, un 
Espion des Terroristes ; et quoique le resultat de leurs premieres 
Calomnies, dont je vous ai deja entretenue, n'ait pas ete conforme

R. King to A. Hamilton.* 

London, June 8, 1798. 
My dear Sir : 

Since writing you a day or two past, I have the pleasure to 
receive your letters by the packet and rejoice to find my hopes 
confirmed by your opinions that we shall not be wanting to our- 
selves in our conduct towards France. 

Immediately on hearing the proceedings of the Admiralty 
Judge at St. Domingo, I remonstrated to this government against 
them, and was without delay answered that General Simcoe had 
no power to erect the Court, that the appointment of Judge Cam- 
bauld was illegal, and all his decrees void ; and that those who 
had unfortunately suffered by them must, as in the Martinique 
cases, apply for satisfaction to the High Court of Admiralty in 
England. I expected and so it was determined, that orders 
should have instantly been dispatched to suppress the court ; this 
was omitted from the negligence of the officer to whom the duty 
belonged in the Admiralty, hence the continuation of the Court 
at St. Domingo. Orders have, however, at length been sent to 
suppress the Court. 

The instructions of the 25th of January 1794, a copy of which, 
was on the 7th of February sent to the Secretary of State, have 
been misrepresented or not understood. Instead of enlarging, 
the effect of them will, as it was intended it should, be to contract 
the description of cases, in which the trade of neutrals will be 
liable to interruption. The order, as it is called, of the 6th of 
November 1793, authorized the capture of all vessels carrying 
supplies to, or laden with the produce of the French West Indies. 
The instruction of the 8th of January, 1794, revoked this order, 
and substituted another in which the bona fide neutral trade be- 
tween the United States and the French West Indies was con- 
sidered legal — while that between the French West Indies and 
Europe was liable to interruption by the vessels being sent in for 
adjudication. The late instruction of the 25th of January, which 
I have thought a point gained, enlarges the rights and security of 
the trade of neutrals, for instead of former restraints, it is now 
admitted, that a direct trade by neutrals between their respective 
countries and the French, Dutch and Spanish West Indies, out 

* Works of Hamilton, vi., 300. 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE, 343 

and home, and likewise the direct voyages from those colonies 
to any port in Great Britain are lawful and not liable to 
interruption. 

That the naval officers will often exercise their authority, how- 
ever limited, in abuse, will continue to be the case so long as the 
military profession is disgraced by a sordid love of gain, and so 
long as the system of the Admiralty Courts of England shall be so 
little satisfactory as they really are. We are, as you will naturally 
suppose, extremely impatient to receive information from the 
Mediterranean. It appears certain that the Toulon expedition 
sailed about the 19th of May. The force is variously reported. 
Buonaparte is supposed to be with the fleet, which is said to be 
thirteen ships of the line, as many frigates and nearly four hun- 
dred transports — all the naval characters agree, that it is next to 
impossible that they can reach Ireland without discovery. Indeed 
from the prevalence of the winds from the west, a single ship 
would, it is said, be at this season perhaps two months in making 
the voyage from Toulon to Ireland. The opinion that has the 
most advocates is, that the expedition is against Portugal — that 
the troops will be disembarked at Carthagena or Malaga in Spain, 
and that they will cross the mountains to Portugal. It is well 
understood that from the want of subsistence they could not have 
marched through Spain. But Portugal has no money, and all the 
plunder that would be obtained would not defray the expenses of 
the expedition. The enterprize would reduce Spain under the 
more complete control of France. Cadiz would become a French 
port. The English would be expelled from the Tagus. The 
Spanish fleet would be relieved as soon as the windy season 
arrives, and from the Tagus and Cadiz the expedition may go to 
the Brazils and the treasure of South America may be at the dis- 
posal of the Directory. Besides the country may be revolution- 
ized on the French model, and this may prepare for the measures 
to be adopted toward us. Letters from Lord St. Vincent, of the 
19th of May (when his fleet off Cadiz consisted of twenty five sail 
of the line, in excellent condition) induce the belief that Sir 
Roger Curtis would join him from the Greek station by the 2 2d 
or 23d, with the sail of the line. His orders are to leave a force 
to block up Cadiz and watch the fleet, and to proceed with the 
residue of the fleet to search for and fight the Toulon fleet, and 



344 RUFUS KING. [1798 

according to everything that we know, there is great reason to 
expect that he will be in season to intercept them even should 
their object be Carthagena or Malaga. 'Tis against every proba- 
bility that the Toulon expedition can pass the Gut without 
discovery. 



R. Troup to R. King. 

New York, June 10, 1798. 
My dear Sir : 

. . . Every day brings us new and decisive proofs of the 
growing unanimity throughout the whole extent of our territory. 
Addresses to the President are constantly coming in — meetings 
are holding, and the people are resolving with heart and hand to 
support the government in all such measures as the public coun- 
cils shall devise for the protection of our independence and 
liberties. Even Governor Mifflin, alias Secretary Dallas, in an 
address to the officers of the State of Pennsylvania on the neces- 
sity of putting themselves in warlike array, speaks in very harsh 
terms of the Government of France, and considers it as having 
forfeited all claims to our gratitude and friendship. In short all 
may be truly said to be united and determined to take our 
stand. 

If Great Britain should happen to fall, it will be an event all 
shall deplore with all the sincerity the necessary consequences 
resulting from it will naturally inspire ; but such an event will not 
deter us from the combat in which we are about to engage. The 
sense of the studied insults and unjust aggressions of France, is 
so deeply rooted that the nation will freely encounter every pos- 
sible extremity to convince her that we are a free, virtuous and 
spirited people. 

In this city we are putting on quite a military face — volunteer 
companies, of horse and infantry, are raising ; and meetings of 
the old officers of the army and navy — and of the citizens, in the 
different wards have been had to concert measures for the defence 
of our port. All parties compose the committees appointed for 
this object, and all join in the necessity of prompt and efficacious 
measures. We shall apply to the Governor for an immediate call 
of the Legislature to give us aid. The Secretary at war is mo- 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 345 

mently expected here on the same business — and we hope soon 
to be in a situation to prevent our being disgraced by a few- 
frigates, however unable we might be to prevent an impression by 
a formidable fleet and army. 

Congress have not yet adjourned, and there are appearances of 
their continuing in session without an adjournment. Gallatin 
continues to clog the wheels of government, but he has not suf- 
ficient strength to stop its motion. Without him the party would 
be completely scattered. He constantly preaches the duty of 
resisting all foreign attacks, and professes warm zeal for the con- 
stitution and country. 

Giles has gone home with a broken heart and ruined constitu- 
tion. Edward Livingston has been home for several weeks and I 
see no symptoms of his return. 

The young men of Philadelphia, this city and Boston have 
come forward in mass, with the most patriotic and determined 
addresses to the President, and made an offer of their lives in the 
service of their country. They have gone farther and claimed it 
as a matter of right to compose the van of our army. Their 
addresses and the President's are extremely affecting and will be 
read with exulting pride by posterity. The fourth of July will be 
celebrated with great animation and pomp. 

Tell our friends Mr. Gore and Mr. Trumbull that the Eastern 
States stand like old grenadiers in their ranks, firm, erect and 
looking well to the right. One soul animates them ; and if the 
French invade their shores I have no doubt the Yankee Doodle 
will triumph over ca-ira. 

If you should meet any of our Envoys to Paris in London, you 
may tell them that their conduct has given the most entire and uni- 
versal satisfaction. Upon their return, they will be received with 
all the ardor of affection that can possibly be expressed by men 
who have a love for virtue and a respect for talents and firmness. 
Their memorial to the Directory is considered as one of the first 
State papers of the age. You will read it with infinite satisfac- 
tion. A few days ago their despatches down to the middle of 
March were received from them. They are all published and 
contain nothing more than repeated demands for money ; we will 
not however give them, as our Envoys have already informed 
them, a single sixpence. We are uneasy lest our Envoys may 



346 RUFUS KING. [1798 

be arrested and imprisoned. Our hope is they have left 
France. . . . 

The old Chief is again furbishing his sword. If there be a 
dignus vindice nodus, and he should be invited he will take the 
field and so will Hamilton. . . . Burr has been re-elected a 
member of the State Legislature for this city. He was a member 
the last year ; and his conduct very different from what you 
would imagine. Some conjecture that he is changing his ground. 
He concurs with us decidedly in measures for defence of our 
port. . . . 

The City is perpetually improving in buildings &c. The Park 
near your house [Broadway on part of lot where the Astor House 
now stands] has made your situation not only pleasant, but has 
given it an air of elegance that will please you. . . . 

God bless you, 

Rob. Troup. 

P. S. Congress have lately passed an Act for establishing a 
naval department to be under the direction of a Commissioner of 
the Navy. Your friend Cabot was appointed — but declined ; 
afterward Benj. Stoddart of Maryland ; he declined — and the 
office is still vacant. 

June nth. — It is reported by way of the West Indies that the 
British court have issued orders for capturing all neutral vessels 
bound to French, Dutch, or Spanish ports. A Judge Cambold 
or Gambold, of very considerable celebrity in protecting pirates, 
has it is said lately condemned many vessels under these orders. 
Capt. Cochran of the Thetis has likewise recently captured 
several vessels, and the captures, from the reports respecting 
them, cannot be accounted for except as the effects of these same 
orders. This business has created very unpleasant sensations in 
the public mind. If true, and the system is persisted in, I have 
no doubt it will lead to a rupture. By this morning's paper I find 
Foster's resolutions are postponed for a fortnight by 44 to 40. . . . 
Mr. Blount has given notice that when Foster's resolutions are 
brought forward, he will move similar resolutions against Great 
Britain. The democratical party will be highly gratified with a 
war agt. Great Britain ; and the friends of the government are 
not now in a frame of mind to bear a blow from any quarter.

T. Pickering to R. King. 

Private. 

Philadelphia, June 12, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . . The conduct of Mr. Gerry surpasses the fears of 
those who knew him intimately and anticipated mischief from his 
appointment. To the errors of usual wrongheadedness, must be 
added folly, meanness and treachery ; the latter I should not have 
suspected ; but his conduct is not to be satisfactorily accounted 
for on any other principle. Altho' the evil to his country is 
equal, I wish it may be found attributable only to an excess of 
vanity and weakness. 

This morning I received a letter from Mr. Murray dated April 

1 2th, and conveying information * from Genl. Pinckney dated at 

Paris the 6th of April. By this it appears that Mr. Gerry with 

unpardonable arrogance and folly had determined to take upon 

himself the whole responsibility of the Mission agreeably to the 

designation of the Executive Directory ! and that Generals P. and 

M. were to be ordered to leave France. There is, however, one 

consolation in this, that those two excellent men will be out of 

France and safe when the publication of the first dispatches of 

the Envoys will be known there. If they would then guillotine 

Mr. Gerry they would do a favor to this Country ; but they will 

keep him alive to write, a la Monroe, a Book, which will equally 

express his misconduct. . .

London, June 14, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

The Toulon Expedition continues to be the object of anxiety 

and of uncertainty. The affairs of Ireland are most alarming, 

the rebellion having burst forth in Antrim, and Ulster being in 

danger of a revolt. Should the insurrection thus extend itself 

over the North, the South in which symptoms of disaffection have 

appeared will not remain quiet. In consequence of this critical 

state of Irish affairs, Lord Cambden will be recalled and Lord 

Cornwallis sent as his Successor. The military capacity and ex-

348 RUFUS KING. [1798 

perience of the latter have recommended the change which does 
not originate in a dissatisfaction with Lord Cambden, whose zeal 
and exertions have been entirely approved. In case the Re- 
bellion is suppressed, which must be effected or England is lost, 
thousands of the fugitive Irish will seek an asylum in our Country. 
Their principles and habits would be pernicious to the order and 
industry of our people, and I cannot persuade myself that the 
Malcontents of any character or country will ever become useful 
citizens of ours. It is my duty seasonably to apprize you of the 
probability of this Emigration : but it belongs to others to decide 
what the safety and welfare of the Country may require to be 
done, should it actually take place. 

We have Paris papers to the 9th inst. The " Bien Inform^ " 
contains a Correspondence between Talleyrand and Mr. Gerry — 
the object of which is the disavowal of the Bribe and the sacrifice 
of Mr. Talleyrand's agents. Mr. Gerry is called upon to give 
up their names, which, after a faint opposition, he consents to do, 
under the limitation that they shall not be published as having 
been received from him. The Correspondence is preceded by a 
piece, which, tho' anonymous, undoubtedly comes from the office 
of foreign affairs. It represents the Envoys (always excepting 
Mr. Gerry) as indisposed to the restoration of friendship between 
France and the United States ; as refusing a direct intercourse 
with the Minister of foreign affairs, who often solicited it, and as 
surrounded by men of Intrigue who constantly missled and de- 
ceived them. These indispositions of the Commissioners, it is 
alledged, correspond with the views of the American Government, 
which desires a war with France, in order that it may have an 
opportunity to co-operate with England against the French and 
Spanish Colonies, and especially that it may be enabled to estab- 
lish in the United States a Monarchical Government. The piece 
concludes as I have before told you it would by declaring : " Not- 
withstanding the injuries and provocations that have been offered 
with the hope to excite France to declare war against America, 
that, superior to her just resentments, she has resolved to consult 
only the happiness of the two Republicks, and to call the whole 
world to witness the sincerity of her disposition which she has 
not ceased, and will never cease, to manifest to live in peace with 
America." 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 349 

If we are the dupes of this repeated and bare-faced effort to 
deceive and divide us, we must shut our eyes to the fate of Switz- 
erland and of the other victims of the pretended friendship of 
the great Nation. It must be the subject of perpetual regret that 
Mr. Gerry suffered himself to be separated from his Colleagues ; 
for had he remained firm, they would all have been received and 
Europe as well as America would have been spared the scandal- 
ous scene that has passed. 

With perfect respect & Esteem, &c. 

Rufus King.

London, June 15, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . Notwithstanding his pretended delicacy, Hauteval by 

no means denies the agency ascribed to him in soliciting the 

Bribe required by Talleyrand. Colonel Trumbull, who was at 

Paris soon after the arrival of the Commissioners, has more than 

once informed me that Hauteval told him that both the Douceur 

and the Loan were indispensable, and urged him to employ his 

influence with the American Commissioners to offer the Bribe as 

well as the Loan. . . . 

With perfect Respect & Esteem, &c. 

Rufus King. 



Robert Troup to R. King. 

New York, 23d June, 1798. 
My Dear Sir : 

I seize a few minutes to inform you that the die between us and 
France is finally cast. General Marshall arrived here on Sunday 
last. His arrival was unexpected and his stay with us very short. 
I have no other apology to make for our not giving him a public 
demonstration of our love and esteem. You can form no concep- 
tion of the flow of affection for all our Commissioners. Mr. 
Gerry's continuance has created much uneasiness, but all appears 
satisfactorily explained by the intelligence this day received from 
Philadelphia. The newspapers herewith sent will furnish you 
with the President's last message to Congress, in which he de- 



350 RUFUS KING. [1798 

clares he will never send another minister to France without 
previous assurance from its government that the Minister shall 
receive that honorable distinction, which is due to the representa- 
tive of an independent, free, and powerful nation. . . . 

Mr. Marshall has been received in Pennsylvania with high 
proof of public attachment. ... I am far from thinking 
that our treaty with France will now be considered as binding. 
In other words, I believe it will be declared to have been broken 
by France, and therefore that we hold it to be void. 

Thus, my good friend, we are about cutting asunder, if the 
separation has not already taken place, the bonds that have long 
united us to France. We must either submit to being a colony of 
that wicked and domineering republic, or we must exert all the 
means we possess to preserve our sovereignty and everything that 
is valued and sacred in society. The latter is our choice. We 
have counted the cost, and like our virtuous ancestors we deem 
nothing to be valuable without the enjoyment of freedom. It is 
impossible to foresee what may be our future destiny. If it be the 
design of Providence that we should fail in the contest, we shall, 
at least, merit the esteem of posterity. 

The bills for suspending all intercourse with France — for cap- 
turing French privateers on our coast — for sending off disaffected 
or seditious aliens — for arming our merchantmen — for raising a 
provisional army — for direct taxes — for borrowing money &c — 
have been passed, and I have now no doubt but all other needful 
measures will be promptly and pretty unanimously taken. . . 

Inform our friends Gore and Trumbull that John Adams will 
not disgrace his country and that his country will support him. 
There never was, and indeed there never can be, a man of more 
solid popularity than he now possesses. . . . 

Your very affectionate friend 

Rob. Troup.

T. Pickering to R. King. No. 18. 

Department of State, June 27, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

. . Mr. Gerry having persisted (contrary to the opinion of 
his Colleagues and obvious propriety) in his determination of 
staying in France to prevent an immediate rupture, as he was per- 
suaded to believe, I wrote him, on the 25th instant, the inclosed 
letter of recall,* which when you have read, be pleased to seal 
and forward to him, if still in France, or anywhere in Europe. 

The public opinion is becoming more and more correct in 
regard to France, the ambition, lust of domination and rapine of 
whose Government have at length become so apparent that mul- 
titudes, whose former attachment and prejudices had blinded, 
now view it in all its deformities and horrors. With the general 
indignation at the insults and injuries received from that Republic 
a martial spirit is rising and extending. 

A Bill has passed the Senate for declaring our three Treaties 

with France no longer binding on the United States. I presume 

it will also pass in the House of Representatives without much 

difficulty. 

T. Pickering. 

* In this letter Mr. Pickering writes, giving a positive recall : 
" The respect due to yourselves and to your Country, irresistibly required that 
you should turn your backs to a Government that treated both with contempt, 
a contempt not diminished but aggravated by the flattering but insidious dis- 
tinction in your favor, in disparagement of men of such respectable talents, 
untainted honor and pure patriotism as Generals Pinckney and Marshall, and 
in whom their Government reposed entire confidence, and especially when the 
real object of that distinction was to enable the French Government, tram- 
pling on the authority and dignity of our own, to designate an envoy with whom 
they could condescend to negotiate. It is therefore to be regretted that you 
did not concur with your Colleagues in demanding passports to quit the Terri- 
tories of the French Republic sometime before they left." — He says further, 
that in laying his [Mr. Gerry's] letter of April 16th before Congress, the Presi- 
dent declared the negotiation at an end and that " he will never send another 
minister to France, without assurances that he will be received, respected and 
honored as the representative of a great, free, powerful and independent nation."

Theodore Sedgwick to R. King. 

Philadelphia, July 1, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . In my last I gave you some account of the publica- 
tion of the first dispatches from our ministers in france, & the 
considerations which induced the adoption of that measure. The 
effects, out of congress, have been considerable, — It has stimu- 
lated those who before felt interested — awakened the indifferent 
— in many instances dispelled delusion, and in some, perhaps^ 
converted the opposers. Instances of the latter are few, if any, 
among those who affect the character of leaders. In congress the 
opposition remains unaltered, except as to their pretences. They 
are, indeed, no longer a french faction, but, as heretofore, they 
invariably oppose everything and propose nothing. Less effect 
has been produced by the disclosure of the outrageous conduct 
of france, in the state of New York, than in any other state east 
of the Delaware. In the late election six out of the ten represen- 
tatives are incorrigible jacobins. 

The measures of the legislature have been as much below what 
they ought to have been, as above what might have been expected 
from the materials of which it is composed. So equally are par- 
ties divided in the house, that measures to be successful, must be 
graduated by the feelings & opinions of the most cool and feeble 
of our friends. . . Long since, in my opinion, a wise policy 
required a declaration of war & an immediate and complete prep- 
aration for that state of things. Several of our friends, however, 
believed it would tend to discredit them among their constituents, 
— that the opposition would endeavor to create, in the popular 
estimation, a new denomination of parties — those of peace & 
war. For myself, I believe, this calculation extremely erroneous. 
— If Congress adjourns without a declaration, I am persuaded, it 
will have a directly contrary effect. In that case the people will 
be addressed with some plausibility & more effect, and induced 
to believe, that the friends of peace, may save them from the 
calamities of war. But, on the other hand, if war be inevitable, 
it may reasonably be hoped, that the people, in their selection of 
characters, will choose those who are best qualified to conduct it. 
Unless, among our most respectable friends in the house, there is 
an absolute despair of success ; the measure will be brought for-

ward & I presume in the course of two or three days. The 
Speaker last evening, indeed, told me, he presumed it would be 
done on the 4th inst. — (Dayton is now in advance of the first 
rank of federalism.) It has not been thought prudent to pass it 
in the Senate with a possibility of rejection in the House. In this 
opinion I have fully concurred. Should it pass the House there 
is no doubt it will prevail in the Senate. Indeed I know no man, 
except our friend Bingham, who can be called federal, who will 
not vote for it. 

The President is daily rising in the opinion & affection of the 
well disposed ; and in the same proportion the second is becoming 
more & more an object of abhorrence & detestation. 

The conduct of our old friend Gerry has astonished all who 
were not intimately acquainted with him, but he has behaved 
much better than I expected — Nothing could have made me 
regret, but I now rejoice that I voted against his appointment. 

The plunderings of the french and still more the mad specula- 
tions which have been so extensively pursued by many in our 
country is the cause of great embarrassments. The rage to get 
rich without industry or economy was more general than can well 
be imagined. With the great destroyers, Morris & Greenleaf, who 
are in the gaol of this City, Wilson who is confined in Norfolk, 
Virga. &ca. &ca. there is hardly a county in any of the eastern 
States where there are not monuments of the prevailing mania. . . . 

I am very sincerely, 



Your friend

My Dear Sir : 

Your extreme inquietude occasioned by Mr. G's conduct will 
be much abated before this can reach you — his course has been 
indeed the most dangerous that cou'd have been taken & had the 
knowledge of it been possessed by our Jacobins six months ago 
it wou'd have enabled them to work great mischief, — our divisions 
wou'd have been more marked & confirmed ; at this time it is 
unpropitious but the evil is circumscribed, as all the follies &

weaknesses which have been exhibited at Paris are well known to 
his Great Patron they must necessarily produce great Chagrin & 
I sincerely wish he may never recollect how much his friends have 
differ'd from him in estimating Mr. G's character. Altho' I am 
happy in being disengaged from the political world yet I am too 
much interested in its events to refrain from observing them. I 
have expressed to you often my high opinion of the competency 
of G. B. to withstand all the power which France can possibly 
employ against her so long as her Govt, stands & the nation is 
politically united. I have sincerely wished that an invasion might 
be attempted not doubting that it wou'd issue in the disgrace of 
France, but I have at no time believed that so mad a project 
wou'd be executed. It will give you great pleasure to see by the 
public papers how fast our indignation rises against the French & 
that we are in a fair way to get rid of every tie which bound us to 
that seductive & perfidious nation — our people are learning every 
day that we have everything to fear from the arts of France & 
therefore are becoming reconciled to the trial of arms. This new 
state of things must bring new & interesting duties to our Minis- 
ter in London ; I know he will discharge them with ability & 
fidelity & I hope with success. Doubtless the British Govt. & in- 
deed every Statesman in Europe who is opposed to French Domi- 
nation, will rejoice to know that the United States are about to 
engage heartily on their side : it is true that we shall do little 
more at first than provide for our own defence, but we are capa- 
ble of greater efforts after we are fully engaged, & a variety of 
considerations unite to render our association in the war extremely 
favorable to G. B. ; we are at least sufficient for a make weight 
where the scales are so nearly even, & if our Destiny had thrown 
us on the other side, as we cou'd not remain neutral, G. B. must 
have yielded to so much discouragement. But I am fully per- 
suaded that G. B. in concert with the U. S. can command the ocean in 
opposition to all Europe, Russia alone excepted & if the war shou'd 
continue several years, these nations wou'd enjoy exclusively the 
Commerce of all America & Africa & the best part of Asia & 
Europe — the Colonies of France & the Nations subject to her 
power wou'd soon listen to the pleas of Necessity & wou'd volun- 
tarily receive the Commercial Ships of those who alone woud 
supply their wants. Already a fleet of armed Merchantmen have 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 355 

sailed from Boston carrying 130 Guns & as this spirit is extend- 
ing itself the little pirates from the West Indies will not be able 
to annoy us much in future ; our public vessels carrying from 14 
to 44 Guns will be increased to 40 or 50 in the course of the year 
& surely we are capable of doing much more. 

Vive vale.

R. King to Secretary of State. No. 83. 

London, July 2, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

We desire farther information respecting the views of France 
from the following extracts of the Paris papers. The project of 
sending Mr. Sottin, lately the Minister of Police, and other rest- 
less and skilful Intriguers, under the character of Consuls into 
our country is the same as that by which they have succeeded in 
overthrowing the Independence of Switzerland and other nations. 
If any thing could exceed the past insolence of France, it is the 
Mission of a corps of Revolutionary agents, under the masque of 
public characters, and who it is presumed (I hope and believe 
falsely) will be received and permitted to reside among us, after 
the repeated refusal and expulsion of our public Ministers. I 
think it is a bold step on the part of France, who certainly risques 
a refusal from us, which she has as yet nowhere received, and 
which would, in my opinion, exalt our character still higher in the 

eyes of Europe. 

With perfect Respect & Esteem &c.

R. King to A. Hamilton.* 

London, July 2, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

France will pursue with us the plan that she has elsewhere 
found successful. She will endeavour to overthrow us by the 
divisions among ourselves, which she will excite and support by 
all the means of which she is mistress. . . . 

If any thing could exceed the past insolence of France, it 
would be this attempt to plant in our chief towns a corps of revo- 
lutionary agents under the mask of public characters, and whom 
she expects, I hope falsely, that our government will receive and 
permit to reside among us, after having herself repeatedly refused 
and expelled from her territory our public ministers. . . . 

* Hamilton's Works, vi., 308. 



358 RUFUS KING. [1798 

Another arret of the Directory has added Havre to the ports 
into which our vessels are forbid an entry ; so that we cannot now 
enter the ports of Toulon, Rochefort, L'Orient, Brest, Dunkerque 
or Havre. Cadiz and the Texel are closed by the British squad- 
rons, and I apprehend that the Meuse will likewise be blockaded, 
as the British North Sea fleet is by this time reinforced by the 
Russian Squadron. 

We are still at a loss where Buonaparte is bound. He sailed 
from Toulon on the 19th of May. My opinion has been that 
Ireland was his object. At present, it seems to be the general 
opinion that he never intended to leave the Mediterranean. In a 
few days we must hear of him. The English confidently believe 
that he will fall into the hands of Admiral Nelson, who is in pur- 
suit of him. In Ireland, though for some months there will be 
partial and unimportant risings, the force of the insurrection is 
broken and the danger nearly over. The chiefs have been with- 
out character and without any intellect. There is no indication 
that they have received a single musket from France, and in gen- 
eral they are without arms, except pikes. There is but one suc- 
cessful remedy for Ireland, and it is that which has proved so 
successful with Scotland. Ireland, like Scotland, must become 
an integral part of the British Empire, or she will continue igno- 
rant, ill-governed, oppressed and wretched. 



Rufus King to W. Wickham. 

Great Cumberland Place, July 3, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

I take the liberty of sending you a list of American citizens in 
whose favor I think there would be a propriety in making an ex- 
ception in the proposed regulations respecting Aliens. The great 
number of American citizens residing in different parts of Great 
Britain for commercial and other purposes, seems to make it 
requisite, in order to satisfy the provisions of the alien law, that 
they should be enabled to obtain from our Consuls certificates of 
citizenship instead of being obliged to apply to me for that 
purpose. 

From the great prudence and good principles of our Consuls in 
this country I am persuaded that you will be safe from abuse in 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 359 

accepting their certificates in the place of mine. If this arrange- 
ment will be agreeable to you, which should extend to all the dis- 
tricts, I will transmit to you a list of our Consuls and furthermore 
send to them an instruction on this subject. I should hope like- 
wise that the certificates of our Consuls will be received in all 
applications for passports upon the arrival and departure of 
American citizens. To you who are frequently acquainted with 
the thousand things that occupy the attention of a foreign Minis- 
ter, it is needless to remark that an arrangement such as I propose 
must be a very great relief to me. 

With perfect respect & esteem. 

Rufus King. 

In despatch No. 84 to Secretary of State, etc., dated Lon- 
don, July 6, 1798, R. King says : 

" The late accounts from America, as is natural, have given 
very great satisfaction here ; and I should observe an improper 
reserve did I not add that all Parties unite in expressing their 
admiration of the conduct of the President. 

" With perfect Respect & Esteem &c. 

"Rufus King." 



Circular to Consuls. 

London, July 9, 1798. 
Sir: 

You will observe that with a few exceptions, the late Procla- 
mation requires all aliens to report themselves and obtain permis- 
sion to reside in Great Britain, and that no alien will be suffered 
to come and go without a Passport. As it would be inconvenient 
to our countrymen, dispersed as they are throughout this country 
and likewise to those from time to time arriving and departing to 
be obliged to apply to me for certificates of citizenship in order 
to obtain permission to reside, or passports to depart, the Duke 
of Portland has consented to my proposal, that our Consuls, in all 
cases relative to the alien regulations, shall give certificates of 
citizenship to such persons as shall in a satisfactory manner prove 
themselves entitled to the same, and that these certificates shall 
be received in like manner as mine heretofore have been. It is 
proper that I should recommend to you the greatest caution in 



360 RUFUS KING. [1798 

this business, and you will recollect that the certificate is merely 
to enable the person to whom it shall be granted, to conform to 
the Regulations of the alien laws, and that it is not to be con- 
founded with Certificates of Protection. You will therefore 
grant these certificates only to such Americans as are required to 
register themselves, to those who on their arrival . . . desire 
permission to land and reside here, and to those who want pass- 
ports to leave Great Britain ; tho' I think it probable that in the 
last class of cases your certificates will not be required, as the 
permission granted to those who shall have registered themselves 
will sufficiently identify them in their applications for passports 
to leave the country. 

With great Respect I am &c &c. 

Rufus King. 



R. King to A. Hamilton.* 

London, July 7th, 1798. 

Buonaparte has made the debut of the campaign by the easy 
though important conquest of Malta. The island has been sup- 
posed impregnable, and therefore was the depository of great 
wealth, removed thither from Italy. It contained likewise an ex- 
cellent arsenal, two or three ships of the line, and as many as 
6000 excellent seamen. It was the Maltese seamen who made 
the fine campaign under Suffrein in the East Indies during the 
American War. Sicily is near, and from thence the French will 
obtain provisions, should Admiral Nelson attempt to blockade 
the fleet in the harbor of Malta. Buonaparte may perhaps take 
possession of Sicily, after which Naples would almost fall of 
course. We are left to conjecture what are his ulterior plans. I 
don't perceive that it is believed that the English squadron can, 
owing to the tempestuous seas, maintain a long blockade. At 
Rastadt procrastination is the game. The French journalists 
amused themselves with calling it " the Eternal Congress." I see 
no likelihood of a concert upon the Continent against France. 
The struggle is left to England, who certainly maintains it with 
increased zeal and resolution. For some months past we have 
not a word about peace. No one appears to think that peace 

* Works of Hamilton, vi., 310. 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 361 

would bring safety. The affair of Ireland is nearly finished. 
Cornwallis has requested that no more troops should be sent to 
him and that those on their way should be countermanded. In 
this state of things we are (for so I consider our situation) forced 
into a war of defence. Have you received a former letter of mine 
on this subject ? It is of infinite importance that we are not de- 
ceived by ourselves or others. We must do more than merely 
defend. I still think that the object that I have before sug- 
gested, * demands all our consideration, wisdom and energy. 
Don't suppose that I would combine our fortunes with those of 
others. On the contrary, whatever our interest may require in 
regard to a co-operation with others, I am averse to indissoluble 
engagements with any one. The Continent of Europe cannot be 
saved, but this is no reason why America should likewise perish. 
France is the only nation that projects enterprises, or succeeds in 
putting them into execution ; all others are puzzled in a perpetual 
effort to find out and defeat the plans of France, without concert- 
ing and attempting to execute one that might give to France the 
disadvantage of defence. If we follow this course, I dread the 

issue. 

Farewell — yours &c. 

I am mortified with the probable result of the election in 
New York. Mr. Jay according to probability, is re-elected, but 
how very considerable has been the opposition. Besides what is 
to become of us, if we return such members to Congress, as I 
think it likely will compose a majority of our next delegation ? 



T. Pickering to R. King. No. 20. B. 

Department of State, July 9, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . An act was passed last week (July 7th), declaring " That 
the United States are of right freed and exonerated from the 
stipulations of the Treaties and of the Consular Convention here- 
tofore concluded between the United States and France, and that 
the same shall not henceforth be regarded as legally obligatory on 
the Government or citizens of the United States." 

An Act authorizing the expulsion of dangerous aliens was

362 RUFUS KING. [1798 

passed some days before, and a Bill from the Senate for punish- 
ing seditious persons and libellers will probably pass the House 
of Representatives to-morrow. . . . 

An addition is to be made to the Standing Army of eight or 
twelve Regiments, and the officers of the provisional army are to 
be appointed. . . . General Washington has been appointed 
Lieutenant General, with the command of all the armies of the 
United States, raised and to be raised. It is probable that he 
will accept the appointment. The spirit of the people continues 
rising. ... T. Pickering. 



R. Troup to R. King. 

New York, July 10, 1798. 
My Dear Sir : 

Yesterday the President approved the bill for annulling our 
Treaty and Consular Convention with France. The majority in 
the House of Representatives for this measure was about ten. 
The Bill passed the Senate yesterday, and the President must 
have had it with him but a very short time. . . . 

General Washington is appointed Lt. General and Commander 
in chief of our armies. . . . Congress have determined to pro- 
ceed to the immediate raising of an army of between 12 and 13000 
men ; and I have no doubt that an augmentation of it will soon 
take place. 

We are busily engaged in fortifying our harbour. The Gov- 
ernor has just issued a proclamation convening our Legislature at 
Albany on the 9th of August next to take our situation as a 
State, and particularly our harbour, into consideration. 

The 4th instant was celebrated with great animation and splen- 
dor here and in all other parts of the union, from which we have 
any accounts. A new troop of horse, commanded by our friend 
Giles and in elegant uniform, made their first appearance on that 
day and added much to the brilliancy of the scene. Our city 
resembles a camp rather than a commercial port. 

Addresses are still coming in to the President. They all, a 
very few solitary instances excepted, breathe the dignified and 
determined sentiments of freemen alive to the honor and sover- 
eignty of their country. Wherever there is a deviation from these 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 363 

sentiments the President undertakes to whip the addressers. The 
President seems to have all the ardor of youth and all the energies 
and firmness of meridian life. If we survive the struggle, as I 
have no doubt we shall, speaking of us as a nation, no man that 
has figured on our theatre, will go down to posterity with greater 
lustre than John Adams — I will not even except George Wash- 
ington. 

Last Saturday Capt. Decatur, who commands one of our sloops 
of war captured a French privateer schooner of 12 guns and 
seventy men near Egg Harbour. . . . This is the first capture 
that has been made. It is a good beginning and it has excited 
very agreeable sensations. Our coast is much freer than it has 
been of French Pirates. . . 

The spirits of our countrymen are highly elevated ; and you 
may proclaim it everywhere, that we will pay tribute to no nation, 
and that we shall water our soil with our blood and suffer every 
hardship before we yield to the imperious demand of any foreign 
nation. 

The last letter I wrote you, mentioned that Mr. Gerry's letters 
had removed disagreeable suspicions that had prevailed agt. him. 
I wrote my letter the instant after I had read Mr. Gerry's letters 
— before I had time to reflect, and before I had an opportunity of 
learning the public opinion. The truth is that upon reflection I 
dislike his letters and his conduct. They are both generally dis- 
liked. At a public dinner given by both Houses, or rather by 
members of both Houses of Congress, at which all the public 
officers in Philadelphia and many foreigners of distinction were 
present, Mr. Pinckney was toasted and Gerry was omitted. At 
almost all subsequent entertainments Pinckney and Marshall have 
been most honorably noticed and Gerry has been neglected. It 
is understood, and that from Marshall himself, that Gerry has 
suffered himself to be wheedled in Paris ; that he acted there in 
direct opposition to the wishes and decided opinions of Marshall 
and Pinckney ; and that Genl. Pinckney, before Mr. Marshall left 
France, spoke to Mr. Gerry in strong terms of contempt and 
indignation at his behaviour. . . . No two men, however can 
be more beloved and honored than Pinckney and Marshall. 
Their two memorials have made a deep impression on the public 
mind and have done more good in placing the conduct of our 



364 RUFUS KING. [1798 

government in its true point of light, than all that has been before 
said or written. . . . 

We are arresting some disorganizers here for libelling the 
President and Secretary of State — a Mr. Burk and a Doctor 
Smith — the former a late Irish emigrant and the latter, a late 
English emigrant, who was connected with Ld. G. Gordon in his 
famous riots — conduct a press in this city, which publishes a 
paper called the Time piece. Burr is much suspected to be in- 
terested in the press. It is confidently said he was security for 
the purchase money of the press. Dr. Smith is an elderly man — 
a brother of the famous Wm. Smith, late Chief Justice of Canada 
— and as he is a native of America, he claims to be a citizen of 
the United States. They are bound over to the next Circuit 
Court which will sit in September. Patterson will preside at it. 
Bache is under recognizance in Philadelphia for a similar offense. 
Burr and Rutgers — I mean the rich Col. of this city — are bail for 
Burk ; Smith's relations are his bail. It is determined to try 
whether we have strength enough to cause the constituted authori- 
ties to be respected. I have not a fraction of a doubt respecting 
the issue. . . . 

It is very grateful to our friends that you are now in London. 
It is of great importance that we should stand well with Great 
Britain ; and we have unbounded confidence in your dis- 
cretion. . . . 

Most affectionately your friend 

Rob. Troup. 

R. King to A. Hamilton. * 

London, July 14, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

I send you inclosed an interesting little piece addressed to 
Gallatin by a former citizen of Geneva. If translated and pub- 
lished it may do good. We have no news from the Mediterranean 
since the capture of Malta, nor can we do more than conjecture 
the future destination of Buonaparte. Turin with its arsenals is 
possessed by a French army ; so that Sardinia is at the feet of 
the Directory. The Emperor continues to recruit his armies, and 
is now laying up magazines in the Tyrol. His expenses are said 

* Works of Hamilton, vi., 313. 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 365 

to be equal to those of an open war, and his resources unequal to 
his present expenditures. Prussia manifests no inclination to 
enter into a new coalition against France, and there are who sus- 
pect a most intimate connection between those powers. In short 
the fate of Europe is as uncertain and difficult to understand as 
at any period of the war. It is at least ten days since the 
spirited measures passed in America must have been known in 
Paris. We are, therefore, anxious to learn the effect they have 
produced. They will be entirely disappointed, and my conjecture 
is, that, contrary to their wishes, their pride will drive them to 
declare war against us. On the 13th of June Gen. Pinckney was 
still at Lyons ; his daughter was much better, and he flattered 
himself with the expectation of being able to reach Bordeaux and 
to embark by the middle of this month. On the 26th of June, 
Mr. Gerry was at Paris, waiting, say letters from Americans who 
are about him, for the ultimatum of the Directory. Letters are 
sent in every direction by the Americans in Paris, which say that 
the Directory hold a conciliatory language, and that Mr. Gerry is 
in hopes to procure terms which will be honorable and satis- 
factory to his country. I thought it impossible that any future 
step of Mr. G. could exceed in* and what had passed when 
he decided to separate from his colleagues and remain at Paris,, 
but I was mistaken. His answer to Talleyrand's demands of the 
names of X, Y, and Z, place him in a more degraded light than I 
ever believed it possible that he or any other American citizen 
could be exhibited. 

I send you Bellamy's address. It, as well as all that has been 
published, serves to confirm the public detestation against the 
Directory. The American dispatches have been circulated 
throughout Europe, and have everywhere done much good and 
increased the reputation of the government. 



R. King to Lord Grenville. 

My Lord : Great Cumberland Place, July 14, 1798.

worth has not yet come to hand. I desire to be understood as 
merely transmitting the Proposition of the Dutch Directory, and 
not as expressing any sentiments of my own upon the subject or 
requesting those of the British Government. I ought neverthe- 
less to observe that I will with pleasure send to Mr. Murray such 
answer as it may be thought proper to make to this informal com- 
munication.

[Copy] 

W. V. Murray to Mr. King, &c, &c, London. 

The Hague, 29th June, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

I wrote day before yesterday by Mr. Wadsworth, your and my 
excellent friend. The object of my letter was to request you to 
obtain, if possible, some relaxation of the Govt, and orders of 
Great Britain in favor of the Dutch Herring Fishery. On the 24th 
instant their little fleet of Baasses ought to have cast nets. The 
proceeds of this annual tour at sea are deeply, almost essentially, 
important to the poor as provisions ; besides as their profits of the 
year's income to great bodies of poor fishermen, it is all in all. 

Sure I am that neither Great Britain nor the Prince of O. can 
wish to hurt these men, except as they may be considered with 
their boats as the involuntary means of Invasion. These means, 
I believe, have been suspended as far as they were intended to 
operate from this point of embarkation. * 

I understand that the boats lately in requisition are delivered 
up all through Flanders to their owners. To these men it was the 
usage of the Prince of Orange to show great personal kindness 
formerly. On this subject I have been spoken to by the Directory and 
requested to speak to you. I need not assure you that especially in 
the poorest state of her affairs, I would not knowingly, as I value 
my own country's safety, hurt Great Britain or thwart her strength. 
I wish it success. Pray inform me if anything can be done.

R. King to Right Honble. Lord Grenville. 

Great Cumberland Place, July 14, 1798. 
My Lord : 

I have this morning been informed that the Lords of the Coun- 
cil decline granting permission for the shipping to the United 
States of Copper in Sheets and Bolts, unless on my certificate that 
the same are for the use of the American Government. 

Exclusive of the demand which the American Government may- 
have for these articles very considerable quantities are wanted for 
the Merchant service, which would be exposed to embarrassments 
in case the permission heretofore granted to export the same shall 
in future be refused. As I understand that the Manufacturers 
can supply any quantity of these articles, and consequently the 
demands from America are not likely to interfere with those of 
the Naval Department of the Country, I take the liberty to re- 
quest your Lordship's interference in order that under proper 
cautions, permission may from time to time be given for the Ex- 
portation of Copper in Sheets and Bolts for the use of the Mer- 
chant Ships. 

In making this request I conform to an instruction that I have 
lately received from the American Government. 

With perfect Respect & Esteem &c. 

Rufus King. 



R. King to Secretary of State. No. 86. 

London, July 14, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

It is more than ten days since they must have known at Paris 
the spirited measures adopted by our Government ; we may there- 
fore every hour expect important information from that country. 
I think they will declare war against us ; that will essentially 
thwart their plans ; but their pride will not leave them an option. 

Sir Joseph Banks, the President of the Royal Society, a few 
days past received a letter dated the 6th of June from Dupont de 
Nemours, which states that he with a Delegation from the National 
Institute are going to the United States of America with the view 
of improving and extending the sciences : the letter adds that the 
Directory has given them the requisite passports, and, thro' Sir 



368 RUFUS KING. [1798 

Joseph, requests that passports from the British Government may 
likewise be granted to them. I have been informed that this 
mission of Philosophers meditates an establishment without the 
limits of the United States, and within the boundaries of Spain 
high up the Mississippi ; their objects can hardly be mistaken ; 
and notwithstanding the moderation and" character of Dupont, it 
is not probable that either the American or English Government 
will be disposed to give any encouragement to this mission of the 
Directory.* 

There is no news from the Mediterranean since the capture of 
Malta, and excepting the possession of Turin with its fine arsenal 
by a French army, I can add nothing to my last accounts of 
the situation on the Continent. We have a rumour that the 
American ships in the French ports are embargoed, and that all 
American citizens are to be immediately sent out of the Republic. 
Mr. Gerry, on the 26th ult? was still at Paris, waiting according 
to private letters from persons about him, for the ultimatum of 
the Directory ; General Pinckney was at Lyons on the 13th of 
June ; his daughter was then much better, and he hoped to be at 
Bordeaux and to embark by the 20th of this month. 

The day after the arrival of the last Packet from New York,. 
f in a Conference with Lord Grenville, he had heard with horror 
from Mr. Liston that in a conversation between you and him, you 
had intimated an idea that our Government might be disposed to 
countenance the establishment of a Republic of Blacks in St. Domingo. 
I replied that I had no knowledge of such intention and after saying

". . . I shall not be guilty of so much affectation of regard to science, as 
to be very willing to grant passports to Dupont de Nemours, or any other 
French philosophers, in the present situation of our Country. We have had 
too many French philosophers already, and I really begin to think, or rather 
to suspect, that learned academies, not under the immediate inspection and 
control of government, have disorganized the world, and are incompatible with 
social order. Mr. King judges correctly of the American government, that it 
has no disposition to give any encouragement to the mission of the Directory. 
I hope he conjectures equally well of the English." — Life and Works of J,

the conversation turned to other and less important Topics.

Thomas Pinckney to R. King. 

Charleston, 18 July, 1798. 
My dear Sir : 

The infirm state of my health rendered it necessary for me to 
leave Congress previous to their adjournment by which means 
your favor addressed to me in Philadelphia did not reach me 
until after a long & tedious journey I had returned home — the 
debates in Congress detailed in the Newspapers will long before 
you receive this have enabled you to give an answer to Sir 
Clement Cottrell on the subject of the present ; but lest this in- 
formation should by chance not have met your Eye, I have to 
inform you that I wrote to each branch of the Legislature relating 
to them the offers of the Courts of G. Britain and Spain to make 
me the customary present & asking their decision whether or not 
I should receive them — the Senate passed a resolution consenting 
to the acceptance, which Resolution was not concur'd in by the 
Representatives. No reason was assigned for this rejection but 
from the course of the debates it appeared that the Majority were 
actuated by general motives of policy & not by such as peculiarly 
related to either party. I am convinced that you either have or 
will put the refusal in its proper point of view, so that no umbrage 
may be taken where I believe none was intended to be given. 

The increased spirit of union which has lately been manifested 
in the United States & the general determination to support our 
independence at all hazard & against every assailant must have 
afforded you much satisfaction. This spirit, if not universal is as 
general as could have been expected — if there are any Americans 
still deceived concerning the views & intentions of the French 
toward us, nothing I think could have continued the delusion but 
the conduct of Mr. Gerry. I fear that to want of judgement in 
this character may be added qualities of a more criminal nature — 
The present questions which seem to divide the sentiments of the 
friends to our independence are an immediate declaration of war, 
& an Alliance with Great Britain. I am of opinion with those 

VOL. II. — 24 



370 RUFUS KING. [1798 

who are averse to both measures, preferring to go into the war if 
necessary without the declaration ; continuing our preparations 
for a vigorous opposition & actually repelling every aggression 
both at home & abroad until we see the effect of our late meas- 
ures, which I am well assured will astonish the French Govern- 
ment, whether or not they may cause any alteration in their coun- 
cils. And as to an Alliance offensive or defensive with any 
power on Earth I have a multitude of reasons too tedious to 
detail against that measure, one is founded on past experience, 
as we are now paying the penalty of a former engagement ; an- 
other is that I have no faith in these paper bonds when the 
pressure of circumstances tends to dissolve them ; a third is that 
these compacts must be neutral & might drag us on into war con- 
trary to our interest & inclinations when the cause of war may 
no longer exist ; but above all I wish us to stand on American 
ground — at least I wish the experiment fairly to be made ; if 
then we find we can not go alone, it will be time to call for 

assistance. 

Truly Yours 

Thomas Pinckney. 



R. King to Col. Pickering. 

Private, 

London, July 19, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

On the 14th inst Mr. Gerry was still at Paris, and the Ameri- 
cans about him continue by their letters which are sent in every 
direction to amuse their correspondents with Reports that the 
Directory hold a conciliatory language concerning America, and 
that Mr. G. has hopes that he shall be able to obtain for his Coun- 
try Terms that will be honorable and satisfactory. This is pre- 
cisely what the Directory must desire that he and they should 
say and circulate at the moment they expect a Rupture between 
the Two Countries. How he will justify his residence at Paris 
after the receit of the letter of Recall sent to him & his col- 
leagues I cannot conjecture ; he certainly feels and acts differ- 
ently from what most of his Countrymen would do in his 
situation. There is a most extraordinary and to me a most 
satisfactory contrast between his conduct and language and that 






1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 37 1 

of the President. So striking is the Difference that the question 
has been often asked, by those who do not understand our con- 
stitution, by whom our Ambassadors are appointed, and who has 
the power to recall them ; the supposition being that these powers 
do not reside in the President whose opinions are so much at 
variance with those manifested by Mr. Gerry. . . . 

We still have nothing more than vague Rumours concerning 
Buonaparte, and the squadron under Nelson since the capture of 
Malta. At Rastadt there is the appearancee of pretty firm Re- 
sistance to the last Note of the French ministers. But nothing 
positive or satisfactory can be inferred from the present Posture 
of negotiations there. 

As I have intimated to you would probably be the case, I per- 
ceive that numbers of the disaffected Irish will be expelled and 
that they will be disposed to plant themselves among us. It was 
the practice of the Emigrants from Scotland to bring with them 
Certificates from the religious Societies to which they belonged, 
of their honesty, sobriety and generally of their good Character ! 
Why should we not require some such Document from all Emi- 
grants, and it would be well to add to the Testimonial that the 
person to whom it was granted was not expelled from his Coun- 
try and had not been convicted of any crime. I am, I confess 
very anxious upon this subject. The contrast between New Eng- 
land and some other Parts of the U. S. is in my view a powerful 
admonition to us to observe greater caution in the admission of 
Foreigners among us. If from the emigrations of past time we 
have suffered inconvenience and our true national character has 
been disfigured, what are we to expect from the Emigrants of the 

present Day ? . . . 

With great haste 

R. K. 

R. Troup to R. King. 

New York, 24th July, 1798. 
My dear Sir : 

. . . I now enclose you Gen. Washington's acceptance of 

the command of our armies. This is much admired and thought 

to add another gem to that crown of glory he has so long worn. 

Congress have adjourned ; our Treaties with France are dis- 



372 RUFUS KING. [1798 

solved ; no declaration of war has taken place, although we are 
on both sides in a state of actual hostility. 

The temper of our countrymen is still continuing to mount 
higher and brighter. We shall not dishonour our country. . . . 
Our general officers are appointed. Hamilton is the first on the 
list as Inspector General, with the rank of Major General ; next 
to him is Pinckney, our Envoy to France as Major General ; then 
comes Knox as Major General. . . . 

God bless you

R. King to Secretary of State. No. 87. 

Margate, July 28, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

I have as you will suppose been much gratified with the late 
intelligence from America : if anything can preserve us from the 
distress and ruin which continue to extend themselves in Europe, 
it will be our thinking and acting concerning France with that 
wisdom and firmness of which the President gives us so illustrious 
an example. We shall not only thereby save our own country 
but we shall do more ; our example beyond what we imagine will 
encourage others to unite in that resistance which alone can res- 
cue Europe from Slavery and Barbarism. Men of all parties, and 
of every country agree in applauding the moderation, the justice 
and the wisdom of our Government, and never perhaps did the 
publication of any negociation more completely serve to decide 
and settle the public opinion than that of our mission to Paris 
has done. It has given reputation to our couutry, and besides 
been advantageous by closing the mouth of the apologists of 






1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 373 

France. I wish I could send you even a tolerable program re- 
specting the affairs of Europe. Many people think that great 
events depend on the success or failure of the Expedition, which 
nobody understands, of Buonaparte. We know nothing of con- 
sequence from the Mediterranean since the capture of Malta. A 
frigate returned from thence to Toulon with despatches and a 
general officer on board, has been met and captured by an Eng- 
lish frigate and we are told that Buonaparte with his fleet had left 
Malta two days before the English fleet that pursues him arrived 
there. The prevalent opinion is that there is a great probability 
that the French fleet will be overtaken and defeated. The con- 
ferences at Seltz between that Ex-director and Count Cobenzel, 
which it has been said related to the affair of Bernadotte at 
Vienna, have broken off, and, as is given out, without effecting 
their object. At Rastadt the ministers continue to exchange 
notes, and to protract the negociations as if the winding up of 
their business depended upon events that had not yet arrived. 
The conquest of Switzerland and the occupation of Turin by a 
French army enables the Directory to complete the Revolution of 
all Italy whenever they please. In Ireland the Rebellion is at an 
end, a general amnesty with a few exceptions will soon be pro- 
claimed ; many of the inferior chiefs will be permitted to go into 
exile. I have before intimated the probability of such a measure, 
and hope the President will have power to exclude from our 
country all such foreigners whose residence among us would be 
dangerous. England strong in her union and confident of her 
resources manfully resolves to maintain the struggle with the 
enemy ; no one speaks of peace ; and all seem to think and act 
as tho' arms alone could protect them from the misery that is suf- 
fered by the people of France. You may observe in some of the 
newspapers indications of a change in the Ministry ; no credit is 
due to them ; the Ministry undoubtedly possess as great, and per- 
haps a greater portion of public confidence and support than were 
ever bestowed upon any former administration, and in respect to 
the favor of the King, so long as they will continue the war, so long 
they will receive his protection ; indeed the opposition are too small to 
form from among themselves a new administration ; and could they 
do it, neither the King nor the Nation would confide in them* 

* Italics are in cipher. 



374 RUFUS KING. [1798 

I don't say this without the highest and most convincing proof 
that it is true. The Paris papers of the 13th give with fidelity the 
late news from Philadelphia. Mr. Gerry was still there ! Dupont 
(a letter from whom to his sister that lately fell into my hands is 
sent enclosed*) had arrived at Bordeaux after a short passage from 
New York. We may judge of his Report from the tenor of this 
letter. We have accounts from France, which tho' probable, need 
confirmation, that on the 9th instant an Embargo was laid on all 
American Ships, and yesterday there was a rumour that the same 
measure had been adopted in Holland. The French papers of 
the 10th are silent on this subject, tho' they mention the encreased 
probability of an open rupture with the United States. I have 
taken such measures as I think will give me early information on 
this subject, and in a certain event, I am prepared, to send out 
safe and expeditious intelligence thereof. 

With perfect Respect & Esteem &c. &c. 

Rufus King. 



R. King to Col. Hamilton. 

31st July, 1798. 

Dear Sir : 

You will believe that I have been much gratified with the late 
intelligence from home. France has calculated all her plans on 
our disunion, and the expectation that her friends if not more 
numerous would be more active and possess greater energy than 
the friends of our Government ; or rather she has believed that 
our Government like that of every country that she has succeeded 
to overturn and enslave, would act with such timidity and in 
so qualified a manner, that the affections and support of the 
People would be easily withdrawn from and even turned against 
it. If the Government continues to speak and act with decision, 
the people will become more and more united, and still better in- 
clined to execute its purposes. This opinion should be taken in 
connection with an observation (the importance of wh. appears 
to me the greater the oftener I consider it) that I have suggested 
in more than one of my late letters. The composition of ad- 
dresses and the forming of volunteer associations who will have

1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 375 

nothing to do, are for the present well ; but they will cease to be 
novelties and soon become tiresome, and to be secure you must 
have some sufficient object that will interest and employ the 
passions of the Nation. The mere defensive system of the 
enemies of France has been a principal cause of her success, and 
if we adopt the error we shall be exposed to greater Risques than 
by a bold and active system, which, exclusive of being the most 
certain means of safety, would promise the acquisition of great 
and lasting advantages. 

The Destiny of the new world, and I have a full and firm per- 
suasion that it will be both happy and glorious, is in our hands. 
We have a right and it is our duty to deliberate and act, not as 
secondaries, but as Principals. The object and the occasion are 
such as we ought not in respect to ourselves and others to suffer 
to pass unimproved. 

I have nothing to observe in reference to the subject of regret 
and complaint,* mentioned in your last letters. You will not 
doubt that all the means in my power have been employed to 
correct the mischief ; they have served only to convince me that 
it is incorrigible ; it is an evil too deeply rooted and too power- 
fully protected to be cured ; and it is something gained to know 
that it is so. If we are wise we shall have the agents that will 
place the remedy in our own hands. 

A Frigate returning from Malta to Toulon and a general officer 
has been captured by an English frigate, and we are told that 
Buonaparte had sailed on his expedition two days before the Eng. 
fleet that pursues him arrived there. If so, the French fleet is in 
great danger. Many persons think that great events depend on 
the success or failure of Buonaparte's expedition. All the late 

* Reference is probably here made to a letter of Hamilton, June 6th (vol. vi., 
p. 298), in which occurs the following passage : " How vexatious it is that at 
such a juncture there should be officers of Great Britain, who, actuated by a 
spirit of plunder, are doing the most violent things, calculated to check the 
proper amount of popular feeling (in the U. States), and to furnish weapons to 
the enemies of government," and mentioning several cases of outrages in the 
W. Indies, such as Cambauld's at the Mole, and the captures of vessels by 
Cochrane of the Thetis, he closes : " There seems a fatality in all this. It 
cannot be doubted that the British Cabinet must at this time desire to conciliate 
this country. It is to be hoped they will not want vigor to do it with effect, by 
punishing those who contravene the object." — Ed. 



376 RUFUS KING. [1798 

arrivals from Paris say a new storm is at hand ; but none ex- 
press a hope that the changes it may effect will render the condi- 
tion of France or of others better. Gerry still hangs about the 
Directory ! ! At Rastadt the Congress continues, and the jeal- 
ousies between Austria and Prussia artfully kept alive by the 
common Enemy, prevent that hearty union without which no suc- 
cessful cooperation will take place against France. 

In Ireland the Rebellion is suppressed, and our Government 
will I hope have the power and the inclination to exclude those 
disaffected characters, who will be suffered to seek an asylum 
among us. England is more than ever united and resolves with 
confidence in the superiority of her resources to prosecute the 
war. There is no talk of peace ; nor is there any appearance wh. 
wd. lead to an opinion that new overtures for that purpose are 
likely soon to be made. 

On the other hand France is extremely embarrassed any longer 
to find the money necessary to maintain her army and carry on 
the war. 

Be so kind as to present my affectionate respect and congratu- 
lations to the Governor. I ought to write to him, but I consider 
a letter to him or you as nearly the same. 

With great truth and attachment &c. Yrs. 

R. King. 

P. S. We have just heard that Gerry has received his passport. 

At the close of Talleyrand's letter, sending it, he says though 

the Directory, as a measure of precaution, has laid an embargo 

upon all American vessels, " telle est la repugnance du Directoire 

a. considerer les Etats Unis comme ennemis, que malgre leurs 

demonstrations hostiles, il veut attendre, qu' il y voit irresistible- 

ment force par des hostilites reelles."

July 31, 1798. 
My dear Sir : 

I give you a thousand thanks for three letters that I have lately 
received from you. They have given me more information and 
more satisfaction than all I had heard for the preceding six 
months. We are delighted with the firm and manly conduct of 
our Government. If any thing will save us from the Snares and 
Ruin prepared for us, it will be the resolute and plain Policy of 
which the President's conduct is so worthy an example. We 
everywhere gain applause and admiration ; even from those who 
have strong prejudices to overcome in speaking well of any of 
our measures. 

Such persons as have lately returned from Paris concur in their 
reports of the disappointment and chagrin of those who are most 
intimate with the Directory. Nothing can exceed the rage of the 
apostate Americans, who have so long misrepresented and dis- 
graced their country at Paris. Mr. Gerry remained there, when 

377 



378 RUFUS KING. [1798 

we last heard from thence. The information lately received from 
Philadelphia, which is to the 20th of June, has been received and 
published with tolerable fidelity in the French papers. The late 
law, authorizing the Directory to make domiciliary visits is the 
return of terror and forbodes another Revolution. The Expedi- 
tion agt, Engd. is of tedious preparation. 

The Rebellion in Ireland is suppressed and there is reason to 
believe, so numerous and vigilant have been the English ships of 
war, that not a single musket, nor a single officer have been landed 
in Ireland. If measures are not employed to prevent it, you will 
find that considerable numbers of the disaffected will seek an 
asylum among us. Notwithstanding all you may hear to the con- 
trary, England is more united than ever ; confident in her re- 
sources and, thoroughly convinced of the importance of the 
contest, she will manfully maintain it, until Peace can be obtained 
that will bring security. The French have demonstrated their 
inability in respect to the threatened invasion, in not having 
attempted even to succour Ireland whom she encouraged to 
revolt. If England is wise she will pursue a Policy that will here- 
after preserve her from that anxiety and expence to which she has 
been so often exposed by Ireland. Scotland was formerly equally 
troublesome ; but since the Union the Scots have been loyal ; the 
same measure would probably produce the same effects in Ireland. 

We are waiting with impatience for further news from the 
Mediterranean — At Rastadt nothing is decided and the Congress 
continues. The jealousies between Austria and Prussia prevent 
their union, without which both these nations must undergo a 
Revolution. Our Agent in the case of captures has just reed, 
from the Exchequer in payment of the awards of the commissrs. 
and of Sir Wm. Scott and Dr. Nicholl, about ^70,000 Sterling, 
and there is a prospect of a satisfactory termination of the cases 
of capture that fall within the purview of the Treaty. . . 

You have undoubtedly heard that here, as well as with you, all 
the country have been permitted to form volunteer corps — in the 
Parish of Mary-le-bone, the tradesmen associated and a proposal 
was made to appoint a number of half-pay officers to be their 
officers. General Arnold lives in that Parish, and a rumour circu- 
lated that he wished a command. The tradesmen met and re- 
solved that General Arnold, having once betrayed and deserted

his duty, ought never again to be trusted, and that they wd. never 

serve with him or under his command. 

Yours, 

R. King. 

P. S. We hear that Mr. Gerry has demanded and received his 
Passport. Mr. Talleyrand informs Mr. Gerry, " that notwithstand- 
ing the hostile preparations in America, the Directory will wait until 
they are forced by actual hostilities to declare war." They do 
not easily relinquish a plan, and they appear moderate and hum- 
ble, in hopes that we shall relax and that in the end they shall 
succeed. 

R. Ktng to Secretary of State. No. 88. 

London, August 1, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

It is confirmed that France has laid an Embargo on all Ameri- 
can vessels in her ports, and I have reason to apprehend that the 
same measure will be enforced in Holland. The knowledge of 
what has been done in France will hasten the departure of such 
of our ships as are in the Dutch ports. Excepting ten or twelve 
at Bordeaux, there are but few American vessels in the French 
ports, and I do not learn that the number is considerable in 
Holland. 

Mr. Gerry received his Passport on the 15th ulto., but was still 
at Paris on the 25th, tho' proposing to leave it to embark at 
Havre ; Genl. Pinckney has reached Bordeaux, where he ex- 
periences new embarrassments on account of the Embargo, but 
expects to receive permission to embark in the ship in which 
Dupont and others lately returned to France. I have sent you 
by various channels Talleyrand's last letter to Mr. Gerry, which 
having been published in Paris, has been republished here. You 
will doubtless regret that Mr. Gerry's unfortunate separation from 
his colleagues has furnished an occasion for some of the Remarks 
that this letter contains, the principal object of which, agreeable 
to the original and avowed hopes of the Directory, and which it 
appears they still cherish, is the establishment of that division 
among our People, and between them and the Government which 
will enable France to regulate the destinies of America, in the 
manner she continues to rule those of Europe. 



380 RUFUS KING, [1798 

We have intelligence from Boston as late as the 3d of July, and 
it is highly satisfactory ; but unless we are patient, firm and per- 
severing, and can thereby succeed to deprive France of the oppor- 
tunity of employing the means among ourselves upon which she 
relies to effect her purposes, we shall notwithstanding our promis- 
ing beginnings ultimately become the victims of her insidious and 
destructive policy. For consider the rapacity and insolence that 
she daily practises towards those who have unhappily fallen be- 
neath her power : she knows how to assume the language of 
justice and of moderation to others ; and to attain her object 
with deep dissimulation displays in the most captivating manner 
the images of candour, of sincerity and of Justice. My anxiety 
is lest our Country may be deceived by her false appearances, 
and after ail we have ourselves experienced, and after the dread- 
ful commentary upon French moderation and justice exhibited 
in the fate of the Swiss, that we shall find those among us who will 
become the advocates of a system that will prematurely bring the 
new world to that ruin, that has nearly overwhelmed the old. I 
am informed and I believe correctly, that the Reports of Volney 
which are in the highest degree gross and offensive in regard to 
our Government, represent the separation between the northern 
and southern States and between them and the western country, 
as events that nature has ordained and which France can with 
ease and advantage at any time effect. The Reports of Dupont 
differ in this respect from those of Volney, and the former also 
represent the people to be more united and better inclined to 
support their Government than the latter conceives them to 
be. . . .

I am very much obliged to you for the interesting information 

contained in your letter of the 31st July. The spirit which the 

United States continue to display in the present crisis of their 

affairs affords the best prospect, & the surest means, for the main- 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 38 1 

tenance of their consideration abroad & of their tranquillity at 
home. You know how sincerely I concur with you in every wish 
that you can form for the success of the wise & dignified measures 
which your Government is pursuing. 

In my opinion the tone of Talleyrand's last letter to Gerry on 
sending him his passport plainly shows that those measures have 
already produced a great part of the effect to be expected from 
them. But if this affectation of friendship & conciliation suc- 
ceeds in imposing upon your people, and induces them or their 
Government to relax its efforts, the whole of what has been done 
will be useless and the same course will be to be again pursued 
with less expectation of ultimate success. 

You know I am never very sanguine in what I say to you of 
continental affairs, in Europe. If all or any of those Powers 
whose ruin is either completed, or in the regular progress of com- 
pletion, had shown half the energy that has been displayed by 
the British & American People, they would have been safe, we 
should have been triumphant, and America would have been a 
tranquil and uninterested spectator of the troubles which the 
infernal spirit of atheism and modern Philosophy had produced 
in France. 

It would be too much to persuade oneself that they are yet 
fairly roused from their fatal Lethargy & impressed with a true 
sense of the nature of the crisis in which they are placed. There 
are however just now appearances more favourable with respect 
to Austria & Russia than we have lately been accustomed to see. 
Between the former of these Powers & Naples a defensive Alli- 
ance has been concluded for mutual support against France, and 
any attack by the French against Naples for receiving or supply- 
ing our ships (which the Neapolitan Govt, has engaged to do) is 
to be considered by Austria as a casus foederis. This stipulation 
seems to render a renewal of the War almost certain and Austria 
is preparing for it accordingly. The conferences at Seltz are 
entirely broken off. Cobenzel & Neuchateau had both orders to 
demand satisfaction on the affair of Bernadotte, and as neither 
was authorized to give it, nothing was settled on that head. Co- 
benzel had also orders to remonstrate & treat on the subject of 
the Italian & Swiss revolutions since Campo-Formio, & Neuchateau 
refused to talk on these events which had happened, as he said, 



382 RUFUS KING. [1798 

by the will of the Italian & Helvetic nations ! Nothing was there- 
fore agreed to, but the whole negotiation was referred back to the 
ordinary channels of intercourse, the negotiators separated, as 
I learn, with great mutual politeness. 

I mention these particulars to you in confidence not to be 
talked of here, but with such liberty to state them to your Gov- 
ernment to whom I conceive it may be important to be accurately 
informed of them. If there was more energy & union on the 
continent, I should think the prospects of the present moment 
very favourable, but be the conduct or the state of the continent 
what it may you [may] be assured that neither the principles nor 
the conduct of this Country will vary.* 

Believe me ever with the most sincere regard, dear Sir, your 

most faithful humbl. servt. 

Grenville. 



R. King to Secretary of State. No. 90. 

Margate, August 5, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

The last Paris papers, which are to the 30th of July, are un- 
interesting ; but the information from thence by Dover & Ham- 
burgh confirms the inference that may be drawn from Talleyrand's 
farewell letter to Mr. Gerry, that the spirit of our people and the 
wise and dignified conduct of our Government have already pro- 
duced a great part of the effect to be expected from them. 
Should however this affectation of friendship and conciliation suc- 
ceed in imposing upon our people, or should it induce them or 
our Government to relax in the only sure means of saving the 
Country, the whole of what has been done will be useless, and 
the same course will be to be again pursued with less expectation 
of ultimate success. Difficult as it undoubtedly is with the best 
and most regular information, to form a correct opinion respect- 
ing the affairs of Europe, I shall forever believe that if those 
powers whose ruin is either completed, or in the progress of being 
so, had shown half the energy that continues to be displayed by

tains the information given by Lord Grenville used generally in the language of

the people of America, they would have been safe, England 
would long since have been at peace, and we should have 
remained the tranquil and uninterested spectator of the troubles 
which the infernal spirit of atheism and modern philosophy had 
produced in France. When the enslaved nations will awake 
from their lethargy cannot be predicted, and it would be too 
much to persuade ourselves that they or those, who are on the 
eve of ruin, are yet fairly roused or fully impressed with the crisis 
in which they are placed. 

But I have this moment learned, and you may give full credit 
to the information, that there are just now appearances more 
favorable, and particularly in respect to Austria and Prussia than 
we have lately been accustomed to see. Between the former and 
Naples a defensive alliance has been concluded for mutual sup- 
port against France ; and any attack by the French against 
Naples for receiving or supplying the British ships of war, which 
the Neapolitan Government has engaged to do, is to be consid- 
ered by Austria as a Casus foederis ! This expectation, so very 
important in the present posture of affairs in the Mediterranean, 
seems to render the renewal of the war almost certain, and Austria 
is accordingly preparing for it. Through the same channel that 
I have obtained this highly interesting intelligence, I also learn 
that Cobenzel and Neufchateau in their conference at Seltz have 
orders to demand satisfaction in the affair of Bernadotte ; and 
as neither was authorized to give it, nothing was settled on that 
head. Cobenzel had also orders to remonstrate and treat on the 
subject of the Italian and Swiss Revolutions since the Treaty of 
"Campo Formio ; the Ex-director refused to talk on these events 
which had happened, he said, by the will of the Italian and Hel- 
vetic nations. 

Nothing was therefore agreed, but the whole negociation was 
referred back to the ordinary channels of intercourse, and the 
negociators separated, as I hear, with great mutual politeness. I 
hope to be able to send this letter by the Packet, tho' the mail 
has been despatched, as I consider it to be of great consequence 
that the President should receive the earliest information of the 
present and probable state of Europe ; respecting which if there 
was greater energy and union upon the Continent, the prospects 
of the present moment might be considered as favorable. But

let the conduct or condition of the continent be what it may, I 
am assured that neither the principles nor the conduct of this 
country will vary. 

With perfect Respect and Esteem &c. &c.

R. King to Lord Spencer. 

Great Cumberland Place, nth August, 1798. 

Mr. King presents his compliments to Lord Spencer, and has 
the honor to inform his Lordship that the American Brigantine 
Sophia Master which the Government of the U. S. some- 
times since dispatched to France for the purpose of bringing from 
thence their Envoys at Paris, is now arrived at Spithead with 
Elbridge Gerry Esq, one of their Envoys, on board. 

The Sophia was forced to put into Portsmouth in order to es- 
cape a French Privateer which they had every reason to believe 
was in pursuit of them. She had also been stopt, soon after leav- 
ing Havre, by the British Frigate Niger, Capt. Woodhouse, from 
whom Mr. Gerry received every mark of the most polite attention. 
Mr. Gerry being desirous of prosecuting his voyage with all possible 
expedition, and anxious to prevent future interruptions by his 
Majesty's Ships of War, has sent a confidential person to Town, 
with directions to Mr. King to apply immediately for letters of 
safe conduct from the English Government, addressed to the 
Commanders and officers of its fleets. 

In compliance, therefore, with this request, Mr. King takes the 
liberty of soliciting the necessary Passport and flatters himself 
that he cannot in any manner so effectually and readily obtain it 
as in Lord Spencer's interference ; he confides in his Lordship's 
giving every facility to Mr. Gerry, not only in consideration of 
his public character, but of his being personally the intimate friend 
of Mr. King.

Mr. Nepean presents his compliments to Mr. King, has the 
honor of enclosing to him the Protection he has desired. 

Mr. Nepean imagines that no great difficulty would arise in ac- 
commodating Mr. Gerry on board the Cleopatra, charged with 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 385 

the outward bound Convoy to America, if he or Mr. King should 
have any particular wishes on that head. Mr. Nepean opened 
Mr. King's letter in Lord Spencer's absence. 
Admiralty, Saturday Afternoon. 



R. King to Elbridge Gerry. 

London, Aug. 13, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

Your letter of the 10th arrived at my office on Saturday, and 
was sent that evening to me at Margate, which place I left the 
next morning before the arrival of the mail ; by the return post 
however I have at length received it. On Saturday Mr. Munro 
sent you my Passport which cannot be of any use to you ; he had 
and as I conceive agreeable to your desire, applied for and by this 
mail has sent you a Passport from the Lords Commissioners of the 
Admiralty. 

I am extremely sorry that my absence from town prevented my 
receiving your letter on Saturday, as in that case I should have 
gone immediately to Portsmouth to meet you ; I still hope for 
that pleasure and it will afford me much satisfaction to receive 
you in London ; the visit cannot be uninteresting to you, and with 
the belief that you will have both time and inclination, I have just 
sent Mr, Munro to the Duke of Portland's office to procure and 
forward to you the requisite Passport. 

I should not put our meeting upon this footing, but would be 
with you to-morrow morning, was I not obliged to be in town both 
to-morrow and the day after. If, however, you shall feel any dis- 
inclination to come hither and will wait, which the adverse winds 
are likely to compel you to do, I will meet you at Portsmouth on 
Thursday. 

Our accounts from home are as late as the 10th of July ; tho' 
not official, I believe them authentic. You already know the 
tenor of the Laws for the Protection of our Commerce, and like- 
wise of those which authorize the Capture of French Privateers. 
The Law suspending all commercial intercourse with France and 
her Dominions has been followed by another declaring all our 
treaties with that nation void ; and I have seen in a Norfolk pa- 



386 RUFUS KING. [i798 

per of the 5th of July the copy of a Bill that had been twice read 
in the Senate of the U. S., which, after reciting the French ag- 
gressions, enacts that the Government and People of France and 
of their Dependencies are to be deemed Enemies of the U. S., 
and that any person owing allegiance to the U. S. who shall ad- 
here to them, giving them aid and comfort shall be deemed a 
Traitor, and on conviction suffer death. 

A private letter that has been shown to me from Baltimore of 
the 10th of July states that Colonel McHenry, Secretary of War, 
was then there on his way to meet General Washington, who had 
been appointed Commander of the Army which he has accepted. 

With respect to this Country, you will naturally suppose that 
the intelligence from America is received with great satisfaction. 
Upon this and other important points, a meeting between us, 
would, in my opinion, be advantageous to our Country. I have 
but a moment before the mail closes to renew my assurances of 
Esteem and to beg you to believe me your faithful friend. 

R. K. 



R. King to Elbridge Gerry, Esq. 

London, August 14th, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

I have had the pleasure to receive your Letter of yesterday, and 
as the winds continue unfavorable, I am in great hopes that we 
shall have an opportunity of meeting before you sail. 

If you do not come to London, but remain at Spithead, I will 
see you there on Thursday. Your letter of to-morrow in answer 
to mine of yesterday will regulate my conduct in this respect. 

I have very strong reason to believe that a person has been 
sent from France to Philadelphia, with a commission not friendly 
to the U. S. ; but under what assumed name, or on what ship he 
went over I don't know. By this mail I have sent to our Con- 
sular Agent at Portsmouth a despatch to Col. Pickering with 
instructions to send it together with a Packet of newspapers on 
board the Sophia, if she has not sailed. 

I am, Dear Sir, your ob. & faithful friend. 

Rufus King.

R. King to Secretary of State. No. 91. 

London, Augt. 14, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

Mr. Gerry sailed from Havre on the evening of the 8th, and 
was chased into Portsmouth on the 10th by a French Lugger, 
which he conjectures was sent to sea for the purpose of intercept- 
ing him notwithstanding his Passports. 

I have by his desire sent him a Passport from the Lords Com- 
missioners of the Admiralty ; and although from his letter to me 
I perceive that he is anxious to proceed on his voyage without 
delay, I have desired him to come to London, thinking that our 
meeting might be of public advantage. If he should be disin- 
clined to leave his ship, or to come here, I have informed him that 
I will meet him at Portsmouth on the 16th, before which my en- 
gagements do not permit me to leave London. 

Several letters of a later date than those heretofore noticed 
passed between Mr. Gerry and Mr. Talleyrand before the former 
left France ; the last which was received by Mr. Gerry at Havre 
announces the Arrete of the Directory of the 31st of July con- 
cerning the Privateers of the West Indies. This arrete is pub- 
lished in all the papers. 

I lose no time to inform you that Duverne de Praisle, who un- 
der the name of betrayed the cause of the Royalists in 
France, has been sent to Philadelphia with his sister (with whom 
he lived in a state of prostitution) and that I have very strong 
reason to believe that some commission, not friendly to the United 
States has been given to him. 

He is an officer of the Army, a man of talents, and unlike 
most of his countrymen, cautious and discreet. I don't know 
under what name or in what ship he went over ; but he may be 
discovered by his conversation, which, with all his reserve, habitu- 
ally turns on the countries he has visited ; which are America 
where he served in de Grasse's fleet ; England where he was some- 
time a prisoner, in 1782 ; and the Black Sea, where he was sent 
to assist in taking a survey of the coasts. He is remarkable from 
an uncommon dark and downcast look, tho' he has sharp eyes ; 
he is about five feet seven or eight inches high, and has a swing 
in his walk like that of seamen. His sister, tho' somewhat better 



388 RUFUS KING. [l798 

looking is not unlike him ; they have a child the issue of their 
incestuous connexion. 

I have no letter from you later than your number 13. 
With perfect Respect & Esteem &c &c 

Rufus King. 

P. S. I have just received a second letter from Mr. Gerry in 
which he informs me that it turns out to have been an English 
and not a French Lugger that chased him into Spithead. The 
Commander of the Lugger by order of his superior officer has 
waited upon Mr. Gerry and made an apology for having chased 
the Sophia. As Mr. Gerry appears to be anxious to reach 
America with the greatest expedition, I am apprehensive that I 
shall not have an opportunity of meeting him. 

2d P. S. By the Hamburgh Mail that has just arrived, I am in- 
formed that on the 27th ulto. Dr. Logan arrived there on a Danish 
vessel. He kept himself very quiet, waited on the French agent 
there, but not on the American Consul. He is said to have been 
charged with letters from Mr. Jefferson and others for Fayette, 
Merlin and Talleyrand : the French agent without hesitation gave 
him a Passport for Paris where he expressed much anxiety to 
arrive before Mr. Gerry's departure ; but in this he has been dis- 
appointed. He gave the idea of being sent by the American 
Government, and that his mission required expedition & secrecy. 
I shall probably know what was the tenor of his conversation at 
Hamburgh, and will, if of any consequence, hereafter communi- 
cate it to you. 

I know the Doctor and am at no loss to understand the object 
of his Mission. 



R. King to Elbridge Gerry. 

London, 12 p.m., 15th Augt., 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

I have this moment received by Express yours of this date. I 

should have been on my way to meet you, but not receiving any 

answer to my letter of the 13th in course by the mail that arrived 

this morning, I concluded that you had sailed before it reached 

Portsmouth. This I the more regret, as it is now impossible that 



1 7 98 J LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 389 

I can arrive at Portsmouth within the time that you prescribed. I 

am therefore reluctantly obliged to give up the hope that I had 

entertained of an interview with you before your return. . . . 

Wishing you a safe and Expeditious Passage, 

I have the honor to remain, Dr. Sir, Your ob. & faithful St.

R. King to Wm. V. Murray. 

In W. V. Murray's Cipher. 

London, Aug. 16, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

It is almost certain that the war will soon be renewed, at least 
between Austria and France. The political timidity of Prussia 
will prevent the king from acting ; but a war with Austria sup- 
ported by Russia would favor any disposition that may exist in 
Holland to emancipate themselves from France. It will be diffi- 
cult for England by any formal act to discard the Prince of 
Orange, tho' as I have before told you, and as the past history of 
England and Holland proves, the non-existence of the Stadthold- 
erate will not impede a friendly and useful connexion and Treaty 
between the two Countries : a reform would perhaps be preferable 
to an abolition of the Stadtholderate. 

Wadsworth has reported to me a conversation with Shimmel- 
pennick that passed, I believe, in your presence, and which may 
be made the commencement of at least an informal negociation 
between Holland and England. No one can approve the old 
constitution of Holland. England desires to see, and would 
gladly assist in, any suitable manner to establish a rational, free, 
and efficient Government in that Country : she would engage 
to all persons perfect security against every sort of personal or 
other inconvenience on account of the past and would moreover 
become the guaranty against the abuse, which might be appre- 
hended from the weakness of the Prince of Orange. 

The portion of authority which he or his family should retain 
in the new System, would be matter proper for discussion, and you 
may say that a person on the part of England will meet such per-

son on the part of Holland, by which I mean all the Provinces, as 
shall be sent to any convenient place that they shall name con- 
fidentially to confer upon these important concerns.*

R. King to Right Honorable Henry Dundas. 

London, Aug. 16, 1798. 
Sir : 

I take the liberty to send you the enclosed, a copy of a letter 
that I have received from Mr. Lane, a merchant in the city, who 
is the agent of Mr. Derby a respectable citizen and merchant of 
the United States. 

Mr. Derby is desirous of sending, with the utmost expedition a 
small ship to Bengal for the purpose of purchasing and exporting 
from thence to the United States, a cargo of Saltpetre : this he 
cannot do without the permission of his Majesty's Government. 
Notwithstanding I have on a former occasion obtained thro' your 
interference for my countryman Mr. Babcock a permission to ex- 
port a quantity of Saltpetre from Bengal to the United States, I 
should feel some hesitation in repeating the application, did not 
the present situation of the United States, and a precise instruc- 
tion that I have lately received from the President, make it my 
duty to give all the aid and encouragement in my power to our 
Merchants to carry to the United States every species of military 
stores, the acquisition of which is daily becoming more important 
to us. 

Under these circumstances, so different from those which have 
heretofore existed, I take the liberty to request your interference 
in order that permission may be given under such cautions as may 

be thought requisite to Bullock, Master of the American 

Ship Benjamin, belonging to Elias D. Derby to purchase at Cal- 
cutta 130 tons of Saltpetre and to export the same from thence 
directly to the United States. 

With perfect Consideration and Respect, &c, &c.

R. King to Rt. Hon. Lord Grenville. 

Great Cumberland Place, Aug. 16, 1798. 
My Lord : 

I have been instructed to cause to be purchased and sent to the 
United States with the least possible delay 25000 muskets, as 
many Iron cannon for the naval service, consisting of equal num- 
bers of 24. 18. 12. 9. 6. & 4. pounders as can be purchased for 
^6000 sterling, and of Iron cannon for the land service, consist- 
ing of 32. 24. 18. 12. & 9. pounders, as can be purchased 
for ^4000 Sterling, and I have reason to expect orders for a 
farther supply. 

It is my wish that this order should be executed in such man- 
ner as shall least interfere with the system of the Ordnance De- 
partment. Several of the Manufacturers of Birmingham inform 
me that they can manufacture more arms than are at present de- 
manded by the Ordnance Department. I mention this circum- 
stance with a view that the Government orders may be enlarged 
in case that it shall on consideration appear adviseable that the 
supply we want should be furnished from the Tower. As it is my 
intention to send these military Stores by several vessels, a de- 
livery of them by parcels will suit as well as to receive them all 
together. It is however of very great importance to us that we 
obtain them as soon as possible. 

With perfect Consideration & Respect, 

Rufus King.

New York, Aug. 16, 1798. 
My Dear Sir : 

. . . The President is at Braintree. On his way he met with 
every mark of distinguished attention. Here his reception was 
the most splendid I have ever seen. . . . 

Philadelphia is again visited with the yellow fever. It is said 

to be as malignant as it was in the year 1793. The consequence 

is that the inhabitants are generally leaving it. Almost all 

the public offices are removed to Trenton. We are healthy 

here. . . . 

Very truly yours 

Rob. Troup. 



392 RUFUS KING. [1798 

R. King to Secretary of State. No. 93. 

London, Augt. 17, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

I have not succeeded in effecting an interview with Mr. Gerry, 
who probably sailed from Portsmouth last evening or this 
morning. 

We have a report that Congress have passed a law annulling 
all our Treaties with France ; should this be true the moderate 
tone manifested in the late Letters of Mr. Talleyrand may prob- 
ably change. It is not my duty to make comments upon the 
effect already produced by the firmness that I so much admire 
in our Government, but I cannot suppress the expression of my 
anxious hope that we shall test the sincerity of these conciliatory 
overtures by the past conduct of France towards other powers, as 
well as by her present treatment of our citizens, of their Property 
under the unrecalled arretes respecting the Trade of Neutrals. 
We should constantly remember that the Tiger crouches before he 
leaps upon his prey* 

In a conference that I had yesterday with Lord Grenville, he 
assured me of every facility in their power in the execution of an 
order for arms that I have received from the Secretary of the 
Treasury. We cotiversed upon the new state of things that would 
arise upon the abolition of the Treaties between us and France. He 
intimated a wish that the two articles in our Treaty respecting Ships 
of War, Privateers and their Prizes might be revised, in order that 
they should become more precise and less liable to misconception 
or disagreements ; he suggested the expediency of abolishing the dis- 
tinction between National Ships and Privateers, from the difficulty 
i?i certain cases of distinguishing the one fro??i the other, it being a 
practice with the French to lend their Frigates to private adventurers 
and then again to employ them in the national service j he said he 
hoped to be understood as not wishing to hasten any measures 
of this nature, but merely as suggesting a subject that might be- 
come of consequence seasonably to attend to, and added that he should 
write to Mr. Liston to this effect. I told his Lordship that I was 
without any late i?iformation from Philadelphia, that I heard of 
the Laws having passed to which he referred, but that I had no 

* Italics in cipher. 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESFONDENCE. 393 

certain account of it j that such a measure opened a new and extensive 
view of the affairs of the United States and of Great Britain, and 
one so different fr 07n that which had heretofore existed that I could 
not consider any instruction of antecedent date as in any degree ap- 
plicable to such a new state of things j that I was however per- 
suaded that we should be disposed to consider and explain any of the 
Articles of our Treaty so as to avoid misconceptions or disagree- 
ments about their meaning ; that it undoubtedly occurred to him 
that the duration of the commercial parts of the Treaty depends upon 
the Settlemetit of certain points not cojicluded betiveen him and Mr. 
y^ay, and upon the adjustment of the West India Trade ; that con- 
sequently the maritime Regulatio7is to which he had alluded, and 
which would become so important by an elder Treaty than that which 
should exist between France and the United States, would depend 
upon a satisfactory and seasonable agree??ient upon these imsettled 
points. He replied that he was quite aware of this circumstance ; 
that for his own part he had no hesitatio?i to say to 7ne that he 
thought the state of the Conti7ient dubious j that a ce7itury perhaps 
would not restore it to what it was ten years ago j that he felt 77iore 
and 77iore encouraged i7i the union of the people of Great Britai7i a7id 
in their ability to outlive the stor77i j but that they must essetitially 
cha7ige their co7inectio7i ; that they 77iust look to A7nerica instead of 
Europe, a7id from its i7icrease a7id prosperity they hoped and expected 
to find what they should lose i7i Europe ; they therefore should be 
prepared at a proper time to go into the consideration of the subject 
with a sincere desire of an arra7ige7ne7it that bei7ig 77iutually bene- 
ficial a7id satisfactory should pro7nise to be durable. 

Our Conference here took a turn to the probability of the Revo- 
lution of S. A77ierica ; he was fuller and more explicit than he had 
been on any former occasion, always understanding that 77iy con- 
versatio7i on this subject was personal and wholly U7iautho7'ized. 
This digression which treated of the practicability a7id of the 77ieans 
of effecting the ?7ieasure, tended to shew to me that they have at 
times considered and co77ibi7ied with their vieivs of a future connectio7i 
with the U7iited States, the i7idepe7ide7ice of the Spa/iish Co7iti7ie7ital 
Colo7iies. I did not perceive, nor do I believe it to be the case, 
that they have a7iy recent infor77iatio7i of the prese7it Temper, disposi- 
tion or pla7is of these Colo7iies, a knowledge 77iore easily procured 
fro77i the United States than froi7i Europe and which is indispensably 



394 RUFUS KING. [1798 

requisite to the success of an enterprize to accomplish the Revolution. 
He spoke of the government to be established in those as a Revolu- 
tion. He thought our System would attract and receive their appro- 
bation, and made some remarks upon the apprehensions to be enter- 
tained on account of their genius and character, which especially 
in Peru was said to be highly animated and full of enthusiasm ; 
and concluded by observing that he was more and more con- 
firmed in the opinion, that none but Englishmen and their Descend- 
ants knew how to make a Revolution. 

Another subject of some consequence to others was discussed in 
this conference, a Report of which I must defer until my next 
Dispatch. 

We have nothing by the last mails from the Continent and are 
still ignorant of the destination and fate of Buonaparte. Russia 
has become alarmed lest Greece is the object, the revolution of 
which would begin that of her Do7ninions j the reappearance of 
Kosciusko in Europe has increased the inquietudes of Russia. A 
late Treaty between the two Emperors stipulates a succour of 16 
thousand men to Austria in case of a renewal of the war with 
France. The force is inconsiderable, but knowing the character of 
the Emperor Paul, the engagement is a beginning and in this light 
very important. It is more and more confirmed that the political 
timidity of Prussia will prevent the king from engaging in the war. 
Prince Repnin has entirely failed in his object, and is about leaving 
Berlin. The great business of Seyes is to convince this monarch 
of the interest that the Nation has to remain quiet and to grow rich, 
while their neighbours are distracted and i?npoverished. The delu- 
sion will be seen when it is too late. 

With perfect Respect and Esteem &c. &c.

Great Cumberland Place, Aug. 17, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

I am very glad that you have asked my advice in the prosecu- 
tion of an appeal from a Vice-Admiralty Decree, concerning a 
quantity of iod. nails as contraband of war. Several decrees of 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 395 



this character have been rendered particularly by the upright and 
learned judge Cambauld, who has gone further, and on account 
of the delinquency of the neutral for carrying to the enemy in 
some cases, a bale of Osnaburgs, which instead of being em- 
ployed for sails, are used for negro clothing ; and in others, a 
cask of nails, which instead of being used for Ship Building are 
employed in House Building, has condemned the Ship and the 
residue of the Cargo. It is true that small nails and even Brads 
are used in finishing the Cabin of a vessel ; but as well might the 
Admiralty Court condemn Window Glass, because this article is 
used in glazing the windows of a ship's cabin, or leather, be- 
cause it serves to prepare the Boxes of the pumps, as they can 
condemn any species of nails beneath the size of what is called 
Dock Nails, a smaller sort of spikes, and which are the only nails 
that can with common sense be alleged to serve directly to the 
equipment of Vessels. 

That in the provincial Courts of Admiralty such decisions may 
have happened, when we know the character and capacity of 
some of the judges, is not to be wondered at ; but that in the 
High Court of Admiralty, especially in the Court of Appeals, a 
decree so entirely preposterous should be even apprehended is 
truly surprizing. I will never believe it possible, until it has 
actually been given, and the sooner we decide the question the 
better. A trial cannot be had in any case, in which, according to 
your statement, the point will be more simple and easy to be 
settled. 

I therefore desire that you will by all means, prosecute the 
appeal, before the Lords ; that you may perceive that on this 
occasion I follow the sentiments of our Government, I transmit 
to you the extract of a Letter that I have received from the 
Secretary of State, which shows the importance of a decision that 
shall put this question at rest. 

With great Esteem &c. &c. 

Rufus King. 

P. S. I need not remark to you that the supply of nails for the 
building of mills & houses and particularly for Negroes is a valua- 
ble branch of the American West India Commerce.

Parliament Street, 18th August, 1798. 
Sir: 

I have received the honor of your letter of the 16th instant, 
enclosing a letter from Mr. Lane, a Merchant in the City of Lon- 
don, stating that his Correspondent Mr. Derby of Salem in the 
United States, is desirous of sending a Ship to Bengal for the 
purpose of exporting from thence to the United States a Cargo of 
Saltpetre. 

Independent of any personal consideration, which would induce 
me at all times to pay attention to any wish of yours, I can have 
no hesitation in contributing to afford every possible facility to 
the Government of the United States, which my influence with 
the East India Company can tend to procure, and I shall instantly 
forward your application to the Court of Directors, who I flatter 
myself will feel no hesitation in complying with your wish. 
I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obed. humble St. 

Henry Dundas. 



G. Cabot to R. King. 

August 18, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

I am just now favored with your's of the 12th & 26th of May. 
You are in the midst of great events which occupy the attention 
of the whole world & for whose issue we feel a particular solici- 
tude. We speculate more on what is passing on your side the 
water than the affairs which are transacting here ; indeed it is 
impossible we shou'd not see that our destiny is involved in the 
fate of Europe. If France succeeds in executing the projects of 
her mad ambition, it appears to me a Feudal System worse than the 
old will be established over the whole face of the civilized world. 
We shall see only two sorts of people Soldiers 6° Slaves. While 
conjecture is rambling everywhere with the Toulon Fleet I have 
ventured to opine that they are gone into the Euxine in concur- 
rence with the Turks to attack the Russians in that quarter &

thus to divert their force from the borders of the Baltic. There 
Germany may be also checked, & there the disaffected Polanders 
may be easily rallied. If such is the object, its first success may 
be great, resulting from surprise & from a security against the 
Fleets of England which wou'd be shut out from the passage of the 
Dardanelles : but it wou'd ultimately be favorable to England by 
engaging Russia to act with vigor against all the undertakings of 
France. If however Nelson overtakes them I expect a profit- 
able victory & this wou'd seem to be certain if the French are not 
acting in concert with the Turks. 

Our accounts from Ireland are to the first week in June & are 
affecting — if the Govt, succeeds however in fully suppressing the 
Insurrection as is expected no one can doubt that the power of 
G. B. will be greater than before ; the anxieties about Ireland will 
cease & the Royal army there will form a new security against the 
French. 

I saw the P last week at Quincy, he is extremely dissatisfied, 
(I think), with Gerry ; he maintains however that he can do no 
harm now, but he supposes the Directory will try new artifices to 
restore their party here. I think Congress will be called together 
early in November if anything occurs to render it expedient. You 
will see that they have not done enough altho' they have done 
many good things. We are still tainted with Jacobinism in 
various parts of the U. S. but the majority of Antijacobins is 
certainly very great on the whole & I think we are in less danger 
than we have been these 5 years, — among the military arrange- 
ments you see Hamilton is named first after Washington, but 
several sorts of people are endeavoring to establish the opinion 
that Knox and others cannot serve unless their rank is above 
Hamilton's, because Hamilton's rank in a former war was below 
theirs. I hope that Mr Pinckney will not be ensnared by those 
fallacious plausibilities which have been successful (as I am told) 
with Knox ; the Country needs all the aid of H's talents & I trust 
will have it. 

I know nothing of Mr. Pitt's scheme but what I infer from the 
remarks in your letter, we ought to make liberal allowances for 
the extraordinary circumstances in which G. B. is placed, but it 
will be unfortunate for us & perhaps for her, if she is obliged to 
adopt any measures which will furnish new food to the french 



39§ RUFUS KING. [1798 

Partisans in the U. S. Some of the great men about you still 

entertain the belief that an Invasion is to be attempted ; I have 

often wished it but never for a single moment cou'd believe it. 

It must certainly give you great pleasure to know that we are 

earnest in equipping a little navy & that we shall soon have 50 

vessels of all sizes — say from 10 to 44 guns. You will be equally 

glad to hear that our Interdict of french trade has already produced 

very uneasy sensations among the West India Cutthroats & I think 

if we are steady & G. B. cooperate with us, in less than a year the 

trade of the Enemy Colonies may pass into the hands of G. B. & 

the U. S. ; but this I think shou'd not be admitted unless those 

Colonies throw off the Jacobin Yoke. 

Notwithstanding almost all Europe is enslaved by France yet 

to me it appears that France is on the decline — I hope the time 

so often mentioned by the Clergy is at hand when the wrath of 

man having praised the Lord the remainder of it he will restrain. 

A line from Gunn lately informed me that the Georgians were 

federal & other information corroborates his — the bold and 

patriotic language of P. Adams has done infinite service among 

the people.

Secret and Confidential. 

London, August 20, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

Mr. Murray has on several occasions informed me that disposi- 
tions and views existed among certain influential persons in poiuer in 
the country where he is, to throw off the odious dominion of Fra7ice : 
the object of these communications has been to procure from England 
assurances of support on certain points, and relaxation in the rigour 
with which the war is carried on, particularly against the Dutch 
Fisheries. 

These communications have always been so loose, informal, and im- 
perfect that I have, on his account as well as others, felt considerable 
embarrassment in permitting myself to be drawn into an affair, the

399 



400 RUFUS KING. [1798 

real character whereof I was so little able to appreciate. So far as 
I could give precision to the principal wishes of these persons, they 
desire an assurance from England that she would discard the Prince 
of Orange, co-operate with them to extricate themselves from France 
a?id assist them in establishing a Government which should exclude 
the Stadthclderate. 

After considerable hesitation I took an occasion to mention the 
subject with frankness, disclosing at the same time all my own 
doubts to Lord Grenville. He treated it, as I have been accus- 
tomed to find him treat all other subjects, with candour and good 
sense ; the result of the conference was a Letter that I wrote to 
Mr. Murray, in which without communicating to him that I had 
conferred with this Government I observed to Mju, as of myself, that 
considering the State of Parties in Holland, it being certain that a 
very great body of the nation are still attached to the House of 
Orange, it seemed to me a difficult step to be taken by England, to give 
any such assurance as seemed to be desired; but that I could venture 
with considerable confidence in my own opinion to say, that there 
was nothing in the presumed sentiments of England, or in the past 
history of the two Countries, that forbids the expectation of a sincere 
and beneficial connexion and intercourse between them, should Holland 
again, as heretofore she has done, abolish the Stadtholderate. 

Upon the other point I wrote a note to Lord Grenville in which 
I communicated to him the representation Mr. Murray had made 
to me, of the very great distress of the poor in consequence of the in- 
ter ruptio7i of their Herring fishery, and of the hutnanity as well as 
Policy of some relaxation in the orders given to the English Cruisers 
upon this subject, adding that I desired to be understood as 
giving no opinion of my own, nor as soliciting any answer from the 
English Government ; my sole object, being the bare communica- 
tion of what L understood to be the wishes and sentiments of others. 
L informed Mr. Murray of what I had done, and that I should send 
to him such answer as I received ; I have not received any, nor is it 
likely I shall. 

Mr. Wadsworth, who lately arrived here from Holland, by the 
desire of Shimmelpennick, related to me a conversation that passed 
between them, which I thought it adviseable, especially at the pres- 
ent moment when according to appearances the war between France 
and Austria is about to recommence, to communicate to this Govern-

?nent. This was done at the conference which I gave you an 
account of in my No. 93. 

My letter to Mr. Murray* a copy of which is annexed, was the 
fruit of our conference. I have thought it my duty to state this affair 
to you for the infor?nation of the President. It will naturally occur 
to you that Mr. Murray's safety may depend on secresy.

My Lord : 

If your information is not so late, the inclosed Letter, f which 
I pray you to return to me, will communicate intelligence of some 
importance. Talleyrand with much earnestness urged Mr. Gerry 
to wait at Paris for Instructions, which he expressed his belief to 
be on their way, and which would remove all his scruples respect- 
ing his powers to treat separately with France. We see the 
explanation of this Scheme in a motion that has been made in the 
House of Representatives to address the President, requesting 
him to instruct Mr. Gerry to treat separately with France on the 
basis laid down in the Instructions originally given to him and his 
Colleagues. 

The proposition was treated with great and uncommon marks 

of indignation and negatived by 51 against 30 voices.

My Lord : 

I take the liberty to send your Lordship inclosed the copy of a 
Letter that I have lately received from Colonel Pickering respect- 
ing a number of Iron Cannon said to have been given by the late 
King George the 2nd to the Province of South Carolina ; these

Cannon which are represented to be entirely useless at Halifax, 
would be of great service in the defence of Charleston. 

If there should be no objection against their being received by 
South Carolina upon such terms as may be thought proper, I beg 
your Lordship's permission to suggest the expediency of a Dupli- 
cate of the Instructions that may be given to Governor Wentworth 
on this subject being delivered to me to be sent to Philadelphia, 
in order that the requisite measures may be taken to receive and 
transport the Cannon from Halifax to Charleston. As I think it 
of the greatest importance not to lose a moment in the execution 
of the orders that I have lately recived for a supply of Military 
Stores, I beg your Lordship to have the goodness to give me the 
earliest answer in your power to the application that a few days 
since I had the honor to make to you on this Subject. 

With perfect Respect &c. &c.

Lord Grenville to R. King. 

Dropmore, Aug. 27, 1798. 
My dear Sir : 

I return you your letters with many thanks. The papers to-day 
give us General Washington's letter, which is I think extremely 
well written and calculated to produce the best effect. We have 
nothing about Bonaparte or Nelson, nor can we I think expect 
to hear yet, as the letters from Constantinople were of so very 
recent date. 

The French are, thank God, a good deal too late in their Irish 
Expedition. Two months ago such a debarkation would have 
been matter of some uneasiness ; now, I trust, it cannot but ter- 
minate more advantageously for us than if the thing had not 
taken place. 

Ever, my dear sir, most truly yrs., G.

Department of State, Trenton, Aug. 29, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

The yellow fever has again driven us from Philadelphia ; the 

public offices are removed to this place. The fever is more 



I79 S J LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 403 

malignant than in any former year ; upwards of eighty persons, 
chiefly adults, died in the 48 hours from the 25th to the 27th 
inst. The poor are the principal sufferers ; most of those who 
have the means have left and are still leaving the city. . . . 

The President a few days after the adjournment of Congress 
(which was the middle of July) set out for Massachusetts, and 
will probably remain at Quincy till Autumn. Your numbers 69 
and 71 were read by him ; but no definitive opinion on the im- 
portant question relative to the Proceedings of the Board of 
Commissioners in London was formed. I am apprehensive of 
serious difficulties in the Board of Commissioners at Philadelphia ; 
those on the part of Great Britain claiming a jurisdiction in cases 
which we conceive were never contemplated in the Treaty, and 
Mr. Guillemand concurs in these claims. The United States 
have been exposed to great disadvantage by the continued 
absence and sickness of Col. Innes ; he is dead, and Samuel Sit- 
greaves Esquire is recently appointed to succeed him. Perhaps 
in my next I may have it in my power to state the principal 
points on which the British Commissioners insist ; and if they 
persevere in their claims, probably the American Commissioners 
must stop the proceedings by a secession. . . . 

Your account of the reception of the Instructions to and dis- 
patches from our Envoys to the French Republic is highly grati- 
fying ; it was anticipated that their publication would do much 
good in Europe as well as in America. Here they produced their 
natural and obvious effect on all unprejudiced and unperverted 
minds. But you are too well acquainted with public Bodies to 
have expected, or rather to be surprised if there was not a very 
material change in the conduct of one side of the house. The 
constituents, however, of many members are proving and will 
prove that their opinions and feelings have not been justly repre- 
sented in Congress. This, perhaps, will nowhere be more visible 
than in North Carolina. The prevailing sentiments of the Country 
are undoubtedly expressed correctly in the general spirit of the 
addresses to the President of the United States. . . . 

Complaints against Judge Cambauld have continued. I am 
glad that orders for suppressing his court are at length to be sent 
out. . . . 



404 RUFUS KING. [1798 

T. Pickering to Rufus King. 

Private, 

Trenton, Aug. 29th, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

. Some of the military appointments will please you. 
The public voice had declared the Chief Command ought to be 
conferred on Col. Hamilton. This was before it was imagined 
that General Washington, at his advanced age, would again take 
the field. Since this event he has designated Col. Hamilton to 
be Inspector General with the rank of Major General ; then 
General Pinckney and next General Knox for Major Generals. 
I know that General Washington hesitated only between the two 
first, and that he had no question that General Knox should fol- 
low both the others. Yet General Knox to my surprise has more 
than hesitated to serve under Col. Hamilton ; looking back to his 
rank in the American War, whereas the army now to be raised is 
to be a new one, and the nature of the impending war imperiously 
demands the advancement of the best talents wherever to be 
found, and whatever their grade in a former war. I am not, you 
may suppose, singular in my opinion ; of all the members of Con- 
gress who spoke of the chief command in my hearing, not one 
ever mentioned the name of General Knox ; and consequently, 
as they expected he would be called into service, they contem- 
plated for him a station subordinate to Col. Hamilton. I believe, 
however, that some sort of compromise is proposed which will sub- 
ject the question to a future decision. 

I understand that Baron Steuben's case may be cited as a pre- 
cedent in favor of Col. Hamilton. The Baron was appointed 
"Inspector General with the rank (and pay) of a Major General." 
The like words were used in the appointment of Col. Hamilton. 
The Baron it was decided should take rank as a Major General 
from the date of his appointment over the other Major Generals, 
who were subsequently appointed ; and, consequently, as Col. 
Hamilton was first named on the List of Nominations, he must 
precede in rank all the other Major Generals named at the same 
time. I believe the Senate would have passed on his nomination 
and have adjourned to the next day, and then have decided on 
the rest, if they had suspected a serious question would have 
arisen between him and General Knox. 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 405 

*You must know that the President wishes Knox to precede 
Hamilton whom he dislikes extremely, and whom he would have 
named first ; but that the order of the names was designated by 
General Washington, who claimed as a condition of his accepting 
the Chief Command, the privilege of prosposing his principal 
officers. 

Mr. Caro forwarded his letters from Falmouth ; writing me 
that he was obliged to go immediately to South America. But I 
presume he advised you of this step.

Margate, Aug. 30, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

No Commissions have been sent to me for American Vessels, 

nor do I think it likely that any will be sent, it being my opinion 

that the delivery of these should always take place within the 

United States. I can have no hesitation in recommending to 

such of our Ships as are armed (and I request you to afford every 

suitable aid and encouragement to those who are inclined to arm), 

to defend themselves to the utmost of their power against the 

French cruizers. 

Yrs. &c. Rufus King. 



R. King to Secretary of State. No. 95. 

Margate, Sep. 3, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

Mr. Tazewell whom Mr. Gerry sent to me from Paris with a 
copy of the Correspondence between him and Talleyrand, informs 
me that no copy of it had been sent to you, so that should an 
accident happen to Mr. Gerry, or to his papers, you would be with- 
out information of what passed at Paris after the expulsion of 
General Pinckney and General Marshall. 

This consideration has determined me to send you a copy of 
that delivered to me by Mr. Gerry's Secretary. I see nothing in 
these papers that ought in the least to change our opinions of the 

* In cipher. 



406 RUFUS KING. [i79& 

insidious views of France. The arrete of the Directory, and 
which their agents will represent as a concession of importance, 
will furnish a profitable job for those who shall be appointed to 
distribute the new commissions ; but so long as the Laws author- 
izing the capture of neutral property remain unrecalled (and 
so far from being revoked, they have since the date of the arrete 
been confirmed as you will perceive by a letter from Boulay Paly, 
member of the Council of 500, inserted in the Echo of the 26th 
ulto), it must be a matter of indifference to us whether our ves- 
sels are captured by Privateers with new or with old Commissions. 

The pretence for this arrete is of a piece with the vindication 
of Talleyrand respecting X. Y. & Z, and the justice and sincerity 
of the Directory should be ascertained not by their words but by 
the following contemporaneous fact. 

Hayley an American citizen, master of the American Ship Hare 
lying in the Port of London, laden with a rich Cargo, the property 
of an American, and bound to New York, went with my Passport 
from London to Paris, where in a personal interview, not with the 
Agents of the Minister of Marine, but with the Minister himself^ 
he disclosed his plan of bringing the Ship Hare and her Cargo 
into France, and to enable him to receive the profits of the fraud 
without risquing the punishment of piracy, he demanded and re- 
ceived from the Minister of Marine a Commission naming him 
the Commander of a Privateer that did not exist ; with which in 
his Pocket he returned to London, and soon after carried the 
Ship Hare and her Cargo as a prize into France. 

The Ship and Cargo were both claimed by the American 
Owners and upon the unveiling of this infamous proceeding be- 
fore the lowest Tribunals, the judges hesitated and finally re- 
fused to sanction so unheard of a fraud ; tho' instead of restoring 
the property to its lawful owners they on some frivolous pretence 
adjudged both Ship and Cargo to be good prize to the Nation. 
Lately the Tribunal in the last resort, upon the appeal of Hayley, 
has reversed the judgment of the lower Court and decreed the 
Ship and Cargo to be condemned as good prize to the Renegade. 

If a transaction more grossly corrupt and infamous has oc- 
curred in the West Indies, where I admit that the examples of 
fraud and violence have been sufficiently numerous under colour 
of authority from more than one nation, I have not heard of it ; 



I79 8 ] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 407 

and yet with this case of unequalled infamy and corruption be- 
fore them, sanctioned by the highest Tribunals of the Nation, the 
Directory expect to amuse us with the disavowal of the conduct 
of a few subaltern Agents in a remote part of their Dominions ! ! ! 

With perfect Respect & Esteem &c, &c.

R. King to Secretary of State. No. 96. 

Margate, Sept. 5, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

I lately received your No. 20 ; the four or five immediately pre- 
ceding missions have not yet come to hand. The Newspapers 
inform us that Congress has adjourned, and I have seen with the 
greatest satisfaction the military appointments that have been 
made and the other important measures which have been adopted 
by the President. If we have constancy and firmness to act upon 
our own Systems, which France by every possible intrigue will en- 
deavour to disturb and defeat, we shall not only save our Country 
from the mischiefs that have been plotted against it, but we shall 
acquire a reputation in our own eyes, as well as in those of others, 
that will increase our security and in other respects prove highly 
advantageous in future times. It does not appear that the Law 
annulling our Treaties with France, or that extending the authori- 
ties of our public armed Ships to capture any French armed 
Vessels, were known at Paris on the 30th ulto. These measures 
with dismission of the French Consuls are of a character to bring 
to a speedy decision the questions between France and the United 
States. 

If we do not within a few days hear of a Declaration of War 
against us, I shall conclude, what I am inclined to believe will be 
their choice, that they will wait for the effect of the Publication 
of the Correspondence between Mr Gerry and Mr Talleyrand 
and of their Vindication against the Report of our Envoys. The 
French Report that I send you by this opportunity contains 
several Paragraphs, which though not important, should not 
escape our notice. Duverne de Baisle, of whose mission I gave 
you an account in a former letter, drew up and delivered to the 



408 RUFUS KING. [1798 

Directory a plan to revolutionize Canada with certain portions of 
the United States, and there is reason to believe that his late mis- 
sion to America is connected with this plan. We are still entirely 
ignorant notwithstanding the variety of Reports which continue 
to circulate concerning the real object and situation of Buona- 
parte. The accounts from Constantinople that a body of French 
forces had arrived at Alexandria are believed by this Govern- 
ment, but it has heard nothing from Nelson since he passed the 
Straits of Messina, nor is there any intelligence whether the troops 
landed at Alexandria are the main body or only an advanced 
Corps of Buonaparte's Army. At Paris there seems to be the 
same uncertainty respecting the situation of the two Fleets. The 
preparations for war are carried on with the greatest activity by 
both France and Austria. At Rastadt the Congress appears to be 
drawing to a close : the French Ministers have delivered their 
ultimatum and insist upon an immediate and decisive answer : 
the Deputation of the Empire seem inclined to yield, but the 
Emperor avoids a definitive answer. There are strong tokens of a 
spirit of Revolt throughout all Italy, and notwithstanding the late 
Offensive and Defensive Treaty between the French and Swiss 
Directories the Swiss are radically discontented, and under favor- 
able auspices would almost unanimously rise to expel the armies 
of France. 

On the 22nd. ulto. a body of French Troops, whose exact number 
is not yet ascertained, landed with a quantity of military stores at 
Killaloe in the Province of Connaught in Ireland : this force must 
be inconsiderable as they are supposed to have disembarked from 
only three frigates, who brought them from Bordeaux. It is 
now nearly a fortnight and we have no account that they are 
Prisoners. 

A few days after landing they attacked a Corps of British 
Troops, whom they compelled to retire w r ith the loss of six pieces 
of artillery. Lord Cornwallis has gone himself against them, and 
from the force that he has collected, unless they have been joined 
by large bodies of the malcontents, there can be no doubt that 
we shall hear of their total defeat by the next Messenger. 

The impression that has been produced by this handful of 
Frenchmen, and the delay and caution with which they are ap- 
proached, demonstrate that the Government has but little conn- 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 409 

dence in Irish loyalty and that it is fortunate that this descent 
was not made eight weeks sooner. In what part of our Country 
would 1000 Enemy land and remain unconquered for a fort- 
night ? 

With perfect Esteem & Respect &c. &c.

P.S. I hear that many of our Vessels are changing their flags

R. King to Lord Grenville.

Margate, Sept. 6, 1798. 
My Lord : 

I have heretofore with much concern represented to your 
Lordship the great embarrassment and loss to which the Ameri- 
can Commerce has been subjected in consequence of the dilatory 
and unsatisfactory proceedings of his Majesty's High Court of 
Admiralty. 

The increasing infirmities of the Judge of this Court, and 
which from his advanced age there is little reason to believe will 
ever be mitigated, incapacitate him to discharge the Duties of his 
important office with the ability and dispatch that the undoubted 
rights and essential interests of neutral nations give them a title to 
expect and require. 

It would be misplaced and altogether useless to enter into a 
discussion to prove what impartial justice and your Lordship's 
perfect knowledge of the subject will at once admit, that the 
right of the Belligerent Nations to capture and retain for adjudi- 
cation the vessels of neutrals, is qualified and accompanied by a 
correspondent and perfect obligation to establish Tribunals, that 
with the least possible delay shall hear and determine all such 
cases of Capture. 

Will it be requisite to proffer proofs which, in respect to the 
United States are unfortunately but too abundant, of the increas- 



4IO RUFUS KING. [i79& 

ing and ruinous delays to which our navigation and commerce 
continue to be exposed in the High Court of Admiralty. Prop- 
erty to a very great amount has been unreasonably detained for 
adjudication in that Court beyond the time requisite for that 
purpose ; new captures have in succession augmented this capital, 
and the claimants in cases ready to be heard, after waiting term 
after term and year after year, subjected to heavy expences, and 
the discontented witnesses of the cause of these delays have, in 
several instances, returned home despairing of the re-possession 
of property that they assert and believe an impartial Tribunal 
ought long since to have restored to them. 

In cases of Capture that have appeared to me illegal, I have 
sometimes addressed myself to your Lordship for the purpose of 
obtaining their release. The usual answer to these applications 
has been that such cases were attended with circumstances which 
made it proper to subject them to a judicial examination. With 
confidence I appeal to your Lordship's justice and impartiality to 
decide how far this answer ought to be satisfactory when, without 
considering the growing infirmities of the Judge, but estimating 
the future progress of the Court, by its past proceedings, it cannot 
be doubted that years must elapse before such new cases would 
be in turn to be decided. 

It will not be thought necessary in order to strengthen our just 
expectations on this subject to state to your Lordship the extra- 
ordinary losses to which in some instances the American Mer- 
chants have been liable by the derangement of their affairs in 
consequence of the capture and indefinite detention of their Ships 
and Cargoes. The mere capture of the property of a Neutral 
without those circumstances of aggravation coupled with the de- 
lay that notoriously exists in the Court, will, I flatter myself, be 
thought of sufficient importance to engage your Lordship's inter- 
ference, which I earnestly hope may not be withheld in order, in 
such way as shall be found practicable, to remove the cause of 
these grievous delays, and thereby to afford to all parties the like 
motives of satisfaction with the dispatch and impartial justice of 
the Maritime Tribunals of England, as are universally admitted to 
exist in respect to the other Branches of the Judiciary. 

With perfect consideration & Respect 

Rufus King.

Lord Grenville presents his compliments to Mr. King, and has 
the honor to inform him in answer to bis note of the 26th ulto. 
that his Majesty has been graciously pleased to allow that the 
Cannon therein mentioned (as being at Halifax) should be lent 
for the service of the United States, on the condition of their 
being returned by that Government into the King's Stores at 
Halifax whenever the occasions of the public service may induce 
the British Government to make a requisition to that effect. The 
Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia will be instructed by the 
first mail to carry this arrangement into execution in concert with 
any Officer who may be appointed by the United States for that 
purpose.

Dear Sir : 

It is within a few days of four months since the sailing of the 

expedition from Toulon, and strange as it will appear, we are still 

ignorant of the ultimate destination and views of Buonaparte. 

* August 26, 1798. 



412 RUFUS KING. [1798 

Admiral Nelson after looking for him in vain thro' the Seas of the 
Levant returned with the English Fleet to Syracuse on the 2 2d of 
July, from whence, after forming a junction with the Portuguese 
Squadron which carries his force to 19 Sail of the Line, and re- 
victualling his Fleet, has sailed again in search of the French. 
Whether with reason or otherwise, there is a disposition to cast 
blame upon the Admiralty for having sent Nelson into the Medi- 
terranean without a sufficient Stock of Water and Provisions ; the 
failure of which is said to have obliged him to return to Sicily. 
The rumour is that Buonaparte divided his fleet and landed part 
of his forces at Alexandria, and the other part at Alexandretta in 
Syria ; that one body will proceed by the Red Sea and the other 
by the Persian Gulph, and that the French have a marine force 
under Richery in the Seas of the hither India superior to that of 
England, and sufficient to secure a passage for the French army 
to the Malabar Coast ; but we have been amused with so many 
reports on this Subject which have turned out fabulous, that little 
credit is given to the new ones that continue to be circulated. All 
we certainly know is, that we know nothing certain of Buonaparte 
since he left Malta. 

No intelligence has been received from Rastadt since the de- 
livery of the French ultimatum. The latest accounts afford further 
proof of the discontents of Switzerland and that the Roman and 
Cisalpine Republics are threatened with new convulsions ; in the 
former the Consuls have been suspended, and the controul of the 
nation taken into the hands of the French General at Rome 
who has lately suppressed a revolt in one of the Departments by 
the bloody extermination of the Inhabitants. In the Cisalpine 
Republic the division among the Patriots is so great that it seems 
probable that the Constitution will be laid aside, and the Govern- 
ment be confided to the French Commander in chief at Milan. 
The Grisons refuse to unite with the new Helvetic Republic, 
which finds few friends and supporters out of the large Towns. 
Some Swiss peasants who lately surprised and murdered four 
French soldiers, for which they were condemned to death, went 
boldly to their execution, glorying that they had shed the blood 
of their enemy, and calling upon their countrymen to imitate 
their example. These circumstances connected with the activity 
of the military preparations of France, Austria, Russia and Naples

leave little doubt that we are upon the eve of a recommencement 
of the War ! 

The Invasion of Ireland has ended in the Surrender of the 
Invaders * ; as yet we have no returns of their number nor of that 
of the Irish who joined them ; both are supposed to be inconsid- 
erable. The Reports of the Secret Committees of the Irish Parlia- 
ment which I send you, fully disclose the principles and views of 
the Leaders of the Rebellion. These are so conformable to those 
which have prevailed in France, so false and so utterly inconsist- 
ent with any practicable or settled form of Government, that I 
have taken occasion to express my wishes that the United States 
might not be selected as the Country to which any of the State 
Prisoners should be permitted to retire. 

It is nearly a fortnight since I have received any accounts from 
Paris. Doctor Logan, it appears, has had an interview with 
Merlin, has been closeted by Talleyrand, and observes no reserve 
or decorum in reprobating the conduct of the President, which, 
if I may credit my information, he asserts is disapproved by a 
majority of the people, who are alarmed lest his measures should 
involve us in a war with France ! ! ! 

The manner in which the Directory answered the offer by 
Shimmelpennick of the Dutch mediation confirms my opinion 
that they entertain great hopes and expectations from the publica- 
tion of the Correspondence between Talleyrand and Gerry, tho' 
I have again and again considered it, and can discover nothing 
that ought to change our opinion respecting their views and ob- 
jects. I am unable to decide whether the offer proceeded spon- 
taneously from the Dutch or was instigated by France ; the 
commercial interest of the former is sufficient to have engaged 
their exertions to prevent a war between us and France, which if 
it did not draw them in, would destroy the little remnant of their 
Commerce : on the other hand, many and unequivocal circum- 
stances shew that seeing our union and firmness France is adverse 
to an open rupture ; there are even appearances that she medi- 
tates a revision of the Maritime Laws ; and the employment of 
the Dutch as mediators may be another means by which she may 
hope to avoid extremities and bring about a new negociation. 
But all these symptoms are antecedent to the knowledge that the 

* See letter 96, Sept. 5, 1798.

Treaties were abolished, and that we know nothing from Paris 
since this important fact was known there. 

With perfect respect and Esteem 

Rufus King.

Trenton, Sept. 15, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . Your letter (private) of Feby 7, expresses your opinion 
of Mr. Gerry as communicated to General Pinckney, an opinion 
in which all the public men whom I had heard speak of Mr. G. 
and I, from my acquaintance with him, were ready to concur. 
But General Pinckney in a letter to his brother of April 4th says : 
" I never met with a man so destitute of candour and so full of 
deceit as Mr. Gerry* ; " and Mr. Marshall is of his opinion. . . . 

The Newspapers will have informed you of the extensive 
calamity of yellow fever, which has visited Philadelphia, New 
York, Wilmington in Delaware, New London, Boston and Ports- 
mouth, N. Hampshire. It is more malignant and mortal than in 
any former year. . . . 

Your faithful and obedt servant, 

Timothy Pickering. 

Mr. Fenno, the printer, died yesterday or this day. — B. F. Bache 
died a few days before. Sept. 17. yesterday I was informed that 
Greenleaf of New York, the printer of the Argus, was also dead. 



R. King to R. Troup. 

London, Sep. 16, 1798. 
My dear Sir : 

I have just received your letter of the 24 July — The military 

appointments [that letter contained the names of them — Ed.] are 

on the whole excellent — with such leaders and a proper spirit in the 

country, I almost give myself up to a confidence that we shall be 

secure. I don't like, however, the divisions which continue to

prevail in New York and regret to see that you divide even be- 
tween Hail Columbia ! and "fa ira." At this rate we shall hear 
more of the party, and of the means which France possessed in 
America. 

It is ten days or more since we have anything authentic from 
Paris respecting our affairs. The Americans, who, on the laying 
of the Embargo, were conducted to prison as prisoners of war, 
have been released and an Arrete of the Directory has ordered 
the Embargo to be raised, tho' we have no accounts that our 
vessels have in fact been allowed to sail. Logan is announced in 
the Paris papers as the Envoy of the Patriotic Party in America. 
He has met Merlin, to whom, it is said, he had letters from Jeffer- 
son, McKean and Mifflin — been closeted with Talleyrand, and 
meets the Party at Skipwith's. 

Observe that we know nothing from Paris subsequent to it's 
being known there that the Treaties are abolished. It is plain 
that discovering our union and firmness, they intended to regain, 
if possible, the ground they had lost. They wd. have negotiated 
a Treaty which they would not, because they are really unable, 
have performed ! and I should add which they would not have 
executed, if they had been able. But the Treaties are dead and 
cannot be renewed ! the ground cannot be regained ; what, when 
they see this to be their situation, will be their conduct is matter 
of conjecture. I still believe they will not declare war, and think 
it probable that they will endeavour to reinstate themselves and 
their influence among us. 

Nelson missed Buonaparte, who it seems has reached Egypt, 
tho' the accounts are obscure and even contradictory in regard to 
this fact. Nelson after revictualling his fleet, strengthened by the 
junction of a Portuguese Squadron has returned to the Levant in 
search of the French. 

War is almost certain and on the eve of recommencing between 
Austria and France. Naples and Russia will in all probability 
act on the side of the Emperor. Russia will not reengage, and the 
German Empire will prefer, according to appearances, to be in- 
corporated with France, rather than to be overrun by her armies, 
which she would be in case of war. 

The invasion of Ireland has made a great noise, excited much 
alarm and required the presence of the Viceroy at the head of 



41 6 RUFUS KING. [1798 

20,000 men before the handful of invaders laid down their arms. 
This could not have been so if there had been more confidence in 
the army ! ! ! and the time and bustle that has been requisite to 
conquer the invaders reflect no credit on the zeal of the Br. 
Army. 

Yrs. &c. 



R. King to O. Wolcott, Sec. of Treasury. 

Margate, Sep. 17, 1798. 

Dear Sir : 

The Messrs. Baring will keep you advised of the progress they 
make in executing your order for Cannon. As the shipments will 
be made in different vessels I have instructed them not to insure ; 
and I now take notice of this circumstance for the double purpose 
of enabling you to make insurance, if you think it adviseable, and 
also to apprize you that I shall in no case order insurance to be 
made here without your special directions. 

It is yet uncertain whether we shall be able to procure any con- 
siderable quantity of Muskets in this Country. I hope soon to be 
able to inform you whether we can obtain from the Government 
or the Manufacturers the quantity ordered in your letter of the 
3rd of July : in the meantime I am completing the inquiries that 
for some time past I have been making in other quarters : being 
informed that there are about four thousand English Muskets for 
sale at Hamburgh, I have desired Mr. Pitcairn, our Consul there, 
to purchase them, if they are in good condition, uniform and can 
be had for the price that has been named to me. 

In case of failure in England I have the prospect of being able 
to procure about 18,000 Muskets of German Fabrick at Hamburgh, 
from whence only we are likely to obtain them : in this case we 
must endeavor to ship them by the Convoys which are established 
between England & Hamburgh, and then to forward them with 
a Convoy from England to the United States. 

With perfect respect and esteem 

Rufus King.

R. King to A. Hamilton.* 

London, September 17, 1798. 

I am charmed with the military appointments. In the main they 
are quite what they should be. Such chiefs ought to give glory as 
well as security to their country, and they will do both if the occa- 
sions offer. You see that I relapse into my former strain. I know 
not what you and others, whose sentiments I respect, may think, 
but I must unsettle all that is best settled in my opinions of the 
character of the present extraordinary crisis, or I cannot agree 
that an unimpassioned, phlegmatic, cautious, inactive and merely 
defensive war, even under the highest toned and most vigorous 
form of government, is capable of affording a tolerable chance of 
security against such an adversary as France. 

I do not entirely comprehend the views and proceedings of 
Congress, who appear to have done too much or not enough. But 
I have been too long acquainted with the temper and composition 
of that body, not to be able to conjecture the difficulties that arise 
from the vanities of some, and the obstinacy of others ; and which 
have given the appearance of inconsistency to their measures. 

Congress has adjourned, and it is of the highest importance that 
we should form a correct opinion of the course that France is likely 
to pursue. It is plain, that discovering our union and firmness, 
France instantly decided upon her relinquishment of apologies 
and loans, and resolved to recede as far as should be necessary to 
regain her standing ; and if possible, her influence among our 
people. But she has no intention of doing us justice for the past, 
or performing what she might be induced to promise in respect to 
the future. The correspondence between Talleyrand and Gerry, 
inclusive of other extemporaneous and subsequent measures of the 
same character, should convince us of the justice of this opinion. 
Logan, who as we hear, was provided with letters from Jefferson 
and others, has been presented to Merlin as the envoy of the patri- 
otic party in America. He has been closeted with Talleyrand and 
speaks openly of his success with the French government. Since 
his arrival at Paris, the American Seamen have been released, who, 
on the laying the embargo, were conducted to prison, and the 
Directory have ordered the embargo to be raised. The preamble 
of the Arret merits attention.

" 29 Thermidor. Le Directoire executif, considerant que malgre 
la manifestation hostile du gouvernement des Etats Unis, qui 
avait determine un embargo momentane sur leurs batimens, il doit 
croire qu'a moins d'etre livre aux passions du Cabinet Britannique, 
ce gouvernement fidele aux interets de la Nation Americaine, pren- 
dra des mesures analogues aux dispositions pacifiques de la Re- 
publique Fran9aise des qu' il recevra la confirmation, et voulant 
suivre les habitudes amicales et fraternelles de la France, envers 
un peuple dont elle a defendu la liberte, arrete ce qui suit, &c, 
&c." These proceedings should be compared with the treatment 
and language received by our envoys, and we shall from hence be 
able perhaps to fathom the views and discover the meaning of 
France. It is analogous to what has been done in other countries. 
Difficulties and embarrassments complained of by the proper 
agents of such countries have been aggravated and increased, and 
in order to divide the people from their government, promises of 
redress and satisfaction have been given to the popular agents of 
such countries, which had been refused to the envoys of their 
governments. 

But we know nothing certain of the views of France since it has 
been known at Paris that our treaties are dissolved. The measures 
above referred to were of antecedent date. I still think they will 
not declare war, but endeavor to gain their object by humiliation 
and intrigue. 

The war is on the eve of recommencing between France and 
Austria. Prussia will remain neuter : Germany will suffer herself 
to be incorporated with France in preference to being again at war 
with her. Naples will be engaged, and Russia, according to 
appearances, will also become active.

chief command the privilege of proposing his principal officers. 
This was not correct. He agreed to serve with the reservation 
that he should have such principal officers in the line and staff as 
he could confide in. His advice was asked on this subject by the 
written instructions of the President to the Secretary of War, and 
the advice being formally given, with respect to the three first (for 
there is at present no dispute about others) it cannot be departed 
from without wounding General Washington's feelings, nor indeed 
consistently with good faith, especially as it was known to the 
President, that General W. had declared that he relied on the aid 
of Col. Hamilton, to whom he wrote explicitly that as to his 
(Genl. W's) friend General Knox whom he loved and esteemed, 
he ranked him after both Hamilton and Pinckney. This private 
letter was left open, and the Secretary of War submitted it to the 
President's perusal. In the face of all this General K. (to whom 
also General Washington has explained himself) demands the 
priority of rank, or he will not serve. This, though to be regret- 
ted, would be of comparatively little moment, were not the Presi- 
dent disposed to admit his pretensions. But the reasons opposed 
to them and in favor of H. are so cogent and indeed irrefragable, 
and are now prepared to be laid before the President in all their 
force, I cannot believe but that he will be convinced, and make 
all predilection yield to the considerations of public welfare, in 
which, indeed, his own honor, reputation and influence are neces- 
sarily involved. 

Your intimate friendship, esteem and respect for Col. H. and 
your regard for General K. will interest you in this matter ; altho' 
your first and great concern will be the influence of the Presi- 
dent's final decision on the safety and welfare of your country. 
The result, I hope and trust, will be satisfactory. It must soon be 
known ; and I will embrace the conveyance to relieve your 
anxiety which I am sure cannot be less than my own. To you 
alone of all Americans in Europe have I, or shall I, touch on this 
subject ; for I know not of any one so intimately connected with 
all the characters in question ; or to whom it will be of so much 
consequence to communicate information that will be confined 
within very narrow bounds when at home.

R. King to Secretary of State. No. 99. 

London, Sept. 19, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . I can give you no recent account of Buonaparte, except 
that it is now fully believed that he has landed in Egypt : the 
French Journals are silent respecting him, while those of Germany 
are filled with stories of his victories over the Beys of Egypt and 
the Arabs of the Desert. 

The last mails agree with the more direct and recent intelli- 
gence from Paris, that we are on the eve of the commencement of 
the war between Austria and France. Logan has left Paris for 
Bordeaux on his return to America ; he is said to be charged with 
Dispatches from the French Government, tho' the Directory 
seems desirous that it should not be supposed that he has been 
particularly noticed, or that his visit at Paris has been connected 
with any political object. The Arrete for raising the Embargo 
on American Vessels in the Ports of France is dated on the 16th 
of August ; but I have not heard that our Ships have been per- 
mitted to depart ; tho' from the tenor of all our information, it is 
more and more plain that the Directory will endeavour to avoid 
an open rupture with America, and as far as possible to regain the 
former standing and influence of France among us. 

How wise and magnanimous has been the conduct of the Presi- 
dent ! how honorable to our Nation the support he has received 
from the people ! All the world is becoming inquisitive respect- 
ing America : foreigners do us the greatest justice, and those who 
dare not imitate, applaud and admire our example.

Dear Sir : 

. . . I this morning received the Paris paper to the 16th in- 
stant. " L'Ami des lois " of the 15th Fructidor (Sep. 1st) announces 
the arrival of a flag of truce at Bordeaux in 24 days from Phila- 
delphia, and Poultier, the editor, asserts that she brings dispatches 
of the most satisfactory nature to the friends of peace. " Le 
parti Anglais (dit il) loin d'avoir pris decidement le dessus dans 
les E. U., est au contraire dejoue dans ses projets sanguinnaires, 
et la majorite du Congres vaincue par les procedes genereuses du 
gouvernment de la, grande nation, a rejete tous les plans hostiles 
qui lui avaient ete presentes par M. Adams. Elle a repousse 
toutes mesures qui tendraient a troubler la bonne harmonie qui 
doit exister entre deux peuples amis ; et apres avoir manifeste

tres clairement ses intentions a ce sujet, le Congres s'est separe 
au milieu des Benedictions d'un peuple qui sent tout le prix de 
son alliance avec la Republique Francaise, et qui avait deja 
donne en plusieurs occasions des preuves non-equivoques de son 
eloign ement pour les actes de rupture projettes par un fonction- 
naire inftdele que V opinioti publiqiie accuse d' etre vendu auplus infdme 
de Gouvememens. En apprenant l'heureuse nouvelle que nous 
transmittons a nos lecteurs, nous n'avons pu nous defendre d'un 
sentiment d'admiration pour la conduite politique tenue derniere- 
ment par le Directoire envers les E. U., conduite qui a opere des 
changemens si avantageuses dans notre position vis-a-vis cette 
puissance, et qui doit nous concilier l'estimede tous lespeuples." 

It is probably known to you that Poultier's Journal, tho' not 
strictly official, is one that furnishes the means of conjecturing 
the Politicks of the Luxembourg. Paragraphs of the same tenor 
appear in the French papers of a later date, and, if what I suspect 
be true, before this reaches you, you will have received direct 
overtures for the renewal of negotiations. If the views of the 
Directory could be doubted by any one who has impartially ob- 
served them, the distinction which continues to be made and kept 
up between the Government and people of the United States, 
and the base insinuations of Poultier concerning the President 
should increase the caution with which we meet the overture of a 
Nation from whose acts alone we have anything to fear. I per- 
suade myself, if the President renews the negotiation, that he will 
perceive not only that his own character, so justly precious to his 
country, but what is dearer to him, that the Constitution and 
safety of the Country itself, will require a total exclusion of every 
suspected individual from a share in the negotiation. This is a 
subject too important not to merit the most profound reflections ; 
it is one that conceals our only real danger ; there are obvious 
reasons why it is neither adviseable nor necessary that the Topic 
should be more than hinted at by me. 

The French papers of the 16th inst. contain an account that 
Buonaparte landed with his army at Alexandria on the 1st of July, 
and after concluding a Treaty of friendship with the Beys and 
Arabian Chiefs entered Grand Cairo on the 2 2d from whence he 
immediately pursued his march. The same papers announce the 
receit of Letters from Malta, which state that the English Fleet

had given battle to that of France, which was found at anchor on 
the coast of Begnieres, preparing to return to France : the battle 
is reported to have been fought with obstinacy and to have ended 
in a decisive victory by the English. 

No dates are given, and the details are obscure ; the event is 
notwithstanding upon the whole highly probable : the Redacteur 
of the 1 6th says we learn par line voie sure that two ships part of 
the Toulon Fleet, have arrived in our ports, one of 80 Guns, 
commanded by rear-admiral Villeneuve is at Malta, the other of 
74 Guns is at Corfu.

London, September 23d, 1798. 

You will have no war ! France will propose to renew the 
negotiation upon the basis laid down in the President's instruc- 
tions to the envoys. At least so I conjecture. 

If the negotiation is recommenced, the most obvious pre- 
caution suggests the expediency of confiding it to hands above all 
suspicion. 

We see that we have nothing to fear from the arms of France ; 
all her skill and energy and resentment will nevertheless be em- 
ployed to attain her ends. 

A treaty, liberal in terms and stipulations, though neither should 
be performed nor observed, would gain time, and go a great way 
to restore her injured credit. 

The election of President would return before the efficacy and 
sincerity of the new stipulations and engagements would be ex- 
perimentally ascertained. To give them any chance of success, 
they must be liberal to the utmost bounds of our expectations. 

Bonaparte reached Grand Cairo on the 22d of July, but we are 
quite ignorant whether he was opposed by the Beys. It does 
not appear yet whether he will remain some time in Egypt, in 
order to consolidate his conquest and authority over that country, 
or proceed immediately by the Red Sea for India. We are with-

out details or confirmation of the victory which the French papers 
of the 15th and 16th instant state to have been gained over the 
French fleet by Nelson. The news is on the whole highly prob- 
able, and the victory has, according to these reports, been very 
decisive and glorious. The war is about to recommence. 



Wm. Bingham to R. King. 

Bellevue, Jersey Shore, Septem. 30th, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

The publication of the Dispatches of our Commissioners, which, 
considering the Nature of them, must have excited some Surprize 
amongst the diplomatic People of Europe, had an astonishing 
Effect in creating a Spirit of determined Resistance to French 
Aggressions. The Friends of the Government have improved the 
Opportunity of cloathing the Executive with additional Energies. 

Another good Consequence will be felt in our Elections, which 
will return a large Majority of federal Characters. The Result 
of that of No. Carolina has been very favorable. I hope the Im- 
pression will be durable ; but I have my Apprehensions with re- 
spect to many of our political Proselytes. I am confident that 
many of them possess a disorganizing Mind, & that in their Hearts 
there is still lurking a secret Attachment to the French Cause. 
But I hope the Government will be made sufficiently energetic to 
controul the Conduct of such Characters. 

It is evident that the Policy of France will be to divide us & if 
she cannot create a formidable Party by her Intrigues, she will 
probably have Recourse to Arms, altho' at present she has too 
many objects of pressing Importance in Europe to attract her 
Attention, to attempt an Expedition in this Quarter. 

Our Commercial People have suffered immensely by French 
Spoliations & the Country at large is undergoing a very consider- 
able Change, from the scarcity of Money & the stagnation of 
Trade, which have effected a considerable fall in the Price of 
Labor & Provisions, as well as in the Value of all kinds of Property. 
The Fate of England will have a great Influence on the political 
Situation of this Country. I cannot but entertain very serious 
apprehensions, for the Result, when I see the preponderance that 



426 XUFUS KING. [1798 

France is daily acquiring on the Continent, & no Union of Force 
or Concert of Governments to oppose her ambitious Projects. 

Her Aim is evidently to revolutionize Europe & she has made 
great Progress in her Views, when she has impressed a Terror, 
which operates like the Stroke of a Torpedo, & has benumbed all 
the Faculties of the European Powers. If she continues a little 
longer in her Career, she will have Europe at her Feet. 

We are anxious to hear the ultimate Object of Buonaparte's 
Expedition. Malta was but a half way House. We suppose it 
to be India ; but by what Route, or what Preparations have been 
made to effect it, is Matter of Conjecture. 

I deprecate the Consequences of the Insurrection in Ireland ; 
if successfull, as it regards England — if otherwise, as it regards 
this Country. In the latter Case, we shall have immense Emi- 
grations of an ignorant & deluded Class of People, who will make 
a Merit of resisting every Government, they live under. I cannot 
see how we can shut our Doors against their admission. A late 
Law has rendered a longer Residence, necessary to Naturalization, 
but this will not prevent their seeking an Asylum here ; altho' it 
will deprive them of the Power of influencing Elections. 

You inquire if Ross will become Governor. I think & hope 
he will ; all my Efforts will be exerted, to insure his Election. 
We shall certainly feel his Loss to the Senate ; but, in critical 
Times, he may still be more usefull, as the chief Magistrate of 
this state ; altho' I must confess that the Senate has not appre- 
ciated, in point of Talents, by the recent Changes, that have 
taken place. 

You will hear with great pain the melancholy Accounts of the 
Situation in New York and Philadelphia, again scourged by the 
Introduction of an epidemic disorder of the most malignant 
Character. It has caused the Cities to be abandoned, & the 
Inhabitants to fly in every Direction, to seek an Asylum. You 
will readily judge the distress which must arise from so general a 
Derangement, independent of the Loss of so many valuable Citi- 
zens, who have fallen Victims to the Disorder. The Physicians 
are disputing whether it is contagious, infectious, or epidemic ; or 
whether it is a local or imported Disease ; they likewise differ 
about the Mode of treating it. However, if some effectual Means 
are not adopted to eradicate the Cause of these severe visitations, 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 427 

the Cities on the Sea-Coast will be considerably depopulated, as 
the lower Class of People cannot support the Loss & Inconvenience? 
which arise from the necessity of such frequent Removals. 

Yours &c. 

Wm. Bingham. 



A. Hamilton to R. King. 

New York, Oct. 2d, 1798. 
My Dear Sir : 

Mr. R. delivered me your letter of the 31 of July. The opinion 
in that and other of your letters concerning a very important 
point has been acted upon by me from the moment that it be- 
came unequivocal that we must have a decisive rupture with 
France. In some things my efforts succeeded, in others they 
were disappointed, in others I have had promises of conformity 
to lay the foundation of future proceeding, the performance and 
effect of which promises are not certainly known to me. The 
effect, indeed, cannot yet be known. 

The public mind of this Country continues to progress in the 
right direction. That must influence favorably the present Con- 
gress at the ensuing session. The next will be in all appearances 
intrinsically better. 

Of the executive I need say little ; you know its excellent dis- 
positions, its general character and the composition of its parts. 
You know also how widely different the business of Government 
is from the speculation of it, and the energy of the imagination, 
dealing in general propositions, from that of execution in detail. 

There are causes from which delay and feebleness are experi- 
enced. But difficulties will be surmounted and I anticipate with 
you that this Country will ere long assume an attitude correspond- 
ing with its great destinies, majestic, efficient and operative of 
great things. A noble career lies before it. 

Why does not Gouverneur Morris come home ? His talents 
are wanted. Men like him do not superabound. Indeed I wish 
that you were here rather than where you are, though I think 
your position an important one at the existing juncture. But we 
want to infuse more abilities into the management of our internal 
affairs. 



428 RUFUS KING. \M9% 

Governor Jay is well. He & all your friends continue to take 
a lively interest in whatever concerns you. 

Adieu. Yrs. Affect.

R. Troup to R. King. 

New York, Oct. 2d, 1798. 
My dear Sir : 

. . . I sincerely wish this letter could be the messenger of 
goodness. The reverse is the case. Our city is in the deepest 
mourning ! Since August last we have been again visited with 
the yellow fever and its ravages have been much more terrible 
than those of the fever of 1795. Our number of deaths to the 1st 
of this month exceed 1400. At least two thirds of our fellow 
citizens are now in the country. We have lost many, very many 
valuable men. . . . The weather is now getting cool and the 
fever is consequently beginning to abate. Nothing but frost — 
and a severe frost too — will restore us to our usual health. . . 
For three weeks past the deaths have averaged 45 a day. . . . 
one day 58. I am in the house I formerly occupied in Broadway, 
and as my neighbourhood has been healthy, I have remained with 
my family in town. We have hitherto escaped. . . . Col. 
Hamilton, Mr. Church and their families have also remained in 
town, except for a few days past, when out of compliance with 
the pressing solicitations of Genl. Schuyler they took rooms a few 
miles out of town ; but they have spent the greatest part of the 
time in town. . . . 

The fever has prevailed more amongst the higher classes of citi- 
zens than it did in 1795. I do not mean by the term higher classes 
to convey an aristocratic idea. No, no. I only mean those citi- 
zens, whose means of living furnished them most amply with 
medical assistance and all other necessaries to subdue the force of 
the disease. . . . Philadelphia has been in a much more de- 
plorable state. The fever broke out there before it made its 
appearance with us, and its devastations have been dreadful. It 
had not raged long before it was found to baffle all medical skill 
and all means to subdue its force, and limit its sphere of action. 
The result was that the inhabitants came to a general resolution 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 429 

to abandon the city and seek safety in flight. . . . To make 
the flight more universal, a number of the principal physicians led 
the way. Rush, however, and others of inferior note to him, re- 
mained. It is thought that there are now about 7000 souls in 
Philadelphia. The deaths for more than a month past have 
averaged near 70 a day — some days last week they have exceeded 
100. . . . All the public offices, both State and Continental, 
are removed ; some to Germantown, others to Trenton and other 
places. All private business is at an end, and nothing but dis- 
tress, deep distress, prevails in that quarter. 

Our situation is not so calamitous, but is nevertheless very 
afflicting. Our courts are shut up ; our trade totally stagnant, 
and we have little or no appearance of business. What little com- 
mercial business there is to do, is done on this street and on the 
north side of the City. Our Coffee House is now at the Tontine 
Hotel, a little above Trinity Church. There our Custom house 
is kept, and there the Insurance gentlemen meet. I go nowhere 
but from my house to the Battery and from thence back again. I 
call in once a day at Hamilton's, and we endeavour to fortify each 
other with philosophy to bear the ills we cannot cure. We meet 
with nothing of what our friend Lawrance, when in practice, used 
emphatically to term touching. We meet with no clients and of 
course with no fees. When that is the case, I need not tell you 
how deplorable must be the condition of society ! 

But New York and Philadelphia are not the only victims of the 
fever. It has also visited Wilmington, New London, Boston, and 
several other parts of the New England States. . . . We are 
as usual looking about for a cause. . . . Our last winter was 
uncommonly long and severe ; and our last summer in heat and 
length has exceeded the memory of the oldest among us. In the 
midst of our heat, we had the longest heaviest shower ever re- 
membered here ; and this by filling cellars, choking drains, &c. 
put our whole mass of filth into a state of violent fermentation. 
The foul air arising from this source was increased by a large 
quantity of beef stored in different places in the neighbourhood 
of Burling Slip, and which bad packing and extreme heat rendered 
putrid. Hence the explosion was first made at Burling Slip, and 
its effects were quickly communicated to almost every other part 
of the city. 



430 RUFUS KING. [1798 

Our medical gentlemen have changed their treatment of the 
disorder with happy effects. The violent system of the lancet and 
mercury has given way to gentle cathartics and powerful sudorifics. 
A Mr. Underhill — a quaker — who is no physician, but a man of 
infinite humanity and attention to the poor, has cured hundreds 
with the use only of castor oil and sweating teas. Bard and sev- 
eral of our most eminent physicians are decided friends to the 
new remedies. We have lost fourteen medical gentlemen, amongst 
whom Dr. Varick, brother of the Mayor, young Dr. Hicks, Dr. 
Dingley, & Dr. Elihu H. Smith are the most conspicuous. 
Scarcely a single physician has escaped an attack, and several — 
such as Dr. Moore, Dr. Rodgers and Dr. Onderdonk — have worn 
themselves out and taken refuge in the country. Dr. Bard has 
been ill, but is recovered and will set off for his farm in Dutchess 
County. . . . 

The President was driven by the fever and the heat of the 
weather from Philadelphia to his farm at Braintree, where he now 
is. His absence from the seat of government and the derange- 
ments occasioned by the fever, have prevented the celerity that 
was expected in the raising of our army. A fresh misfortune is 
likely to befal the army. The appointment of General Officers 
(saving in the rejection of W. S. Smith) was in conformity with a 
list made out by General Washington and by him transmitted to 
the President. Upon this list Hamilton stands as first Major 
General, with the additional appointment of Inspector General. 
General Washington's idea and the idea of several in the Senate 
was that Hamilton would be the second in command. This idea 
is very offensive to General Knox, also appointed one of the Major 
Generals. The President, it is confidently said, is inclined to 
favor Knox's pretensions, and I fear a misunderstanding will take 
place that may materially injure the public service. I hope an 
adjustment will be effected to the satisfaction of all parties. I 
know that it is a cause of very considerable anxiety to some of 
our best friends, and that it is particularly so to General Wash- 
ington. If Hamilton should resign, he will resume his former 
station as aide-de-camp to Genl. Washington. 

Col. Smith (I mean the President's son-in-law) was down on 
General Washington's list as adjutant General, with the rank of 
Brigadier General. There were but three votes in the Senate for 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 43 I 

him, and of these was the vote of Lawrance. The objection 
against Smith I have never heard ; we are left to conjecture. 
Some ascribe his rejection to the utter embarrassment of his 
affairs ; others to his unsteady political course ; the true cause I 
am as much a stranger to as others. I have reason to believe that 
the rejection made a deep and lasting impression on the President's 
mind. . . . 

Our Legislature met on the 9th of August. . . . They granted 
300,000 dollars for fortification &c. and unanimously agreed upon 
an address to the President on the conduct of France. The ad- 
dress upon the whole, considering that Burr was in the Assembly 
and much superior in talents to any of the opposite party, is bet- 
ter than I expected. It breathes a decided determination to 
support our sovereignty and independence against France, and 
expresses strong indignation at the treatment our Commissioners 
received. . . . 

It is said with Confidence that Mr. Jay means to retire to 
private life, at the end of his current term of service which will be 
in July 1801. He is sick of the office, and he is a good deal 
complained of by many of those who supported him in his two 
first elections. Not half the zeal and energy formerly displayed 
for him manifested themselves in his favor in several parts of the 
State at the last election. There will be great embarrassment in 
the choice of his successor. 

Burr still continues in our Assembly. His object cannot be 
precisely developed ; some suppose it to be a state bankrupt 
law, in which he is said to be deeply interested. Others conceive 
that he has the government in view. It is certain that he has not 
discovered a desire to resume his station in the Senate. No 
doubt is entertained that after the publication of the dispatches 
from our Envoys to France, his conduct showed strong symptoms 
of a wish to change his ground. He was active and apparently 
zealous in our measures for defending our harbour : he was par- 
ticularly courteous to Hamilton and some of the most intelligent 
of his party have gone so far as to say he certainly expected an 
appointment in the army. He began in a considerable degree to 
lose the confidence of some of his associates ; and yet before the 
appointment of General Officers took place, and in the midst of 
conciliatory appearance, he became bail for the appearance of 



432 RUFUS KING. [1798 

Bourk, who was apprehended upon a warrant issued by Judge 
Hobart for a most infamous libel on the President. I understand 
Judge Hobart refused to take Burr alone, and that Burr then 
prevailed upon Col. Rutgers to join him in the recognizance. 
. . . It is determined to try the force of government in pro- 
tecting the character and conduct of its officers from the ribaldry 
and abuse uttered against them in certain papers. 

The fever has disposed of Bache of Philadelphia and Greenleaf 
of this city. Poor Fenno is also gone, and we have lost McLean 
who published our daily gazette. . . . On the whole we 
count with confidence that the next new Congress will yield a 
decided majority for honorable and strong measures against 
France. I am so well satisfied on this head that my mind is at 
perfect rest. 

Madison seems to be in a tomb ; we hear nothing of him. 
Jefferson on his return home from the last sitting of Congress, 
was indiscreet enough to accept of the honor of a public enter- 
tainment in Virginia on a Sunday. This fact has been trumpeted 
from one end of the continent to the other as an irrefragable 
proof of his contempt for the Christian religion and his devotion 
to the new religion of France. It has made an impression much 
to his prejudice in the Middle and Eastern States. 

We have seen and read with the greatest contempt the cor- 
respondence between Talleyrand and Mr. Gerry relative to 
Messrs. X. Y. and Z. and with the same emotion we have 
also seen and read the concluding correspondence between 
Talleyrand and Mr. Gerry just before the departure of the latter 
from Paris on his return home. The public mind is now too 
much enlightened and too firmly fixed in the belief of French 
falsehood — perfidy — and corruption to give credit to any thing 
that comes from the democracy of its infamous agents. . 
No declaration made by the President has been more grateful to 
the feelings of our countrymen, and of course more popular, than 
the declaration that he never would send another minister to 
France until we were treated with respect and distinction due to 
a great, powerful and free nation. ... I never reflect upon 
the recent Conduct of France towards us without an ejaculation 
to Heaven for its special favor in giving us cause to dissolve our 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 433 

connexion with her. It was a connexion pregnant with the most 
destructive poison to our morals, our religion — and all those 
principles and maxims of government that tend to the preserva- 
tion and increase of human happiness. I consider the Act of 
Congress which rescinded the treaties as a new declaration of our 
freedom and independence ; and if my wishes were to be gratified 
the day on which the act finally passed would be celebrated as a 
great anniversary festival and honored with the highest testi- 
monies of public joy. 

I may be an enthusiast ; but, my good friend, I really have 
such a horror of the French Revolution and the misery it has 
inflicted upon so great a portion of our species, that I think the 
Revolution we have just achieved is one of the choicest natural 
blessings that God in his Providence ever bestowed upon a 
people. 

As to Mr. Gerry, I can say nothing honorable to him, or pleas- 
ing to you. De mortuis nil nisi bonum is a maxim as applicable 
to him as if he was in his grave. . 

Do you know that Mr. Low has communicated to me your 
wish to purchase a farm on the North River in Dutchess County; 
and as I am better acquainted in that quarter than he is, I have 
undertaken to assist him in procuring information for you . . . 
but I have written myself into a headache. This pamphlet, for 
I can call it by no other name, goes by the packet. 

Failures with us are still too prevalent. Horace and Seth 
Johnson just before the fever broke out failed for an immense 
amount. . . . Comfort Sands has taken his stand at Flatbush 
in King's County within the liberties of the gaol, where he means 
to stay. . . . Mr. Thomas the Lawyer in Philadelphia about 
three months ago, to the utter astonishment of the whole City, ab- 
sconded after committing the most horrid forgeries and frauds 
that can be imagined. He in all probability would have been the 
federal candidate for Congress if he had maintained his former 
character . . . 

Poor Morris remains in gaol. Judge Wilson lately died in North 
Carolina in the hands of the Sheriff — a victim to misfortune and 
liquor ! Poor Duer in gaol likewise. . . . God help you.

T. Pickering to R. King. No. 29. 

Department of State, October 3, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

This morning I received your interesting Letters No. 87, 88, & 89, 
dated July 28, Aug. 1 and Aug. 5, and shall forward them by this 
evening's mail to the President, who continues at Quincy. Mr. 
Henry Rutledge forwarded you letters from New York, where he 
has arrived in the ship Factor, Capt. Kemp. He informs me that 
while he lay windbound at Portsmouth, Mr. Gerry arrived there 
in the Brigantine Sophia. He sailed from Havre on the 8th of 
August and reached Portsmouth Harbour on the 9th, pursued by 
a British rowboat, dispatched by the Commanding Officer at the 
Islands of St. Marcow, to speak the Sophia, as she came from 
Havre, according to custom in those seas. Mr. Gerry's fears 
having transformed this boat into one sent after him by the French 
Directory, insisted on Captain Geddes keeping out of its reach ; 
and to escape the boat they tugged at the Brig's sweeps till she 
arrived at Portsmouth Harbour, where the boat also arrived two 
hours after her. Mr. Gerry expected to pursue his voyage in a 
day or two after the Factor left Portsmouth. Mr. Gerry assured 
Mr. Rutledge that the motive of his flight was the fear that the 
boat might have been dispatched after him by order of the French 
Government, for the purpose of bringing him back, and of com- 
mitting him to the Temple, or of sending him a Prisoner to the 
West Indies ; adding that after his conduct towards the French 
Government, he was sensible he had every thing to dread from 
their enmity. . . . 



R. King to Secretary of State. No. 2. 

London, Oct. 3, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . Nelson's victory off the Nile has been more glorious 

and decisive than any recorded in the annals of naval Powers ; 

of thirteen ships of the line and four frigates which composed the 

French force eleven ships and two frigates remained on the scene 

of action : the details upon this subject and the comparison of 

the number and force of the two Squadrons, which you will find 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 435 

in Nelson's dispatch are highly interesting and demonstrate the 
superiority of the English over the French in this species of 
war. 

Buonaparte arrived at Alexandria three days after the English 
Fleet had left it. Alexandria was immediately taken possession 
of : a corps of 5000 troops were left there. Buonaparte with 
about 18000 men proceeded to Cairo, which he entered on the 
2 2d of July ; the landing and progress of the French were resisted 
by the Mamelukes and Arabs, and tho' the contests were always 
unequal, there is reason to believe that the French suffered con- 
siderable loss. 

Several advice Boats have been taken with Buonaparte's dis- 
patches and a great number of private Letters, some of the latest 
written since the destruction of the Fleet ; they are all in a 
desponding stile, describing the difficulties as much greater than 
were expected, the army to be wasting with disease, and on every 
side harassed by the Arabs and country troops ; so little has been 
the success in revolutionizing the public opinion, and so active and 
hostile are the Egyptians that not even a letter can be sent from 
Cairo to Alexandria without an escort of 600 horse. The Porte, 
whom Buonaparte hoped to conciliate by declaring against the 
Beys and professing a deference for the Ottoman Power, issued a 
Declaration of War against France on the 2d of Sep., the imme- 
diate consequence of which was the sending of the French Charge 
d'Affaires to the Seraglio Towers, and the arrest of all the French 
throughout the Turkish dominions and the sequestration of their 
Goods. 

The ultimate object of Buonaparte is India ; but his complete 
establishment in Egypt was first to be accomplished. A Letter 
from the Commissary General complains of their want of pro- 
visions and particularly of wine or of some substitute, without 
which the waters and climate of Egypt will, in his opinion, destroy 
the army. Buonaparte himself is disappointed and dejected ; in 
a private Letter to a friend at Paris, he writes his despondency, 
expresses his intention to return to Paris this winter, and gives 
orders that his house should be kept prepared to receive him. 
Letters from Tallien to his wife, written after the Battle, which he 
saw, and of the disastrous issue of which he says he was about 
setting out to carry the news to Buonaparte, breathe the same re- 



436 RUFUS KING. [1798 

grets and disappointment. The French transports are in the 
harbour of Alexandria where they cannot be approached by the 
heavy ships, and at present Nelson has no Frigates or Gun Boats 
with him. He leaves a number of Ships off the Nile, and returns 
with the others to Sicily, which will hereafter be the rendezvous 
of the Fleet that England will maintain in the Mediterranean. 

Russia has finally taken a decided part both by a liberal offer of 
assistance to Austria, and by the still more liberal step of actually 
sending a Fleet to Constantinople, and putting that and a Rus- 
sian army, which is upon the Frontiers, under the orders of the 
Russian Ambassador to be employed on the requisition of the 
Porte for the defence of the Ottoman Territories. On the whole 
there is a great probability that the Expedition will totally fail 
and that the enem}' will meet a fate as disastrous as that of the 
Fleet. The Declaration of the Porte and the disposition of 
Russia to enter into the war against France are important events, 
but the Councils of Vienna have become more wavering, as 
those of Russia have become more decided ; and should the 
French lower their tone a little more, or should the late Blow 
induce them to offer to the Emperor further acquisitions in Italy, 
it is by no means certain that Austria would not snatch at the 
bait ; tho' neither she nor Prussia can promise themselves 
security so long as France is mistress of such immense Terri- 
tories as she at present possesses. 

The Directory immediately after the news of the destruction 
of the Toulon fleet sent a Message to the Councils in which they 
demand more men and money to enable them to force Austria to 
conclude peace and to take vengeance of England : it is needless 
to add that these supplies were instantly decreed. 
With perfect Respect and Esteem &c. &c. 

Rufus King. 

P. S. The course of events has confirmed an opinion some 
time since given to you that Sweden and Denmark would make 
no effectual opposition to the maritime Plunder that their com- 
merce suffers from the French Privateers. Two Swedish con- 
voys laden with deals, iron and naval stores, consisting together 
of about forty sail of merchantmen under the protection of a 
National Frigate and Sloop of war, and bound to different ports 
ot Spain, France and Italy have been stopped and sent into the 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 437 

English Ports : the Swedish Envoy has demanded their release, 
asserting that the articles composing their Cargoes are not con- 
traband according to the Treaties with England : this is denied 
on the part of England and the Ships are ordered to be unloaded. 



Lord Grenville to R. King. 

Private. 

Dropmore, Oct. 4, 1798. 
My dear Sir : 

I have not a great deal to add to what I last stated to you on 
the subject of Continental Politics. Russia has, as you may have 
seen, taken a decided part, both by liberal tender of assistance to 
Austria & by the still more liberal step of actually sending a 
fleet to Constantinople, & putting that & a Russian army (which 
is on the frontier) under the orders of the Russian Ambassador 
there, to be employed, on the requisition of the Porte, for the 
defence of the Ottoman territory. 

We have taken several advice boats with Bonaparte's dis- 
patches & a number of private letters, some of the latter written 
since the action off Alexandria. All are in a desponding stile 
describing difficulties much greater than were expected. The 
army is wasted by disease and continually harrassed by the 
country troops & the Arabs. Even a letter cannot be sent from 
Cairo to Alexandria without an escort of 600 horse. On the 
whole I really think that without being sanguine we may con- 
sider that business as over. The Porte declared war against 
France the 2d September. 

The Councils of Austria are still wavering & irresolute, & if 
the insolence of the Directory is so far humbled by this last blow, 
as to induce them to hold out fresh lures to Vienna of acquisi- 
tions in Italy, I would not answer for it that the Austrians might 
not catch at the bait, tho' they see the hook it no longer 
conceals. 

I have been desired to suggest to you an idea which might, it 
is conceived, be beneficial to both our Countries, in the essential 
article of raising supplies with as little pressure as possible on 
our own People. It is that by mutual agreement we should re- 
tain so much of our drawback on Sugars, Szyau charge the export 



438 RUFUS KING. [1798 

of that Article for foreign consumption with such duties, as would 
supply to both of us a considerable Revenue drawn from foreign 
Countries, on an article in which our two Nations have no com- 
petitors, nor are likely to have any. If you think any thing of 
this sort practicable, Mr. Pitt would I know be very happy to be 
allowed to converse with you upon it, & if possible, before this 
Mail goes out. 

Ever, my dear Sir, most truly yours

Geo. Cabot to R. King. 

Oct. 6, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

Dumourier's sketch has afforded me a good deal of pleasure 
for tho' his ideas of invading England partake of the pride, 
revelry, vanity & folly of all Frenchmen on that subject yet his 
picture of the other States of Europe is drawn skillfully & is in- 
structive. We are aware of the danger you have ably described 
in your letter of the 4th of August & shall profit by your ideas. 
Altho' the elections in New York are bad we flatter ourselves 
with the expectation of some great reforms in other States. N 
Carolina has already gratified us & I expect our 3 Jacobiny votes 
will be reduced to 1, or probably annihilated — should the new 
Congress be well constituted as is now expected I presume the 
President will call them together in March if the present house 
shou'd persist in refusing any thing which the public welfare re- 
quires. Shou'd this happen the new house wou'd meet under 
impressions so favorable to strong & decisive measures that I 
think they wou'd do every thing that has that character & which 
cou'd be desired. It has proved unfortunate that Genl Marshall 
entertained the opinion that France wou'd declare war as soon 
as the Dispatches published here shou'd reach Paris. In no- 
event ought they to declare war because it wou'd certainly help 
us without serving them, yet this opinion of Mr. Marshall damped 
the ardor of some, furnished excuses to others & satisfied a few 
of the best men that as it wou'd be advantageous to us that France 
shou'd take the odium & that she would do it, therefore we ought 
to forbear ; however as we always got along as well by blunder- 



I79 8 ] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 439 

ing measures as by those we denominate wise, let us hope that 
even this dangerous delay will be salutary. 

Gerry is here — he arrived 6 days since & has visited the Presi- 
dent at Quincy — we wait silently to see the part he will take — 
he has hitherto talked prudently since his landing — he approves 
the vigorous measures that have been adopted & says we must 
rally round our Govt. & yet it is impossible he shou'd not justify 
himself & therefore he must say that we might have had an ad- 
justment of differences safe & honorable. If he says this he will 
renew the clamours of the factions & the hopes of the credulous. 
Great pains have been taken to guard the Community against 
plunging into new delusions & much more will be done ; there 
will after all be a prevalence of folly, but I hope not so much as 
to ruin us. 

As you have seen the military appointments, you naturally an- 
ticipate the heart burnings which are felt by K. at seeing H. 
placed where he ought to be. Some Jacobins who associate with 
K. have stimulated him to demand a Rank superior to H. & even 
Genl Lincoln has countenanced this demand ; upon every prin- 
ciple the demand is unsupportable, but yet it has been listened 
to in a place where it may work mischief. I believe however K. 
having discover'd that he might fail altogether finally, has been 
prudent enough to say that " if Genl Pinckney wou'd serve in a 
Station subordinate to H. he wou'd." A perfect understanding 
of this subject was not to be expected in a moment & many who 
have not examined it have been led to suppose K. was right. I 
am satisfied however that he is totally wrong ; he relies on a Re- 
solve of the old Congress which provides that in case of election 
of several persons to similar offices on the same day a priority of 
Rank shou'd be allowed to those whose Rank was highest pre- 
vious to the election — but this was a regulation for a particular 
description of offices ; & there is in fact another Resolve gen- 
eral in its nature which provides that in Elections on the same 
day the order of the Elections shall determine the rank — this is 
common sense & has been consider'd as proper by the present 
Govt. It applies to all New officers & such certainly as are all 
who at the time of their appointment are private citizens — such 
were the men concerning whom the question is raised. Con- 
versing with Mr. Liston on this subject he informed me that a 



440 RUFUS KING. [1798 

military man who shou'd from any cause be z/;zofficered in Eng- 
land wou'd not be able to avail himself of former rank if he 
shou'd again enter the service. Probably you may know from 
others more of this business, but I have said so much with a view 
to engage your interference with Genl Pinckney, if he is any 
where within your reach. Knox's objection being really un- 
founded it is probable Pinckney wou'd not adopt it, & therefore, 
if he is disposed, can easily smooth over the whole difficulty. 
For if he is unwilling to enter the service from any other motive 
he may satisfy Knox by saying to him that he acquiesces perfectly 
in the order of the appointments as regards himself & wou'd not 
decline the service but for other reasons — if indeed he serves as 
is universally desired all difficulty vanishes at once. I have in- 
terested myself in this affair because it threatens an embarrass- 
ment to the Administration which every good man desired to 
prevent — I have written frankly to the P. on the subject to put 
him on his guard, — it will be extraordinary indeed if these anti- 
quated claims are to deprive the Country of its best resources. 

My last letter from Gore is gloomy in the extreme but nothing 
has shaken my faith in the execution of the national covenant 
made with us by G. B. The obstacles have been too great & 
are ungraceful ; they are greater than I expected & if the business 
does not wind up well great discontent will grow out of it ; but I 
still confide in the weight of all those reasons which you are per- 
fectly qualified to enforce, to satisfy the B. G. that a liberal con- 
duct is the only true policy. 

Yours truly, 

C.

Dear Sir : 

We have had great reason to be dissatisfied with the delays and 
caprice of the High Court of Admiralty ; these have lately en- 
creased with the encreasing infirmities of the Judge. 

You know that the tenure of this office is during good be- 
haviour ; had it been otherwise, I am persuaded that he would 
long since have been removed ; for his incapacity has been 
notorious and the Government has received repeated Complaints 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 44 1 

on this head from the Ministers of all the Neutral Nations. 
Learning that the Captors have lately become equally dissatisfied 
with the Claimants, and that their influence would co-operate with 
that of those whom a reform would provide for, I thought the 
occasion a favorable one to renew our Complaints upon this sub- 
ject, which I accordingly did in a Letter to Lord Grenville, a copy 
of which is annexed.* The like step was adopted by the Danish 
Envoy and the Swede would have joined us, had he not been at 
the moment engaged in an unpleasant Correspondence respecting 
the Swedish Convoys that had been stopped and sent into the 
English Ports. 

As yet we are uncertain of the effect ; but there is considerable 
reason to expect an arrangement by which Sir William Scott will 
become the Successor of Sir James Marriot. 

I likewise annex copies of a Letter that I lately wrote to the 
Duke of Portland,! and of his answer J ; though they are both 
Private Letters, I have not thought it proper to omit communi- 
cating them to you. There are occasions and this is one of them, 
of delicacy as well as of importance, and in which we can only 
act from our own view of what the public welfare appears to re- 
quire ; I flatter myself that in this instance it will not be thought 
either that my opinion was ill founded or that the step it gave rise 
to was impolitic. . . .

[The beginning of this letter relates to efforts made to 
carry out instructions for the purchase of cannon and mus-

Under these circumstances you will conclude that I have little 
or no prospect of procuring in this country the muskets we want.

I am assured however * that in the event of an actual rupture with 
France, tve shall instantly receive a part of what they may possess 
and that the supply shall be continued. 

I stated to Genl. Ross who conducts the business of the Ord- 
nance Department during the absence of Lord Cornwallis, that 
though the event to which he alluded had not in fact arrived we 
thought it so probable that it was indispensable on our part to pre- 
pare for it beforehand and in case we could not obtain in England 
the supply of Muskets we want that we must turn our attention 
to the Continent, though we should experience many difficulties 
in procuring arms from thence, which when we have got them 
would be inferior to those of England. The General replied that 
they would give us all the information and aid in their power, and 
to enable us to escape the impositions to which we should be ex- 
posed in respect to the proof, that, if we would contract for their 
delivery and proof in England, they would prove them for us in 
like manner as for themselves. He added that tho' he had sup- 
posed from the late Measures of France that they would avoid an 
open rupture with us and that therefore we should not be in urgent 
want of arms, still if upon his return from Scotland, wh. would be 
in about three weeks, / should continue to desire it that they would 
supply us with five thousand Muskets from the Tower. 

I have written to Pitcairn at Hamburgh to ascertain whether 
we can contract for ten or fifteen thousand muskets, and within 
what time they can be supply'd to be delivered and proved in 
England. . . . From all the enquiries I have made on this 
subject, I am induced to believe that there is no safety in the 
purchase of Muskets unless they have been regularly proved in 
some national establishment. I had a prospect of purchasing a 
quantity of Prussian arms which were to have been procured 
from the Prussian arsenals ; but the King of Prussia has very 
lately forbid the exportation of Muskets, in consequence of which 
a contract that had been made by this country for a supply of 
Prussian arms has failed. The Prussian arms are of the same 
caliber as the English, but they are heavy and much more so 
towards the muzzle than those of England on account of their 
cylindrical Ramrods ; but they are efficient arms. . 

With great respect, &c. &c.

R. King to Secretary of State. No. 4. 

London, Oct. 10, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

A few days since I received a message from Mr. Pitt* desiring 
me to meet him for the purpose of conferring upon a plan to be 
concocted between the American and British Governments for the 
purpose of encreasing their respective revenues by diminishing the 
drawback on Sugar exported to foreign markets. Mr. Pitt pro- 
poses that Great Britain should withhold a certain portion of the 
drawback on that article, and that the United States should impose 
an equivale?it Export Duty upon it, supposing, I presume, either 
that we impose no Duty on its i??iportation, or that it is less than the 
portion of the Drawback he has in view to detain. 

I have written a note to Lord Grenville, through whom I re- 
ceived the message, explaining to him the present footing of this 
branch of our commerce, as well in respect to the Duties and 
Drawbacks as to the course of our trade, the Ships employed in 
which are not obliged to return with their cargoes to the U. States 
but are free to go, as they sometimes do, directly from the West 
Indies to a foreign market, adding also that Congress are restrained 
from imposing duties 011 Exports. 

I have at the same time expressed my want of facts sufficient 
to form an opinion how far this branch of trade is so exclusively in 
the hands of Great Britain and the United Slates, as to authorize 
the measures suggested by Mr. Pitt, and concluded by saying, as I 
have no reason to doubt, that the American Govemme?it will readily 
agree to such commercial relations as may be likely to improve our 
revenues and at the same time benefit those of Great Britain j that 
I would with pleasure at any time confer with Mr. Pitt on this or 
any other subject having the same object in view. 

I have thought it adviseable to communicate this overture, tho" 
privately and informally made, because exclusive of its particular 
object, it appears to me to be of some importance i?i assisting us to 
judge of the opinions of this Government respecting our encreasing 
Commerce, and of its views and wishes in regard to our future 
connection. 

Whatever may be our opinion concerning this proposition, the 

* Italics in cipher.

high price at which Sugar is so universally consumed in Europe 
persuades me to believe that we can with ease and advantage, 
whenever we find it requisite, greatly encrease the Duty now im- 
posed on that and a considerable number of other articles of gen- 
eral consumption. The restraint upon Congress relative to 
export Duties proceeded from, I then thought and still think, an 
ill founded opinion & jealousy respecting a Duty on the exporta- 
tion of Tobacco. The diminution of the culture of this article 
in Europe, and the superior quality of that of America, give us 
in fact a monopoly in the Sale of it ; & without detriment to the 
Planters we might at least divide with the European Govts, the 
tax paid by the consumer. 

The revenue obtained from the Consumption in Europe is a 
demonstration of this truth provided, as I believe to be the fact, 
that our Tobacco is without a rival. 

With perfect Respect &c, &c. 

Rufus King. 



R. King to Thos. Pinckney, Esq. 

London, Oct. 12, 179S. 
Dear Sir : 

I have had the pleasure to receive your obliging Letter of [18th 
July, 1798]. We do not disagree in opinion upon what is the true 
policy of our country on the subject of foreign connection. 
France according to her convenience has violated the Treaties we 
made with her, and at length we have consented to their abolition : 
they are now dead, they cannot be revived, and my dearest hope 
is that we may never see their like with any nation ! Europe has 
reached her maturity, America has yet her race to run ; their 
relative importance and interests are therefore constantly chan- 
ging, hence the policy that our Treaties should be occasional, par- 
ticular, and not of long duration. Besides a nation of the first 
order may make and break treaties as suits the moment, but it is 
not so with those of a second rank ; these then should make only 
such treaties as they intend to observe themselves, and which 
they have reason to believe will be kept by others. It is one 
thing to release, and a different one to guaranty a title ; the 
former conduces to peace, the latter is fruitful in contention and 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 445 

injustice. As our Titles are well settled, and as we are moreover 
able by ourselves to defend them, we want no guarantees, and 
wanting none are without the common motive to guaranty the 
Titles of others. Perhaps I go beyond you and too far upon this 
subject. If I could be persuaded to admit an exception to this 
Policy, it would not be in favor of any Power of Europe. 

I have been gratifyd. as all real Americans must be by the firm 
and imposing attitude assumed by our Government : it has en- 
creased our union and security at home, and as far as I am able 
to judge, has had the happiest influence in establishing and ex- 
tending a high and well merited opinion of our wisdom and 
character abroad. 

France has receded as we have advanced, but we shall deceive 
ourselves if we believe that she has relinquished her views. The 
fate of Switzerland, the history of which should be read by every 
American, is a dreadful lesson and should preserve us from the 
fatal error that hastened and disgraced her Fall.

Great Cumberland Place, Oct. 13, 1798. 
My Lord : 

By the Third Article of the Treaty of Peace between the 
United States and Great Britain it is provided " that the Ameri- 
can fishermen shall have liberty to dry and cure fish in any of the 
unsettled bays, harbours and creeks of Nova Scotia, Magdalen 
Islands and Labrador, so long as the same shall remain unsettled ; 
but so soon as the same or either of them shall be settled, it 
shall not be lawful for the said fishermen to dry or cure fish at 
such settlement without a previous agreement for that purpose 
with the inhabitants, proprietors or possessors of the ground." 

The plain and amicable intention of this Provision appears to 

446 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. ^J 

be that this liberty should without interruption be enjoyed by the 
American fishermen until it should prove actually prejudicial, by 
interfering with the cultivation or pursuits of the Settlers and In- 
habitants of the places to which according to the said Article 
the American fishermen have a right to resort. 

Hitherto we have met with no impediments, but I am appre- 
hensive that without your Grace's interference, we are likely soon 
to experience Embarrassments on this subject. A Letter that I 
have lately received from Isaac Coffin Esq., a copy of which I 
send enclosed to your Grace, gives us notice that he has or is 
about to, become, the proprietor of the Magdalen Islands in the 
Gulph of St. Lawrence, and though I have heard of no change in 
respect to their settlement, Mr. Coffin expects that our fishermen 
should apply not at these Islands, but at Halifax for licences to 
pursue the fishing in this quarter in the manner they have been 
accustomed to do. I am not acquainted with the soil of these 
Islands, and therefore cannot form an opinion how far they are 
valuable for the purposes of cultivation : that they have been 
known and neglected for nearly two centuries, affords a presump- 
tion that they are in this respect of little or no value ; and their 
neighbourhood to Newfoundland precludes their being chosen as 
a new station for the establishment of the Fisheries. 

The only motive then that seems likely to have influenced Mr. 
Coffin to become their proprietor, instead of being permitted to 
remain public property of use to the Fishermen of both nations, 
must have been the expectation of obtaining a revenue from the 
American fishermen, who shall continue to frequent them 

How far these views will be found to correspond with the pro- 
visions that I have cited, is a question of considerable importance, 
and one that I can with great confidence submit to your Grace's 
consideration. If, as I flatter myself must be the case, your 
Grace shall agree with me in the construction to be given to the 
third article of the Treaty of Peace, I could hope that your Grace 
will deem it expedient to give such instructions upon the subject 
to his Majesty's Governor within whose jurisdiction these Islands 
may be situated, as shall prevent the misunderstanding that other- 
wise may be apprehended. 

With perfect consideration &c 

Rufus King.

Dear Sir : 

The inclosed Letter from the Sec. of State I pray you to con- 
vey in safety and as soon as may be to Berlin. 

I ought not to omit the opportunity to thank you for the Pam- 
phlets you have sent me from time to time. They not only 
entertain and amuse me but I flatter myself are Useful. Our 
Country seems to be, as we used to say in 1775, unanimous & firm. 
They are much more so now than they were then. N. York and 
Pennsylvania, were always a little chancellants. But they will be 
kept tolerably steady. There are strong Pillars in both. 

But, Watchman, what of the Night ? Where is all tending ? 
I am weary of conjectures. Will Princes ever be more wise, or 
People more temperate or United ? or Aristocrats more willing to 
acknowledge a Superior ?

R. King to Secretary of State. No. 5. 

London, Oct. 16, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

We are impatient to receive the Hamburgh Mail ; two are due, 
and according to the last I have, we may expect the result of the 
Congress at Rastadt. If the reports in the French papers are 
correct, the Empire is likely to make its peace and the Emperor 
to be again involved in the war. But the Cabinet of Vienna is 
so wavering and undecided that it is not easy to predict its final 
determination ; on the one hand, its preparations for war are in- 
creasing, and the movements of the French, particularly in Italy, 
such as indicate the greatest probability that Naples will speedily 
be attacked ; on the other the recent refusal of Austria to ratify 
the Convention lately signed by its minister at this Court for the 
reimbursement of the monies advanced by England before the 
Treaty of Campo Formio, pretending that its ratification at this 
moment might have a sinister influence upon its negotiation with 
France, added to the important circumstance of the Emperor's 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 449 

having remained a quiet spectator of the overthrow of Switzer- 
land, which opens his dominions to France, would incline me to 
conclude that Austria at least believes that she shall avoid the 
war and dispense with the future succours of England. 

Russia is in the most zealous manner employing her influence 
to engage Austria in a new coalition, and has certainly come for- 
ward in the most liberal and decided manner to support the 
Porte. The revolution in the politicks of St. Petersburgh is 
among the unexampled events of these extraordinary times. 
England is of course gratified and as usual has engaged an 
eventual subsidy to Russia, of twelve hundred thousand pounds 
sterling. But unless Austria confederates, the Russians and Turks 
can do nothing against the Body of France. 

Perhaps among conjectures this is as probable as any, the Em- 
peror will continue to temporise, when France will either march 
against Naples, or without reserve attack Austria on the side 
of Switzerland. War abroad can alone prevent war at Home. 

Portugal has again failed in an attempt to treat with France,, 
through the mediation of Spain ; the Directory consented to re- 
ceive another minister ; this was at first refused and at last agreed 
to, only upon the assurance of D'Azara, the Spanish Ambassador, 
that on the conclusion of the Treaty the customary and liberal 
presents should be made by Portugal. Noranha the new Portu- 
guese Envoy had scarcely arrived at Paris before he received 
Passports and an order to leave the territories of the Republic. 
The real cause of the change may be conjectured but not known. 
The published one is that the Directory declined a Treaty on the 
former basis, and that Noranha had no powers to accede to the 
enlarged demands for money and territory in Guiana. 

We have as yet no certain intelligence of the destination of the 
Brest expedition ; another small Squadron with troops is reported 
to have put to sea within a few days from Dunkirk, and the French 
papers mention the sailing of two or three frigates from Brest for 
the Windward Islands. They are said to have on board two 
agents of the Directory, one for Guadaloupe and the other for 
Cayenne. Several of the counties in Ireland continue to be in- 
fested with a daring banditti, who, from the fastnesses of the 
mountains, lay waste the neighbouring plains. The plan of uniting 
Ireland with Great Britain which was in agitation in the year 1792,,

and laid aside on the breaking out of the war, has been lately re- 
sumed, and measures are at this time in train to carry it into 
effect. A million Sterling was in 1792 the estimate of the sum 
that would be necessary to accomplish this measure ; perhaps the 
same sum will still be sufficient as the late disturbances may have 
depreciated the Property in that Country, and none perhaps more 
than that of the revenue of the Boroughs. 

I had yesterday a conference with Mr. Pitt * on the subject of 
my No. 4. He thinks the measure one that will prove beneficial 
to both countries, and that the objections that I have suggested 
may be got over. Facts are wanted and means are employed to 
collect and arrange them ; the concert must necessarily be tempo- 
rary should it on consideration be approved by the Governments 
of the two Countries. Coffee is an article of equal importance 
with Sugar, and instructions have been sent to the British Consuls 
to collect information of the qua?itity of these articles exported from 
the countries where they severally reside, in order to assist in de- 
ciding how far this Trade is in our hands. I have, as you would 
suppose, said that I could conclude nothing, nor shall I do any- 
thing that would in the smallest degree compromit us ; but if the 
Subject should appear to the President to deserve attention, he 
will perhaps think it proper by the earliest opportunity that you 
should express to me his instructions respecting it. 

After our conference on this subject had ended, I took occasion 
to express to Mr. Pitt the embarrassment to which several 
branches of our Trade to this Country are liable from the intri- 
cacy, the prohibitory clauses, and in several instances the rigour 
of their commercial Laws, and adverting to the relaxation that 
usually takes place during every war in their famous Navigation 
act, expressed a wish that the policy might become more and 
more clear of permitting England to become the Entrepot of the 
Trade of foreign nations. He immediately interrupted me by 
saying he was in hopes that the next session would not pass over 
without the establishment of extensive and very important regula- 
tions on that subject ; and I hear it is in contemplation to make 
eight or ten free Ports in Great Britain where the Productions of 
all Nations may be brought and deposited, free of all duties except 
on such of them as shall be taken out for home consumption ; a

policy that beyond any other will serve to increase the wealth, and 
extend the Commerce of this Nation. 

Our Conversation finished by Mr. Pitt declaring to me that 
their commerce during the last year had been more extensive 
and their ordinary revenues more productive than in any former 
year, and that the result as well in regard to the new, as to the 
old Taxes, disproved the assertions which had been made respect- 
ing the incapacity of the Nation to support the burthen it was 
obliged to bear, and joined to the prevailing unanimity and firm- 
ness of the Country, afforded him the fullest conviction that even 
alone England would be able to carry on the war as long as France 
may be inclined to pursue it. 

I hear it has been decided to maintain a strong and superior 
naval force in the Mediterranean, a circumstance that I hope will 
be turned to profit by our Merchants, and particularly by those 
concerned in the Fisheries. It is believed that we should begin 
to indemnify ourselves for the numerous expenses of the Barbary 
Treaties. 

Sir James Marriot has resigned and the probability is that Sir 
William Scott will be his successor. This is an event of great 
importance to us as well as to all others who have suffered by the 
caprice, inferiority and incapacity of the late Judge. . . . The 
long vacation, as it is called, being nearly over, I intend resuming 
with the Chancellor the Question respecting the Maryland Bank 
Stock. Russell's family has certainly been compensated and I 
really see no remaining objection to the claim. 

With great respect and Esteem &c. &c.

Sir: 

I have had the honor to receive your Letter of the 13th inst, 
with a copy of one which had been written to you by Mr. Coffin,

tor it will be necessary to apply at Halifax for licence from him 
or his agent for permission to resort to the said Islands. 

It appears that a grant of the Islands in question has been 
made to Mr. Coffin ; but as such grant by no means implies the 
settlement of the said Islands, I will instruct his Majesty's Gov- 
ernor of Newfoundland, including the Magdalen Islands, to take 
particular care that no interruption is given to the liberty granted 
to the American fishermen by the 3d Article of the Treaty of 
Peace of 1783 between his Majesty and the United States of 
America to dry and cure fish in any of the Bays, Harbours & 
Creeks of the said Islands (amongst other places mentioned in 
the 3d Article) so long as the same shall remain unsettled.

London, Oct. 19, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . The newspapers continue to announce that prepara- 
tions are making to send the Irish State Prisoners to the United 
States. I wrote another Letter to the Duke of Portland upon the 
subject, a copy of which is annexed & likewise a copy of his 
Grace's Letter to Lord Cornwallis,* that has been sent to me, & 
which will, I presume, relieve me from any further concern on 
that head. I also annex the copies of a Letter that I lately 
wrote to the Duke of Portland & his answer respecting a claim 
affecting our fisheries that had been notify'd to me by Captain 
Israel Coffin. Though I am not certain that our fishermen resort 
to the Magdalen Islands, or are in the practice of curing their 
fish abroad, I judged it desirable to resist this claim, and by no 
means to lose a moment in asserting the true construction of the 
Treaty of Peace concerning this important Branch of our National 
enterprize and industry. The answer of the Duke is satisfactory 
and may hereafter be an important document. 

Though we are without particular account of the issue of the 
Battle, there is no doubt that the expedition that lately sailed from 
Brest was destined against Ireland, and that it has been met and 
defeated by the English squadron off the northwest angle of Ire- 

* See Appendix IV.

land ; the battle, which was seen from the shore, took place on the 
1 2th. The other expedition that was reported to have sailed 
from Dunkirk is said to have been driven into some of the Dutch 
Ports. 

I understand it to be ascertained that all the Irish patriots who 
were some time since at Paris embarked with the Expedition from 
Brest. This defeat will therefore in all probability put an end for 
some time to further Schemes of Invasion. 

According to the last news from the Mediterranean and Italy, 
the late victory of Nelson has had a very great influence in en- 
couraging and confirming Hostilities against France. A revolt is 
said to have taken place in Malta, and I think it probable that the 
English will now endeavour to become Masters of that important 
Island. 

A Paris paper of the 8th instant contains the following para- 
graph, " Les derniers lettres de Bordeaux assurent qu'il y est ar-

Dear Sir : 

I am very much obliged to you for your private letter of the 
29th of August. I had heard a rumour that General Knox was 
not pleased ; tho' I have no great reliance upon my own opinion 
in regard to questions of rank among military men, I should not 
have believed that General Knox would have made and persisted 
in an objection to Hamilton's being placed above him. I am 
however glad that the question is not likely to deprive us of Gen- 
eral Knox's services. You are silent concerning South America* ; 
I have again and again touched upon it ; I have wished to say 

much more, but I have not thought it prudent. As England is

are here, as we could desire : there will be precisely such a co- 
operation as we wish the moment we are ready — The Secretary of 
State will shew you my communications on this subject, tho' I 
have not a word from him respecting it ; your outline corresponds 
with what has been suggested by me, and approved by this Gov- 
ernment — fortunately some months past I obtained a fac simile of 
the latest Map of the Country — it has been now two Months in 
the Hands of an Engraver, who has engaged to deliver the Copies 
in January — This Government has considerable information re- 
specting the interior, as well as concerning the condition and 
Dispositions of the Inhabitants, tho' I apprehend it is not of a 
recent date — What we know is favorable ; but if we are to be 
betrayed by France, the glorious opportunity will be lost — I am 
gratified in receiving your opinion of the good condition of our 
public affairs, but do not feel confident that we are as safe as you 
appear to think we are — It is fraud not force that I fear — A Paris 
Paper of the 8th instant which is the latest that takes any notice 
of the U. S. says, " Les derniers lettres de Bordeaux assurent

N. Webster, Jr. to R. King. 

New Haven, Nov. i, 1798. 
Sir : 

. . . You must be well acquainted with the various meas- 
ures and changes of public opinion in this country. From the 
time you left America till the publication of the dispatches from 
our Envoys in France, no change of consequence took place in 
the strength of parties. That publication had a great effect. 
There is no doubt that many real converts were made to the 
measures of our Govt. Other opposers were silent or became 
moderate or neutral. But a principal effect was the exhibition 
of the real force of our Govt. Men who had been active advo- 
cates of Govt, and others who were staunch, but inactive friends 
came forward with boldness and confidence, & pledged them- 
selves to maintain Govt. The wisdom & the property are now 
enlisted & committed on the side of Govt. — a thing much wanted, 
in a country, whose Govt, rests on popular opinion. 

The Elections, I conceive, do not exhibit the strength of the 
party on which France relied for aid in case of a serious Crisis. 
There are multitudes of men who vote for certain leaders in oppo- 
sition from former friendships and confidence in men who will 
never enlist under a military commander to aid a foreign invader. 
France deceives herself if she relies on the elections for an 
estimate of her force in this country, farther than to aid a change 
in the administration. Indeed this may be all she intends or 
wants. 

But it is confidently expected that the next Congress will show 
a more decided majority in favor of Govt, than the last. We are 
now apprehensive of the " diplomatic skill " of France in holding 
out apparently friendly offers, which shall ensnare our credulous 

* Torn off. 



456 RUFUS KING. [1798 

fellow citizens. Agst. this we must guard night and day. Of our 
Executive, there is no danger ; but you well know, Sir, the fas- 
cinating powers of French arts over weaker minds. 

Our last advices from Europe show a troubled State of Nations. 
I apprehend after all a general change in the Govts, in Europe, 
unless perhaps the British Fleet should save the nation from the 
contagion. It appears to me that democracy is planted already in 
most of that part of the world and that no force whatever can 
exterminate it. Whatever may be the ultimate result, certain it 
is that during the struggle between the old and new systems, 
Europe must be a continual scene of convulsions and misery. 
Our distance may protect us, but great care must be taken here 
to prevent the effect of French principles. . . . 

The dreadful pestilence which has scourged our cities, the sum- 
mer past, is abating and business revives. New York will lose 
about 2000 of her citizens & Philada. twice that number. . . . 
The disease has this year been more mortal & contagious than 
before & has more frequently put on the form of Levant plague. 
It has demonstrated the fact that the plague is only the worst form 
of bilious fever. The received theories about the origin of the 
plague will all be overthrown by our experience. The notion that 
this disease is propagated by specifc contagion only, from the 
Levant into the northern part of Europe, is totally unfounded, 
and will soon be completely disproved. The Faculty of Europe 
have yet to learn that the great principle which causes the 
X>lague, or which gives the usual autumnal fevers the malignity 
of pestilence, is commonly diffused over a great part of the habi- 
table globe at the same ti?7ie, and shows its effects in Europe, 
Asia, Africa, & America in the same year or the same season. 
This I shall demonstrate in a work I am preparing for the press. 
In this, I want exceedingly the bills of mortality for Paris, Am- 
sterdam, Copenhagen, Osnaburg, Vienna, Berlin and some cities 
in the South of Europe, for a century or two past, (London bills 
I have) and I had thoughts of writing to the Royal Society to 
procure them thro' their influence ; but I have omitted it, because 
the work is here called for & I must publish it, the winter com- 
ing. As soon as the work is out I will send you a copy. 
With great respect, your obt. Servt.

R. King to Secretary of State. No. 7. 

London, Nov. 5, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

A Swiss lately arrived here from the Continent with an order 
from Talleyrand to procure and send to him all the English 
charts and Maps of the Bahama Islands in the Gulph of Mexico, 
Louisiana & of the United States. Some few maps of other 
countries were likewise inserted in the List and probably intended 
as blinds ; the order has been executed by Faden. Pitcairn* in- 
forms me by the last Hamburgh mail that Matthew Salmon, a 
Mulatto, formerly a St. Domingo Representative in the Conven- 
tion, with his wife also a Mulatto and two other of the name of 
Villard and Collier, are on the point of embarking on board the 
Danish ship Minerva, Capt. Kramp, from Hamburgh to Charles- 
ton, S. Carolina. Salmon has large Dispatches from the French 
Directoire concealed in tubs (cases) with false bottoms ; they 
have Passports from the Magistrates of Hamburgh as Swiss. 

In the late conference with Genl Rose who conducts the busi- 
ness of the Ordnance Department in the absence of Lord Cornwallis, 
he said that he was authorized to inform me that in the event of war 
between us and France, they would instantly divide with us the Mus- 
kets and other military stores in their possession, and that they would 
moreover without a moment's delay ship and send the same to us 
in some of their men of war ; that they were desirous of affording 
us immediately the supply we want, but that their own demands as 
well as those of the Turks which they were now obliged to supply to a 
considerable extent, added to the earnest importunities from 
Portugal for arms to assist her in defending herself against the 
invasion with which she is again threatened, put it out of their power 
to supply us with the quantity we have requested j that they had 
however concluded to deliver us two or three thousand immedi- 
ately and to continue to deliver us five hundred at the beginning 
of every month ; that orders to this effect would be immediately 
given to the officers of the Tower where the arms would be properly 
packed in boxes ready to be shipped ; the price will be the same as 
that paid by the ordnance. 

Pitcairn has contracted for 6000 Mitskets, a part of which are 

* Italics in cipher. 



458 RUFUS KING. [l79S 

already shipped, and the whole will probably be delivered in the 
course of three months. The price is lower than that of England, 
but I am very fearful they are not such as we shall approve 
though we have used every precaution in order to escape 
imposition. 

I have a faint hope of obtaining a quantity of Bavarian Mus- 
kets which are not quite the model we should prefer ; but their 
caliber is like that of the English Muskets, and they are moreover 
to be relied upon as effective arms, being all proved in the Prussian 
arsenals. 

We continue to receive vague Rumours from the Continent of 
the surrender of the French to the Inhabitants of Malta, of the 
destruction of the Transports at Alexandria & of the Capitula- 
tion of Buonaparte. The late mail brings us nothing satisfactory 
or certain respecting the issue of the negotiations at Rastadt. The 
Emperor continues his military preparations and France inforces 
the new requisitions. We have no confirmation of the renewal of 
the Embargo on our ships in the French ports ; but the capture 
of our ships by the French Privateers is frequent and without any 
perceptible discrimination in respect to their voyages or the nature 
of their cargoes. Some of these captures arrive in France, most 
of them are carried into Spain, and many of them are recaptured 
and brought into this Country. The last mail from Ireland 
brought intelligence of the appearance of several more French 
Frigates with troops in Killala Bay, which are said to have put to 
sea again on learning the Defeat of the Expedition from Brest. 
These Frigates are supposed to have come from Rochefort or Ro- 
chelle and to have been destined to reinforce the troops from 
Brest. They will with difficulty regain their own ports. 

The Thetis, Capt. Cochran, has lately arrived from Halifax. I 
had some time before spoken to Lord Spencer respecting the dis- 
contents excited among our Merchants by the vexatious captures 
made by this officer upon our coasts & expressed a wish that he 
might be recalled. His Lordship on his arrival gave an immediate 
notice thereof, with an assurance that he should not return. 
With perfect Respect and Esteem, &c. &c.

1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 459 

T. Pickering to R. King. No. 32. 

Department of State, November 7, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

In your 92 you remind me of the advances you have made to 
Mr. La Fayette. The President has not yet returned from Massa- 
chusetts, but in his absence I express to you my opinion (in which 
the Secretary of the Treasury decidedly concurs) that you should 
stop your hand and make him no further advances. There is in fact, 
as Mr. Wolcott remarked, no appropriation to cover them. . . . 

The arret for recalling the Commissioners of French Privateers 
in the West Indies is perfectly illusory, seeing all the Laws and 
arrets to capture neutral vessels remain in full force. But you well 
know that their depredations on our commerce in the European 
seas, tho' not as numerous, have been as atrocious as those in the 
West Indies. Yet Mr. Gerry in his communications with Mr. 
Talleyrand adverted only to those in the West Indies, as tho' the 
ports of France and Spain were exempt from such monstrous viola- 
tions of the Laws of Nations and of the most obvious princplies of 
Justice. This unfounded distinction by Mr. Gerry was the result 
of unpardonable ignorance or criminal complaisance. . . . 
Copies (of Mr. Gerry's dispatches) are preparing to be laid before 
Congress. This step will be necessary for two reasons ; one to 
satisfy the public expectation, the other, to prove that all Talley- 
rand's overtures were inconsequential ; and their main object to 
procrastinate, and in the mean time, by amicable tho' deceitful 
professions of an ardent desire of reconciliation, to lull us asleep, 
until the French should be at leisure to take vengeance for our 
daring to look "the Great Nation " in the face and to prosecute 
their original plan of subjugating the United States, as they have 
done Switzerland, Holland, &c. You will recollect that in some 
letter from General Pinckney when alone at Paris, he recited an 
expression of a Frenchman, who had been in America, " That the 
United States merited no more consideration than Genoa or Geneva " : 
it was Mr. Talleyrand who made this declaration. We see what 
the French have done with these Republics, and our fate was to be 
similar ; for according toTalleyrand our supposed divisions would 
render us equally weak and unable to resist. . . . 



460 RUFUS KING. [1798 

R. King to A. Hamilton.* 

London, Nov. 9, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

The same uncertainty exists respecting the recommencement of 
the war. Both Austria and Prussia are bolder than before the late 
naval success of this country ; but the conduct of the Emperor 
is rather calculated to show that he may be purchased by further 
acquisitions in Italy. Naples will not decline a war. Her exist- 
ence perhaps depends upon her provoking it. 

The casus foederis with Austria is a defensive war, but the 
Emperor has said that he should not be critical on that head. 
The news of the capitulation of Buonaparte and the destruction 
of the transports at Alexandria, is not confirmed, though they are 
events that must take place. The expeditions against Ireland are 
annihilated. Of the nine ships that sailed from Brest, seven, 
including the Hoche, are in the English ports ; the two frigates 
that escaped from the Texel have both been taken ; and of the 
three that sailed from Rochefort and appeared off Ireland soon 
after the defeat of the Brest squadron, two are said to be taken. 

The Dutch frigates were probably bound to Demerara, though 
the soldiers were told they were to go to Ireland. 

Parliament meets on the 20th. Mr. Pitt will have a good 
account to give of the extension of their commerce, and of the 
increase of the revenue. The assessed taxes, which have been 
shamefully evaded, will be given up, and a tax upon the income 
of the nation substituted. There will be great difficulties in the 
details, as well as strong prejudices to overcome, but I hear that 
the body of merchants in London are to support the plan. The 
late naval success has excited a high degree of animation through- 
out the nation : and the government will be generally and cor- 
dially supported in such measures as it shall adopt to prosecute 
the war. The funds have gone up to 57 per cent, which is a great 
rise, and in a short time. You will see that I have prevented the 
sending to you of about fifty Irish state prisoners, who were at 
the head of the rebellion in Ireland, and closely connected with 
the Directory at Paris. Probably our patriots will think my con- 
duct presumptuous. In the present posture of our affairs, I

could have no hesitation. We have an account that the Constel- 
lation, Capt. Truxton, has taken a French frigate on our coast. 
This news is brought by Capt. Cochrane, of the Thetis, who will 
not be permitted to return to the American station. 

Yours very truly, &c. 

P. S. The Hamburgh Mail, just arrived, informs us that very 
great resistance is made to the requisition of 200,000 men in Bel- 
gium ; 12,000 young men are embodied, and the spirit of revolt 
extends itself every where. The scene is too near the army of the 
Rhine. 



R. King to W. V. Murray. 

London, Nov. 17, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

To avoid any misunderstanding I put my letter of the 16th of 
August and yours of the 7th of September and 6th of October 
into the hands of Lord Grenville* with a request that he would 
give me in writing what he should think proper to be said to you 
upon the subject. Annexed you have a copy of his Letter 
to me. 

With sincere attachment &c.

Lord Grenville to R. King. 

Private. Copy. 

Dropmore, Nov. 6, 1798. 
My dear Sir : 

I return you the two letters which you had the goodness to 
leave with me. I think I collect from them that the persons with 
whom Mr. Murray has conversed* will not treat with us about the 
means of delivering their Country from the yoke of France unless 
we first agree that the P. of O. and the Stadtholderate should be 
set aside. 

This condition we consider as wholly inadmissible as a prelimi- 
nary to such a discussion, nor can we give the least expectation 

* Italics in cipher. 



462 RUFUS KING. [1798 

that it would even be the result of it. We hold it to be impos- 
sible to restore, and still more to maintain the tranquillity of that 
country by the exclusion of the most numerous party in it. 

The object of England is what you stated to Mr. M ., and what 
it has been for above a century : to see in that Country a rational, 
free and efficient Government, capable of providing for its domes- 
tic happiness and maintaining a real independence with respect 
to all its neighbors. The prosecution of one party for the past, or 
its exclusion, or that of the other party for the future are equally 
incompatible with these objects. Those persons whoever they 
may be who concur in this wish would find in England a willing 
and a powerful assistance : but there is nothing in the present 
relative state of G. Britain and Holland, which could tempt us to 
embark in any more limited plan at the risk of increasing instead 
of destroying the internal dissension of that Country, and thereby 
exposing it to become avowedly and permanently what it is now in 
substance, but for a time only, a conquered Country annexed to the 
present Government of France. 

With many thanks to you and to Mr. M. for the trouble you 
have taken on this subject, Believe me, my dear Sir &c. &c. 

Grenville, j6. 

P. S. I need hardly repeat that if, on the ground stated in this 
letter and in yours of 16th August, there is any disposition to open 
a discussion with us, our disposition remains the same, and it would 
only be for them to name the place and person where and thro 
whom they would communicate. We would immediately give the 
necessary instructions to a fit person on our part. 

Grenville. 

R. King to Secretary of State. No. 8. 

London, Nov. 10, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

The same uncertainty continues with respect to the recom- 
mencement of the war between Austria and France, and for 
nearly three weeks we are without any precise information from 
Paris. Naples will not decline the war, nay she appears inclined 
to provoke it. The casus foederis with Austria is a defensive war, 
but the Emperor has lately given assurances that he shall not be 
critical on that point. 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 463 

The Irish Expeditions have all failed and most of the French 
ships are prizes in the English ports. Parliament meets on the 
20th ; the Nation is animated by the late victories at sea and the 
Government will receive a very general and cordial support. 

There is no doubt that the Union with Ireland will be proposed 
and as there are thirty thousand English troops in that country, 
the measure will probably be carried into execution, tho' there 
will be much opposition. 

There appears to be very great activity among the Merchants 
in preparing voyages for the Levant. The interruption of the 
supplies of rice from Egypt to Constantinople has created a great 
demand and sudden rise in the price of that and some other com- 
modities in this market. I cannot but think the present a favor- 
able moment not only for the extension of our trade in the 
* Mediterranean, but for the conclusion of a commercial Treaty with 
the Porte. Speaking upon this subject to Lord Grenville, he assured 
me that we might with confidence rely upon their good offices and in- 
fluence at Constantifiople in any arrangements we may be inclined to 
make there. 

The Russian Envoy of his own accord yesterday observed to me 
that we have considerable trade in the Baltic and it appeared 
somewhat singular that no direct intercourse or correspondence had 
ever subsisted between our two Governments. He added that they 
stood well at this moment with the Porte with whom we might have 
an interest in making a commercial Treaty, and that he had no 
reason to doubt that the Emperor would be inclined not only to form 
a commercial Treaty with us, but moreover to afford us his Influence 
in concluding one with the Porte. 

I answered that I could perceive considerable advantage in a 
commercial Treaty with Russia and that it would undoubtedly be 
an object of importance to extend and establish our Trade in the 
Levant. He then proposed that we should take an early opportunity 
of resuming this conversation, and concluded by saying that by 
writing to our respective Governments, if the measure should be 
found adviseable, they might authorize the Treaty to be negotiated 
here. 

I have thought it best to report this conversation, tho' the sub- 
ject is referred to another interview. Count Woronzow is a man

volt is hourly extending itself. But the army of the Lower Rhine

New York, 16th Nov., 1798. 
My dear Sir : 

. . . Quitting the subject of farms, I proceed to give you a 

general sketch of our political state. . . . Genl. Pinckney & 

Mr. Gerry are both arrived, the former at this port and the latter 

at Boston. . . . No man can stand higher in public opinion 

than he (Genl. Pinckney) does. Saving General Washington, I 

believe the President, Pinckney and Marshall are the most popular 

characters now in our country. There is a certain something in 

the correspondence of Pinckney and Marshall (for Gerry seems 
vol n—30 465 



466 RUFUS KING. [1798 

to be considered a blank) with Talleyrand that has united all heads 
and hearts in their eulogy. Pinckney is well pleased with his late 
appointment of Major General and has expressed great pleas- 
ure at the idea of serving under Hamilton. Knox, it is said, has 
resigned his appointment, and I have seen a surmise that his 
land operations have so embarrassed him as to make his entrance 
upon public life inconvenient. The President was doubtless 
favorable to Knox's pretensions against Hamilton. There is no 
cordiality on the part of the President to Hamilton. During the 
last election for President, Hamilton publickly gave out his wishes 
that Pinckney should be elected President. These wishes were 
communicated both privately and publickly to the President, and 
have occasioned, I suspect, more than a coolness on the part of 
the President. I blamed Hamilton at the time for making the 
declarations he did, and I foresaw that evil would arise from 
them. . . . 

There is now a council of war at Philadelphia. General Wash- 
ington is there attending it with all the Major Generals. The 
precise object is not known ; but the public expectation is that 
vigorous measures will speedily be adopted and pursued to bring 
our army into the field. 

Gerry upon his landing in Boston was said to have been re- 
ceived with three cheers : since which I have heard nothing of 
him except that the Boston papers announce that he detests the 
French — has a budget, which, when opened, will give additional 
and very strong proofs of French perfidy and corruption, and that 
he warmly approves of the measures lately adopted by our 
government. 

The famous Dr. Logan, who is generally called Jefferson's 
Envoy Extraordinary, has lately arrived from France with de- 
spatches, as report announces, from the Directory to the Secretary 
of State. The same report also announces that he hastened to 
Trenton to deliver his despatches to the Secretary, who dismissed 
him with a flea in his ear. . . . It is asserted in the papers 
with the appearance of authority from the Secretary . . . that 
as to any overtures or propositions towards a negotiation there 
are none. . . . I do not think that a more rooted detestation 
of France exists in England, than prevails with a great mass of 
our fellow citizens. All the old prejudices instilled into our 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 467 

minds by our ancestors, seem to be revived and to have acquired 
infinitely more force than they ever possessed. So let them re- 
main till time shall cease to run his course. 

Speaking of the elections to Congress Mr. T. says among other 
things, Marshall is certainly a candidate for the district in which 
he lives, and has published an answer to some questions addressed 
to him. He thinks the Alien and Sedition bills lately passed by 
Congress were unneccessary and that he should, if he had been 
in Congress at the time, have opposed them. On the subject of a 
Treaty with Great Britain he is, if we form one during the con- 
troversy with France, for confining it to objects connected wholly 
with the controversy and to end with it. He means, if elected, 
to vote for the repeal of the Alien and Sedition Bills. . . . 

At a late circuit court of the U. States — Judge Paterson pre- 
siding, in Vermont, Lyons was indicted for printing — it seems he 
has set up a press there — a letter written by Joel Barlow to Bald- 
win of Georgia. The letter goes by the name of the Barlow 
letter. It is an infamous libel on our government and eulogy on 
that of France ; it was written last spring. Lyons after a very 
fair trial, was found guilty and sentenced to pay a fine of 1000 
dollars and suffer four months imprisonment. He is now in gaol. 
During the trial and afterwards he behaved like himself — like a 
fool and a blackguard. Mrs. Bache, the widow of the editor of 
the Aurora, considers him a martyr. This woman has renewed 
her husband's paper with as much virulence as was manifested by 
her husband. This also is the case with Greenleaf's widow. . . 

17th Nov., 1798. 

Benson has just returned from the Eastward, where he has been 
attending the St. Croix Commissioners. This line is at length 
settled. The Commissioners have unanimously decided against 
us and in favor of the pretensions of Great Britain. 

The Commissioners for British Debts, it is said, have decided 
that debts due to persons attainted by our laws during the late 
Revolution, are to be paid on the ground that those debts have 
been prevented from being recovered by lawful impediments. A 
precedent of this kind has been set in the case of Dr. Inglis, now 
Bishop of Nova Scotia, and formerly an Episcopal Clergyman in 
this City. He is named in our Bill of attainder. I am not with- 



468 RUFUS KING. [1798 

out a suspicion that this precedent is not warranted by the 
Treaty. It will cut deeply — and I think will create not a little 
uneasiness. . . . 

The Philadelphia papers announce that Dr. Logan has been to 
pay his respects to General Washington, and that he met with a 
very dry and contemptuous reception. . . 

Very truly yours

George Cabot to R. King. 

Nov. 16, 1798. 
My dear Sir : 

I lament that while our Elections must be considered as the 
truest test of public opinion their evidence at the present junc- 
ture is so unfavorable. The result of ours is not wholly known 
but Varnum is rechosen & the declination of Isaac Packer will 
open the way for Dearborn. In the District where I reside a 
very great effort was made in favor of Heath & conducted with 
so much system and industry as gave me much uneasiness. It 
appeared evidently that a plan was formed to bring every jacobin 
to the poll without any previous alarm to the Federalists ; these 
however were not wholly surprised & Otis was carried by 400 
majority. 

Genl. Knox declines serving in the army unless he can be placed 
above Hamilton where neither the Govt, the people, nor his own 
merits wou'd place him — a hope has been entertained that Gen^ 
Pinckney wou'd adopt similar opinions but far from every such 
idea he readily declared his satisfaction with the arrangement & 
his great pleasure in seeing Hamilton employed where his Genius 
& Talents fairly ranked him — this business is now adjusted & 
Knox's refusal is perhaps no injury, for his private embarrass- 
ments wou'd always have hung heavy about him & sunk him in 
the public estimation : I regret however that his feelings have 
stimulated him to speak of Hamilton privately as a man of in- 
satiable ambition &c — 

Gerry since his return has declared pretty explicitly his appro- 
bation of our National Measures & his desire to see them per- 
sisted in & supported. The President appears to think him a 
good patriot still & considers his errors as no greater than his 



I79 8 l LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 469 

colleagues especially Pinckney's ; this disposition in the P. to 
cover the follies & improprieties of his friend, threatens us with 
new & mischievous schisms. Gerry's conduct will be reprobated 
by the wise & the good if there shou'd be a discussion of the 
respective merits of the Envoys in the Newspapers or elsewhere. 
Already the P. in answering an address from the people of 
Machias has spoken of the errors of the Envoys as if they were 
common : a little more of this wou'd bring forward Pinckney & 
Marshal who can hardly vindicate themselves without criminating 
Gerry. Col. Pickering in his excellent answer to P. Johnson has 
used expressions which wound Gerry & the latter has written an 
explanatory letter to the President in which he treats Pickering 
with some little disrespect. This letter the Prest. forwarded to 
Pickering with his own, a request that, as it wou'd be some satis- 
faction to Gerry & cou'd do harm to no one, it might be inserted 
in some public print — but Pickering will not publish it & if it 
shou'd be published he will comment upon it & upon Gerry's 
conduct in a manner that will show his business in a strong light. 
Prudence forbids me to write all you wou'd wish to know & I 
hope you will learn nothing more on the subject for we need all 
our strength against the common Enemy & therefore must suffer 
no division : some pains are taken to prevent this matter from 
proceeding which I trust will be successful. With the purest 
principles of Morality & patriotism & a profound knowledge of 
the theory of Govt, the Prest. needs some faithful monitor to 
guard him against the delusions of his own heart, which tho' a 
very good one, its impulses shou'd not be followed without critical 
examination. Yours faithfully & affectly —

Dear Sir : 

We have Paris papers to the nth instant. Notwithstanding the 
slavery of the Press, their papers contain curious articles which 
shew not only that the interior of France is in a state of consider- 
able agitation but that the Directory think themselves on the eve 
of the renewal of the war. I was yesterday informed from a re- 
spectable quarter that Naples would certainly begin. The march 



470 RUFUS KING. [1798 

of the Austrians into the country of the Grisons is an important 
measure, and not likely to have happened unless the war had 
seemed inevitable. The annexed arrete would appear extravagant 
and incredible if it proceeded from any other authority ; but man- 
kind is so accustomed to the violence and injustice of France, that 
we almost cease to express our surprize and indignation at the new 
instances she continues to display. 

Some of the foreign ministers have urged this Government to 
make reprisals on the French Prisoners, and the measure is now 
under consideration. I have remained silent. Two of our citi- 
zens who commanded a French Privateer are prisoners here ; I 
have heard of no prosecution against them.

Dear Sir : 

From the character that Mr. Coke gives of Lynch, there can be 
no danger apprehended from his residence in America. The only- 
objection to our consenting to his going there is that it will be an 
exception to a good Rule and may lead to other applications. 

But under the circumstances of his case, and especially as Lord 
Cornwallis must see something in it, that discriminates it from 
others, I beg you to inform the Duke of Portland that I do not 
object to Lynch's being permitted to proceed to the United States 
of America. 

With the most sincere esteem & Regard &c &c.

Dear Sir : 

. . . Parliament met on the 20th. The King's speech mani- 
fests a decided resolution to persevere in the war, & the unanimity 
and zeal of the Nation will enable the Ministers to raise the sup- 
plies without difficulty. An early Loan will be negotiated, tho* it 
is understood that the plan of raising a considerable portion of 
the Supplies within the year will be persisted in. 

The Directory enforces the new Levies, tho' they meet with 
considerable opposition, particularly in Brabant & the annexed 
territories. The Insurrection in Brabant has been very extensive, 
but the Insurgents will not be able to maintain the Contest. The 
accounts sometime since circulated of the burning of the Trans- 
ports at Alexandria are discredited, and if, as there are some 
appearances of being the case, Buonaparte succeeds in conciliat- 
ing any considerable bodies of the Inhabitants, he will be able to 
maintain himself a long time in that fruitful country. 

Annexed I send you a copy of a Note from Lord Grenville 
respecting the French arrete transmitted to you with my number 
9. A late French paper contains a second arrete, which sus- 
pends the execution of the first.

472 RUFUS KING. [1798 

Lord Grenville to R. King. 

Copy. 

Downing Street, November 27, 1798. 

The undersigned, His Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign 
Affairs, has the honor of communicating to Mr. King Minister 
Plenipotentiary for the United States of America for the informa- 
tion of his Govt., that by a Decree published officially at Paris it 
appears to have been declared in the name of the French Direc- 
tory, that every person being a native of, or originally belonging 
to neutral countries, or to such as are in amity & alliance with 
the French republic, who shall bear any Commission under His 
Majesty, or who shall form a part of the crews of British ships of 
war or other vessels, should on the proof of that fact alone, be 
considered and treated as a Pirate, and that it has been ordered 
that this Resolution shall be notified to the neutral powers and to 
those in alliance with France. 

Even this Decree, contrary as it is to the usage of every civil- 
ized nation, cannot excite our surprize as proceeding from those 
in whose name it has been published. To the different powers 
who are thus insulted and whose innocent subjects are exposed to 
the most cruel treatment on the part of a Govt., professing friend- 
ship or alliance with them, His Majesty must leave it to adopt such 
measures as they will without doubt judge necessary in the case 
of an outrage hitherto unexampled in the History of the World. 

The King however feels that protection is due from him to 
those who sail under his flag, either in his Majesty's ships of war, 
or in other British vessels. His Majesty has therefore not hesi- 
tated to direct it to be signified to the Commissary of French 
Prisoners in G. Britain that the first instance of the execution of 
this Decree shall be followed by the most rigorous retaliation 
against the French Prisoners, whom the fortune of War has 
already, or may hereafter place at the King's disposal. 

It would certainly never be but with extreme reluctance that 
the King could yield to the painful necessity of subjecting any 
unfortunate individuals, to the fatal but inevitable effects of this 
atrocious Decree ; but His Majesty will have at least the satis- 
faction of feeling that nothing has been omitted on his part to 
prevent its execution ; that the authors of it can alone be con- 
sidered responsible for all its guilt and all its consequences. 

Grenville. 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE, 473 

R. King to Lord Grenville. 
Private. 

Great Cumberland Place, Dec. 1, 1798. 
My Lord : 

I continue to be urged, and more frequently than I could have 
wished, have applied to your Lordship and others respecting the 
Maryland Bank Stock. The Lord Chancellor to whom I am 
much obliged for the politeness and favorable disposition with 
which he has uniformly attended to my repeated efforts to bring 
this business to a conclusion, must notwithstanding his habitual 
patience and good temper be fatigued with hearing, as I really 
am with devising, new expedients for that Purpose. I have 
therefore determined to relinquish a course that I have so assidu- 
ously tho' ineffectually followed, and will send to your Lordship 
a note referring to those heretofore presented, and requesting an 
answer whether the stock in question will without further delay 
be transferred to the State of Maryland. Previous however to 
the adoption of this step, availing myself of the freedom with 
which I am accustomed to treat every subject with your Lord- 
ship, I have thought it adviseable to write this private Letter to 
your Lordship, and not without the hope that, through your in- 
terference assisted by the good offices of the Lord Chancellor, the 
presentation of the note may become unnecessary. 

I am the more encouraged to hope that this may be the case 
when I consider that since this Question has been depending be- 
fore the Court of Chancery (the suit commenced in 1784) all the 
persons who opposed the transfer and who lost real estate by the 
American Revolution, including as well the Ewers, as the family 
of Russell, have been compensated for their losses by his Majesty's 
Government, and that all persons who have incurred losses by 
the non-payment or confiscation of American Debts, have a 
remedy before the Commission under the late Treaty now open 
at Philadelphia. 

In truth, My Lord, there does not appear to exist any solid 
reason why this property should be longer withheld from its law- 
ful owners ; for according to my view of the Question, it belongs 
to the People of Maryland by the soundest and most solid of all 
titles, that of their having bought and paid for it. 

With perfect Esteem & Respect &c &c.

My Lord : 

The Newspapers speak in such positive terms of a Treaty con- 
cluded between General Maitland and Toussaint the negro Chief 
of St. Domingo, that I take the liberty^to enquire of your Lord- 
ship, whether any engagement of the nature of that said to have 
been formed by General Maitland has actually been concluded. 
Your Lordship knows how materially we are concerned, at the 
present moment, in this Enquiry ; and I flatter myself will on 
that account excuse what might otherwise seem a mere matter of 
Curiosity.

R. King to John Jay. 

London, Dec. 7, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

I have had the honor to receive your Letter of the 30th of 
Sept., and am sorry that we shall not be able at present, nor for 
a considerable time to come, to obtain in this Country the supply 
of arms wanted by the State of New York. I have for some time 
had orders from the Government of the U. S. for a much larger 
quantity of Muskets than I shall be able to procure. The Manu- 
facturers of this Country, tho' exclusively employ'd by the 
Government, not being able to supply its wants. So great indeed 
has been the Deficiency, that England has during the last year 
purchased and imported more than sixty thousand German Arms. 
I have purchased several thousand German Muskets at Ham- 
burgh ; they are made under the English model, are rather 
cheaper than those of England, but not as good. We can obtain 
Arms from no other part of Europe, and under these circum- 
stances I will immediately write to Mr. Pitcairn, our Consul at 
Hamburgh, to engage the manufacturers whom we have employed 
to make and have ready to deliver at Hamburgh in the Spring 
Three thousand Muskets with Steel Ramrods & Bayonets. The 
Remittances may be made to me or to him as the State of the 
Exchange shall recommend. Perhaps it will be best to remit 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 475 

directly to him as the Exchange between England and Hamburgh 
will be against the former if, as is not improbable, any of the 
Continental Powers are subsidized by this Country. 

With the most perfect Respect and Esteem, &c. &c. 

Rufus King. 

John Jay to R. King. 

Albany, 30th Sept., 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

A late Act of the Legislature of this State authorises me to 
purchase a further supply of arms, and the Money appropriated 
for that and other Purposes of Defence not being in the Treasury, 
I am empowered to borrow it. A Loan to the amount of two 
hundred thousand Dollars has been agreed to by the Bank of 
New York. The proportions in which this sum should be 
apply'd to the different objects of the Act have not yet been 
ascertained ; I cannot therefore at present determine on the exact 
number of arms which should be purchased : but being certain 
that it will not be less than three thousand Muskets and Bayonets, 
I must request the favor of you to take early measures for caus- 
ing that number to be made or purchased, so that they may be 
shipped in the Spring ; a sufficient sum for the purpose shall be 
seasonably remitted to you. Knowing the- confidence reposed by 
the Legislature on your Readiness to promote their views for the 
common good, I take the liberty of troubling you with this Busi- 
ness ; it will I am persuaded be cheerfully undertaken and prop- 
erly conducted.

. . . No material occurrence relative to the recommence- 
ment of the war has happened since the date of my last Letter. 
The Austrians continue to strengthen their Posts on the frontiers 
of Switzerland, and the French to reinforce their Army in Italy. 
It is a long time since we have heard from Buonaparte ; accord- 
ing to the Paris accounts he has conciliated large bodies of the

Inhabitants of the Country, is quietly establishing himself in 
Egypt, and will soon be in a condition to extend his conquests 
Where or how the united Squadrons of Turks and Russians are 
employed we know not. Nelson continues the blockade of 
Malta and the Expedition of six thousand men under General 
Stuart, that lately sailed from Gibraltar, is supposed to have gone 
against Minorca, a Position of importance to enable the English 
to maintain a naval superiority in the Mediterranean. 

Lord Elgin, late Envoy at Berlin, is going as Ambassador to 
Constantinople, and Mr. Grenville, an elder brother of Lord 
Grenville, goes on a special Mission to Berlin and Vienna. The 
particular motives to be presented by Mr. Grenville to those 
Courts are not known, but the object is to influence them to 
unite in a new confederacy against the Enemy. 

A Rumour having prevailed that previous to the Evacuation of 
Si. Domingo, General Maitland* concluded a Treaty with Tous- 
saint, according to the provisions of which a trade is to be opened 
between the English and the Inhabitants of that Island, I wrote a 
note to Lord Grenville, in which after stating how much in the 
present Situation of our affairs, we are interested in the Inquiry, 
I desired to be informed whether any such Treaty had been made. 
His L'dship referred me to Mr. Dundas, by whose orders I was 
shewn Genl. Maitland 's Dispatches and the Competition concluded 
between him and Toussaint, a copy of which is annexed. I asked if 
Hadonville and Ragaud were included in the Convention, and was 
answered in the negative. Did General Maitland consider Tous- 
saint as a Erench General, or as the Chief of an Independent State, 
the measure might issue in the Independence of St. Domingo ; if 
St. Domingo is an Independent State, we as well as you may trade 
there ; if a Erench Colony with whom you have concluded a truce, 
we cannot consent to supplies being carried there from the U. S. 
which would nourish and increase their Depredations on our Trade. 
The Reply was, that the Subject was not free of difficulty j that 
General Maitland without instruction or authority had concluded 
the Convention j that Toussaint had the most influence and greatest 
authority in the Island, and that if Hadofiville & Ragaud opposed 
him he would endeavour to expel them ; that England found the 
Conquest impracticable, and to prevent the danger to which Ja-

maica would be exposed they on the whole had thought it expedient 
to ratify the Convention ; that St. Domingo wd. be a market for 
our provisions, & that Coll. Grant was going there to superintend the 
Execution of the Convention. 

I returned from Mr. Dundas' office to Ld. Grenville, with 
whom I conversed on this extraordinary measure, taking care to 
remind his Ld.ship * of what he had formerly remarked to me 
concerning a supposed inclination on our part to encourage the 
Establishment of a Black Republic in St. Domingo. I think I am 
not mistaken in supposing that Lord Grenville does not approve of 
what has been done, and that he sees the pernicious effects, which 
it will have upon our Trade, as well as upon the future security of 
their own Colonies. I have this evening only reed, a copy of the 
Convention. If Toussainfs authority enables him to carry it into 
execution, it will be a measure of vast importance & one pregnant 
with extensive consequences. I shall write a Letter to-morrow to 
Mr. Dundas, stating the mischievous effects that it is likely to have 
upon our Trade ; but as the mail will be dispatched to-morrow, I 
will not be able to send you his reply. 

I have lately resumed the Maryland Business : I think I shall 
bring it to a conclusion — I hope a satisfactory one, but I dare not 
give any assurances that this will be the case. Under present 
circumstances I do not think it would be adviseable that the State 
should take any new or further step respecting it. . . .

P. could have been encreased, they would have been by his noble 
and manly conduct on this critical occasion. He is a man of the 
highest honor and greatest virtue, and merits all that the esteem 
and gratitude of his Country can bestow upon him. 

I am concerned to see the result of the Elections in New Jer- 
sey, Pennsylvania and Maryland, and am not without apprehen- 
sions that the late publications on the part of France have had a 
pernicious influence on public opinion ; unless the next H. of R. 
are intrinsically better than the present, I shall feel a most serious 
alarm for the tranquillity of the country. 

We may repeat it in a thousand addresses to the President that 
we are a united people ; but France will look to the divisions of the 
H. of R., and from them take courage to persevere in her fixed 
determination to break down our Government and divide our 
Country. 

Mr Listoris * last Dispatch gave rather a gloomy picture of our 
affairs ; he does the fullest justice to the Government and its 
views, but laments the activity and success of the Jacobins.

Dear Sir : 

Count Rumford, late Sir Benjamin Thomson, whose name 

and history are probably known to you, and whose talents and 

services have produced the most beneficial Establishments and 

Reforms in Bavaria, was lately named by the Elector to be his 

Minister at this Court ; on his arrival, he has been informed that, 

being a British Subject, it was contrary to usage to receive him 

and that therefore he could not be acknowledged. The intrigues 

and opposition against which he had for some years made head 

in Bavaria, probably made him desire the mission to England ; 

the refusal that he has here met with, has decided him to return 

and settle in America. He proposes to establish himself at or near 

Cambridge ; to live there in the character of a German Count, to 

renounce all political expectations and devote himself to literary 

* Italics in cipher.

pursuits. His connections in this country are strictly literary, 
and his knowledge particularly in the military department may 
be of great use to us. The Count is well acquainted with, and 
has had much experience in the Establishment of Cannon foun- 
deries : that which he established in Bavaria is spoken of in very 
high terms, as well as certain improvements he has introduced in 
the mounting of flying artillery. 

He possesses an extensive military Library, and assures me 
that he wishes nothing more than to be useful to our country. I 
make this communication by his desire and my wish is that he 
may be well received, as I am persuaded that his principles are 
good and his talents and information uncommonly extensive. It 
is possible that attempts may be made to misrepresent his politi- 
cal opinions ; from the Enquiry that I have made on this head, I 
am convinced that his political sentiments are correct. 

Be good enough to communicate this to the President.

R. King to W. Bingham. 

London, Dec. 8, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

I have received your obliging Letter of the 30. of Sep., and am 
happy to have heard by accounts of a later date that the fever 
has nearly disappeared. Your Session began on Monday last, 
and we wait with great impatience to learn what are your senti- 
ments on the subject of French affairs. The issue of the late 
Elections in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Maryland is not such 
as I had been led to expect, and would not I think have hap- 
pened unless the late publications in favor of France had had an 
undue and unfavorable influence on the Public opinions. 

It is in vain that we talk of national union, while so large and 
firm an opposition is seen in the H. of R. We deceive our- 
selves if we believe that the Directory believe us : they and their 
agents perfectly understand their Business, and by our Divisions 
are encouraged to persevere in their fixed Purpose to overthrow 
our Government and break up our Union : I respect your good 
sense and character too highly to express to you this opinion, did 



480 RUFUS KING. [1798 

I not most religiously entertain it ; and unless the Senators and 
Representatives, with a majority of the People likewise believe 
and act with vigor upon this opinion, the Government and the 
Country are lost. No man is more deeply concerned than you 
are in the Security and Prosperity of the Country ; no one is 
more able to form a correct Estimate of the dangers to which it 
is liable ; I therefore hope that the Crisis has drawn your atten- 
tion to the Subject, and because we have escaped many Perils 
by unforeseen means, that we shall not wholly depend on fortune 
to save us. 

I wish I could send you good tidings from this quarter of the 
world ; but I am more and more convinced that we must resolve 
to look to and depend upon ourselves, and not upon others for 
Security.

Philadelphia, Dec. 8th, 1798. 
My dear Sir : 

. . Your Sentiments of the Directory & their persevering 
Designs against this Country are in perfect Unison with mine — 
the late great & glorious Victory obtained over their Fleet by 
Admiral Nelson, will I hope give Them a severe Check, & that 
the Turks & Arabs have e'er this given a good Account of 
Buonaparte & his Army. The Peace & Happiness of Mankind 
render this almost essential, as They can be viewed in no other 
Light than the Plunderers & Destroyers of the human Race. 

I am extremely happy to inform you that there is already an 
Augmentation of Federalism in the next House of Representa- 
tives ; the Elections of Virginia, Kentucky & Tennessee are not 
yet made. We have some hopes that the Federalists will increase 
there. We calculate the present H. of R. 56 Feeds. 50 Antis. 
The Gain in the next H. on the different Sides stands thus — 
Fcederalists 2 in Massachusetts, 6 in N. Carolina, 2 in S. Caro- 
lina 2 in Georgia — total 12, Antis. 2 in New York, say 3 in New 
Jersey, as there are 2 Feeds, and 1 Anti & 2 dubious there, & I 
always set down the uncertain Man against Me, 1 in Maryland. 
Total say 6 — Majority in Favor of Feeds 6 which added to the 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 48 1 

Majority of the present House makes 12 — Should every Member 
from Virginia be in the Opposition, as there are now but 3 Feeds, 
there must at every Event be a Majority of 9 in the next H. of R. 
Giles has retired from Congress & gone into the State Legisla- 
ture, no Doubt to do all the Mischief He can against the general 
Government. It is supposed the next Legislature of Virginia will 
change their Mode of Election, from District to the State at large, 
for the Purpose no Doubt of defeating Genl. Marshall, who has 
declared Himself a Candidate at the next Election. 

I send You the President's Speech, which I hear the Antis 
affect to approve of ; if Sincere, our Session must be harmonious. 

Genls Washington, Hamilton & Pinckney have been some 
Time, in Fixing upon proper Characters as Officers to our Army, 
which I understand has been a most difficult Business ; it is now 
nearly accomplished. 

I presume You have heard that our Friend Sedgwick has given 
the strongest Evidence of true Patriotism, in having declined be- 
ing chosen a Senator, & agreed to oppose Jacobin Skinner who 
now represents his District, in which He has been successful. — 
S. has not yet come on. 

I am sorry to inform You that I was defeated at the last Elec- 
tion by Mr. Joshua Seney, who died shortly afterwards, occasioned 
by the Fatigue He must have undergone. A new Writ was imme- 
diately issued by our Executive to fill that vacancy, which I 
conceived they did without Authority. I did not again come 
forward — Mr. J. Nicholson an Anti was elected by a Majority 
of only 74 agt. a Mr. Goldsborough a good Fcederalist. 

Yours sincerely 

Wm. Hindman. 

Wm. Bingham to R. King. 

Philada., Decern. 8th, 1798. 

Dear Sir : 

I entirely agree with you in the Danger that may arise from the 
Emigration of so many Irish Insurgents to this Country, amongst 
whom it appears there are many professional Characters, who 
will be able to make an Impression on Society much greater than 
the common Class of disaffected Irish. They will join the party 
in opposition to the Government, & will vent their Resentments 

VOL. II. — 31 



482 RUFUS KING. [1798 

against Great Britain, by attacking those who are disposed to be 
on friendly Terms with her. They will be discontented, & there- 
fore disorganizing Characters, whose Residence amongst us can- 
not be otherwise than injurious, in the present Moment of political 
agitation. 

Your Idea of the Views of the Directory, to divide the People 
& by such Means endanger our Government, are perfectly cor- 
rect, & it has therefore been the unceasing Effort of its friends, by 
strong energetic Language to rouse the Pride & awaken the Spirit 
of the People, as well as to impress upon them a Sense of their 
Danger. 

Their Measures have been attended with Success as you will 
observe by the Returns of the late Elections — three-fourths of the 
aggregate Representation of the three Southern States will be 
federal — a great change will probably take place in Virginia : 
Pennsylvania & New York have been very unfortunate, by de- 
luding the People with the most glaring Falsehoods & Misrepre- 
sentations, but, on the whole, there will be a large Majority in 
favor of dignified Measures. 

There will not be much essential Business done this Session. 
The Government will carry into more compleat Effect the Powers 
that have been entrusted to it, by an extension of the Naval & 
military Establishment, so as to be better prepared for War, or 
insure a more energetic, negotiation for Peace. 

Much Clamor has been made about the Alien & Sedition Bill, 
& a vigorous Attack, in the Course of the Session, supported by 
all the Virginia Faction, will be made on it, in order to alarm the 
public Mind, & prepare the way for their Success, in the ensuing 
Election, in April next. 

You will long since have known that General Maitland has 
withdrawn the British Forces from St. Domingo & left it in 
Possession of the Island Troops. Recent Accounts from that 
Quarter confidently assert that the black General Toussaint is 
about declaring the Island independent. 

Whatever may be the Tendency of this bold measure, with 
respect to the Negro Property in the British Colonies, it cannot 
but result favorably for this Country, by the immense Supplies it 
will be required to furnish. The Eastern States will more par- 
ticularly benefit therefrom. It is possible, that instead of the 



1 7 98 J LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 483 

Habits of Industry, to enable them to pay for the Articles they 
consume, they may have recourse to a System of Buccaneering ; 
but there is little Probability of such an Arrangement. 

Volney's Conduct is infamous. You will see by the Kentucky 
Resolves, that he might have spoken the Language of that 
Country ; but probably of no other Part of the United States. 

Yours &c. 

Wm. Bingham. 



R. King to J. McHenry. 

London, Dec. 8, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

By the Ship Connecticut that will sail soon for Philadelphia, 

I shall send you a Box of Indian Medals, which will compleat 

the series ; by another conveyance, the first good one that offers, 

I will send you the Dies, which I have ordered to be retouched. 

The Map of So. America, of which I have spoken to you, will be 

published in three or four weeks ; when it is out I will send you 

a Copy, as it will be at least amusing to see something correct 

and authentic respecting this Terra incognita. I have been at 

great pains to collect the best maps of every Country, and have 

reason to think that my Collection is nearly as perfect as it can 

be made. It has occurred to me that your office should possess 

a like collection. I cannot at present tell you what it will cost, 

but if you desire one to be made, I will employ the same Person 

who has done so well for me. 

Very sincerely yr. ob. St. 

Rufus King. 



R. King to Henry Dundas. 

Copy. 

Great Cumberland Place, Dec. 8, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

I am much obliged to you for the copy of the Convention con- 
cluded by Genl. Maitland with Toussaint. I have examined it 
with care and think I perceive that it will be productive of great 
mischief to the American Trade. France captures the ships of 
America with as little ceremony as tho' open war existed between 



484 RUFUS KING. [1798 

the two Nations, and St. Domingo is a Portion of her Dominions 
from whence our Commerce has been much harassed by her 
Cruizers. For the purpose of crippling her Privateers and in 
order to diminish her means of annoying us, we have prohibited 
all commercial Intercourse between our Territories and those of 
France, and refused to her the Supplies of various kinds which 
she has been accustomed to receive from us. 

If the Fifth Article of this Convention is carry'd into execu- 
tion, that Portion of St. Domingo which is under the dominion 
of Toussaint (including the Cape of St. Nicholas and Port-au- 
Prince) will be supplied under the protection of England with 
Provisions and other Articles, and thus nourished will be en- 
couraged and enabled to increase and pursue the Depredations 
on our Trade. 

This I am persuaded is entirely contrary to the views and in- 
tentions of the British Government, but such, in my apprehension, 
will be the effect of a ratification and execution of the Convention 
as it stands. 

As the Convention was concluded without authority, it is free 
to the British Government to accept or reject it in toto, or to pro- 
pose such additional articles as will make it as little injurious as 
possible to their friends. 

If it shall not be deemed expedient to reject it altogether, is it 
not due to the amity and good understanding between the United 
States and Great Britain, that it should be amended by the addi- 
tion of an article by which it shall be declared that no Privateer 
shall be fitted out or permitted to sail from any of the Ports under 
the dominion of Toussaint to cruise against the Vessels or Trade 
of the United States, and that no American Prize shall be re- 
ceived or sold in any such Port. 

If such an article should, as I flatter myself it will, appear to 
you to be both just and expedient, Col. Grant may be instructed 
to make its addition and observance an indispensable condition 
of the Ratification and Execution of the Convention. 

In the present interruption of our Trade in consequence of the 
Prohibition of our Ships to resort to the Ports of France, I am 
aware that Jealousies may be felt among our Merchants from 
the exclusive Commerce secured to Great Britain under this Con- 
vention ; and perhaps it might have been wished that under a 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 485 

Truce with this Portion of the French Territories, a trade to it 
should likewise have been opened to every Nation not at war 
with Great Britain. 

This however is a subject of inferior consideration to the Prin- 
cipal object of this Letter. 

With perfect Consideration & Respect &c. &c. 

Rufus King. 



H. Dundas to R. King. 

Copy. 

Downing Street, gth Dec, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

I have to acknowledge the receipt of your Letter of yesterday 
respecting the agreement entered into between Genl. Maitland & 
Genl. Toussaint L'Ouverture at St. Domingo. 

This agreement as you are already informed was not entered 
into in consequence of any Instructions or under any authority 
Genl. Maitland received from this Country. The powers and 
directions given him from hence being exclusively confined to 
objects connected with our military situation in that Island ; but 
the General upon a full consideration of that situation, having 
found it necessary to withdraw His Majesty's troops, and a sus- 
pension of hostilities having been proposed and entered into with 
the Enemy during the evacuation, the agreement in question ap- 
pears principally to have arisen out of this armistice, and at the 
same time to have been in some degree connected with an expec- 
tation that the French General would be thereby induced to 
suffer the Inhabitants and natives who had taken an active part 
in favor of this country to remain in the Island without any 
molestation to their persons or Property, in consequence of their 
former conduct. The favorable report I have received of Genl. 
Toussaint's behaviour in this respect, and the hope I entertain 
that our giving effect to the agreement would become an addi- 
tional encouragement to him to persevere in the same humane 
system, are the grounds on which I have recommended to His 
Majesty to send Col. Grant to St Domingo for this purpose. 

Having stated to you the motives which appear to have actu- 
ated Genl. Maitland in forming this engagement and those which 



486 KUFUS KING. [i798 

have suggested to me the propriety of giving it effect, I have no 
hesitation to admit that as Genl. Maitland acceded to the same 
without any powers whatever from this Country so to do, Genl. 
Toussaint can have no right to complain of its ratification being 
made conditional to his binding himself not to suffer any Privateer 
to be fitted out, or to sail from any Ports under his Dominion to 
cruise against the vessels or trade of the United States, nor any 
American Prize to be received or sold in any such Ports ; and I 
shall not fail to direct Col. Grant to propose an additional Article 
to this Effect, and to inform Genl. Toussaint that unless it shall 
be accepted and strictly observed, he must not expect that the 
Convention can be ratified or executed by this Country. 

As I cannot doubt the favorable light in which you view every 
measure that tends to maintain and improve the political and 
commercial relations existing between this Country and the 
United States, I derive a great satisfaction from this opportunity 
of convincing you how anxiously I feel, in common with every 
Department of His Majesty's Government, to pay all possible at- 
tention to every suggestion which coincides with your wishes and 
the friendly footing in which England and America now stand 
with respect to each other. 

I have the honor to be &c, &c, 

Henry Dundas. 



R. King to Genl. Pinckney. 

London, Dec. 10, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

I have very great pleasure in congratulating you on your safe 
arrival ; it will be a further satisfaction to hear that the voyage 
did not prove injurious to your daughter's health. We are, as 
you will naturally suppose, extremely anxious to receive news from 
Philadelphia, subsequent to the meeting of Congress, and the more 
so since we have been made acquainted with the issue of the late 
Elections in some of the middle States. 

I have hoped that we should acquire greater union among our- 
selves and more confidence in our Government by the experience 
of the few last years : but if the same firm and persevering oppo- 
position in the H. of R. is to continue, the Govt, must be degraded 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 487 



and embarrassed ; and we amuse ourselves in believing that ulti- 
mately France will not succeed in her detestable projects. 

No one has felt more keenly than you the disgust and indigna- 
tion excited by the frequency as well as the manner in which our 
divisions and attachments are spoken of abroad. I have often 
wished that some of the real Americans, who profess an ardent 
devotion to their Country and still oppose its Government, could 
come abroad and there experience the same Humiliation ; if they 
are men of integrity, it would cure them of their dangerous folly. 

The U. S. from situation, strength and knowledge, as well as 
on account of the freedom of their Government, and the vigour 
and enterprize of their People, have the Right as well as the Power 
to take the lead in whatever may affect or concern the new world : 
without boasting, we may truly say that we can resolve on no 
measure relative to our Continent, that we are not able to exe- 
cute : and I therefore hope we shall never form a connexion with 
any nation, in which America is not the main object and the U. 
S. the principal and leading agent. If we resolve to respect our- 
selves, we shall soon receive better treatment and more respect 
from others. No one can predict the return of Peace to Europe ; 
there are no symptoms even, which encourage the Hope that this 
desirable Event is likely soon to arrive. 

This then is the favorable moment, when we should assume the 
attitude that belongs to us, and hasten those Plans, the execution 
of which ought not in Prudence to be longer deferred. 
With sincere attachment & Esteem &c &c 

Rufus King. 

P. S. I can't express the satisfaction with which I have heard 
of the definite settlement of a question in wh. you and some other 
of my friends were concerned. 



R. King to Secretary of State. No. 12. 

London, Dec. 11, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

The detention of the Packet gives me an opportunity of send- 
ing you copies of my Letter to Mr. Dundas and of his answer. 
I have no doubt that the Convention with Toussaint grew out of 



488 RUFUS KING. [i798 

the Difficulties of Genl. Maitland's military situation. He found 
it impossible to defend himself and was embarrassed with three 
or four thousand Colonial troops, principally blacks, whom he 
dared not carry to Jamaica, and was without shipping to send to 
Europe. He asked Toussaint to receive and protect them, which 
was agreed to on condition that Provisons should be sent to sub- 
sist them. Hence the stipulations on this Head. 

Col. Grant will soon embark for St. Domingo. I understand 
that the Government intend to put the Business into the hands 
and under the control of some one person ; it has been offered 
to a considerable Jamaica merchant who has refused it ; indeed 
the Jamaica proprietors are much alarmed by the transaction. If 
Toussaint supports his Power and is not ensnared by Hadonville, 
it is not improbable that St. Domingo will entirely throw off the 
Dominion of France. 

We are perplexed with the same uncertainty with respect to 
the recommencement of the war. According to the last mail from 
Ireland, there will be great opposition to the projected union. 

With perfect Respect and Esteem, 

Rufus King.

John Jay to R. King. 

Albany, 12 Dec, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . The Treaty between Austria and Naples countenanced 
the probability of a war between them and France ; and subse- 
quent Events do not encrease the prospect of a general peace. 
It appears that the Invasion of Egypt followed by Nelson's vic- 
tory, has produced a Declaration of War by the Turks agst France. 
If it be true that Oglow has not only been pardoned but pro- 
moted, the affairs of the Turkish Empire must be in sad state ; — 
Russian anxieties are dangerous Remedies for imbecilities at 
Home. I suspect the Turk has much to fear. 

The Directory and Buonaparte have gotten rid of each other, 
and they both must know and think of it. I presume therefore 
that Buonaparte when deciding on his present Expedition did 
not calculate with certainty on aid from them, and consequently 

4S9 



490 KUFUS KING. [l798 

that his Expectation of Success must rest on other Circumstances. 
What may be his object or his Fate cannot be known or foreseen 
as yet — possibly and I think not improbably, important conse- 
quences will be the Result — one has already taken place — I mean 
the bringing the Turks into the War. 

Britain makes a distinguished figure, and the United States 
have by their late measures compensated in some Degree for their 
preceeding Errors — French Influence continues very active and 
will not be entirely expelled — their Agents and partizans are less 
loud and insolent, but not less industrious and unprincipled — 
much will depend on the present Session of Congress, and on this 
head I am not free from apprehensions. 

Yours sincerely, 

John Jay. 



G. Cabot to R. King. 



Dec. 12, 1798. 



My dear Sir : 

. . . I had some considerable conversation with Mr. Liston 
when he was here & he was so polite as to express his desire for 
more. I labored much to impress him with the ideas which you 
know I entertain on the subject of those great common interests 
which ought steadily to guide the two nations in their conduct 
toward each other, & I insisted much, as I have always done 
with sensible Englishmen, that from the nature of our Govt, it 
was the peculiar duty of theirs to avoid every act, as much as pos- 
sible, which might keep alive the animosity against them which 
France or Faction had enkindled among our people &c. &c. &c. 
I found he had well considered the subject & needed no sugges- 
tions of mine, but I cou'd not help thinking you had done some- 
thing toward producing sentiments which appear to me extremely 
important as they are certainly just. I was the more ready to 
attribute to you some merit because in the course of conversation 
he repeatedly gave you great praise & expressed a warm wish 
that you might continue where you are for a long time to come. 
I cou'd not refrain from reflecting upon the inferences which our 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 49 1 

Democrats wou'd draw from hearing your Eulogy pronounced 
by a British Minister, but for myself I am ready to declare it 
gave me infinite pleasure & that it strengthened the hope I have 
long cherished that two nations so perfectly well adapted to sup- 
port & promote each others interests wou'd not be again the 
Dupes of the Enemy of either. 

I suppose the great city you inhabit has been intoxicated with 
joy at the unparalleled victory of Nelson : by this time the world 
must see that England is not degenerated as France wou'd pre- 
tend, but is able of herself to resist all the physical force of 
Europe on the Sea. I hope too it is admitted that England can 
sustain the war for an indefinite period without impoverishment 
— indeed it has appeared to me evident that G. B., the U. S. & 
Russia cou'd triumph over all the powers & that the two former 
might even be enriched by the war. What shall hinder G. B. from 
deriving directly or indirectly immense commercial benefit from 
the Colonies & even the Countries of her Enemies ? her manufac- 
tures will find their consumers among the deluded Followers of 
French Equality who can no longer manufacture for themselves 
because their Stock has disappeared as soon as it was insecure. 
The Gold plundered from the Treasury of Berne will finally pay 
English Clothiers for the coats which the Plunderers wore. From 
various causes the trade of the East Indies will be continually 
supplanting that of the West & it is not to be doubted that a 
Nation which covers the Sea with its victorious Fleets will enjoy 
the largest portion of that distant Commerce. I think the Eng- 
lish have only to be true to themselves (Govt. & People) & they 
may defy France with all the Devils they can conjure up. 

The English have great dread & their Enemies great hopes of 
Buonaparte's success in an Enterprise against India : it is a dan- 
ger not wholly to be despised, & yet it is 10 to 1 he never arrives 
there with any great force & he wou'd finally fail of establishing 
himself there if he shou'd arrive — the command of the Sea is in- 
dispensable to the permanent security of whatever might be 
acquired in Countries so distant. 

Your's fideliter, 

G. C.

Suppose Virginia, Kentucky & Tennessee should return all 
Jacobins, there will notwithstanding be a Majority of ten, in 
Favor of Government & the Administration, a most comforting 
Circumstance, by which We shall be enabled to bid Defiance to 
all the Machinations & Deviltry of the Directory ; who I hope 
will be a Non-Entity before this reaches You, — as their Reign 
has been long enough — & God knows whether Mankind will be 
bettered by the Change. 

Mr. Jefferson, the Fountain of Mischief in this Country, has 
not yet arrived here, to discharge his constitutional Duty ; but 
remains, it is said, for the purpose of attending the Legislature of 
Virginia, to aid Taylor, Giles & Junto in plotting some dia-

bolical Plan against the Foederal Government ; one great Object 
is to Change the Foederal Elections from Districts to the State at 
large, dreading the Abilities & Power of Genl. Marshall, who I 
flatter Myself will at every Event be elected a Member of the H.

T. Pickering to R. King. 

Department of State, December 14, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . Incredible pains have been taken to misrepresent the 
laws passed at the last Sessions, called the Alien and Sedition 
Laws ; but no extensive effect has been produced, except in Vir- 
ginia and Kentucky. In the former addresses to the Legislature 
have been prepared and signed, calling for its interposition to 
obtain the repeal of those laws. In Kentucky the Governor has 
made to the General Assembly a very impudent and inflammatory 
speech on the subject of those Laws. Possessing a high respect 
for the federal Constitution, and determination to maintain it, the 
idea is held out of the right of an individual State to judge and 
determine whether the Acts of the federal Legislature conform to 
it ; and a pretty clear implication of a right to disobey them, if 
any motives induce a declaration of their being unconstitutional. 
This Governor (Gerrard) I suppose to be a new, not a native 
Citizen. I have been told that he was a Baptist Preacher, and his 
secretary a new comer of Dr. Priestley's sect. The leaders in 
Kentucky have been endeavouring to draw the State of Tennessee 
into their schemes, but in vain ; and the people North of the Ohio 
remain uncontaminated. I have just received a letter from 
Kentucky, by which it is plain their opposition is not by any 
means as universal as their public resolves import ; and this 
opposition is there, as in other districts of the United States, the 
result of misrepresentations and falsehoods. . . .

London, Deer. 15, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

The Imperial Internuncio at Constantinople on the 17th of 
November dispatched a Messenger to Vienna with the information 
that courier after courier had arrived that day by different routes 
with intelligence that on the news of the preparation of Murad Bey 
and Ibraham Bey to march against the French armies in Egypt, 
Buonaparte had convened his chief officers with the principal 
Inhabitants of Egypt in the great Hall of Cairo, when after stating 
the approach of the Beys, he enlarged upon the necessity of imme- 
diate measures to repel them, and concluded by proposing a gen- 
eral contribution to enable him to oppose the Enemy ; that this 
Discourse was ill-received by the Egyptians, and that a Tripoline 
chief drew from under his garment a Pistol and shot Buonaparte, 
whose death was the signal for the massacre of the other French 
officers as well as all the unarmed French found in the city. 

Baron Thugut communicated this intelligence to Sir Morton 
Eden, the British Ambassador at Vienna, who on the 3d inst. 
dispatched an extraordinary messenger that arrived here yesterday. 

It is difficult to form a satisfactory opinion concerning the accu- 
racy of this news. The Turks have strong imaginations as well as 
great credulity. I find that it receives credit in Downing Street. 
The same messenger brings a Report that the Pacha of Rhodes, who 
is said to have embarked with a Body of Troops in the Squadron 
of Russian and Turkish ships gone against Alexandria, has made 
good his Landing and retaken that Port from the French. 
With perfect Respect & Esteem &c. &c.

R. King to A. Hamilton.* 

London, Dec. 19th, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

The same uncertainty continues to perplex us concerning the 
recommencement of the war. One day we are told that Naples 
has really begun, and that Austria is on the way to support her ; 
the next, that Naples is kept back, by Austria, to whom the Direc- 
tory have made the most advantageous offers. It is certain that 

* Works of Ifa??iilton, vi., 376. 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 495 

France feels the change that has, within the last six months, taken 
place in Europe, and is extremely anxious to defeat the projected 
coalition. Prussia observes, and seems inclined to adhere to the 
same cautious policy that for some time has governed her admin- 
istration. Poor Spain is completely under the influence of the 
Directory, and, however strange it may seem, the King, who most 
cordially hates England, shed tears and was inconsolable on the 
news of Nelson's victory. Portugal is threatened with a war with 
Spain, unless she concludes a peace on the terms of the Directory. 
There is great discontent in many of the French departments, but 
still the levy of the new requisition proceeds. The insurrection 
of Brabant extends itself ; but though it will give the Directory 
some trouble, cannot prove successful unless the war soon recom- 
mences. Mr. Grenville, an elder brother of the Minister, has gone 
on a special mission to Berlin. He is said to be very clever, and 
has therefore refused to go into the diplomatic course. Unless 
favorable circumstances of success exist, one would scarcely be- 
lieve that the Minister would just now have employed his brother. 
The French will lose all their islands, trade and influence in the 
Mediterranean. Minorca has been taken by the English. Malta 
must fall. Corsica will probably expel the French, though England 
will not again accept of their capricious allegiance. Zante, Cerego, 
and Cephalonia, and probably Corfu, have fallen into the hands 
of the Turks and Russians. 

A report from Constantinople states that Buonaparte has been 
assassinated ; though probable, it wants confirmation. Mr. Pitt 
will be supported in the tax of 10 per cent, on the income of the 
nation ; indeed, the people appear firm and resolved to support 
the government, and the prosperity of their manufactures and 
trade enable them to do so. Adieu. 

Yours truly, &c. 

P. S. — I make you my hearty congratulations on the settlement 
of the question of rank.

London, Dec. 21, 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

On the 7th instant France declared war against the King of 
Naples and Sardinia. The Neapolitan troops, headed by their 
King, had before entered the Roman Territory, alleging that it 



4g6 rufus king. [1798 

had been revolutionized subsequent to Campo Formio, and not 
acknowledged as a Republic either by the Court of Naples or its 
ally, the Emperor. 

The King of Sardinia has for many months been a Prisoner in 
his own capital, enjoying a mock liberty of service only to his 
Gaolers. He cannot be degraded lower, and the causeless attack 
upon him is one more proof that safety cannot be found in sub- 
mission, and that no degree of Humiliation can satisfy this im- 
moral and tyrannical Power. 

It is not natural to suppose that Naples would have taken this 
decisive step without being confident of support from the Em- 
peror, and this presumption is strengthened by the known charac- 
ter of the Austrian General Mack, who under the king commands 
the Neapolitan army. Our next dispatches from Vienna are 
therefore expected with anxiety & impatience. There is little 
doubt that Corfu has surrendered, and information was yesterday 
received of the surrender of Malta with the Ships in that Harbour, 
which escaped from the battle of the Nile. Minorca is undoubt- 
edly in the hands of the English, and was taken, as we hear, with- 
out resistance. By the capture of Corfu and Malta, the two ships 
of the line and the two frigates which escaped from Aboukir, have 
fallen into the hands of the allies, so that the whole of the Toulon 
Fleet attacked by Admiral Nelson is taken or destroy'd. 

We have no further accounts relative to the Death of Buona- 
parte or concerning his Army. 

With Perfect Respect & Esteem &c. &c. 

Rufus King.

Dear Sir : 

A single Paris paper of the 19th instant brought by a Packet 
Boat from Gravelines was received in town this morning, and 
states that a large body of Neapolitan troops were beaten on the 
4th by a column of French troops commanded by Genl. Macdon- 
ald. From the scenes where this action took place, it may be in- 
ferred that Rome was in the hands of the Neapolitans. Piedmont 



1798] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 497 

had been entirely overrun by the French. Admiral Nelson had 
taken possession of Leghorn & with his fleet blockaded the 
Ligurian ports. Not a word is said concerning the Austrian army 
in Italy and we are left quite at a loss whether it has or will ad- 
vance to support the Neapolitans. If Naples gave the attack 
without being confident of this support, her conduct has been less 
prudent than perilous ; as without it Naples as well as the whole 
of Italy must quickly fall under the power of the French. 

The same Paper asserts that information was just received by 
the Telegraph that the Deputation of the Empire had just ac- 
ceded to the French ultimatum, and that peace with the Empire 
was concluded. If this is true there is much reason to apprehend 
that the Emperor has resolved not to engage in the war. Loose 
and inaccurate as this information is, I think it my duty to send 

it to you.

R. King to the Duke of Portland. 

Great Cumberland Place, Dec. 26, 1798. 
My Lord : 

The Treaty of Peace between the United States and Great 
Britain forbids any further confiscation of Estates. 

The late Treaty of Amity and Commerce provides that citizens 
of the United States holding real Estates within the Territories of 
Great Britain and the Subjects of Great Britain holding real 
Estates within the Territories of the United States shall continue 
to hold them, and that the same shall descend to their Heirs, 
provided they are not sold during the lifetime of the Proprietors, 
which may freely be done. 

According to the inclosed Report of the Judges in His 
Majesty's Colony of Newfoundland, the Estate therein described 
belonging to Abigail Lillie, a Citizen of the United States, was 
not confiscated during the American War, but was held and en- 
joy'd by her during that period and for several years afterwards ; 
but in the year 1788 was taken from her by order of the Governor 
because she had become an alien. This plain statement of the 

VOL. II.— 32 



498 RUFUS KING. [i799 



Case, will, I am confident, satisfy your Grace that this Proceeding 
has been altogether erroneous and contrary to the existing stipu- 
lations relative to this subject between the United States and 
Great Britain. 

Extensive real Estates within the United States which belonged 
to British subjects before the American War continue to be held 
by their original holders or their Heirs, and these Estates are 
secured from Escheat by the Provisions of the Ninth Article of 
our late Treaty above cited. 

I will not give your Grace the trouble of any further observa- 
tions on this subject, and will only request that Instructions may 
be given for the Restoration of the Estate in question and for the 
loss sustained by the dispossession of the lawful owner. 

With the most perfect Consideration and Respect &c. &c. 

Rufus King.

London, Jany. 3, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

The Elbe being closed by the late severe frost, no Packets have 
arrived from Hamburgh within the last three weeks, so that at 
this critical and interesting moment in respect to the affairs of the 
Continent, we are without information except such as is collected 
from the Paris papers, which are irregularly received from Grave- 
lines. Mr. Grenville who embarked in a Frigate about a fort- 
night since for Hamburgh on his mission to Berlin has returned, 
not being able to land. 

The Newspapers which I send by this conveyance detail the 
intelligence contained in the late French papers. Hadonville has 
returned to France from St. Domingo, and in his last Proclama- 
tion intimates that Toussaint and his advisers meditate the Inde- 
pendence of that Island. Subsequent to Hadonville's return an 
Advice Boat arrived at L'Orient with an Aide de Camp & Dis- 
patches from Toussaint. 

The Bill calling for a Tenth of every man's Income in addition 
to the old Taxes last night passed the House of Commons. This 
measure has received a very general and zealous support, and is 



1799] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 499 

a high proof of the Firmness and Capacity of the Nation in sup- 
port of the war. 

With perfect Respect and Esteem &c. &c.

R. King to the Secretary of State. No. 17. 

London, Jany. 10, 1799- 
Dear Sir : 

The situation of St. Domingo* having on repeated consideration 
appeared to me to be likely materially to affect certain great in- 
terests of the U. S. and consequently to require of them a compre- 
hensive as well as cautious Policy to protect those interests and 
to turn to profit if possible the changes of which the Indepe?idence 
of Saint Domingo is the forerunner, / went some days since to 
Lord Grenville, and after stating to him my reflections upon this 
subject, observed that the principle motive that led me to submit 
them to him was in order to ascertain his opinion whether it would 
not be of great and mutual benefit that we should act in concert as 
well in respect to the present as the expected condition of this Im- 
portant Island. He could best decide the advantages and disad- 
vantages which they were likely to expect from the emancipation of 
that Colony. With regard to us we had to apprehend some incon- 
veniences from the Influence of the example upon our slaves in the 
Southern States, and it would be incumbent upon us to pursue such 
measures as should promise security against, and, if practicable, 
effectually prevent the depredations and Piracy to be apprehended 
should St. Domingo become the Resort and Asylum of Buccaneers 6° 
rovers. We had never attempted to foment insurrections among 
our neighbours, nor to persuade the Colonies near us to throw off 
their allegiance ; but we should neglect what we owe to ourselves, if 
in the present case and in others which may be like it, we did not 
adopt such measures as should seem best calculated not only to 
render them harmless, but as far as possible to make them beneficial 
to us. What those measures would be, it was not possible for me 
to form an opinion ; but that they and we should take care not to 
embarrass each other, and so disappoint the views of both, appeared 
to me very plain. 

* Italics in cipher. 



500 RUFUS KING. [i799 

Ld. Grenville said that it seemed highly probable that St. Do- 
mingo would become independent, and that he entirely agreed in the 
opinion I had expressed in reference to the Policy and advantage 
of a concert of measures betwem them and us. At present they had 
not formed any distinct views on that head ; the late engagements 
of himself and colleagues in Parliament had delayed the Business, 
but they were then engaged in the consideration of the subject which 
in a variety of lights they considered an important one ; that Col. 
Grant had not yet gone out, and would be detained until they had come 
to some further determinations upon the subject of his Mission. 

That they desired to secure their colonies from the influence of 
the example of St. Domingo and to prev at the existence of a new 
Barbary power in that quarter of the world. They moreover had it 
in view to propose to Toussaint to put the Trade upon such a foot- 
ing as might afford to him the supplies that he should require, and 
at the same time guard against the mischiefs that they and we 
desire to prevent : that he had thought of an exclusive company com- 
posed jointly of British and American subjects j that the Idea had 
not been examined, and that as soon as he had more fully consid- 
ered the subject, he would invite me to meet him and his Colleagues 
for the purpose of considering it. 

The foregoing is the outline and substance of our first consul- 
tation, in the course of which other things were said, not however 
of sufficient importance to be repeated. The following queries 
and their answers are exceptions to this remark. I asked Ld. Gren- 
ville if the lndepende?ice of St. Domingo must not inevitably have a 
great influence upon Jamaica and the other Islands? he answered 
that certainly it must j must it not be soon followed, notwithstand- 
ing all your vigilance, by the abolition of the whole Colony System in 
that quarter of the world? the Colony System must fall to the ground, 
we have foreseen it, and nothing remains but to postpone it as 
long as possible and to employ such measures as seem best 
adapted to diminish the Evils of the event when it arrives, and I 
have no reserve, added his Ld.Ship, in saying that in whatever we 
do, we must act in Harmony with you. 

Last evening I received a letter from Lord Grenville, a copy of 
which and of the enclosed Minute are annexed, and according to 
his Ld.Ship 's invitation I met him and his Colleagues this morning. 
The Conference began by my saying that before / made any obser- 



1799] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 50 1 

vation upon our present equivocal situation in regard to France, or 
upon the division of the Trade between us and them, as proposed, 
I ought to express my belief that the Plan would be objected to 
as well on account of the general unpopularity of monopolies in 
America, as on the score of a defect of power in Congress to create 
an Exclusive Corporation for the Purposes of Trade. Such a 
Power is not expressly given, and if it exists must be taken by in- 
ference from Powers which are distinctly given. Questions of this 
sort are liable to much debate, and in this case would perhaps be 
opposed by some who might think the Power exists, but who dis- 
like monopolies. Besides our merchants are numerous and full of 
enterprize, and no way has suggested itself by which a limited 
number of them could without undue preference be selected to 
compose a company. In respect to the proposed Division of the 
trade between us and them, I said, that the distinction in the supplies 
seemed plain and natural enough, but there were articles supply d 
to St Domingo not of their manufacture nor of our production, such 
as Wines, Brandies, nankeens & probably other commodities that 
did not occur, in respect to which it might be agreed that such 
articles might be supplied by either. In regard to our situation with 
France it is easier to say what it is not, than what it really is, & 
I could only express my hope that it might soon become less 
doubtful & better denned. 

Mr. Pitt observed that it would be presumptuous in a stranger 
to give an opinion on the Powers given to Congress by our Constitu- 
tion, wh. possibly were not as large as we ?night find to our advan- 
tage that they should be, but the present case was of great strength, 
and the mischiefs with which ive were menaced were such that it 
wd. be singular indeed, if an adequate Power did not exist to 
guard against them. Our Southern States were open to Emissaries 
of St. Domingo, and perhaps all things considered it was not 
stating it too widely to say that we had as much or more to appre- 
hend than they had fro??i St. Domingo becoming the Resort and 
Refuge of Buccaneers &> Pirates. If the proposed project affords a 
fair probability of preventing those Evils, it would be unfortunate 
that it should fail from a defect of Power in Congress : and per- 
haps we should think it expedient in that case to refer the Plan to 
the respective States for their co?ifirmatio?i. In respect to the 
articles ?iot of growth or manufacture of either, it will, said Mr. 



502 RUFUS KING. [l799 

Pitt, be best to divide the supply between us in some equitable and 
convenient manner, betraying to my apprehension, a fear of an 
open competition. 

Ld. Grenville after making several observations explanatory of 
the minute he had sent me, asked what other plan could be devised 
that would be likely to avoid the objections which I had suggested 
and which would secure the principal objects in view. 

I reply'd that if it should turn out Congress had not the Power, 
or were unwilling to erect an exclusive Commercial Company, the 
Power, to form Treaties and to regulate Trade with foreign nations, 
were expressly given, and under them in the shape of Treaties and 
Laws, we could establish such regulations as our Interest and 
Safety, & those of our friends should require j going upon the idea 
of the entire Independence of St. Domingo, we and they might form 
Treaties with Toussaint, by which it should be agreed that the 
citizens of the U7iited States a?id the subjects of G. Britain alone 
should trade to that Island. These Treaties might contain such 
special stipulations relative to the particular Ports of Trade — the 
coasting Vessels to be employ'd between these Ports — the supplies 
which should or should not be carried there — emigrations — the 
suppression of Privateers, and all such other points as may sug- 
gest themselves upon a full consideration of the Question. 

A Convention might likewise be made between the United States 
and G. Britain that should prescribe the regulatio?is to be observed 
by Each in carrying on the trade which should be open to all the 
subjects of the two Countries. This Convention to be valid when 
Laws conforming and providing for the execution of its stipulations 
sho'd be enacted by the Legislatures of both nations — these regula- 
tions might be as minute and extensive as the various objects to be 
attained shou'd require. 

Lord Grenville made several objections to this Plan, grounded 
upon the insecurity there would be in enforcing the observance of 
the requisite regulations when the Trade should be open to all the 
People of the two Countries. Mr. Pitt appeared less decided on 
this Point and agreed as they all did in my observation that concert 
in this business between us and the?n, was on many accounts of the 
first importance j that if the best Plan was inconsistent with con- 
cert, one must be devised that will secure this primary object and as 
many others as possible ; and that the more liberal the terms were 



1799] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 503 

in respect to Toussaint, the more advantageous the connexion would 
be to the Inhabitants of St. Domingo, and the less likely to be de- 
feated by the instigation of Emissaries. I asked what probability 
there was that Toussaint would agree to a Plan that should leave 
him but a limited Independence j Mr. Dundas reply V that taking 
all their information together, he thought it quite probable that 
Toussaint would consent, and with respect to his intentions he had 
told one of their officers lately returned, that he would throw off the 
yoke of France, if he could be supported. 

It was remarked that something must be done immediately. I 
replied that I could see no objection to Col. Grant's going forward 
according to their first intention. He might open the Plan to Tous- 
saint and state the difficulties likely to exist against its adoption 
by the United States — that whatever should be agreed upon be- 
tween Toussaint and G. Britain should be open for the accession 
of the United States, and also open to such modifications as should 
enable the U. S. to become a party in case they decline or are 
unable to agree to the proposed Plan — that full information should 
be given to the President thro' me, as well as by Id. Grenville thro' 
Mr. Liston, with the assurance that G. Britain desires the coopera- 
tion of the U. S., and will agree on such equitable commercial 
stipulations, as shall be compatible with the attainment of the 
pri?icipal objects they have in view in respect to their Colonies. To 
this Id. Gretwille and his Colleagues asse?ited and the Conference 
ended with the suggestion that the President would think it advise- 
able to send some person to join Col. Grant in settling the arrange- 
ments with Toussaint. 

This is a subject that me?'its deliberate and extensive considera- 
tion. Whatever we do, should be done with a view as well to the 
present Colony system, as to future events still more important than 
the present. It is certain that Great Britain desires to act with 
us, and we may be sure of her cooperation if we will concur in her 
Plans. She will even risk something to obtain our concurrence, but 
she will act without us in case we disagree as to the terms of a joint 
cooperation. We also can act without her and should, as she un- 
doubtedly does, balance the advantages & disadvantages of a 
separate and a joint negotiation. 

With perfect Respect & Esteem &c. &c.

Copy (annexed to previous letter). 

Cleveland Row, Jany. 9, 1799. 
My dear Sir : 

In consequence of our last conversation relative to St. Domingo, 
I have, after discussing the subject with some of my Colleagues, 
prepared the enclosed minute, which I send for your considera- 
tion, as the basis of an arrangement which would I think provide 
equitably for the Commercial Interests of our two Countries as con- 
cerned in that business, and what is infinitely more important, wd. 
afford us as good security as the nature of things allows of, 
against the infinite dangers to which our Islands and your Southern 
Provinces would be exposed from an unrestrained intercourse with 
St. Domingo in its present state. 

If you should be at leisure & could meet Mr. Pitt and Mr. Dundas 
here to-morrow morning at Eleven, half an hour's discussion 
might very probably so far terminate the business as to enable us 
to write to Amei'ica and to dispatch Col. Grant. If you had any 
wish to see me earlier, I shall be at home. 

Believe me &c. &c. 

Grenville. 

Minute. 

The whole Trade of Import and Export with Toussainf s part of 
St. Domingo to be confined to one port — viz. Port-au-Prince. The 
supply to be restricted by agreement with Toussaint and by compact 
between G. B. and the U. S. to a Joint Company to be formed by the 
two Governments and to consist of — British and American subjects. 

This Co7iipany to be confined to furnish no manufactures but from 
the British Territories, and no articles of Produce or live stock but 
from America. To send the returns for the former in St. Domingo 
produce to Jamaica or G. Britain only ; and for the latter to the 
United States only. An agent on the part of this Company to reside 
at the specify'd Port, and to have on the part of the Compa?iy the 
exclusive conduct of the whole coasting trade, which he shall carry 
on by Boats of the Country to a sufficient extent for the supply 
of the different parts of the Island under Toussaint 's authority, and 

* Italics in this copy in cipher. 



1799] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 505 

for bringing back their Produce to Port-au-Prince : all British or 
American Vessels not belonging to the Company, and all vessels be- 
longing to France or any other Power or to any person in any part 
of the Island of St. Domingo and trading to or from any of it s 
Ports, coastwise or otherwise, except those employed by the agent 
of this Company as above, and furnished with proper Passports, to be 
liable to seizure, and Toussaint to engage on his part to the ut??wsl of 
his power to discourage and prevent all such trade. 

The exportation of Blacks from St. Domingo to any other place, 
(or of any other persons without previous permission to that effect) 
or the carrying on any intercourse whatever between that Island and 
any other place, except as above, to be prohibited under the severest 
Penalties. 

Both Powers to guarantee this arrangement to each other, and to 
agree that in case of its being violated o?i the part of Toussaint, 
with respect either to G. Britain or America, the whole shall be 
suspended, and neither the subjects of G. B. nor America to be at 
liberty to carry on any trade there from thenceforth j and the present 
prohibition continue as to all the rest of the Island. 



T. Pickering to R. King. No. 37. 

Department of State, Jany. 8, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

I am directed by the President of the United States to transmit 
to you the inclosed narrative of Lewis Tresevant and Wm. Tim- 
mons of an outrage committed on the flag of the United States, 
together with extracts of a letter from George C. Morton, Con- 
sular Agent of the United States at the Havanna.* As soon as 
Captain Phillips arrives and makes his official report to the Navy 
Department, it shall be transmitted to you. In consequence of 
this insult, the President has directed the inclosed order * to be 
issued to all our naval commanders to resist every future attempt 
of the kind to the last extremity. A copy of this order I have 
sent to Mr. Liston with the letter of which also a copy is 
inclosed. 

* As the facts are presented in the accompanying letter to Mr. Liston, and 
the order to the naval commanders is summed up in Mr. Pickering's letter, they 
are omitted here. 



506 RUFUS KING. [l799 

This act of Captain Loring excited, as you may imagine, no 
little sensation. It drew the attention of the House of Repre- 
sentatives, who passed the inclosed resolution, in pursuance of 
which, the narrative above mentioned and extracts of Mr. Mor- 
ton's letter have been communicated to them. 

To the extracts from Mr. Morton's Letter laid before the House, 
I have now added other parts relating to the capture of three 
American vessels bound to the Havanna by Capt. Loring's 
Squadron — the pretence that 4^. & 6d. nails and oznaburgs are 
contraband of war, the latter as sail cloth and the former because 
other than " unwrought iron." It is impossible that these articles 
should have been contemplated as falling within the 18 article of 
our Treaty with Great Britain : the interpretation that would 
comprehend them appears to us a perverse one : yet they have 
been made the occasion of much injury and vexation to our 
Merchants and Mariners, as I formerly wrote you, when com- 
plaining of the iniquitous proceedings of Judge Cambauld at 
Cape Nichola Mole. It is true that Capt. Loring released two 
of the vessels captured, as above mentioned, near the Havanna ; 
but an erroneous construction of the Treaty should not furnish a 
pretence for so serious an injury as the detention and carrying 
into port of the third to gratify his resentment against a sturdy 
Master. If this abuse in the construction of the 18 article of 
the Treaty has not yet attracted the notice of the British Govern- 
ment, or if orders for correcting it have not been issued, the 
President desires that it may be a subject of representation 
together with the insult which is the immediate object of this 
letter. 

With regard to the insult on our flag, it will readily occur that 
the right of searching and stripping public Vessels of War of their 
hands, if it exists at all, must be reciprocal, and it need not be 
asked whether a British Naval Commander would submit to it : 
neither will ours. But if such search for and taking away of sea- 
men were at all admissible in practice, it should be in our favor, 
because American Seamen are generally aboard British Ships only 
by impressments, whereas the British Seamen to be found in the 
armed Vessels of the United States are all Volunteers ; and you 
will recollect that the British Government have made a distinction 
between Volunteer and Impressed Americans, releasing the latter 



I79 8 ] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 507 

when their citizenship was proved ; but detaining the former 
altho' they had entered and taken the bounty only in consequence 
of a previous impressment. 

After these observations, candour demands an acknowledgment 
of the general friendly and polite behaviour of the British Naval 
Officers towards ours, and of their readiness to protect our mer- 
chant vessels against the Plunderers of the World, and to afford 
them relief when in distress. An instance has very lately occurred 
in the Chesapeake. A British Vessel of War seeing an American 
vessel aground on a dangerous shoal, sent down cables, anchors 
and thirty Seamen, who got her off and thus saved a valuable 
ship and cargo, which in the next four and twenty hours would 
have been dashed to pieces and lost. 

You cannot too strongly express the desire of the President to 
maintain a perfect harmony between the two countries and his 
regret at any incident tending to disturb it, and which, while it 
sensibly wounds the real friends to their country, furnishes a 
topic of popular clamour to others whose enmity to their own 
Government is equalled only by their hatred to Great Britain. 

I have the honor to be, &c. 

T. Pickering. 

T. Pickering to Robt. Liston. 

" Department of State, Philadelphia Dec. 31, 1798. 
''Sir : 

"... The principal facts stated are these. Capt. Phillips having 
under his convoy several American vessels bound to the Havanna 
saw, not far from that port, a fleet of three ships of the line and 
two frigates, which, as soon as he discovered them to be British, 
he approached and spoke the Commodore, the above named 
Capt. Loring. This officer told Captain Phillips that he should 
take from him all the seamen who had not protection as citizens 
of the United States. Capt. Phillips remonstrated against it, ob- 
serving among other things, that the public flag of the United 
States was their protection, and that if he carried his declaration 
into effect, the Baltimore would not have men enough for her de- 
fence. His remonstrances were fruitless. Capt. Loring took 
from the Baltimore fifty five of her crew. Afterwards finding 
Capt. Phillips indisposed to comply with some other propositions 



508 XUFUS KING. [1799 

and demands, Capt. Loring thought proper to return fifty of the 
men, retaining five, among whom was the Baltimore's Boatswain. 
It is impossible, Sir, for the American Government to imagine 
that this outrage can be the consequence of any orders from his 
Britannic Majesty, and equally impossible for the United States 
quietly to bear the repetition of insults and injuries of this kind. 
The President of the United States has therefore directed that all 
attempts to commit them be resisted." 



Joseph Hale to R. King. 

Boston, Jany. 14, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

Tho' not insensible of the tax you will be exposed to by this 
& its accompaniments travelling from Liverpool to London, I 
cannot forbear giving you a specimen of the Congressional 
Temper. 

The Kentucky & Virginia resolutions, which will doubtless 
reach you thro' another channel, will prove that there is still 
sufficient scope with us for industry, talents, & patriotism. 

In the New England States the alien & sedition acts make less 
noise than the land tax. Its novelty & immediate application to 
the purse-strings excite soft but general murmurs. Yankee good 
sense will soon silence these & the support of the tax be universal 
in the northern states. 

We are daily increasing our naval preparations. It is said five 
ships of the line are to be built & the proposal in a few days to 
be brought forward in Congress. The ready concurrence of both 
houses said to be unquestionable. With the army now organizing 
we shall shortly assume the aspect of a well regulated govern- 
ment. The sedition act operates as a check upon the disorgan- 
izes, tho' they still indulge themselves too freely in their favourite 
bias. 

Permit me, Sir, to congratulate you on the resignation of the 
Judge of Admiralty. His successor is a man of business. Hav- 
ing been an advocate for the Crown, he will have great merit in 
divesting himself of that character in his judicial decisions. 
Doctor N.'s successor will doubtless do justice to his appointment.

R. King to Secretary of State. No. 18. 

London, Jany. 14, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

The Moniteur contains a Report made by Boullay Paty in the 
Council of 500, on the 21st of Decemr. in the name of a Commit- 
tee to whom a reference from the Tribunal of Cassation had been 
sent on the subject of the Law of the 29. Nivose, which authorises 
the capture of all vessels loaded wholly or in part with articles of 
the growth or fabric of the British Territories. The questions 
referred from the Tribunal of Cassation were whether the Law is 
applicable to all captures made after its publication, or only to 
such as were made in consequence of a knowledge of its publica- 
tion, and whether the terms, articles of the growth or fabric of the 

509 



5IO RUFUS KING. [i799 

British Territories, include Commodities of the growth or fabric 
of Portugal ? The Report is in the usual strain of violence against 
England and of Injustice and Contempt towards the neutral 
Powers, all of whom are treated with great indecorum, tho' I think 
none with so large a portion as the U. S., " whose Commerce," 
says the Reporter, " is serviceable alone to England who directs 
their wavering Politics." The Reporter concluded by proposing 
the two following Resolutions. 

Art. iier. La loi du 29. Nivose, an 6, qui a etendu sur mer 
l'execution de celle du 10. Brumaire, continuera d'etre executee, 
a compter du jour qu'elle a ete rendue. 

Art. 2nd. La loi du 29. Nivose sur les marchandises Anglaises 
est, a compter de ce jour, applicable aux navires charges de mar- 
chandises et productions provenant des Possessions ou des manu- 
factures de toutes les puissances qui seront en guerre avec la Re'pub- 
lique Fran$aise. 

The discussion of these resolutions was adjourned, but judging 
from the support they received when reported they have probably 
been adopted. As a violation of our national right, and a De- 
cree in contempt of Public Law, this will be nothing new, being 
only an extension of the application of a former Decree ; yet it 
is an extension that having regard merely to our interest, will be 
found materially to affect our Trade to Petersburgh, Portugal and 
the Wine Islands. 

The decree in another view will merit attention, inasmuch as it 
will disprove the repeated declarations that have been made, that 
the Laws of France against the Trade of neutrals were a retalia- 
tion upon Great Britain, a punishment upon the neutrals for sub- 
mitting to the injuries received from that Nation. Neither Russia 
nor Portugal have interrupted or vexed the Neutral Commerce. 

Several of our Tobacco and other valuable ships, including one 
bound to China, have been lately captured by French Privateers, 
which suffer nothing to escape them which they can master. 

Genl. Allen who had been sent to the Temple, after several 
weeks' confinement procured his discharge, but was again impris- 
oned at the same time that two other Americans, Mr. Tailor, for- 
merly of Boston, and Mr. Joseph Sands of New York, were sent 
to the Temple. From Mr. Fosdick, who lately arrived here from 
Paris, I hear that the situation of our citizens there is unquiet and 



S799] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 511 

in every respect, disagreeable. Mr. Fosdick went to Paris with 
his uncle, Col. Hitchborn, who, as he states, on being lately sent 
for by Talleyrand, and asked whether the President wd. send 
another Envoy to Paris, told him that he certainly would not. 
With perfect Respect and Esteem &c. &c.

London, Jany. 16, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

I went this morning to Ld. Grenville to* state to him what I had 
written as the substance of our late Conferences respecting St. 
Domingo, especially on the point of their agreement with Toussaint 
being left open to such modifications as should enable us to accede 
to it. I found that I had faithfully reported to you what had 
passed, and that upon further consideration of the subject, of the 
difficulties that might attend the execution of their project & the 
danger to be apprehended from delay, they have concluded imme- 
diately to send Col. Maitland to New York with full power to Mr. 
Liston, assisted by Col. Maitland, who made the Convention with 
Toussaint, to settle the business between us and them 6° then to pro- 
ceed immediately to St. Domingo in order to conclude it there. I did 
not omit to express my satisfaction with this determination, and 
added what I afterwards repeated to Mr. Dundas that as Col, 
Maitland was well acquainted with the whole subject, a circum- 
stance that would be of great importance to Mr. Liston, it was 
very much to be desired that every point should be left open to such 
practicable and safe arrangements as should be devised at Phila- 
delphia, instead of particular plans being sent there, which with the 
best disposition on our part might be found impracticable, and 
might moreover have an unfavorable influence upon the adoption 
of a substitute. Both Ld. Grenville and Mr. Dundas assented to 
this observation, and I hope the subject will be found, as I think 
it, susceptible of an adjustment mutually safe and advantageous 
to all Parties. It would be well to provide that our Ships should 
be at liberty to proceed with their cargoes from St. Domingo to 

* Italics in cipher. 



512 RUFUS KING. I~i799 

G. Britain as well as to the U.S. If the Plan of taking off the 
Drawback or a part of it, referred to in former letters, should be 
approved, perhaps we could obtain a stipulation for the Repay- 
ment to us of the duty paid on the importation and detained on 
the Exportation of the Commodity here : unless this is done, and 
the Drawbacks are taken off, it will be our interest to oblige our 
Ships to return Home with their Cargoes instead of proceeding 
with them to Gt. Britain. 

With perfect Respect &c.

R. King to Secretary of State. No. 20. 

London, Jany. 17, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

I can send you no news ; we are almost as ignorant of what has 
been doing upon the Continent within the last two months, as if 
we were at Philadelphia ; the only foreign intelligence received 
since the beginning of December, has been received from Paris. 
The ice which extends several leagues from the shore all along the 
northern coast of Europe continues to interrupt all intercourse 
with the mainland. Our papers from Philadelphia, New York 
and Boston are later than those from Hamburgh, tho' we have not 
yet received the President's Speech. The winter has been uncom- 
monly severe, the weather is now becoming more moderate and 
the usual channels of communication with the Continent must 
soon be free of impediments. We are left to mere conjecture 
respecting the accounts which we shall receive from Vienna & 
Berlin : my apprehensions are stronger than my Hopes. When 
Naples is overrun, as Piedmont has been, Austria may move ; and 
after her armies are driven out of Italy, Prussia may think it time 
to begin. Deliberation is wisdom, but Doubts after decision are 
proofs of weakness. When the weights that hang about great 
occasions are removed, wings should be added in their place ; the 
ruinous consequences of all timid hesitation and delay in the con- 
duct of public affairs, have been so often exemplified, that we shall 
be without Excuse if we repeat the Fault. 

With perfect Respect and Esteem &c. &c. 

Rufus King.

London, Jany. 19, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

Several mails arrived last evening from Hamburgh, but they were 
those longest due, and bring little news of importance. The Pas- 
sage being at length open; we may every moment expect authen- 
tic, late and interesting intelligence. Buonaparte escaped, and 
was not assassinated as first reported, in the insurrection at Cairo. 
His situation is said to have become very critical and difficult. 
The effect of the latest information from the Continent, is an 
opinion that a recommencement of the war is almost unavoidable. 
With very great Respect & Esteem &c. &c. 

Rufus King. 



R. King to O. Wolcott. 

London, Jany. 19, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

By the last mails from Hamburgh, I am informed by Mr. 
Adams that we cannot obtain a single Musket from the Prussian 
manufactories ; and the increased probability of the recommence- 
ment of the war with Austria and the Empire diminishes the 
hope of a considerable supply from any Part of Germany. I 
shall continue to give the subject the most careful attention and 
will endeavour to obtain a few thousand more from the German 
manufacturers. 

If the war is renewed, the exchange will run against us, but 
this in my opinion will be a less Evil than to remit in the present 
state of Exchange which is favorable, and risque the Funds at 
Hamburgh. 

With great Respect &c. &c. 

Rufus King. 



R. King to Rob. Troup. 

London, Jany. 19th, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

The frost has at length yielded, and last night we received 

some of the many mails due from the continent. Tomorrow they 

will probably all arrive, and we shall be able from the news they 

VOL. II.— 33 



514 RUFUS KING. [1799 

bring to form a pretty good opinion respecting the Recommence- 
ment of the War. The last french order seems to put it beyond 
doubt ; the Empire will not be able to stop the advance of the 
Russian Troops, & without it, the french declare the negotiations 
for peace to be at an End. . . . We have not yet reed, the 
Pr's. Speech, tho' we have New York Papers of the 10th Dec. & 
Boston Gazettes of the 15th. This is provoking as we are very 
anxious to see what Mr. Adams says of the return of the Envoys 
and state of our affairs with France. 

One or two Americans who have escaped in a Neutral Vessel 
from France, say that the situation of the Americans at Paris is 
unquiet and perilous. Gen. Allen after several weeks imprison- 
ment in the Temple was set at liberty, but has since been arrested 
and is now confined in a prison of less distinction. 

Young Mr. Sands, son of Comfort Sands, and a Mr. Tailor, 

formerly of Boston, have been lately arrested at Paris and are 

confined in the Temple. No crime was alleged — perhaps things 

are, in this as most other cases, reversed, and Creditors instead 

of Debtors sent to Gaol. What will the Lyons and other parti- 

zans say upon this violation of Liberty in the Person of Genl. 

Allen ? 

Yrs. 

R. K. 



Theodore Sedgwick to R. King. 

Philadelphia, 20 Jany., 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . You know how anxious I had been for some time to 
retire from public life. My own happiness, connected with the 
interests of my family, afforded motives which, to my own mind, 
justified my determination. I was well assured my successor 
would be worthy & respectable — accordingly I declined, Dexter 
was chosen, and I was happy. But my evil destiny has conquered, 
my friends would not permit me to indulge my own wishes, their 
arguments & importunities have again seduced me, and after the 
third of March I shall again be a representative. 

The letter which I wrote you, at the conclusion of the last ses- 
sion, will have given you the reasons why this government has 
exhibited our country in the awkward attitude which you justly 



1799] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 515 

deplore. Our measures in themselves were not only feeble, but 
taken with that gradation and hesitation, which shewed a want of 
system, & of spirit & vigor. The extent & shape of our measures 
were divided, not by comprehensive policy and wisdom, but by 
the feeble minds of the Tillinghasts, the Bullocks & the Coits of 
the house of Representatives. We ought at once to have put an 
end to the cooperation of external & internal enemies — to have at 
once, as far as in our power, prevented the possibility of their carry- 
ing on that most dangerous species of warfare, for the seduction 
of our people, " diplomatic skill." This could not in my opinion 
have been done effectually but by a declaration of war. This 
would have conduced equally to the honor & interest of the 
U. S. To have taken advantage of that measure, it would have 
been necessary to consider Spain, as in fact she is, a Colony of 
france. Besides, acting under the orders of her principal, Spain 
had given us sufficient cause, by innumerable aggressions, to jus- 
tify our conduct. Having assumed the character of Enemy, as 
such, I would have rendered myself respectable by a prompt and 
decided blow. The mouth of the Mississippi & the countries 
connected with and dependent on it should have been immedi- 
ately seized. The immense benefits to have been derived from 
that position, whether for treaty, or a continuance of the war, are 
obvious. In the mean time we should have superseded the 
necessity of alien & sedition laws — without them we might have 
hanged traitors and exported frenchmen. This was the policy I 
would have pursued instantly after the publication of the dis- 
patches. But it was ordered otherwise. 

The State of the Senate is not improved for the next Congress. 
In N. Hampshire Livermore is re-elected. This has put him in 
some what better humour. In Massachusetts you know the altera- 
tion. It certainly is not worse. In New York Watson is more 
firm & stable, so far as I have yet been able to observe, than I 
had thought him. In New Jersey Dayton, now furiously federal 
& antijacobin, replaces Stockton one of the most trustworthy men 
in our Country. He could not be prevailed upon to continue — I 
believe could not well afford it. Rutherfurd firm, decided, hon- 
orable & intelligent is afflicted with an inveterate rheumatism, & 
has resigned. A successor is to be chosen this week & it is said 
that either General Dickinson or Doctr. Elmer will be the man. 



516 RUFUS KING. [1799 

You know them both. Ross in this State is a candidate for the 
government and I hope will prevail ; but I need not say to you 
that he will be a serious loss to the Senate. In Delaware an 
Election will be made this week to supply the vacancy. The 
Candidates are all good. Tazewell in Virginia is reelected. In 
N. Carolina Governor Martin, always theoretically right, tho' 
generally practically wrong, is replaced by Franklin a furious but 
feeble Jacobin. Hunter from S. Carolina, who in the modern 
language of our country, had from the pride of being in good 
company " turned about," is succeeded by Charles Pinckney. 
Gunn gives us hopes of a reformation in Georgia, but Baldwin, 
who has lost his election as a member of the house, will I fear be 
chosen. So much for the Senate. 

In the house of Representatives there is on the whole an 
amelioration. In the New England States there will not be more 
than two antifederalists. One of these may be Lyon, but of that 
election we as yet have had no authentic information, and the ac- 
count in the papers of his election is only the result of conjecture. 
In New York the election is against us in the proportion of six to 
four. By districting New Jersey the opposition has obtained two 
members — In this State they are eight to five. — In Delaware they 
have again chosen Mr. Bayard, a young Gentleman of great re- 
spectability. In Maryland our old tried friend Hindman has lost 
his election and they give us now five on the side of the govern- 
ment to three against it. In North Carolina they want seven for, 
to three against us ; and in S. Carolina & Georgia all but one 
right. But in these three last states several are counted, who have 
been lately converted, and as they are not well established in the 
faith and in good works, they may fall from grace. In Virginia 
there is every reason to believe the spirit of opposition is every 
day growing more & more rancorous. In that state it has 
always been the policy to keep the members in subjection, and 
therefore they have not elected the members of the house, untill 
the month of March, and after their term of service had expired. 
The legislature is now in session, and it is in contemplation to 
provide for the election of their members, for the next Congress, 
by a general ticket ; from an apprehension that otherwise some, 
not friends to their kind of Liberty, may be elected. I am not 
acquainted with the characters of the majority of their Legisla- 



1799] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 517 

ture, but they must be men bold and adventurous indeed, or 
rendered desperate by faction, if they dare adopt a measure, so 
little consonant to their circumstances, and so opposed to the 
general tendency of their democratic doctrines. Should they, 
however, do it, I entertain no doubt, that it will produce the in- 
tended effect — a solid homogeneous column in opposition to Gov- 
ernment ; but I believe, ultimately, it would ruin its authors. In 
any event we may, I believe, promise ourselves that the next house 
will, at least, possess as much firmness, as much principle, and as 
much talents, as the present. 

Notwithstanding the plunder of our commerce, and notwith- 
standing a real pressure which has been occasioned by it, and the 
still greater which has resulted from the failure of those wild 
speculations which have pervaded every part of our country, & 
more particularly the eastern states, our finances still remain solid 
& productive — We have an annual surplus of revenue, exceeding 
two millions and a half, beyond permanent appropriations. This 
is, and by monied men & institutions will be deemed, ample se- 
curity for loans ; and the one to be opened in February will, I 
have no doubt, immediately fill. The terms offered 8 per cent & 
a limited irredeemability are certainly high, but the necessity of 
obtaining the subscriptions promptly, and the present high market 
rate of Interest, from causes which you perfectly comprehend, in 
my opinion justify the measure. 

Since writing the above poor Tazewell has died suddenly. The 
government will derive no benefit from this, because there is no 
chance of getting a good man from that State. We are told that 
either Monroe, Madison or Nicholas, a brother of the Representa- 
tive of that name, and whom the Virginians represent as a man of 
talents, will be chosen. I hope the first, from reasons which you 
will understand. 

The legislature of Virginia has abandoned the project of elect- 
ing their representatives by a general ticket. Our friend from 
that state tells us this was occasioned by a conviction that, in the 
event contemplated, the whole representation would have been 
federal — I cannot believe so well of the disposition of the state, 
but imagine their conduct was the result of the dread of the loss 
of popularity. John Taylor, the former Senator, has brought for- 
ward in the house of Representatives of that state, an address to 



5 1 8 R UFUS KING. [l799 

the people on the subject of the measures of the national govern- 
ment, particularly the alien & sedition Laws, which will doubtless 
pass both houses and is little short of a declaration of war. 

Since writing the former part of this letter, Mr. Wells of whose 
talents and decided federalism, those acquainted with him speak 
handsomely, is elected a Senator from Delaware in the stead of 
Mr. Clayton — The election in New Jersey has not yet taken 
place. 

You have seen an account of the motion of Mr. Griswold, oc- 
casioned by the mission of Citizen Logan, and of the debates & 
bill to which it gave rise. It has passed the Senate — Bloodworth 

6 Langdon only dissenting. As well the policy as the utility of 
this measure might, in my judgment, have been originally doubt- 
ful, yet after it became a question of party there was no hesitation 
that it ought to have been supported. 

The majority of the commissioners on the 6th arte, of the 
British treaty are outrageous in their decisions. It is impossible 
in this letter to enter into the detail, but it is to be feared that it 
will become indispensable on the part of the minority, (Fitzsimons 
& Sitgreaves) to secede. This will afford to you a subject of un- 
pleasant discussion, but I confide in it that the British government 
has too much wisdom not to perceive her interests, and too much 
justice to give support to the extravagance of her agents. 

The object of the present session of Congress will be to " in- 
vigorate " the systems adopted at the last : perhaps it is not go- 
ing too far to say that our consideration ought to have been, 
exclusively confined to those. We ought, however, to have con- 
sidered an increase of revenue as a principal cause of this invigora- 
tion, but in this opinion few of our friends in the house concur. 
The army & navy must be attended to — In regard to the former, 
the conduct of the executive has been astonishingly dilatory — As 
yet not a single inlisting order has been issued. It will not be 
expedient, at present, to increase the numbers, but authority 
ought to be given to the President to raise a provisional army,, 
the act, which passed the last session, for that purpose having, 
expired at the commencement of this. As to the Navy it ought 
to be increased exactly in proportion to our utmost ability. 

Your friend, 

Theodore Sedgwick.

R. King to A. Hamilton. * 

London, January 21st, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

We have the New York papers to the 15th ulto. These con- 
tain the speeches as well as the answers of the two Houses. All 
seems intended for the best, but it gives me an ill idea abroad of 
our zeal, to find that our army, decreed so many months since, re- 
mained to be raised. The difficulty and time necessary to find 
suitable officers, reminds one of the like impediments which pre- 
ceded the appointment of Monroe to Paris. I hope the results 
will differ. 

I am entirely disposed, indeed resolved, to treat the subject as 
the good principles of all concerned merit, but I can't conceal 
from you my very great apprehension that too much is left to the 
chance and influence of intrigue and diplomatic skill. In the 
light in which I alone can see the views of France, there seems 
to be no secure alternative, and the sooner we say so and act, the 
less will be our danger. 

For God's sake, attend to the very interesting subject treated of 
in my ciphered dispatches to the Secretary of State of the 10th, 
1 8th, and 19th instant.f Connect it, as it should be, with the 
main object, the time to accomplish which has arrived. Without 
superstition, Providence seems to have prepared the way, and to 
have pointed out the instruments of its will. Our children will 
reproach us if we neglect our duty, and humanity will escape 
many scourges if we act with wisdom and decision. I am more 
confirmed than before, that an efficient force will be confederated 
to act against France. The combination is not yet completed, but, 
as I have reason to believe, will soon be. 

That will be the moment for us to settle upon immutable foun- 
dations the extensive system of the American nation. Who can 
hinder us ? One nation alone has the power ; and she will co- 
operate in the accomplishment in South America of what has so 
well been done in North.

I communicate to you whatever may be useful to your Govt, to 

know, particularly when it is good news ; but keep our secret 

here — We are on the point, as I trust, of concluding a Convention

Dear Sir : 

All the mails are received. With the last, Couriers arrived 
from Petersburgh and Berlin. In consequence of Dispatches just 
received* from the Continent, England is on the point of concluding 
a Convention with Russia for the march of a second 6° much larger 
army, and the Expectations of this Govt, in other quarters are cer- 
tainly better, tho'' not yet decisive. Consider this as authentic, though 
secret. Russia would not march a second army, unless assured that 
the Emperor, or Prussia, or both would join them. 

With perfect Respect &c. &c. 

Rufus King. 

Mr. Dandridge, of Virginia, had been acting as Secretary 
for Mr. King, but having expressed a desire to take a com- 
mission in the Troops to be raised in 1798-9, was nominated 
and appointed to a commission. Mr. Pickering in a private 
letter, dated Jany. 20, 1799, under these circumstances wrote 
to Mr. King, to ask him to receive his son, John Pickering, 
in his place, he being at that time with Mr. Smith, U. S. 
Minister at Lisbon, by whom he was highly appreciated, and 

* Italics in cipher. 



1799] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 52 1 

who had " manifested an esteem and attachment honorable 
to my [his] son." Mr. Pickering after speaking of his char- 
acter and qualifications, says : 

" He had begun to study the law, when it was proposed to me 
to let him accompany Mr. Smith. I felt a reluctance to interrupt 
studies which were to form the basis of his pursuit for life ; having 
long since determined to bring up my sons to some employment 
suited to their capacities and dispositions by which they might 
support themselves and families independently without any public 
expectations — But for public employments, a previous study of 
the law is highly useful." 

As his son had been nearly two years with Mr. Smith, Mr. 
Pickering had thought of ordering him home to resume his 
studies, when, observing that Mr. King was 

" likely ere long to be without a secretary, it occurred to me 
that could he be placed in that office, it would gratify him, be 
imcomparablymore useful than a longer residence at Lisbon, and 
at the same time procure to you as diligent, as able and as faithful 
a secretary as you would anywhere find. . . . Without mean- 
ing to be importunate, I cannot withhold an assurance to you, that 
I know not any circumstance which could give me so much satis- 
faction as to have my son spend a year with you in London — 
because he is indeed an excellent young man. This is not the 
effusion of a father's fond affection but the testimony of all who 
know him." *

1797. Since that period he has remained in concealment at 
Paris. The late Decree, applying the Laws respecting Emigrants 
to the victims of the 4th of September, who shall not within a 
limited time surrender themselves & submit to banishment, has 
obliged Quatrem£re to quit France and to seek an asylum here. 
I have reason to believe him to be an honest man, and that his 
principles are good considering where they were formed. 

He will bring us pretty exact and recent information respecting 
the situation of France ; and if you see no special reasons to the 
contrary, I shall be obliged to you to give instructions to your 
officer at Yarmouth, to permit him to come to London, where he 
desires to reside. He seems to prefer to keep his assumed name ; 
if however you have any rule on that point, his gratification in 
this respect can be of no importance. Be so obliging as to give 
me your answer in season to write by the mail of tomorrow. I 
have an interest in seeing this character that leads me to this 
application.

Department of State, Jany. 22, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

... In my letter of 8th I promised to send you the official re- 
port of Capt. Phillips, as soon as it should be received, in reference 
to the outrage of Capt. Loring on the U. States Ship Baltimore. 
But I find it is not necessary ; it is a detail of his own pusilani- 
mous conduct, so disgraceful to himself and unworthy an officer 
in the American Navy, that in consequence of his own statement 
of the facts the President has dismissed him from the service. 
He suffered some British Lieutenants to take the command of his 
own ship ; on their requisition he gave them a list of his crew, 
and called them up to answer to their names, and to the enquiries 
of these British officers ! He suffered 55 of his men, to be taken 
away by Capt. Loring's boats, without any resistance. When 
50 of these had been returned, and a Lieutenant of the Thunderer 
by Captain Loring's orders, demanded the delivery of four others, 
whom he called British subjects, and Capt. Phillips told the officer 



1799] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 523 

that he should not consent to their being taken from him, the 
officer desisted and went away because he would not use any force. 
This demonstrates that if Captain Phillips had at first declared 
that if any were taken, it should only be by a superior force 
actually exerted, none would have been impressed. 

This easiness and pusilanimity of Capt. Phillips, however, 
will not justify Captain Loring. Before he proposed an exchange, 
he dema?ided of Capt. Phillips and told him he would take all who 
had not protections, and he sent his boats and took them accord- 
ingly and surrounded by three ships of the line and some frigates, 
Captain Phillips submitted to the outrage. 

To the information in my letter of the 8th, I have now to add 
the further direction of the President, that you make application 
to the British Government for the five men taken and detained by 
Captain Loring. . . . 

Mr. Liston informs me that he has written to Sir Hyde Parker, 
who is chief in command of the British naval force in the West 
Indies, representing the impropriety of taking even known British 
subjects from public armed vessels of the United States ; remark- 
ing that the right of doing it, if it exists at all, must be reciprocal ; 
but to the exercise of which right no British Naval Commander 
would submit. 



R. Troup to R. King. 

New York, 23 January, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . Since the meeting of Congress nothing important has 
occurred. The President's speech and the answers of the two 
houses you have before this seen. Nothing will be done towards 
accommodation with France until she makes our government an 
assurance that she will respect the rights of embassy and receive 
a minister from us with due honor. On this part of our Presi- 
dent's speech our friends in Philadelphia were divided. Some 
thought that we should wait for a Minister from France ; but the 
President thought differently. 

Our government is opening a new loan at 8 per cent, which 
does not seem to be relished. It is universally thought the money 
wanted will be subscribed in less than half an hour. The in- 



524 RUFUS KING. [l799 

terest is complained of ; I fear in Europe it will look like the giv- 
ing of two per cent a month by an individual. 

Our army is progressing but slowly. ... I think the great 
naval victories of Great Britain have tended powerfully to dimin- 
ish our ardor, and to bring on a languor fatal to all our energies. 
. . . Our Navy is increasing and growing respectable. There is 
every appearance that it will be a favorite and popular object of 
the government. . . . 

The proposition for amending the Constitution by excluding 
aliens from a seat in Congress, has been rejected by our Legisla- 
ture now in session. Burr has made a speech, which is published 
in the Aurora on this question. He contends that the only 
instances of corruption we have had are a corruption in our own 
countrymen. Foreigners amongst us have always been virtuous, 
honorable and faithful servants of the public. . . . 

More business in the mercantile line has never been done in 
this city than has been done since November. Insurance has 
fallen 50 per cent ; this agreeable change is ascribed to our Navy 
which has rendered our commerce more secure. . . . 

When General Washington was in Philadelphia, he was in per- 
fect health and his mind was thought to be as alert as ever. Since 
he left Philadelphia we have had a report of his death — but thank 
God it has proved to be groundless — He is not even sick — The 
shock this report gave, I cannot describe. . . . 

Adieu, 

Robt. Troup.

Dear Sir : 

Col. Maitland is a character that I* think well chosen for the 
business that carries him to Philada. All his family, which is Scotch, 
are remarkable for their talents and independence. The Colo, was 
a member of the last Parlia??ient and with his brother, Lord Lauder- 
dale, in opposition. 

In a conversation that I had with him he appeared to be con- 
vinced of the force of the objections that we should offer to the 

* Italics in cipher. 



1799] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 525 

Project first proposed by Ld. GrenvilU and also of the necessity of 
concerted measures between us and this country. He went very far 
upon this point, and as his Powers, or rather those given to Mr. 
Liston, {for Col. M aitland will have no public character) are very 
full, I am greatly in hopes that an adjust??ient will be made that will 
be satisfactory in the present case and open the way to future and 
beneficial Regulations respecting the West Indies. What is now done, 
should have in view, and if possible should be so settled as to assist 
what hereafter must be done. Colojiel M aitland is well acquainted 
with Mr. Liston, and from peculiar circumstances will be likely to 
have much influence with him. 

We have just received the President's speech. The king who 
had before more than once asked me whether it had yet arrived, 
told me yesterday that he had read it and that he found it an able 
and excellent speech. This opinion is expressed by every one, 
and our national reputation is daily increased by the steady and 
dignified conduct of our Government. 

I have not heard that any of our Ships have made use of Cer- 
tificates purporting that no part of their cargoes was of the growth 
or fabric of the British territories. Some Danish or Swedish ships, 
lately detained by the English cruizers are provided with Certifi- 
cates of this sort ; indeed the merchants and navigators of their 
Nation, appear to conform to the Regulations from time to time 
made by France respecting the Commerce & Navigation of Neu- 
tral Nations. 

In a late trial of these detained Ships, the Judge of the High 
Court of Admiralty took notice of the French Decree respecting 
British Productions and manufactures belonging to Neutrals and 
laden upon Neutral ships, spoke of it as a violation of the essen- 
tial maxims of the Law of Nations, intimated that an acquiescence 
in it by Neutral Nations appeared unfriendly to England as well 
as humiliating to themselves, and that Certificates granted by 
French Consuls resident in Neutral Countries declaring that no 
part of the Cargoes of Ships laden in such Countries was of British 
production or fabric, afforded a presumption that such Cargo be- 
longed to France or to her citizens. After this intimation it is not 
improbable that vessels provided with such certificates will be de- 
tained and sent in for adjudication. On the other hand France 
adheres to her Decrees, and our vessels are captured because 



526 RUFUS KING. [1799 

their Passports or Roles d'Equipages do not conform to the law 
of March 1797, and upon the pretence that their Cargoes are 
wholly or partly of English fabric or production. 

Several of our Tobacco and other valuable ships have lately 
been taken and upon one pretence or another all vessels met by 
French Privateers & which are unable to defend themselves are 
captured ; and it is nearly or quite two years since I have heard 
of the discharge of any American Ship sent into a French Port as 
Prize. Upon our own Coasts & in the West Indies, the Privateers 
have decreased, but they have during the winter increased in the 
North Sea, the Bay of Biscay and about the Western Islands. 

The Privateers are nourished by the capture of Neutral Prop- 
erty. The Trade of England sails in fleets and under Convoy 
and in this way is essentially protected. Why should we not 
collect our Rice and Tobacco Ships and send them to market 
under our own convoy ? We see that the English East and West 
India Trade isScarry'd on in fleets which are convoyed in safety to 
their Ports of discharge. More time is requisite to perform the 
voyage, but a much less premium insures the ship and cargo, and 
the measure would be no inconsiderable national saving. 

Should any of our Frigates come to Europe, and touch at any 
of the English Ports, I think by no means improbable that we 
could obtain the discharge of the American seamen who have 
been taken in French Privateers and are confined here as prisoners 
of war. They are upwards of an hundred and perhaps double 
that number. 

With perfect Respect & Esteem &c. &c.

London, Jany. 26, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

I had some weeks past the pleasure of receiving your Letter of 
the 16th October. The Enclosure was immediately forwarded, 
tho' from the obstructions which interrupted the Passage to Ham- 
burg, I fear it was a long time on its way to Berlin. We are still 
uncertain what is to be the Situation of Europe during the ap- 
proaching summer ; on this topic I must refer to my Dispatches

to Col. Pickering. It would be hardly decent to express what I 
think of the weakness, corruption & indecision of most of the 
Continental Govts. The aristocracies are as unwise and as base 
as their Princes ; and if Europe shall be rescued from the Bar- 
barism, with which Philosophy is about to overrun it, it will be 
effected by the moderation & virtues of the People, who in Spain, 
Italy & throughout Germany are less guilty, & more meritorious 
than their Magistrates and Rulers. This is a melancholy pros- 
pect, and one that may appal, tho' it ought not to discourage, the 
boldest minds. The firmness, the courage and the resources of 
England, joined to the docility of the people and the wonderful 
ease with which the Laws are adapted to the new and dangerous 
condition of surrounding circumstances, are the highest Eulogium 
of its Constitution, afford a rational Hope of ultimate security 
and confirm what is so well proved in the best work that has 
been written upon the intricate subject of Government. 

Amidst this mighty storm, it is my greatest pleasure, and the 
source of the most gratifying Pride, to mark the increasing atten- 
tion with which Europe continues to observe and applaud the 
able and dignified Administration of the American Government, 
— which in its open & manly proceedings towards France has 
not only done much for its own Security, but more for that of 
Europe than many portions of it have had the courage or wisdom 
to do for themselves. This language is involuntary, for every- 
where throughout Europe, strong tho' ill founded prejudices 
existed against us and our Institutions.* 

With unfeigned Respect & attachment, I am, &c. 

R. King.

Quincy, 13th Ap., 99. 

I regret I cannot have an opportunity of receiving Genl. Maitland and 
Colonel Grant, and conversing with them on several subjects of importance. 
I hope Mr. King's public dispatches to you were written in better 
spirits than his private letter to me (probably Jany. 26 p. 29). You will please 
return it to me. Mr. King was, you know, at times a little subject to croak- 
ing. I fear, however, in this case he has too much reason. The people of 
Europe see little difference between the new and old state of things. The 
highest and lowest of mankind are desperately corrupt and wicked, and the 
middling people are almost destroyed.

R. King to the Secretary of State. No. 24. 

London, Jany. 27, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

Letters were yesterday received from Adml. Nelson, dated 
Naples Bay Deer, the 2 2d, which state that the Neapolitan Army 
is beaten in every quarter, that the cowardice of the soldiery is 
only equalled by the Treachery of the officers, that the King & 
Queen with the British Ambassador Sir Wm. Hamilton have es- 
caped and were on board the Admiral's Ship on their way to 
Palermo in Sicily. Genl. Mack was at Capua & Naples in the 
hands of the French. Thus all Italy, excepting Tuscany, which 
will not escape, especially as Leghorn has lately been occupied 
by the Neapolitans protected by the Br. fleet, is completely in 

528 



1799] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 529 

the Power, and its wealth & resources entirely at the disposal of 
the Directory. It does not appear that the least effort was made 
by Austria to assist Naples ; the Casus Foederis it is alleged did 
not exist. The Conquest of Italy in itself is a most important 
Event, but the influence of these rapid Successes will exceed all 
calculation, on the one hand in dissipating the effects of the late 
naval victories of England, and by animating & hastening the 
new Levies of France ; and on the other by increasing the hesita- 
tion of Austria & Russia, and adding to the embarrassments 
which retard the projected Confederacy. 

The subject of an Union has been brought before the Parlia- 
ments of G. Britain and Ireland ; in the former an answer to the 
King's Message has been voted without division engaging to take 
the subject into consideration ; in the latter the address to the 
same effect in answer to the Soeech of the Lord Lieutenant was 

A. 

carried in the House of Commons only by 106 against 105 Votes. 
This, I presume, is an unexpected Division. What will be the 
next step I can only conjecture. The Minister here stands pub- 
lickly pledged to pursue the measure until it shall be crowned 
with compleat success. At present perhaps nothing further will 
be attempted in Ireland ; but the Plan will I think be laid before 
the Br. Parliament, where its advantages as well to Ireland as to 
the Empire being fully discussed and laid open, may become the 
Foundation of a renewed attempt with the present or a future 
Irish Parliament. 

With perfect Respect & Esteem &c. &c.

R. King to General Maitland. 

London, Jany. 27, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

I cannot omit the opportunity before your departure to express 
to you the satisfaction that I feel in your going to Philadelphia. 
The Business that carries you there in itself is of considerable im- 
portance, but taken in connection with the harmony and friendly 
intercourse that so happily subsist between our two Countries, and 
which it is so much the wish of both to preserve and to perpetu- 
ate, the subject becomes ten fold more interesting ; and it is 

VOL. II. — 34 



530 RUFUS KING. [*799 

principally in this latter view that I think it truly fortunate that 
the questions which shall arise in the course of your discussions 
are certain to receive an equitable, as well as an unprejudiced and 
liberal decision. The late news from Italy, the whole of which 
except Tuscany is in the possession of the French, will on the 
one hand serve to diminish the Influence of the late naval Vic- 
tories of this Country and to hasten and animate the new Levies 
of France ; while on the other, it will increase the Doubts and 
indecision of Austria and Prussia, and raise up fresh embarrass- 
ments against the projected Confederacy. Without stopping to 
inquire where all this will end, does not the present situation of 
Europe eminently strengthen and confirm the Policy of removing 
as soon, and as effectually as possible, every cause of future mis- 
understanding and jealousy between Gr. Britain & the U. States ? 
I am truly happy in believing that this must be your opinion ; and 
in this way I derive some consolation from those disasters which 
cannot fail to excite our commiseration and Regret. 

With the most perfect Respect &c. &c. 

Rufus King. 



R. King to Lord Grenville. 

Great Cumberland Place, February 4, 1799. 
My Lord : 

I persuade myself that your Lordship will feel the Equity of 
our Expectations in respect to the Subject of the enclosed Note. 
Precedents are conclusively applicable only to cases strictly anal- 
ogous. We present a case without Example, and therefore not 
within the reach of Precedents. France asserted a construction 
of a public Treaty that we denied ; she persisted and we dissolved 
the Instrument, the provision of which she construed in abuse. 

A Question involving the settlement of much Property occurs 
before your tribunals, which on its merits can only be decided by 
deciding the Point and Construction on which we & France dis- 
agree. Will you receive the Construction of France as conclusive 
against us ? What would have been proper had we acquiesced in 
& submitted to the Interpretation given to the Treaty by France 
is another point ; but circumstanced as this question is, and with 
the knowledge of the violence and little regard to Justice that un- 



1799] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 53 1 

fortunately prevail in France, and which no man can exclude from 
his mind, I cannot believe that we are to be thrown out of your 
Courts, on the Plea that respect is due to the Decisions of the Tri- 
bunals of France against the most explicit Denial of their Justice 
and Validity by us. All we ask is that the facts should be decided 
without a reference on the one hand to France, or on the other to 
us. If the demand is novel, so unhappily are the times in which 
we live ; and so much so indeed, that the application of maxims 
established upon the former usages and ancient faith of nations, 
to occurrences and cases originating from the Subversion of these 
maxims, would often defeat instead of securing the Justice they 
were formed to support. 

In regard to the Laws respecting Neutral Ships laden with 
articles of the growth or fabric of the British Territories, and be- 
longing to neutrals, can I suppose that your Courts will receive 
a French sentence condemning such property on account of growth 
or fabric, as conclusive evidence against a suitor, who comes be- 
fore them to prove the Property to be neutral ? Would not such a 
decision be an acquiescence in and an admission of the Justice of 
the Law — and how can one sentence be rejected and another 
received ? 

I will only add my Desire that this Subject may with as little 
Delay as convenient receive your Lordship's attention as I am in- 
formed that one or two of the Cases in question are in a state 
very soon to be argued and decided by the Court of King's 

Bench. 

With most perfect Consideration & Respect 

Rufus King. 



R. King to the Right Honorable Lord Grenville. 

Copy. 

London, February 4, 1799. 

The undersigned Minister plenipotentiary has received the ex- 
press order of the President of the United States to represent to 
the Government of his Britannic Majesty that immediately upon 
the breaking out of the present war in Europe, the United States 
in the most public and solemn manner announced their determina- 
tion to take no part in the same, but on the contrary to observe 



532 RUFUS KING. [*799 

during the continuance thereof the most exact and impartial 
neutrality ; a Resolution alike influenced by a just regard to the 
welfare and happiness of their own People and an earnest desire 
to preserve the Relations of Peace and amity which happily sub- 
sisted between them and the different Nations of Europe. 

These views continued invariably to regulate the conduct of 
the Amn. Govt, until the period when that of France, unmindful 
of the obligation of Treaties, and disregarding the Rights of In- 
dependent and friendly Nations, passed certain laws injurious to 
those Rights & which authorized extensive Depredations upon 
the Amern. Commerce. 

The Undersigned refers in particular to an Order of the French 
Directory of the 2d of August 1797, and to a Law of the two 
Councils of the 18 January 1798. The first declares liable to 
capture and condemnation as lawful Prizes, all American Vessels 
not provided with a Role d'Equipage in the form thereby pre- 
scribed ; a Document which the American Vessels never pos- 
sessed, which was not required by any stipulation in the treaties 
between the two Nations, & which according to express Provisions 
of such Treaties was wholly unnecessary. The Second, in viola- 
tion of the acknowledged and hitherto universally reed. Law of 
Nations, declares liable to capture and condemnation all Neutral 
Vessels laden wholly or in part with articles of the growth or 
fabric of any of the Territories of Great Britain, notwithstanding 
the same shall bona fide belong to Neutrals. 

The United States, whose Commerce became the Victim of 
these Regulations did not fail to present to the French Govern- 
ment repeated and friendly Remonstrances against them ; in 
which they demonstrated their inconsistency with the stipulations 
of existing treaties, refuted the pretended reasons upon which they 
were alleged to be founded & called upon the Justice of France 
for their revision and repeal. 

This pacific and friendly course failed to produce its natural 
and proper Effect ; and the U. States, finding that neither the 
faith of treaties could restrain the Govt, of France, nor reasona- 
ble remonstrances induce a recall of its unjust and vexatious 
Regulations, by a solemn Act of their Legislature declared the 
treaties between them and France dissolved, void and no longer 
binding upon them or their People — gave orders to their Ships of 



1799] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 533 

war & authority to their merchant vessels, the Masters whereof 
should apply for and receive Commissions for that purpose, not 
only to resist, but to attack, capture and make Prize of any armed 
French vessel found upon the high seas, and prohibited all trade 
& Commercial Intercourse between the Territories of the United 
States & the Dominion of France. 

The undersigned flatters himself, from the facts thus concisely 
stated, the truth whereof is equally notorious and incontestable, 
that it might be evident to the British Government, that the 
United States have never acquiesced in, but on the contrary that 
they have constantly denied the Justice and validity of the above 
recited Regulations ; and that unable by friendly Remonstrances 
to recall France to an observance of her treaties and a deference 
for those long established maxims of public Law, which no Nation 
is free to change or to disobey, they have dissolved and cut off 
all commercial Intercourse between the two Nations, & armed in 
defence of their just & violated Rights. 

It has been in consequence of the above mentioned Regulations 
that American vessels laden with valuable cargoes of innocent 
merchandize & insured in Gr. Britain have been captured by 
French cruizers, and tho' acknowledged to be American Property 
have been condemned as lawful Prizes in the Tribunals of 
France. 

These condemnations, made in violation of public faith, and 
which have led to the dissolution of the treaties by which they 
were pretended to be justified, are resorted to, and attempted to 
be used as just and conclusive sentences before the Judiciary of 
Great Britain, for the Purpose of defeating the Citizens of the 
United States in their claims against such of his Majesty's Sub- 
jects, as upon adequate consideration took upon themselves the 
Risque and became the assurors of the Property so unjustly con- 
demned. It is with a view to Property in this peculiar situation 
that the Undersigned is ordered to present this note ; and with- 
out discussing the nature and true extent of precedents, founded 
undoubtedly in the Justice as well as convenience of Nations, and 
which enjoin a Respect for the Decisions of foreign Tribunals, or 
asking with what Propriety such precedents can be made to bear 
upon cases circumstanced like the present, the Undersigned con- 
tents himself in referring these Enquiries to the Justice and im- 



534 RUFUS KING. [i799 

partiality of the Br. Govt, in full confidence that they must lead 
to the adoption of such measures as will effectually secure to the 
citizens of the United States the Remedies to which the Justice 
of their Claims in the above described Cases gives them a solid 
title. Whether this object is to be attained by Legislative or 
other Provisions for that Purpose, the Undersigned does not pre- 
sume to enquire ; but he is bound to express the reasonable Ex- 
pectation of his own Government, that adequate means will be 
devised to remove any Impediments that may be supposed to 
stand in the way of real and substantial Justice in the cases before 
alluded to. 

Rufus King. 



T. Pickering to R. King. 

Department of State, Feby. 5, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . The resignation of Sir James Marriott is a fortunate 
occurrence ; the expences of long and indefinite delays in the 
proceedings of the high Court of Admiralty in England, added to 
the ordinary heavy charges of suits in that Court, rendered them 
insupportable. 

Your timely interference to prevent the emigration of the Irish 
Traitors to this country is extremely acceptable to the President ; 
but if removed to any other country many of them will probably 
find their way hither, and therefore not only a List of their names, 
but descriptions of their persons and their ages would be very 
useful, if attainable. . . . 

The difference of opinion among the Commissioners here under 
the 6th Article of the British Treaty will doubtless suspend their 
proceedings ; the claims not only surpass immensely in amount 
whatever was contemplated by us ; but are advocated on princi- 
ples which appear quite inadmissible. They go the length to 
make the United States, at once, the debtor for all the outstanding 
debts of British subjects contracted before the peace of 1783, 
and in effect reduce the Board to a company of clerks, whose 
chief business would be to examine and see that the accounts 
were rightly cast. The amount of the claims presented exceeds 



1799] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 535 

Nineteen Millions of Dollars. I expect a statement will be made 
of the claims and arguments on one side, and of the reasons with 
which they are combated on the other, which with the requisite 
Documents will be transmitted to you. They will in that case be 
the subject of instructions from the President. 

. . . The Decree of the Directory of France of the 29th of 
October, received in your No. 9., has by the President been laid 
before Congress, with the remark you made upon it. The chair- 
man of a Committee of the Senate told me yesterday that a Bill 
was prepared to be introduced on the subject this day. The 
suspension of the execution of that Decree, as mentioned in your 
No. 10, cannot change the disposition of any measure on our 
part ; and especially as the Decree of March 2d 1797 prescribed 
the same sanguinary treatment of our Seamen, and that Decree is 
neither repealed nor suspended. 

The Law prohibiting Commercial intercourse with the French 
Dominions was to continue only until the end of the present ses- 
sion of Congress. A new Bill, with material alterations has passed 
the House of Representatives, by a very great majority, and will 
probably be adopted to day in the Senate. It is proposed to vest 
the President with power to open the intercourse with such places 
in the French Territories, into which our vessels may enter with 
safety ; and consequently where the licenced piracies of French 
Privateers shall no longer be practised. It is not a secret that 
this may be expected in St. Domingo ; and it would be unwise in 
us not to benefit by such an event. If this discrimination in the 
bill should produce such an effect we cannot be blamed. If by a 
Commercial arrangement we disarm an enemy, the measures can- 
not be censured. The profits of that Commerce, should it be 
opened, will tend to compensate our Merchants for the interest of 
the immense capital of which French Captures, seizures and the 
non-fulfillment of Contracts have deprived them. . . . The 
injuries we have sustained by such captures and partial condem- 
nation (by the British cruizers in the West Indies) are very con- 
siderable. It is time that on both sides the meaning of the 18th 
article was understood. It has lately been stated that one Insur- 
ance Company in this city (Philadelphia) has in the last six 
months paid for losses by British captures to a much greater 
amount than for those arising from French captures.

P.S. The President has this day nominated you Commissioner 
Plenipotentiary to negociate a Commercial Treaty with Russia. 
6th Feby. 

G. Cabot to R. King. 

Feby. 7th, 1799. 
My Dear Sir : 

. . . I anticipate the chagrin you will feel at the falling off 
so visibly in our Country since the meeting of Congress & I par- 
take of the inquietude & perplexity which you are to suffer from 
the secession of our Comms. at Phila. Altho I am wholly unin- 
formed of the grounds of misunderstanding yet I can think of no 
other than is suggested by the Newspaper relative to confiscated 
debts or property, & I shou'd not have imagined that serious pre- 
tensions cou'd have been raised on either Treaty to revise those 
acts. Whatever it may be, you are to negotiate the accommoda- 
tion & your success good or bad will be decisive, in the judgment 
of this country, of the policy G. B. will habitually pursue towards 
the U. S. Every thing has conspired to satisfy me that you per- 
sonally wou'd give to our country a fair & full chance for the 
operation of every favorable motive & incident, & if under these 
circumstances we cannot procure a liberal system of intercourse 
the fault must be in the intractable temper of G. B. But nothing 
short of experience will convince me that she can be so blind to 
her own interest. I know your moderation and equanimity & 
with these your knowledge & Industry can hardly fail to accom- 
plish all our wishes. I have heard nothing of the commercial pro- 
jects you have transmitted — my own head has been often filled 
with extensive schemes which G. B. & the U. S. might execute 
with infinite advantage if they cou'd be brought to act together 
with that perfect good faith & good humour which alone can 
result from a common interest well understood by both parties. 
Men who live out of the world always wonder its affairs are not

& apparently insuperable obstacles which Vice & Folly every 
where produce they wonder that any thing like order subsists. I

as a good antidote to Gerryism which has a little infected some of 
the very Great & some of the very Little. I dare not commit to

T. Pickering to R. King. 

Private. 

Department of State, Feby 6th, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . I wish you to turn the subject in your mind ; and the 
more as you may yourself have occasion, I believe, very shortly to 
concur in making an arrangement which will embrace it, and in 
which, as in all acts of the kind, precision is of the highest 
importance. . . . 

I inclose a very candid and sensible address (printed) from the 
Minority of the House of Assembly of Virginia to the people of 
that State, to counteract the Address and Resolves of the majority 
which were of the most inflammatory nature and hostile to the 
General Government. . . . They have been rejected by every 
other Legislature, which has yet taken them up. In short, Vir- 
ginia and its offspring Kentucky will stand alone in those outra- 
geous attempts to break the union of the States ; their proceedings 
excite only contempt mingled with some resentment, proportioned 
to the degree of force with which they could assail the union. 

T. P. 

R. King to Secretary of State. No. 25. 

London, Feby. 13, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

The last French papers contain a long Message of the Directory 
to the Councils delivered on the 13th ulto., recommending a re- 
vision of the Prize Laws and a transfer of the Power to decide 
Prize questions in the last resort from the ordinary Tribunals to 



538 RUFUS KING. [l799 

the Executive Directory. Probably the last is the real object of 
the Message. The Profits now divided among the Tribunals 
would upon this modification of the Laws, center in the Hands 
of the Directory & its particular Agents. I shall send you a copy 
of this Message, and a Report of the proceedings of the Councils 
upon it, as soon as I am able to obtain them. 

No mails have been received from Hamburgh since the middle 
of January, and we know nothing of what is doing upon the Con- 
tinent, except from the French Papers. Italy has completely 
fallen without the Emperor's moving. Ehrenbreitstein is likewise 
reported to have surrendered without any attempt by Prussia to 
retain it. Portugal is menaced with an army, to which Spain is 
said to have given permission to march thro' her Territories ; and 
another Expedition is undoubtedly preparing at Brest ; naval 
Stores are carried overland from Dunkirk to Brest for its equip- 
ment, and the French papers say they are to make another effort 
to throw a body of troops into Ireland ; ten or twelve Ships of 
the Line with Frigates and Transports are to be employed in the 
attempt. 

I annex copies of a Note that I lately sent to Lord Grenville in 
consequence of your Letter of the 13. of December (No. 35), and 
of a letter to Mr. Dundas respecting the interruption of our Ships 
returning from the Danish Provinces in India to Europe. The 
former has been sent to the Law Officers of the Crown for their 
opinion and Report ; and to the latter I have yet received no 
answer. 

The Swedish Envoy will leave a few days hence on his return 
home ; his secretary remains as Charge d'Affaires : this recall is 
to be understood as a mark of displeasure of Sweden on account 
of the seizure of its ships in the course of the last Summer ; 
these vessels are still detained and are to be tried by the Prize 
Courts. 

Mr. Smith our Minister at Lisbon lately inquired of me whether 
we were likely to recover anything here on account of the capture 
of the Ship Fortune, the vessel employed by Barlow to carry the 
captives from Algiers to Marseilles. I have answered him after 
a full examination of the Case, and taking the opinion of Counsel 
here, the claim has been abandoned as desperate. I think that 
I have already given you an exact report of the circumstances of 



1799] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 539 

this Case ; if not, you may obtain it from Donaldson, who has re- 
turned to Philadelphia ; the vessel was never American property ; 
the whole transaction was a fraud, of which (in the most charita- 
ble light that it can be said) Barlow was the Dupe. 

With the most perfect Respect and Esteem &c. &c. 

Rufus King. 



R. King to Henry Dundas. 

Great Cumberland Place, Feby. 13, 1799. 
Sir : 

Your official connexion with the whole subject of British India, 
leads me to address this Letter to you directly instead of passing 
it into the Department of Foreign Affairs. The Representations 
of the Masters of the American Ships Iphigenia and Kensington, 
and which I take the liberty to send you inclosed, are so full and 
satisfactory that it seems unnecessary that I should restate the 
cases for your information. 

I presume that no question exists concerning the reality of the 
Danish Settlement at Serampore and therefore that none can exist 
concerning the Right of Denmark to regulate the trade between 
it and the Danish Dominions in Europe. These ships then were 
engaged in lawful voyages when the Governor of St. Helena act- 
ing, as he alleges, under instructions from the East India Com- 
pany, detained and sent them to England charged with having 
violated the Provisions of the Treaty between Gr. Britain and the 
United States. 

That we shall experience occasional interruptions from the 
agents of the Company in our trade to India, I am disposed to 
believe ; as it is of the essence of their employment to render as 
exclusive as possible the trade of the Company, and the advan- 
tages it enjoys. 

But I have the satisfaction to know that other and more just 
and liberal views are entertained by you on this subject, and I 
flatter myself that you will be disposed to temper and moderate 
a spirit, that left to its natural impulse will expose our commerce 
to unceasing and most inconvenient interruptions. 

These ships are not detained on suspicion that they or their 
cargoes are enemy's property, but on a principle against which I 



540 RUFUS KING. [i799 

cannot too early offer my Protest, and which I persuade myself 
a due regard to the stipulations of our treaty and to the mutual 
harmony and friendship of our Countries will cause to be re- 
linquished. So far as I am able to understand the conduct of the 
Governor of St. Helena, it was not influenced by an opinion that 
these cargoes were not exported from the Danish, but from the 
British Territories in India, and according to the Provisions of 
our Treaty ought to have been carried directly from there to 
America, instead whereof being bound to Denmark, they became 
liable to seizure by the officers of the British Government. It is 
this influence that I resist ; and admitting the case to be the re- 
verse of what it is, and precisely what it is supposed to be, we 
cannot allow that these ships were liable to seizure by any person 
deriving his authority from Great Britain. The stipulation in 
question, in terms as well as meaning, is an agreement on the 
part of the United States that their people shall carry the articles 
exported from the British Territories in India directly to America, 
and moreover that the United States shall adopt such regulations, 
as from time to time may be found necessary to enforce the faith- 
ful performance of this agreement. It is the United States and 
their officers, and not Great Britain or her officers, who have the 
right and are. bound to enforce the observance of this rule ; and 
in this as in other Stipulations of Treaties between Nations, the 
performance rests upon the good faith of those who have made 
the promise. If the citizens of the United States evade or dis- 
obey the rule contained in the stipulation, the United States, 
and they only, have the Right, and by express clauses in the 
Treaty are obliged to punish the offenders. The remedy on the 
part of Great Britain, if this stipulation is violated, is by calling 
on the American Government to enforce the observance of it ; 
and in case of neglect or refusal, a fact however not to be pre- 
sumed, the Treaty itself may justly be considered as at an 
End. 

Thus then whether these ships were engaged in a voyage with- 
out the reach of the Treaty, or in a voyage contrary to its pro- 
visions, in either case their detention is illegal and they ought to 
be restored. 

With the most perfect Esteem & Respect &c. &c. 

Rufus King.

R. King to Richard Varick, New York. 

London, Feby. 14, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

Having obtained information that a person was employed in 
printing a quantity of American Notes or Bills of Credit, I took 
immediate measures to have him and his work seized by the 
Police. It turns out to be a forgery of the Small Notes issued by 
Mr. Phoenix by order of the Corporation of New York, feb 20. 
1790. The printer had worked off 20.000 sheets, each sheet con- 
taining 4 notes for threepence, and 2 for twopence ; the work was 
to have been delivered the evening of the day it was seized. The 
printer says that he intended to disclose the business to me before 
the delivery, and as evidence of his honesty pointed out the dif- 
ference between the letters in the words " two pence " on the back 
of the false Bills from those of the true, as well as some other 
variations. We are now endeavouring to detect the Employer, 
whose name and residence the printer says he does not know, but 
whom he understood to be an American. I have promised to re- 
lease the Printer (by the way I don't find that he could be pun- 
ished) and to give him a few Guineas if he will effectually assist 
the Police officers in discovering the Employer. 

I wish that this new proof of the risque as well as injustice of 
these small paper money Schemes may operate to discourage us 
from resorting to them. The Corporation would have detected 
and refused to pay these counterfeits ; but the citizens and that 
class of them least able to bear the loss would have been sufferers 
to the amount that should have been thrown out of circulation. * 

With sincere Respect & Esteem &c. 

Rufus King. 

* Richard Varick to R. King. 

New York, February 1st, 1800. 
Dear Sir : 

Some time in April last I had the honor of receiving your very friendly favor 
of the 14th February last, advising me of the measures you had adopted for 
securing the counterfeiters of our City small change commonly called Penny 
Bills alias Fhcenixes, and covering a specimen of the false bills which are in my 
opinion sufficiently well executed to deceive 9 tenths of the Citizens, and as 
you observe the poorer class in particular. 

At the first Common Council thereafter and which was held within a few 
days after the receipt of your letter, I laid it with its contents before the Board. 



542 KUFUS KING. [1799 

G. Cabot to R. King. 

Feby. 16, 1799. 

My dear Sir : 

If the Seditious were hardy enough to denounce you for the 
great service you have render'd the country in shutting its doors 
against Irish Desperadoes you wou'd still have reason to be con- 
tent, for the praises of the good wou'd be increased in proportion 
to the clamours of the vicious ; but I believe the measure is so 
generally approved that Faction will hardly dare to condemn it. 
I mention'd in a late letter the secession of our Comms. ; my 
only authority was the Newspapers but it stood uncontradicted 
until it was universally credited — the truth of it is now denied by 
Porcupine, so that we may at least suppose the acct was ex- 
aggerated, & altho' I know there are some unexpected proceedings, 
I hope they are not of so great moment as I had feared. 

You are not more chagrined than many other Federalists at the 
inconsistency of Congress in their last session. I believe how- 
ever there is no great secrecy in the cause of it ; a maxim a 1000 
times repeated & a million times verified since the day of De Retz 
may serve for a general explanation — how often do we lament the 

They in the first place requested me to present to you their thanks for the 
attention you have manifested to the interest of your fellow citizens of New 
York, and to declare to you their readiness to reimburse any expence which you 
might have incurred on the subject to serve us ; They also took immediate 
measures for calling out of circulation those notes so as to put a stop to farther 
evil and the little Fraud by means thereof. 

[Mr. Varick then states that though he had sent an answer to Mr. King's 
letter shortly after his was received, he had learned from him that it had not 
reached him and therefore in this repeated what had been written in it. He 
finishes the letter by saying :] 

I agree with you in the opinion that we ought not to hold our real property 
cheap on account of a few visits of the Yellow Fever. Indeed I mention with 
pleasure that it has not depreciated as much as our friends at a distance from 
us would be led to suppose, or as some of our desponding ones here imagine. 
It is true that Real Estates do not command as high prices now as 4 or 5 years 
since, when every monied man, alias paper dealer, considered himself a Nabob ; 
but our citizens in general are not yet disposed to abandon their residences or 
to part with their Real Estates under fair prices. 

I transmit you nothing new, as I suppose Mr. Low and many other friends 
give you all our country affairs. I pay my respects to Mrs. King and wish you 
both every happiness. 

With great respect and esteem, &c. 

Richd. Varick.

impossibility of combining the efforts of those who truly aim at 
the same end ! but in the present case Genl Marshall unfor- 
tunately held the decided opinion that France woud declare war 
when the Dispatches shou'd appear : & T. Sewell with other good 
men were so strongly impressed with the advantage of such a 
declaration by them that they cou'd not be persuaded to relinquish 
the belief in it — I was astonished that they shou'd have attributed 
to the French such miserable policy. 

You will be more mortified at the strange language lately held 
on the practicability of a safe & pacific system of intercourse 
being at the option of France to restore &c &c — when a public 
man allows himself to become the advocate of Inconsistency in 
another, he necessarily becomes inconsistent himself. The spirit 
of our country which was rising to a just indignation has un- 
doubtedly been damped by some who had great merit in exciting 
it. You will see however that it is not wholly repressed & the 
violent & seditious temper of Virginia operates powerfully to re- 
vive it. The addresses of our Legislature to Govr Sumner & their 
spirited proceedings in opposition to Virginianism will show 
plainly that the people are better than Congress. 

The ideas you suggest respecting Commerce with the Levant 
& Constantinople are very important & if a treaty can be formed 
that shall secure for us an easy access to those Regions, our people 
will rate its value full as high as they ought, for they outstrip 
Dutchmen & Jews in the love of trade & its profits ; they will 
also see in such a measure the difference between english & 
french sincerity. I don't yet understand the policy of G. B. in re- 
lation to Hispaniola, but to me it appears evident that they ought 
to seize*that Colony from France effectually & forever — the Com- 
merce of England with the two Indies & the U. S., upon principles 
of liberality toward us, might be maintained superior to competi- 
tion or hostility, & if the advantages were to be used with modera- 
tion, might be permanent. In a word Hispaniola shou'd be 
independent & this Independence guaranteed by G. B. & acknowl- 
edged by France at the peace : if Royalty is restored or estab- 
lished, this wou'd be a reasonable indemnity, but if the Monster 
called Republic continues it is indispensable to strip him of this 

possession or there wou'd be no security in his neighborhood

Somerset Place, 18th Feby., 1799. 
Sir: 

I postponed answering the letter I had the honor to receive 
from you a few days ago, in order that I might make enquiry how 
far the detention of the Ships Kensington and Iphigenia had 
taken place in consequence of any special order on the part of 
the Directors. I do not find this to have been the case, and 
therefore take the liberty of suggesting to you the propriety of 
addressing yourself to Lord Grenville on the Subject, as some of 
the most material points contained in your Letter can only, with 
regularity, be treated of through the channel of his office. 
I have the honor to be &c &c.

My Lord : 

I take the liberty to send your Lordship enclosed copies of a 
Letter that I lately wrote to Mr. Dundas and of his answer. Your 
Lordship will perceive by the Letter to Mr. Dundas my motives 
for addressing myself to him upon a subject that it seems accord- 
ing to strict form, can only be treated of with the Department in 
which your Lordship presides. 

Under these circumstances it has appeared to me adviseable to 
present the subject to your Lordship exactly in the form in which 
it was before Mr. Dundas, rather than to give to the application 
the shape of another Letter of the same purport, addressed to your 
Lordship. I flatter myself that your Lordship will agree with me 
in the Interpretation of the Stipulations of our Treaties, and I 
will only add my request of your Lordship's interference, in order 
that these Ships with their Cargoes, with as little delay as possible, 
may be discharged.

G. Cabot to R. King. 

Feby. 22d, 1799. 

My dear Sir : 

In your letter of the 19th Oct, which is this moment received, 
you express some discontent with a sentiment in one of mine to 
Gore on the affairs of South America — I cannot trace in my 
memory any of my ideas on that subject except the general one 
of an open trade which may be enjoyed by us & the English ; if 
any thing better is attainable you know my readiness to approve 
it. 

Congress will soon close its session & considering the singular 
temper with which it was addressed at the commencement I feel 
thankful that our affairs are no worse — the strange expression 
that France might at her option renew the intercourse of com- 
merce & friendship with us has caused much inquietude among 
our best men but I believe you may rely that the system of the 
last session will be pursued & that the spirit of the country is 
sustained notwithstanding this inauspicious circumstance. 

We are to be sure very much exposed to the arts of France if 
they wou'd practise them in a masterly manner but Fortune has 
often counter-balanced our blunders & I trust will not wholly 
desert us now ; — we ought to have declared war or at least author- 
ized universal Reprisals & prohibited personal Intercourse — I 
have urged the adoption of these measures, but among my mas- 
ters a majority cou'dnot be interested in its favor — so like a good 
subject I acquiesce & hope that after the lying & intriguing of one 
more anxious summer, our Govt will be able to do what its own 
dignity & the public good imperiously & plainly demand, & if the 
cursed French Republic shall then subsist I hope we shall be 
prepared to resist its arts & its arms until it sinks — this will hap- 
pen from the weight of its own vices if from nothing else. 

Altho' /have been unwilling to commit to paper the details of 
our affairs which wou'd be the most interesting to you yet I pre- 
sume you are always sufficiently informed — indeed your own re- 
flections must often be as satisfactory as positive testimony ; you 
must have discerned the cause of an apparent inconsistency in 
the sentiments of some of our greatest men — a man can hardly 
venture to palliate still less to vindicate the inconsistency of 
another without being guilty of inconsistency himself — it is unfor-

tunate that a man shou'd mistake obstinate adherence to error for 
consistency of opinions. — G. cou'd offer no apology for his stay 
but his declaration " that he believed there was sincerity " & who- 
ever repeats the apology & sanctions it is obliged to persist in 
declaring that it may be true. 

I hear nothing further of the secession of our Commrs. at Phila., 
therefore conclude the story is misunderstood & that the embar- 
rassment tho' unpleasant is not so important as was reported. 

Your sincere & faithful friend

R. King to Secretary of State. No. 27. 

London, March 1, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

It was customary for the Privy Council to grant special permis- 
sions for the Exportation of Copper in Sheets and Bolts to the 
United States upon my certificate that the Ships were American 
and the Masters Citizens. 

During the last Summer from an apprehended scarcity of Cop- 
per, I was informed that no such permission would in future be 
granted except upon my certificate that the Copper was ordered 
by and intended for the public service of the United States, and 
several orders of this sort have been executed. But permission 
having lately been refused on the application for Copper for the 
Frigate building at Charleston, South Carolina, I wrote a letter to 
Mr. Fawkner, Clerk of the Privy Council, stating the disappoint- 
ment to which we should be exposed by such refusal, especially 
with the expectations we had been authorized to entertain on this 
subject, and desiring him to renew the request for permission to 
export the requisite Copper for the Frigate building at Charles- 
ton. I annex his answer by which it appears that for the present 
we are not likely to obtain any farther supply of Copper from this 
Country. 

We are still without mails or news from the Continent. Your 
No. 35 of 15th December is the last that I have received from 
you.

Philadelphia, March 6, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

The nomination to negociate with the French Government was 

exceedingly regretted by every friend to the President and to the 

United States. I do know an exception. A committee of the 

Senate (Sedgwick, Stockton, Read, Bingham and Ross) were 

prepared to report against the nomination of Mr. Murray on the 

morning of the 25th ulto. when the President sent in his second 

Message, putting the negociation in Commission, and postponing 

its commencement until the receipt of the assurances required by 

his Message of the 21st of June last. This palliated the evil in 

the only possible way in which it could be lessened. This latter 

548 



1799] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 549 

nomination was readily approved. Mr. Ellsworth (painful as the 
acceptance will be) will not decline the Mission : there has not 
been time to ascertain Mr. Henry's mind. The only negociation 
compatible with our honor or safety is that begun by Truxton in 
the capture of L'Insurgente. 

We shall recover from the shock of Murray's nomination ; no 
preparation for war is lessened. . . . Congress have substantially 
provided for all the measures suggested in the reports of the Sec- 
retary of War and of the Navy ; and amid every untoward event, 

my motto is " Nil Desperandum." 

Yours most truly 

T. P. 

P. S. The President has just signed a Proclamation for a gen- 
eral fast, in which are these expressions : " As moreover the most 
precious interests of the United States are still held in jeopardy 
by the hostile designs and insidious arts of a foreign Nation as 
well as by the dissemination among them of those Principles sub- 
versive of the foundations of all religious, moral and social obli- 
gations, that have produced incalculable mischief and misery in 
other Countries," &c, and in the subjects of prayer to the Deity 
" that he would (make) succeed our preparations for defence and 
bless our armaments by land and by sea." 

All this you will say is not very consistent j true, but the evil of the 
nomination may thus be counteracted ; both meastires are exclusively 
the President 's own acts* . . .

London, March 9, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

I avail myself of the offer of a Passenger in the Packet to send 
you the Dispatches of Mr. Adams and Mr. Murray received by 
the last Hamburgh Mails. As fourteen or more mails arrived at 
the same time, and Mr. Murray's Letters to me do not mention 
whether his Dispatches are originals or duplicates I have no 
means of distinguishing the one from the other. Tho' we have 
the Newspapers containing Mr. Gerry's subsequent correspond- 

* Italics in cipher. 



550 RUFUS KING. [i799 

ence, and your excellent and useful Report to the President, I 
am still without any Letters from you since the middle of Decem- 
ber. This I the more regret, as we have heard of the seism of the 
Commission under the 6th Article of the English Treaty, and are 
totally ignorant of the Points of disagreement. I have carefully 
abstained from saying a word respecting the outrage of Captain 
Loring upon our Flag, preferring to wait till I should be in full 
possession of the Case. According to everything I hear, this 
Government will probably be disposed to give us satisfaction. 

Notwithstanding our great impatience on account of the inter- 
ruption of the Communication with the Continent, we seem to be 
in equal uncertainty respecting the Recommencement of the war, 
since the arrival of the mails as we were before. The same hesi- 
tation, the same jealousies and the same temporising System, from 
which so much ruin has already proceeded, continue to prevail 
at Vienna & Berlin. Mr. Grenville arrived at the latter place on 
the 17th ulto., but it is much to be feared that he came too late. 
I hope to be able to write you more particularly upon this topic 
tomorrow or the day after. I shall [put] you this year to a little 
additional Expence in order to obtain information from France ; 
and as foreign Postage is paid here, and the Dispatches of some 
of our Ministers, which pass thro' my Hands are large and heavy 
my Postage account will be proportionally increased. 

I see no evidence of an effectual change towards us or others on 
the part of France ; great and increasing numbers of our valuable 
Ships are captured and condemned by them ; I have heard of the 
release of one from Dieppe, and of one or two others suffered to 
proceed when met by their Privateers. It is confidently said that 
certain vessels under Danish, Swedish and American Flags have 
safe conducts from the French Directory : if so, we can account for 
their being permitted to pursue their voyages when met by 
Privateers. 

While writing I have received your Dispatches to the 6th of

apprehensive that B. S. & B. will be disappointed in not receiving 
Remittances as they are considerably in advance to the Spoliation

March 10, 1799. 

My dear Sir : 

You will partake of all the unpleasant sensations which have 
been excited by the nomination of a minister to the french Re- 
public* — this measure was unexpected and unknown to every 
member of the Govt, until announced to the Senate — Surprise, 
indignation, grief & disgust followed each other in quick succes- 
sion in the breasts of the true friends of our country, & a flat 
negative wou'd probably have been given by the Senate if the 
modification had not taken place which you will see in the 
enclosed paper & which mitigates the evil it cou'd not wholly 
prevent. The origin of this extraordinary proceeding is not ex- 
posed & perhaps ought not to be, but may be sought in the weak- 
nesses to which the best of men are liable — Egotism — vanity — 
wounded pride — Gerryism — distrust of men who lay too much 
stress on the public welfare as opposed to personal — implacability 
toward those who maintain that it was more important to keep 
the sceptre from the hands of a known Enemy than to place in 
the hand of any one in preference to another well tried faithful 
friend — these topics are sufficiently familiar to you & your mind 
will be driven to them for the causes of this afflicting incident : 

* In Life and Works of John Adams , vol. ix., p. 249. In the 5th Letter to 
the Boston Patriot, Mr. Adams says: "They" (the gentlemen of the Senate 
sent to confer with him on the nomination of Mr. Murray to France) * " then in- 
quired, why I had not nominated Mr. King. I answered that if Mr. King had 
been in Holland, I certainly should not have thought of any other character. 
But he was our Ambassador to England, then at war with France, and it would 
be considered by France as an insult to send them our Ambassador, who, as 
soon as he had accomplished his business was to return to England and carry 
with him all the information he might have collected in Paris. That the French 
government would suspect me of a design to send them a spy from the Court 
of St. James. That I presumed Mr. King at that time would not be pleased to 
be removed from England to France for perpetuity or permanence," &c, &c. 

1 A committee of the Senate of which Mr. Sedgwick was chairman was sent to 
endeavor to persuade Mr. Adams to withdraw the nomination of William Vans 
Murray on the 18th of February, 1799, as Minister to the French Republic. 
Mr. Adams refused to withdraw him, but on the 25th of February, 1799, he 
nominated in addition to him, two more, Messrs. Ellsworth and Patrick Henry, 
to be Envoys Extraordinary and Ministers Plenipotentiary to the Republic of 
France. 



552 RUFUS KING. [i799 

at present there is a disposition to let the subject subside, but 
it is so easy to render it mischievous that I am full of fears lest it 
shou'd be used with success to divide us anew & by combining 
many of the Federalists and half federalists with real jacobins 
form a strong majority whose power will be directed to crush 
those who have been foremost in supporting the national dignity, 
but who like Aristides are too much praised by some to be ever 
forgiven by others. The new nomination of Ellsworth & Henry 
I conceive to be a real relinquishment of the original measure ; 
but still it is pernicious to turn the mind again toward negotiation 
after it was reconciled to the true doctrine that in Resistance alone 
there is safety. 

We blunder along & Providence keeps us from falling — you 
will see some consolation in the enclosed paper which if it is the 
first you receive will be worth the postage, — in this hope I send it. 

Yours faithfully, 
G. C. 

R. King to the Count de Woronzow. 

Private. 

Great Cumberland Place, Mar. n, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

I have received answers from Philadelphia to my Letters in 
which I communicated the conversation that passed between you 
and me on the subject of a better understood and more intimate 
connection between our Countries. 

The President as well as his Ministers seem pleased with the 
suggestion, and I am persuaded will most cheerfully do what 
depends on us to fulfil so desireable an object. 

Nothing was accurately determined when the Packet sailed : 
should the President be desirous that the Negotiation should 
take place in London, he will most probably confide it to me,* 

* Pickering to Hamilton ( Works of Hamilton, vol. vi., p. 398), Feby. 25, 

1799. 

" . . . We have all been shocked and grieved at the nomination of a min- 
ister to negotiate with France. There is but one sentiment on the subject 
among the friends of their country and the real supporters of the President's 
administration. Pains have been taken to ameliorate the measure by throwing 
it into a commission. But the President is fixed. The Senate must approve 
or negative the nomination. In the latter event perhaps he will nominate com- 
missioners. I beg you to be assured, that it is wholly his own act, without any 
participation or communication with any of us. It is utterly inconsistent with 



1799] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 553 

and I will not say how truly gratified I should be to cooperate 
with you, in a work that I flatter myself would not only be dura- 
ble, but mutually advantageous to our respective Countries. 

I know that the idea of negotiating the Treaty in a third place, 
proceeds from considerations entirely compatible with the most 
perfect respect for his Imperial Majesty ; and should the plan of 
conducting the negotiation here be finally adopted by the Presi- 
dent, I shall feel myself anxious until I learn that it will likewise 
be agreeable to the Emperor. 

Though I have no information of any decision of the President 
upon this Subject, I have thought it due to the frankness and 
friendship, that I have always received from you, to send you 
this private Note, and I beg you to be assured of the very great 
esteem and respect with which I have the honor to be 

Your obt. and faithful Servt., 

Rufus King. 

R. King to Lord Grenville. 

London, March 11, 1799. 

The Undersigned, Minister Plenipotentiary has received the 
order of the President of the United States * to transmit to Lord 
Grenville in order that the same may be laid before His Britannic 

his late nominations of Mr. King to negotiate a commercial treaty with Russia, 
and of Mr. Smith to negotiate a like treaty with the Porte. Both these objects 
will now be defeated. . . ." 

* J. Adams to T. Pickering, Secretary of State. 

Quincy, June 7th, 1799. 
Sir: 

I return you all the letters of Mr. King and Mr. Humphreys, which were 
inclosed with your letter of May 30th. Encourage Mr. King, I pray you, in 
your letters and instructions to him, to persevere, with all the decision which 
may be consistent with decency and politeness, in denying the right of British 
men of war to take from our ships of war any men whatever, and from our mer- 
chant vessels any Americans or foreigners, or even Englishmen. There is no 
principle under heaven by which they can justify taking by force, even from 
an American Merchant Vessel, even a deserter from their army and navy, much 
less private seamen. If they have a right, we have the same. I know not 
whether the exercise of it would not be most useful to us. Their merchant 
ships are more numerous than ours, and they have more foreigners, Swedes, 
Italians, Portuguese, Spaniards, Danes, Dutch, &c. , than we have. If our 
men of war had a right to take them, we might easily man our navy ; but the 
thing has no principle. 



554 RUFUS KING. [l799 



Majesty, the annexed Pieces, which contain the Reply made by 
the American Consul at the Havannah, of the outrage or insult 
upon the American Flag and Nation, committed by the Com- 
mander of his Majesty's ship of war, the Carnatic. 

According to this Report which has been fully confirmed by 
that of the Commander of the American ship of war, the Carnatic, 
commanded by John Loring Esquire, in company with two other 
British ships of the Line and two Frigates, on the morning of the 
seventeenth of November, on the high seas, fell in with a number 
of American Merchant Ships under the orders and protection of 
the Baltimore, a twenty Gun Ship of war belonging to and bear- 
ing the Flag of the United States and bound to the Port of 
Havannah. 

After it was ascertained that the Baltimore was an American 
National Ship of War, Captain Loring required of her Comman- 
der to surrender to him such of her Crew as did not possess Cer- 
tificates of American Citizenship ; and on this being refused by 
the means of his superior force took out of the said Ship Balti- 
more fifty five of her crew and carried them on board the Carna- 
tic. Fifty of these seamen were afterwards returned to the 
Baltimore, but the other five were detained and carried away by 
the said Captain Loring, who not content with this act of violence, 
added to it the indignity of a demand of the wages alleged to be 
due to these seamen. 

The undersigned is persuaded that it cannot be necessary to 
employ much time in showing the injustice and insolence of this 
unparalleled proceeding. No Nation holds higher the honor of 
its Flag than England ; none cherishes more assiduously the 
Rights of its Navy ; none therefore is more capable to appreciate 
the insult that has been received or the satisfaction that ought to 
be given. 

The Undersigned notwithstanding thinks himself obliged to 
remark that had the whole crew of the Baltimore been composed 
of British Subjects, the reverse whereof was the fact, they were in 
the public service of the United States, by voluntary engagement, 
a reason constantly assigned and received for the refusal to dis- 
charge American Citizens serving in his Majesty's Navy, tho' 
such discharge is demanded by respectable and authorized agents 
of the American Government. 



1799] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 555 

Besides no principle of maritime law is more clear, no national 
Right more perfect, than those which mutually secure to the 
ships of war of friendly Nations, sailing upon the main ocean, an 
exemption from search and detention, and for still stronger 
Reasons from such acts of violence as were committed on the 
present occasion ; if the conduct of the Commander of the Car- 
natic can be justified, the like conduct of an American Ship of 
war must be lawful ; it is needless to suggest the consequences. 

The undersigned entertains too high a respect for the equity 
and justice of his Majesty to believe for a moment that a proceed- 
ing so overbearing and offensive toward a nation with which his 
Majesty lives on terms of harmony and friendship, can be seen 
with any other than sentiments of displeasure, & of marked dis- 
approbation. He therefore entertains no doubt of an early com- 
pliance with the demand of the President of the United States, 
that orders be given for the exemplary punishment of the said 
John Loring, Commander of the Carnatic, and for the immediate 
return of the men taken from the Baltimore and detained on the 
Carnatic. 

The undersigned feels great satisfaction in adding that this is 
the only instance of irregularity on the part of his Majesty's naval 
officers towards those of the United States, and he flatters him- 
self that his Majesty's prompt and public animadversion upon 
that first delinquency will not only prevent a repetition thereof, 
but moreover operate to strengthen and to preserve the mutual 
good will and Harmony that so happily subsist between the two 

countries.* 

Rufus King. 

R. King to Lord Grenville. 

Great Cumberland Place, March 12, 1799. 

Mr. King presents his compliments to Lord Grenville, and 

takes the liberty to inform his Lordship that a sealed packet 

addressed to Mr. King in his public character, of the contents or 

importance of which he is entirely ignorant, has lately been 

brought into the Registry of the Court of Admiralty, by the 

King's Proctor, where it is still detained. 

* The documents which accompany this note contain the details respecting 
the outrage. 



556 RUFUS KING. [1799 

That this packet, if found on board a ship, detained for adju- 
dication, should have been sent with other Papers to the Admi- 
ralty is not very extraordinary, but that an officer of that Court 
should think it his duty to detain it, is not altogether reconcile- 
able with what seems due to the Minister of a friendly Nation 
accredited to and residing near his Majesty. 

Mr. King feels himself obliged to complain of this indecorum 
(which is by no means mitigated by the circumstance of its pro- 
ceeding from a quarter where the Laws of Nations are presumed 
to be professionally understood and discussed) and the more so 
as according to his information it is but a few weeks since by 
the direction of an officer of the same Court, a public Dispatch 
from the Minister of the U. S. at Paris to the American Secretary 
of State, after having been intercepted and long detained, was 
printed and appeared among the Papers exhibited as Proofs in a 
prize cause before the Lords of Appeal. 

Mr. King will not permit himself to doubt that on the recep- 
tion of this Complaint Lord Grenville will take immediate meas- 
ures for the delivery of the Packet now detained and for the 
correction of a Practice so derogatory from the Rights of 
Embassy. 

T. Pickering to R. King. 

" Department of State, March 12, 1799. 
" Dear Sir : " 

Mr. P. acknowledges the receipt of R. K.'s " letters 1 1 
and 12, dated Dec. 7 and 11. Their arrival was fortunate, 
as Dr. Edward Stevens, appointed our Consul-General for 
St. Domingo, is on the point of departing for that Island." 

He incloses several papers to Mr. K., among others his 
Instructions to Dr. Stevens, and says : 

" We expect that Toussaint will put an end to the depredations 
on our Commerce and thereby enable the President to open the 
trade with that Island. I hope Col. Grant, who is going thither 
from Great Britain is a discreet person, and that both his disposi- 
tion and Instructions will induce him to cultivate a good under- 
standing with Dr. Stevens. . . ."

T. Pickering to R. King. 

Private and Confidential. In Cipher. 

Philadelphia, March 12, 1799. 

My public letter of this date will inform you of the Proceedings 
of our Government respecting St. Domingo. We meddle not 

with the politics of the Island. T 1 will pursue what he 

deems the interest of himself and his countrymen ; he will prob- 
ably declare the Island independent. It is probable that he 
wished to assure himself of our commerce as the necessary means 
of obtaining it. Neither moral nor political reasons could induce 
us to discourage him ; on the contrary both would warrant us in 
urging him to the Declaration. Yet we shall not do it. We go 
no further than the Act of Congress directs. We shall never re- 
ceive from the French Republic indemnification for the injuries 
she has done us. The commerce of St. Domingo presents the 
only means of compensation, and this I have no doubt we shall 
obtain. We fear no rivals. Toussaint respects the British ; he 
is attached to us ; he knows our position, but a few days' sail 
from St. Domingo, and the promptitude with which we can sup- 
ply his wants. He cannot form a black (Colony) ; the blacks 
are too ignorant. The Government must be military during the 
present war, and perhaps for a much longer period. The com- 
merce of the United States and of other nations (for you will ob- 
serve we aim at no exclusive privileges) will amply supply all 
their wants, and take off all their produce. So that there will 
not, and ought not to be, any inducements to withdraw the Blacks 
from the cultivation of the Island to navigation ; and confined 
to their own Island they will not be dangerous neighbours. 
Nothing is more clear than, if left to themselves, that the Blacks 
of St. Domingo will be incomparably less dangerous than if they 
remain the subjects of France ; she could then form with them 
military corps of such strength in a future war, as no European 
or other white force could resist. France with an army of those 
black troops might conquer all the British Isles and put in jeop- 
ardy our Southern States. Of this the Southern Members were 
convinced, and therefore cordially concurred in the policy of the 
Independence of St. D., if T 1 and his followers will it. Mr. 



558 RUFUS KING. [i799 



Read was the only exception to this opinion, and his opinions 
are sometimes unaccountable. Mr. Liston appears to be also 
equally convinced of the policy of that independence, as it would 
respect the British Isles. For as he observes, the radical evil is 
already done, and becomes irremediable, in France making the 

Blacks free. T 1 will command 50 or 60,000 Black troops, if 

necessary ; they are jealous of France, that she intends, if possi- 
ble, to bring them back to their former slavery. This jealousy is 
incurable. We, therefore, confidently reckon on the Indepen- 
dence of St. Domingo. Rigaud is a subordinate chief, and a 
Mulatto. This race in the Island are but a handful, not above 
one eighth of the population of the Blacks, and must be crushed 
if they resist the will of T 1. 

It has been impossible yet to make out your instructions to 
negotiate with Russia, or those of Mr. Smith for the Porte. They 
will be further retarded by the Insurrection in Northampton 
County in Pennsylvania. Some people, generally very ignorant, 
have resisted the Commissioners and Assessors of the Direct tax. 
The inclosed Proclamation gives the facts. A military force will 
in a few days march to apprehend the Principals. It is fortu- 
nate, seeing some opposition has been threatened, that it hap- 
pened so near the seat of Government, and where the deluded 
creatures will be so easily subdued. They are Germans and the 
most ignorant in the State. 

In the midst of the great Executive business arising out of the 
late Session, and with an Insurrection begun, the President has 
left the Seat of Government. Yesterday he started for Quincy 
where I expect he will remain these eight months ! Of one 
thing, however, I am happy to inform you — before his departure 
after a serious consultation with all of us, it was concluded unani- 
mously that certain terms should be demanded of France, with- 
out which no Treaty should be made. These terms are what we 
have a clear right to, and our interest and honor oblige us to in- 
sist on. Yet I very much doubt whether France will yield them. 
I am morally sure she will not ; and this has put us all much at 
our ease.

R. King to Secretary of State. No. 28. 

London, March 14, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

Immediately on the receit of your numbers 37 & 40, I pre- 
pared and sent a Memorial to Lord Grenville on the subject of the 
Outrage committed upon our Flag by Capt. Loring ; annexed you 
have copies of this Memorial * and of the answer that I have 
received. 

In a Conference that I have since had with his Lordship on the 
subject of the embarrassment of our Trade from the want of pre- 
cision in the Clause of our Treaty that enumerates the articles of 
Contraband, I adverted to the affair of Capt. Loring, and ex- 
pressed my hope that his Conduct would be animadverted upon 
in a manner that should correspond with the aggravation of the 
offence, and the friendly disposition of our two Countries. 

His Lordship after mentioning the old affair of the Nautilus 
and another of a later date of which I had seen no particular 
account, added that justice required that they should receive 
Captain Loring's Report, to obtain which measures would be 
immediately taken ; but that he would not conceal from me that 
the Publication of the Instruction of our Secretary of the Marine 
to the Commanders of our Ships of war, placed our demand 
respecting Captain Loring in a situation somewhat different from 
what it would have stood, had not that Instruction been published ; 
that they owed and would do justice to all Nations, but the man- 
ner of doing it would naturally vary according to the circumstan- 
ces attending the demand of it, and that what might be proper in 
this respect, when satisfaction was required in the ordinary man- 
ner by a friendly Nation, must appear humiliating if granted under 
circumstances of menace. 

This remark led to a conversation of which I shall send you a 
Report when I give an account of what passed on the Subject of 
the Article respecting Contraband. 

With perfect Respect and Esteem &c. &c. 

Rufus King. 

P.S. Lord Grenville's answer is not yet, as I supposed, reed.

560 RUFUS KING. [1799 

R. King to Secretary of State. No. 29. 

London, March 15, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

Contraband of War. 

In the Conference with Lord Grenville mentioned in my last, I 
stated to his Lordship the great embarrassments and losses of our 
Navigation arising from the seizure and detention of our vessels, 
having on board Nails and oznaburgs, for the Spanish Colonies, 
and intimated that I was authorized to arrange with him an 
additional Article to our Treaty, by which the Articles of Con- 
traband should be more precisely denned, or to concur in such 
other effectual measure as would secure our trade from the 
injury to which it is exposed from the want of a more precise 
enumeration of the articles agreed to be Contraband. His Lord- 
ship replied that it would be necessary for him to institute an 
Enquiry on this head and desired that for such purpose I would 
send him a Note of the articles supposed by us to be erroneously 

included in the Catalogue of Contraband ; at the same 

time, that they should find it important to insist upon the compre- 
hension of whatever was essential to Ship Building, they should 
have no wish to include articles not fairly of that character. We 
conversed upon the manner of forming a new article, should it be 
found necessary : I promised to send the Note his Lordship had 
requested, and the subject was postponed. 

Impressing of Seamen. 

I then mentioned our dissatisfaction with the continuation of 
the practice of taking out of our Ships, met on the main Ocean, 
such of their crews as did not possess Certificates of American 
citizenship ; denying, as I had often done in former Conferences 
upon the Subject, any right on the part of Great Britain upon 
which this practice could be founded ; and suggesting that our 
Ships of war by permission of our Government might with equal 
right pursue the same practice towards their Merchantmen. 

That not only Seamen who spoke the English Language and 
who were evidently English or American Subjects, but also all 
Danish, Swedish, and other foreign Seamen, who could not receive 
American Protections, were indiscriminately taken from their vol- 



1799] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 56 1 

untary service in our Neutral Employ and forced into the war in 
the Naval Service of Great Britain. 

That on this subject we had again and again offered to concur 
in a Convention which we thought practicable to be formed, and 
which should settle these Questions in a manner that would be 
safe for England and satisfactory to us. 

That to decline such Convention, and to persist in a practice 
which we were persuaded could not be vindicated, especially to 
the extent to which it was carried, seemed less equitable and 
moderate than we thought we had a right to expect. 

Lord Grenville stated no precise principle upon which he sup- 
posed the practice could be justified, and the conversation upon 
this point, like many others on the same Subject, ended without 
a prospect of satisfaction. The French and Spaniards and every 
other Nation might pursue the same conduct as rightfully as Great 
Britain does. With respect to foreign Seamen in our Employ, this 
Government has, if I recollect, yielded the point ; but their officers 
continue the practice. We are assured that all Americans shall 
be discharged on application for that purpose, and that Orders to 
this effect have been given to their Naval Commanders : but this 
is far short of satisfaction — indeed to acquiesce in this is to give 
up the right. 

Copt. Loring. 

Recurring to the affair of Capt. Loring, and to the observation 
of his Lordship respecting it at the beginning of our Conference, 
I remarked that the instruction to which he had alluded was in 
itself proper, that it enjoins no more than what we had each the 
right to do, and what I presumed every British Naval Officer 
would think it his duty to do ; that the affair of Capt. Loring had 
called for it, and as the Service was new, it was of consequence to 
our Officers to be informed of their Duty in this, as in other 
important and delicate points. 

Its publication had not taken place by order of the Government, 
but being sent with other Papers to the House of Representatives 
in compliance with the request, it had in this manner come before 
the public. 

That with respect to what his Lordship had said concerning 

VOL. II. — 36 



562 RUFUS KING. [l799 

the Case of the Nautilus and another of a later date, with which 
I was not particularly acquainted, but which I understood to have 
happened within our Territory, I could not admit that the Cases 
were parallel. Besides in respect to the affair of the Nautilus, 
his Lordship would recollect the answer that was given to our 
complaint of the contemporaneous conduct of Capt. Home ; if 
one, so the other should be put out of view ; and that I could not 
believe, were the cases the same, that it would be thought a wise 
Policy to propose to balance one complaint against another. His 
Lordship interrupted me by saying, that nothing could be more 
remote from his intention ; but that he did not see the connec- 
tion of the Cases, and Mr. Liston had very properly, on this 
occasion, reminded you of their Proposal to form an Article for 
the surrender of Deserters. 

I continued by observing that my own opinion had been to 
defer the Article respecting Deserters, until we could agree in one 
concerning the Seamen employed in their and our Service, and 
that most probably in both the cases to which he alluded, it 
was for want of such agreement that they had found occasion of 
complaint. 

That with regard to the Cases mentioned by his Lordship and 
that of the Baltimore there was this difference : the jurisdiction 
in the one was exclusive, and in the others divided : that a 
National Ship sailing on the ocean carried with her and is covered 
by the jurisdiction of her Nation ; but when she enters the Ports 
and Territories of a foreign friendly Nation, she loses a portion 
of that entire Dominion and retains only so much thereof, and 
no more than is necessary to maintain her Discipline and interior 
Police. To that extent, and no greater is the Nation where she 
enters supposed to yield her a portion of its Jurisdiction, retain- 
ing the residue. 

That this Rule would apply to foreign armies passing thro' the 
Territories of a Friendly Power, and that I presumed that numer- 
ous precedents would be found to this Effect. His Lordship 
concluded by saying that he had ordered a Search to be made 
into the usage of European Nations in respect to men of war, 
which resort to and make use of the Ports of friendly foreign 
Powers ; that his belief was that it would be found that the Com- 
mander's word must be taken whether there were any Persons of 



1799] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 563 

the Nation, whose Territories we had entered, among the Crew 
and that no examination was permitted. 

The next day, at the Queen's drawing room, the first Lord of 
the Admiralty, Lord Spencer, in a very obliging manner expressed 
to me his regret at hearing that they were likely to receive from 
me a complaint against one of their officers. I said what I 
thought suitable to the friendly manner in which his Lordship 
expressed himself, and then observed that I had sent a memorial 
to my Lord Grenville complaining of the conduct of Cap. Loring. 
He replied that it had not yet reached the Admiralty. I then 
intimated to his Lordship what had passed between me and Lord 
Grenville and expressed a hope that the circumstance of the 
publication alluded to by Lord Grenville would not be seen in a 
light never intended, and that no past circumstance would be 
allowed to embarass our attainment of satisfaction in this very 
extraordinary Case. His Lordship's reply was liberal and friendly, 
but sufficiently guarded. 

Case of the Ship Aurora. 

Mr. King remarks that he had not yet had leisure to examine 
it. 

Insurance Cases. 

To my memorial on this Subject, and it is one of considerable 
importance, I sometime since received a note from Lord Gren- 
ville, inclosing the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown, which 
states that the Questions could only be decided in the competent 
Tribunals, and that the executive Power could not influence the 
Decisions, and that it was not usual for Parliament to interfere 
to alter the Rights of Individuals in respect to their contracts. 
To this Note I immediately replied, in order to show that the 
opinion of the Crown Lawyers might be perfectly correct, and 
still nothing to the purpose, as we did not request the interfer- 
ence of Parliament to alter the Rights of Individuals in respect 
to their Contracts, but for the purpose of protecting such rights 
and to prevent their being altered by a proceeding subsequent to 
and without the Contracts, and which against justice it was pro- 
posed to make use of to defeat them. I have received no further 



564 RUFUS KING. [i799 

answer, nor do I know that I shall ; tho' I hear that the Lord 
Chancellor entertains an opinion favorable to our Case — a cir- 
cumstance of importance should it go before the House of 
Lords. 

6th Article of the Treaty. 

Mr. Liston has sent no account of the interruption of the Com- 
mission under the 6th Article of the Treaty, and I am not with- 
out hopes that the business may be arranged without being 
sent here. We have had our share and a great deal of 
trouble in getting along with the Commissioners under the 7th 
Article, which still promises a satisfactory issue, and I shall be 
sorry to have anything to do with the 6th Article. You will not 
from thence infer that I think we should submit to the interpre- 
tation of that article intimated in your No. 42. So far from its 
being my opinion, I would sooner relinquish the benefits of the 
7th Article than acquiesce in an interpretation of the 6th, so 
grossly abusive. We must proceed with Temper and take care 
that we are right, and as to the consequences, let them take their 
course. 

High Court of Admiralty. 

Since the appointment of Sir William Scott in this Court, the 
business proceeds with great dispatch, tho' I hear that Sir Wil- 
liam's decisions manifest an extension instead of a greater limi- 
tation of the Rights of Belligerents in respect to Neutrals. 

In a number of recent condemnations that have taken place 
for Breach of Blockade, the Judge has laid it down as incontro- 
vertible Law, that a Blockade is a legal interdiction of all Trade 
inwards and outwards of the Place blockaded. That all vessels 
with their Cargoes seized in the attempt to enter, after Notice, 
and all vessels with their Cargoes seized coming out, provided 
such Cargoes were laden after notice, are liable to condemnation ; 
and that all vessels entering during the Blockade and seized when 
coming out, are also liable to condemnation, the penalty of con- 
fiscation attaching itself to all Vessels which break the Blockade. 

I am also informed that the Judge has intimated an opinion 
that seems strong and vigorous in respect to neutral vessels, which 
with a view to the French Decrees and Regulations possess Cer- 



1799] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 565 

tificates issued by French Consuls resident in neutral Countries, 
purporting that the Cargoes of such vessels are not of the growth 
or fabric of the British dominions. 

That the possession of such Certificates may evince an unbe- 
coming submission to the injustice of France, and one too not 
particularly friendly to Great Britain, may be true, but that they 
incur the forfeiture of the ship or cargo, is an opinion that cannot 
be made out or maintained by those Laws which alone ought to 
influence the Decisions of Prize Courts ; and if persisted in will 
tend to prove what has so often been alleged that the Judges of 
these Courts too frequently make the Law, instead of expound- 
ing it. 

I don't hear that Sir William Scott has yet given an opinion 
upon the Question of a Trade carried on by a neutral between 
the French and Dutch Colonies, and their respective Mother 
Countries, nor has the Court of Appeals, tho' pressed to it, yet 
decided that question. 

Arms. 

I am rejoiced to learn from your last Dispatches, that we have 
a fair prospect of manufacturing at home Muskets as well as 
Cannon to any extent that our affairs may require. If this hap- 
pens a real and most important Benefit will have arisen out of 
the difficulties which have prevented our obtaining arms from 
abroad : for no Nation is really independent that does not make 
at home every sort of arms and Military Stores. I observe that 
money is appropriated for the establishment of National Foun- 
deries. Considering the numerous Founderies in different parts 
of our Country, would it not have been far more ceconomical and 
better to have collected the requisite information for the use of 
these Founderies, and to have employed them to cast our Cannon, 
giving liberal prices till the business was well understood and 
established ? The practice of this Country on this point as well 
as that of the Fabrication of small arms, is in favor of this policy. 
Founders perfectly acquainted with the business may easily be 
obtained. 

As in some measure connected with this subject, I annex the 
copy of a Letter from Count Rumford to me, and referring 
to a private Letter from me to you for my sentiments respecting 



566 RUFUS KING. [l799 

the Count, I shall await your reply to enable me to send him an 
answer to this Letter. 

Copper. 

I understand that it is in contemplation to take off the Duty 
on the importation of foreign Copper ; what Effect that, when 
added to the discontinuance of the Copper Coinage, may have in 
respect to the permission to export Copper in Sheets and Bolts, 
I can't at present decide. The English mines yield annually 
about seven thousand tons of Copper ; those of Sweden, which 
next to those of England are I believe the most considerable in 
Europe, do not yield more than one thousand tons. The famous 
Anglesey mines fail, but from the high price of Copper the old 
and deserted Cornish mines are now worked ; so that there is 
reason to expect the quantity annually produced in England, will 
be as great as before the failure of the mines of Anglesey. I 

don't find that Copper is anywhere so well or at all in Sweden 

or Denmark. 

Maryland Bank Stock. 

I can only repeat what I have again and again been obliged to 
write on this Subject. I from time to time flatter myself with the 
belief that I am near the attainment of my object, when new and 
trifling Difficulties spring up and defeat my expectations. The 
Chancellor is now, and for some weeks past has been, so unwell 
as to decline Business ; when he re-engages in the affairs of his 
office, I shall renew my Efforts. I still hope, but dare not, after 
so many disappointments, promise ultimate success. 

Laws against Neutrals. 

By this opportunity I send you a copy of the Message of the 
Directory to the Councils on the subject of Privateering. The 
Report upon this Message has not yet been made, or if it has I 
have not yet seen it. The discussion still continues in the Coun- 
cil concerning the time when the Law respecting neutral Vessels 
having on board Goods of the growth or fabric of England shall 
be deemed to have commenced its operation. 

The Council of 500 resolved that it should operate from the 



1799] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 567 

day of its Publication in the Bulletin. The Debates before the 
Ancients, instead of confining themselves to the Question, turn 
chiefly upon the Policy of the Law itself, and judging from the 
Members who condemn the Law, one would be inclined to be- 
lieve that it would be repealed. The Message of the Directory 
holds a language more moderate, as well as more artful, than 
formerly concerning the Trade of neutrals ; but it is supposed 
that the Council of five hundred has too direct and considerable 
an interest in the Laws, as well as in the mode of Trial that now 
prevails, to consent to alter the one or the other. 
With perfect Respect & Esteem &c &c

Count Rumford to R. King. 

Copy. 

Brompton Row, 13 March, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

I send you herewith a small Pamphlet which will explain to 
you the causes which have rendered it impossible for me to go to 
America this Spring, as I had intended. I have not however 
given over the idea of visiting that Country, at some future 
period ; very far from it. I really hope and expect to be able to 
go there next Spring, and will most certainly do so if it should be 
possible, provided you should continue to advise it and encourage 
me with a hope of a kind reception. 

I beg you would do me the honor to present one of the inclosed 
Pamphlets to his Excellency the President of the United States, 
and accompany it with my best respects and most cordial 
wishes for his health and happiness and future prosperity of the 
United States. 

The model of a Field Piece on a new and, I believe, on an im- 
proved construction which I have destined as a Present to the 
United States I shall pack up and send to you in order to its be- 
ing shipped to America as soon as I shall get it from his Royal 
Highness, the Duke of York, who has desired to have a copy of it. 

You will recollect that in a conversation we had at your house, 
on the great importance to the United States of the Speedy Es- 
tablishment of a Military School or Academy, I took the liberty to 



568 RUFUS KING. [l799 



say that to assist in the Establishment of so useful an Institution, 
I should be happy to be permitted to make a present to the 
Academy of my Collection of Military Books, Plans, Drawings 
and Models. I now repeat this offer and with a request to you that 
you would make it known to the Executive Government of the 
United States, and that you would let me know as soon as may 
be convenient whether this offer will be accepted. 

I have the honor to be with the most sincere regard & Esteem 
&c &c 

RlJMFORD. 

R. King to the Secretary of State. No. 30. 

London, March 16. 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

I am somewhat fearful that we are a little premature in naming 
a Commissioner to negotiate a Commercial Treaty with Russia* in- 
asmuch as we are not yet ascertained of the sentiments of the 
Russian Cabinet, either in respect to the Negotiation or the Place 
of conducting it ; everything that has passed on that Subject 
having been a personal Conversation between me and the Russian 
Envoy at this Court. 

I have lately written him a private Note intimating that I had 
received answers to my Letters, in which I communicated to you 
our Conversation, and tho' nothing was decided, that I had some 
reason to believe that the proposed Negotiation would be agreeable 
to the President, and that if it should be carried on here, it was 
quite probable that the President would commit it to my Hands. 

He answered that he was pleased with the information and 
that he would immediately write to his Court upon the subject, 
stating what he said as proceeding from our personal Conversations, 
and that he hoped a Treaty might be concluded and that we might 
respectively keep Ministers at Peter sburgh and Philadelphia. 

I learn that the Governor General of Canada is to be changed, 
and that Admiral Vaudeport is to be succeeded. Neither of 
the Successors in these commands are yet chosen. I expressed 
to Lord Spencer my hope that the Admiral would be a man of 
prudence and of a temper calculated to preserve harmony and 
good will between us, and he assured me that he thought the ap- 

* Italics in cipher. 



1799] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 569 

pointment an important one. I shall take an early occasion to 
speak with Mr. Dundas respecting the character of the Governor 
General of Canada. 

Simcoe* should, and I presume will, not be the man ; tho' he 
throws the blame off from himself respecting the Proceedings of 
1793, still his opinions about America disqualify him for that 
Command. 

We are impatient for the expected Letters from Hamburgh, as 
the affairs of the Continent are at a crisis. The last mail which 
left Cuxhaven on the nth brings an account not altogether au- 
thentic, tho' much credited, that the Directory had declared war 
against Austria, and that the French army had actually crossed 
the Rhine at Kehls. Mr. Grenville in a private Letter from Berlin 
to his brother, says tho' he cannot send the intelligence officially, 
that it is generally believed at Berlin. Great hopes have been 
entertained that Prussia could be induced to combine with Eng- 
land and Russia; but if Austria is engaged, such is the jealousy 
between her and Prussia, that the latter will probably remain 
Neutral. 

It is a day or two ago that I was told by one who had it from 
the Duke of Clarence that among other projects to be produced by 
Mr. Grenville at Berlin was one to be executed by England and 
Russia to cut off all the Trade of Neutral Nations with France and 
her Dominions. A report of the same sort, with the addition 
that the United States are to join England and Russia for this pur- 
pose is in circulation among a lower Rank in society. I don't 
know the degree of credit due to the whisper ; but Rumours of 
this sort are not frequently destitute of all Foundation. 

Towards the last of January La Fayette went into Holland ; I 
have not heard of his return ; he could not go there except by 
permission, and nothing is done in Holland, repugnant to the 
views of the French. Some foreign Journals say he has returned 
to France, where his wife has been for some months past, and 
conjectures of various kinds are made in consequence of this in- 
formation. Some assert that he has made his Peace by his 
American Popularity, and that he will be sent Minister to Phila- 
delphia to heal the differences between the two Countries, and to 
prepare the way for the next Presidential Election ; but this is 
* See letter to R. King May I, 1800, by J. G. Simcoe. — Ed. 



570 RUFUS KING. [i799 

all so much an affair of conjecture that I relate it merely as such. 
The present Directory, or at least a majority of them, have 
within eighteen months spoken in the harshest manner of La 
Fayette, and were they or their Government to be interpreted in 
the way we construe others, we should not for a moment lend an 
Ear to such a tale. 

The apprehension of another attempt of the French upon Ire- 
land gains strength, and the internal disorder of that country is 
such as leaves little doubt that the United Irishmen are again 
preparing for the reception of the French. A new Directory is 
supposed to exist, which regulates the motions of the disaffected, 
tho' in a manner so secret as to elude detection. Martial Law is 
again authorized by the Irish Parliament and the most vigorous 
measures employed for the Safety of the Kingdom. 

I will obtain the names of the Irish State Prisoners whose 
Pestilential Flight to the United States was fortunately arrested. 
They amount to Ninety, and a list of their names is easily 
procured. 

I omitted at the time to inform you that at the particular desire 
of Lord Cornwallis, communicated to me through the Duke of 
Portland, I consented that one of these State Prisoners, by the 
name of Lynch, brother to a merchant of the same name in New 
York, should be permitted to go to New York, for which place 
he sailed some months since. He was represented to me as of 
inferior consequence as a Conspirator, and by no means likely to 
be mischievous among us. It is proper that you should know 
the fact, that he may be identified and remembered. 

With perfect Respect and Esteem &c. &c. 

Rufus King. 

Joseph Hale to R. King. 

Boston, March 16, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

Before this comes to hand, you will probably be advised of the 
nomination of our Minister at The Hague as Minister Plenipo. to 
the French Republic ; of the surprise & agitation thereby pro- 
duced among all good men ; of its being specially committed by 
the Senate ; of a large majority therein resolved upon a negative ; 
& of the subsequent modification of this extraordinary measure 
by adding Mr. Ellsworth & Patrick Henry, making of the three 



1799] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 57 1 

a joint commission & restricting the departure of the two latter 
until suitable assurances are received from the Greal Nation. 

You will perhaps have been informed that the gun act embra- 
cing a right to recapture foreign vessels, prizes to the French, was 
lost by this executive measure ; that however the Federal tone 
was at length so far restored as to produce the adoption of the re- 
port on the Sedition & Alien acts, & of three accompanying resolves 
imparting the inexpediency of repealing those acts & any of the 
acts relating to the military, naval, or fiscal arrangements ; that 
the act for raising 24 instead of 12 Regiments was passed ; also 
that for encreasing the salaries of the heads of departments & that 
to empower the President to retaliate should the French decree 
be put in execution. 

I now take the liberty to inclose via Dublin, the President's 
proclamation for a Fast to prove to foreigners that our Execu- 
tive has not & does not mean to abandon the system of defence 
against France by any mean compliances. It may not be im- 
proper to add that the nomination of Mr. Murray is said to have 
been made with a view to outmanoeuvre the arch Talleyrand & 
by no means intended as an overture at conciliation ; or to hold 
up the prospect of peace. It has more than once happened that 
weakness of intellect is reconcileable with soundness of intention. 
— The bad tendency of the measure will it is presumed produce 
no very serious effects in the interior. The influence abroad is 
very justly deprecated. With a blockhead at St. James to repre- 
sent our Country our fears would be inexpressible. Even a man 
of the best talents will find employment for them all on this oc- 
casion. Yet the measure candidly viewed ought not to lessen the 
friendship or excite the jealousies of the British Cabinet. Their 
most solid interests unquestionably dictate a liberality & candour 
particularly in this instance. 

Your most obed. servt. 

Joseph Hale. 

R. King to R. Troup. 

London, Mar. 16, 1799. 
My dear Sir : 

If practicable I will procure for you some information respect- 
ing the Process, &c,of the Prize Court of this Country. There is 
no book extant that gives any satisfaction upon this Subject. The 



572 RUFUS KING. [l799 

present judge of the H. C. of Admty. is a man of uncommon 
abilities ; I don't recollect much of his Predecessors, but I am 
inclined to think him the ablest Judge that has presided in that 
Court. His Predecessors can have no reason on earth, as Lord 
Kenyon says, to complain of this opinion. You must not infer 
from hence that Sr. Wm. Scott does not condemn neutral Ships 
and Cargoes, for I am quite apprehensive that he will in this as in 
most other respects hold the same distinguished Pre-eminence 
over his Predecessors. I have taken some pains to enquire of 
those who ought to understand the mode of proceeding in the 
Prize Court, but my enquiries have been made to little purpose ; 
for here as in all other Cases of Knowledge passing by Tradition, 
the reports of the initiated are not only imperfect but various. 

The College of Doctors, who alone are counsellers or Speakers 
in this Court, does not consist of more than twenty members, who 
perpetuate themselves by the admission of new Brothers. These 
are persons educated at one of the Universities, where they must 
have resided Eleven years before they could have received the 
Degrees which form the indispensable qualification for an admis- 
sion into the College of Doctors Commons, where they rarely 
arrive before they have attained thirty years of age. Give us good 
Lord peace in our Days, is not one of the prayers of this Brother- 
hood. It does not appear that the laborious acquisition of what 
has been written in poetry and prose, in English, French & Latin 
upon the Law of Nations is of much consequence or necessary 
to become a Doctor. Indeed Genet is not the only one who 
despises those worm-eaten authors. I shall have a great deal to 
tell you & Hamilton & Harrison and others, that you will think 
passing strange ! Between ourselves I have seen much less reason 
to discredit our own Courts, and lawyers, and learning and blind 
Justice, as well as somewhat less to admire those of foreign Lands 
than my simplicity had lead me to think I should ! ! 

We hear and at present believe that the directory has declared 
war agt. Austria. Ireland is again in a dreadful condition & 
in daily apprehension of another attempt at invasion from 
France. . . .

R. King to Colonel Pickering. 

Personal and Private. 

London, March 16, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

It would have been quite agreeable to me to have received 
your son as my Secretary, had Mr. Dandridge chosen to have ac- 
cepted of his late Military appointment ; I took occasion imme- 
diately on the receit of your friendly Letter on this subject to 
speak to Mr. Dandridge respecting his appointment in the army 
and to say that in case he thought of returning to America, I 
should be inclined to receive your Son as his successor ; observ- 
ing to him at the same time that I had reason to be satisfied with 
him, his staying with me, or returning would be left entirely to his 
choice. 

He told me that his application for a military appointment was 
made before he had any expectation of coming into my family, 
that he found the Dutch Climate disagree so much with his health, 
that he was obliged to resolve upon a return home, and as an em- 
ployment when he came there had sought a Commission in the 
Army, but that he had relinquished the idea of the army as soon 
as he joined me, and should not resume it, if I had no objection 
to his remaining with me. 

Under these circumstances I shall not forward the letters on this 
Subject to Mr. Smith and your Son, as I entirely agree with you 
that it may be of considerable advantage to him to spend some 
time here before he engages in his profession. I brought my 
youngest Brother with me with this view, and he returned home 
after remaining about a year with me. 

If you will allow your Son to come here, tho' for the reason 
above stated I cannot secure him a Salary, as my Secretary, I 
shall be happy in receiving him as one of my Family and he may 
consider my house and table his own in like manner as tho' he 
was my Secretary. In this proposal, which is not offered as a 
token of civility, I shall be grateful if you agree. 

With sincere regards &c. &c

R. King to Colonel Pickering. 

Private and Confidential. 

London, Mar. 16, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

If the President should think of sending a minister to Con- 
stantinople for the purpose of negotiating a commercial Treaty, I 
know of no one that I think more capable of conducting the nego- 
tiation than my early and worthy friend Mr. Gore. I have some 
reason to believe that such a mission would not be disagreeable 
to him, and it is but strict justice to observe that the patience, 
diligence and ability with which he has conducted the affairs of 
the by no means pleasant Commission of which he is a member, 
give him, exclusive of his respectable personal Qualifications, 
some title to the public notice and favor. Whether you will ap- 
preciate the advantages to our Trade that would be gained by 
such a Treaty I can only conjecture ; nor do I know that any 
means are or will be likely to be taken in order to ascertain the 
Disposition beforehand of the Porte upon this Subject. I don't 
think we should take any ostensible step unless we are previously 
ascertained of a favorable Disposition at Constantinople. You 
will observe that I think we have been a little hasty in regard to 
Russia ; tho' I have not much doubt that this Power will consent 
to negotiate, expecting perhaps that the negotiation be carried on 
at Petersburgh. 

With great truth I am, dear Sir, your faithful Sert. 

Rufus King. 



R. King to James McHenry, Esq. 

London, March 16, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

I annex the copy of a Letter from Count Rumford, formerly 
Sir Benjamin Thompson, to me upon a subject somewhat inter- 
esting. I am persuaded that the establishment of an American 
Military Academy is an object of the first importance to us. 
Count Rumford founded one in Bavaria that enjoys a very high 
reputation, and I have reason to believe that he would receive 
very great pleasure in communicating to us the result of his ex- 



1799] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 575 



perience on this Subject. I have not seen his Military Books, 
Drawings, &c, but am informed that they are inestimable. The 
Cannon he proposes to make a present of to the United States is 
a perfect model, and will serve to assist in the Casting and Mount- 
ing Field Artillery. I have sent a copy of the Count's Letter 
likewise to Col. Pickering, and must wait for the President's in- 
structions, thro' him or you, in what manner I shall answer it. 
Count Rumford proposes to return with the view of residing a 
part of his time in his Native Country. On this Subject I take 
the liberty of referring you to a Letter from me to Col. Pickering, 
and will only add that it would undoubtedly be encouraging and 
grateful to him to receive an answer from the President, thro' me 
or in any other way, that he will be received in a kind and friendly 
manner. 

I have not for a long time received any Letters from you ; nor 
do I know that you have received your Books, Medals, &c, that I 
have at different times sent you. I shall by the earliest oppor- 
tunity send you the Dies which have been ready these four 
months. 

I am always happy to hear of and from you, and beg you to 
accept the assurance of my Sincere Esteem & Respect. 

Rufus King. 



R. King to O. Wolcott, Esq. 

London, March 16, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

I was in hopes to have heard from you by the last packet, and 
to have received your opinion respecting the arms sent by Pit- 
cairn from Hamburgh to New York. You know that I have had 
considerable apprehension that their quality would disappoint us. 
I don't know what is the quantity Pitcairn has engaged. The in- 
terruption during the winter has been such as to cut off all cor- 
respondence. Not having an immediate Demand for the whole of 
the money in the hands of the Mess. Barings, I have requested 
them to pay Mr. Williams about ^5000, to assist him in the pros- 
ecution of our prize Cases ; this saves us from borrowing here for 
that purpose, which we shall be obliged to do unless we receive 



576 RUFUS KING. [i799 

further Remittances. I have also lately ordered the Mess. Barings 
to remit Pitcairn^7ooo.; the exchange is much in our favor, the 
Bills at two and a half and three usances, which I have desired 
might not be discounted, except as the money should be wanted. 
This step has been influenced by the Persuasion that circum- 
stances were at hand that would materially affect the exchange 
between this and Hamburgh, and the Bills being at long sight 
will in a great measure preserve us from Casualties. I shall 
send you soon the late Reports of the Committee on Finance and 
such other publications relative to that subject as have lately ap- 
peared. Send me in return your Reports and Statements to Con- 
gress. Without I obtain them I am not able to answer a thousand 
questions, that it is of use to us should be answered, and correctly. 

Yours &c. 

Rufus King. 



R. King to Count Rumford. 

London, Mar. 17, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

That your numerous and respectable friends in this Country, 
should be gratified by the postponement of your voyage to 
America is extremely natural. But I foresaw such advantages 
from your return among us, to our various public institutions, 
many of which are but now beginning to establish themselves, 
that I cannot refrain from expressing to you my sincere regret 
that it is likely to be so long deferred. I console myself however 
with your obliging assurance that it is not entirely relinquished. 

Though I think I might before hand thank you in the Presi- 
dent's name for the many valuable tokens of friendship that you 
kindly offer us, I have preferred to send your Letter to the Secre- 
tary of State, with a request it might be laid before the President 
in order that I may receive his Instructions, in what manner I 
shall answer it. I beg you, my dear Sir, to pardon the delay that 
has occurred in my acknowledgment of the receit of your Letter, 
which has been occasioned by pressing Engagements, and to be 
assured of the sincere Regard & Esteem, &c, &c.

Lord Grenville to R. King. 

Downing Street, March 21, 1799. 

Lord Grenville presents his compliments to Mr. King and has 
the honor to acknowledge the receipt of his memorial of the nth 
of this month relative to the conduct of the Commander of his 
Majesty's ship Carnatic. 

The Government of the U. S. may be assured that the King is 
always solicitous to respect the Rights and Honor of those powers 
with whom his majesty entertains the relations of friendship ; that 
the instructions, which by his majesty's orders are given to the com- 
manders of his fleets or ships of war, affirm the strictest attention 
to this principle, particularly in the case of the ships of war of any 
of those powers ; and that his majesty, desirous at all times to 
manifest his friendship towards the U. S., will certainly see with 
displeasure any act which may have been committed by any 
officer in his majesty's service in derogation of the attention and 
respect due to their flag. 

With regard to the particular facts mentioned in Mr. King's 
memorial the most immediate inquiry will be instituted into them 
that the distance of the service upon which the Commander of his 
majesty's ship Carnatic is now employed will allow, and on the 
result of this inquiry his majesty will pursue with delay such 
measures as the case may appear to require in conformity to the 
principles above stated.

Rufus King to John Jay.* 

London, March 18th, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

The opposition of Virginia, and of her offspring, Kentucky, 
appears bolder and more considerable than I had apprehended. 
The reform that seems to have taken place in the Carolinas is, 
however, a consoling and important circumstance. I have been 
inclined to believe that the Congressional election was the princi- 
pal object of those inflammatory proceedings, which discredit and 
injure us abroad, and when passed, that these States would display 
less turbulence. 

According to present appearances, the war must recommence 
between France and Austria, if it has not already begun ; but that 
an honest and solid confederacy against France is likely to take 

* Life of John Jay, vol. ii., p. 296. 

578 



1799] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 579 

place between the great powers is more than I dare even to expect. 
Russia is uncommonly zealous. Passawan Ouglou has accepted 
pardon and promotion ; and it is just now said, how accurately is 
another point, that Russia and Austria are to lay aside their mu- 
tual jealousy, and to consult and act together for their common 
safety. 

The commercial condition of England is extremely prosperous 
and notwithstanding the hazardous and really dreadful situation 
of Ireland, this country is united in an uncommon degree, and 
appears resolved to persevere in the war. The minister, at the 
opening of his budget, estimates the total income of all the peo- 
ple of Great Britain at a hundred million per annum ; and it is 
confidently expected that the taxes of this year will considerably 
exceed one-third of this sum. 

The Directory lately hold a language respecting America more 
moderate, but not less artful and dangerous. Whether any change 
in their privateering laws will be made, I think uncertain ; if my 
conjectures respecting the views of the Directory are correct, these 
laws will be now modified, or at least for a time suspended. After 
the experience we have had, it will be humiliating if we are de- 
ceived by the artifices that will be practised among our people. 

Obedt. & faithful Servt.

T. Sedgwick to R. King. 

Stockbridge, 20th March, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . You will have seen the nomination of our friend Mr. 
Murray as Minister to the french republic, and its consequences. 
The immediate document to which the President refers, the Let- 
ter from Talleyrand to Pichon, which in the President's opinion 
affords " a plausible appearance of probability " (a degree of 
evidence I do not perfectly comprehend,) of french sincerity, is 
published. That letter refers to one of the date of the 4th fruc- 
tidor. It is unfortunate that the fructidor letter asserts the claim 
of france to treat only with those " who are truly american, not 
seduced by Great Britain, neither friendly to royalty nor inimical 
to france." No good, it is stated, can be expected by a negotia- 



580 RUFUS KING. [i799 

tion in other hands ; and that fairness requires that he should 
warn the government of the U. S. of " these rocks." Nothing 
has, at any time, been communicated to our government more 
arrogant & offensive. In my opinion, and in this the federal 
sentiment is unanimous, our honor and of course our interest, re- 
quired, that the scene of negotiation should have been the United 
States, and nothing should have induced us to relinquish this 
ground but severe calamity. Nothing could, in my belief, have 
been more unfortunate than this measure. After infinite embar- 
rassments we had attained a point of all, on this side open and 
declared hostility, the most desirable, and which should not, but 
on great consideration, have been relinquished. The state of our 
affairs as well at home as in Europe required a firm adherence to 
the system which had been adopted ; and we must fear the effect 
which may be produced on the proposed negotiation with Russia 
and the Porte. 

Our funds, notwithstanding all the depredations on our com- 
merce, are productive beyond the expectation of any body. The 
surplus of permanent revenue, the last year, after satisfying all 
permanent appropriations, exceeded two millions and a half. 
Credit, from the effect of the last loan, appears sound and 
effective ; there having been nearly three times the proposed 
amount subscribed in one day. The Jacobins say that it is clear, 
from the result, that the terms proposed, by the Secretary, were 
excessive, for, it is argued, if eight per cent will produce 15 
millions surely seven would have secured the proposed amount. 
But the facts authorize, conclusively, the proposed terms. The 
basis of his calculation was the actual market rate of interest 
ascertained by the price of the various species of stock. No other 
principle could have been adopted. 

The conduct of the Legislature of Virginia, and its Satellite 
that of Kentucky,* you must have considered attentively. The 

* The reference here is to the celebrated Virginia resolutions of 1798, prepared 
by Madison for the Virginia Legislature and by Jefferson for the Kentucky 
Legislature, presented by Nicholas, passed in the latter, and known as "the 
Kentucky Resolutions." They resolved that the United States were united by 
a compact, the Constitution, to which each State acceded as a State, its co- 
States forming the other party ; " that every State has a natural right, in 
cases, not within the compact, to nullify, of their own authority, all assumptions 
of power by others within their limits." This principle was summed up by Mr.. 



1799] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 58 1 

conduct of the national government was openly denounced as 
hostile to liberty, proceeding by usurpation, insidiously to estab- 
lish a Tyranny, in violation of the constitution & of oaths. If 
these charges were true, resistance was not only justifiable but a 
duty, and hence they were preparing for it by arming the People. 
Their address to their constituents is a justificatory memorial, 
little, if at all, short of a declaration of war. The effects of this 
strange production were, in some degree, counteracted by the 
address of the minority, a masterly performance, for which we are 
indebted to the pen of General Marshall, who has, by it, in some 
measure, atoned for his pitiful electioneering epistle. But what 
has been infinitely more beneficial is the firm, dignified & patriotic 
conduct of the other State legislatures, whose unanimity will in 
some degree redeem our character, disgraced by Virginia democ- 
racy ; and has, we are informed, arrested the progress of the de- 
signs of the leaders in that state. 

I ought to have told you, for the honor of our executive ad- 
ministration, that none of the ministers, nor, I believe, any body 
else, was consulted by the President relative to the nomination of 
Murray. 

The Secretary of State has, I presume, informed you of the 
unhappy divisions which exist among the commissioners on the 
subject of the British debts.* From all I know it is pretty cer- 

Nicholas in these words : " That the several States who formed that instrument 
(the Constitution) being sovereign and independent, have the unquestionable 
right to judge of its infraction ; and that a nullification of those sovereignties, 
of all unauthorized acts, done under color of that instrument, is the rightful 
remedy." 

Though the doctrine was denounced at the time by other States, to which 
Virginia appealed to support her in declaring the acts of Congress — among 
others, and, chiefly, the Alien and Sedition laws — unconstitutional and to take 
the " necessary and proper measures to maintain unimpaired the authorities, 
rights, and liberties reserved to the States respectively or to the people," the as- 
sertion of these principles has since been on several occasions the cause of 
danger to the country, and was the ground on which the rebellion of 1861 was 
pretended to be based. The crushing of that settled forever the principle that 
the United States is not a compact of States, with reserved rights, but a " gov- 
ernment of the people, by the people, and for the people." — Ed. 

* " The commission sitting at Philadelphia under the sixth article, the ap- 
pointment of the fifth commissioner or umpire of which had fallen to the 
British, was by no means so harmonious (as the 7th at London). Claims of all

tain that a secession must take place on the part of our gentle- 
men. I hope no very mischievous effects will ensue. In any 
event, however, I believe, all dispassionate men will concur in 
opinion that great indiscretion, if nothing more, has marked the 
conduct of the commissioners on the part of G. Britain. 

There have been serious embarrassments experienced in every 
part of our country from three causes, overtrading externally, the 
plunder of our commerce, and speculating internally. The latter 
has been most severely & extensively felt. It has pervaded every 
part of our country from the Potomack, & more especially from 
the Hudson to the eastward. The rage for acquiring property 
by other means than industry and economy was not confined to 
towns but extended to almost every neighborhood in the country, 
& the effects have been such as might have been expected. The 
only remedy has been applied, and altho' a severe one, it is 
already in the towns, and will be in the country effectual. Many 
are, and more must be ruined ; but the essential interests of the 
country will not be injured, nor, ultimately, its strength or re- 
sorts had been filed, including many by expatriated Tories, for the value of 
their confiscated property, to the amount, in the whole, of twenty four millions 
of dollars ; and the ground taken by the majority of the commission was such 
as threatened a very heavy burden to the United States. There was a differ- 
ence in the commission both as to the allowance of interest while the war con- 
tinued and as to the classes of persons entitled to claim under the treaty. The 
British majority of the commissioners were disposed to hold the United States 
responsible, in the first place, for all unpaid debts, and to throw upon them the 
burden of proving that, had due diligence been used, these debts might have 
been collected. The American commissioners maintained, on the other hand, 
that as the United States were only responsible for those debts the recovery of 
which had been prevented by legal impediments, it rested on each claimant to 
show that due diligence had been used, and that the recovery of his debt had 
been prevented by legislative obstacles, or by the debtor's becoming insolvent 
during the continuance of such obstacles. After much discussion, some of it 
very warm, and before one claim had been definitely adjudicated, the Ameri- 
can commissioners, with the approbation of their government, prevented any 
awards by their withdrawing. When this became known in England, the 
British government withdrew their members from the board sitting there ; and 
both commissions thus came to a full stop. But, notwithstanding this interrup- 
tion, both governments expressed their anxiety to carry out the treaty in good 
faith ; and Sitgreaves was soon after dispatched to England to co-operate with 
King in obtaining, if possible, some explanatory article on the subject of 
British debts." — Hildreth, History of the United States, 2d ser., ii., p. 339. 



1799] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 583 

sources impaired. The pursuits of sober industry were never 
better rewarded — commerce is generally protected ; and there 
never was, probably, a time when it was more lucrative. Human- 
ity will regret that so many men, should by an excessive ardor to 
become rich, have plunged themselves into serious difficulties, 
from which they will be able by severe & long exertion only, if 
at all, to extricate themselves ; but the greatest mischief, politi- 
cally considered, is that in too many instances ruined speculators 
commence zealous patriots. 

The salary Act compared with what ought to have been done 
is certainly a paltry measure, but considered as the best that could 
possibly be done it is of immense importance — The measure had 
been defeated in the house by the votes of some who especially 
acted on the federal side — when it was revised in the senate, it 
was necessary, that it should be done, on a scale which would 
insure the assent of those men. This information is due to the 
character of the Senate, in general, to my own in particular, as I 
originated the measure there. 

It is with extreme pain that I anticipate becoming again a 
member of the house. It was my ardent wish, & I thought my 
firm determination to have retired forever from public life, but an 
adherence to that resolution was, under the circumstances, impos- 
sible. Another two years will, I hope, afford a better prospect. 
With much sincerity I am my dear Sir, your friend 

The. S.

London, Mar. 21, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

The Packet is still detained in order that I might receive Lord 
Grenville's answer to my memorial, respecting Capt. Loring ; if it 
is sent in season I shall annex it to this Letter. 

The crossing of the Rhine by the French armies on the first 
instant, and a correspondent movement that probably took place 
at the same time against Tuscany, were the preludes to the declara- 
tion of war that followed against the King of Hungary and 
Bohemia and the Grand Duke. 

Thus, as all impartial observers foresaw, the temporizing at 
Vienna during which Switzerland and Piedmont and Naples have 



584 RUFUS KING. [1799 

been overturned and France at her leisure has recruited and re- 
established her armies, has been worse than useless, has been the 
loss of favorable moments and of precious occasions. 

As yet we have no intelligence from Vienna of the temper with 
which this explosion has been received, nor do I think it by any 
means certain that Prussia will even now heartily unite her strength 
in an honest confederacy, which alone can bring back France 
within those limitations the safety of Europe requires. We are in 
hourly expectation of the news of a battle between Jourdain and 
the Arch Duke. The rapidity of the advance of the French col- 
umns sufficiently announce their expectation of reaching the 
Austrians before they are entirely prepared. 

We have the French papers to the 15th, but I see nothing in 
them directly relative to us, and the new objects that must now 
engage their attention will for the present most likely put us and 
our affairs out of view. 

I send you a copy of Carnot's answer to his denunciation by 
his colleagues : there seems no doubt that it is an authentic per- 
formance. Our late Envoys, or at least General Pinckney, be- 
lieved that Carnot entertained more equitable opinions concerning 
the United States than the majority of his colleagues. 

This answer discloses his project respecting Louisiana ; and if 
such views were entertained by him, whom we believed the most 
just and moderate, can we suffer ourselves to doubt the intention 
of his colleagues ? Is there the slightest reason to suppose they 
have changed their purposes ? Ought we not rather to believe 
that it has been confirmed by the manner in which we have 
opposed it ? And can we persuade ourselves after such an op- 
position that we shall escape the alternative of war or submis- 
sion ? 

With perfect Respect & Esteem &c. &c.

Dear Sir : 

Lord Grenville's answer was not in season for the mail of yes- 
terday ; I have since received it and a copy is annexed to this 
Letter which will probably overtake the Mail at Falmouth. Our

information from Berlin, by the Hamburgh post, confirms the 
opinion that Prussia resolved on the system of neutrality the 
moment that France renewed the war against Austria. Mr. 
Grenville's mission must consequently fail, and the war will be 
prosecuted upon unequal terms and with the greatest vigour 
against a partial and disjointed confederacy. The 25,000 Rus- 
sians, who have for some time been in the neighborhood of 
Vienna, are on their march for Italy where the combined army 
will be commanded by the Russian General Suwarrow. The first 
blow has been unfortunate to the confederates ; the whole of the 
Austrian Corps that occupied Coire in the Country of the Grisons 
having, it is said by surprize, been made Prisoners by the French 
under Massena. I should be happy to believe that this first suc- 
cess is not likely to be followed by future and more important 
victories. One is tired with beholding, and with endeavoring in 
vain to account for the blindness that even yet prevents an 
honest and general confederacy against the overbearing Power of 
France. 

With the most perfect Respect and Esteem &c &c

Lord Grenville to Mr. King. 

Downing Street, March 21, 1799. 

Lord Grenville presents his compliments to Mr. King, and has 
the honor to acknowledge the receipt of his Memorial of the nth 
of this month, relative to the conduct of the Commander of his 
Majesty's Ship Carnatic. 

The Government of the United States may be assured that the 
King is always solicitous to respect the Rights and Honor of those 
Powers with which his Majesty entertains the relations of friend- 
ship : that the instructions which by his Majesty's order are given 
to the Commanders of his Fleets or Ships of war enjoin the 
strictest attention to this principle, particularly in the case of the 
Ships of war of any Such Power ; and that his Majesty desirous 
at all times to manifest his friendship towards the U. S., will cer- 
tainly see with Displeasure any act which may have been com- 



586 RUFUS KING. [1799 

mitted by any officer in his Majesty's service in derogation of the 
attention and respect due to their Flag. 

With regard to the particular facts mentioned in Mr. King's 
memorial, the most immediate enquiry will be instituted into 
them, that the distance of the service upon which the Commander 
of his Majesty's Ship Carnatic is now employed, will allow, and 
on the Result of the Enquiry, his Majesty will pursue without de- 
lay such measures as the Case may appear to require in conformity 
to the Principles above stated. 



R. King to Secretary of State. No. 33. 

London, March 22, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

It has occurred to me since closing my Letter of this date, that 
in consequence of the Enquiry ordered to be instituted into the 
conduct of Capt Loring, it may be adviseable to obtain and send 
to me proofs more direct and regular than those included in the 
Report of the Consul at the Havannah. I judged it proper to 
strengthen the statement of the Consul by alleging in my me- 
morial, as I was authorized to do by the purport of your Num- 
ber , that the same was confirmed by the subsequent Report 
of the Commander of the Baltimore. It would have been more 
regular to have drawn up a Statement from the Report of the 
Commander of the Baltimore, which should have been signed by 
him and his principal officers, and addressed to the Secretary of 
the Marine. 

I submit to your consideration whether this should not yet be 
done. It may be sent to me to be used if the Result of the En- 
quiry, that has been ordered, should render it important. My 
apprehension is that Loring will excuse himself by * saying and at- 
tempting to prove that the Commander of the Baltimore acquiesced in 
and cofisented to all that was done. 

With perfect Respect & Esteem &c. &c.

R. King to Secretary of State. No. 34. 

London, March 23, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

I last evening received a note from Lord Grenville, a copy of 
which is annexed, announcing a Blockade of all the Ports of Hol- 
land. I think I have before informed you that the High Court 
of Admiralty here consider a Blockade as an interdiction of all 
Trade inwards and outwards of the Blockaded Port, an interdic- 
tion to be enforced by the confiscation of all Vessels with their 
Cargoes seized in the attempt, after notice, to enter into or come 
out of the same ; the only exception is in favor of Vessels coming 
out of the Blockaded Port, and which entered the same before 
the Blockade commenced ; and even in this case the Cargo to be 
exempt must have been received on board before notice that the 
Blockade existed. 

Actual notice is given by the men of war of the nation estab- 
lishing the Blockade, when the same is presumed to have been 
unknown at the place from whence the Neutral Vessel cleared ; 
but such notice is not deemed to be necessary when the Blockade 
was known at the place of clearing. 

I suggest for your consideration whether after formal notice, as 
in the present case, it will not conduce to the security of our 
Trade, that the Collector of our Ports should officially be ad- 
vised thereof, with Instructions not to grant clearances for such 
Blockaded Ports. Such Clearances are granted for Amsterdam, 
notwithstanding the notice given to us of the Blockade of the 
Texel, and altho' it is done in the hope of escaping the French 
Privateers, it on the other hand exposes our vessels to be sent in 
here for adjudication. 

With perfect Respect & Esteem, &c, &c 

Rufus King. 



R. King to Lord Grenville. 

London, March 25, 1799. 
My Lord : 

With a view to greater precision it might be advantageous to 

recast the whole of the 18th Article of our Treaty of Amity, 

Commerce & Navigation ; but this would require more time and 



588 RUFUS KING. [i799 

attention than could perhaps at this moment be spared from other 
and more urgent engagements, or than would consist with the 
speedy attainment of the particular object of the Conference that 
I lately held with your Lordship on this Subject. 

Referring therefore to some future period the general subject, I 
submit to your Lordship's consideration the proposal that I am 
ordered to make in respect to a more exact definition of the 
Articles of Naval Stores, which according to the intention of the 
Parties, and the Law of Nations, ought to be esteemed as Contra- 
band of War. 

Our Treaty after enumerating certain articles as arms and im- 
plements serving for the purpose of war, adds, " and also Timber 
for Shipbuilding, Tar or Rosin, Copper in Sheets, Sails, Clamp 
and Cordage, and generally whatever may serve directly to the 
Equipment of Vessels, unwrought Iron and Firplanks only ex- 
cepted." 

It is in consequence of this great comprehension of the last 
Clause of this Paragraph, that the Ships of the United States, 
trading to the Dutch and Spanish Colonies, are subjected to great 
Loss and Damage by seizure and detention for having on board 
either Iron Nails of various sizes which seem directly and chiefly 
for the construction of houses and other buildings in the said 
Colonies and for the making of Sugar Casks, Boxes, & other 
Packages ; or Oznaburghs, an inferior sort of their coarse linen 
and used chiefly for Negro Clothing. 

Nails of this description are of a size that cannot supply the 
place of Spikes which are directly for Ship Building ; and Ozna- 
burghs is wholly unfit for the Sails of Vessels even of the lowest 
Tonnage that frequent the Ocean. Notwithstanding this differ- 
ence between Sail Cloth and Oznaburghs, and between Spikes and 
House Nails, as well as between their respective uses, the one is 
confounded with the other by the British Cruizers in the West 
Indian Seas. 

In order to avoid the interruption and loss arising from this 
error, we propose by way of an additional article, to agree upon 
the enumeration of those articles which alone should be deemed 
to serve directly for the equipment of Vessels, or upon an enu- 
meration of such as shall not be so considered ; or if it shall be 
proposed to exchange Declarations, to be followed by corre- 



1799] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 589 

spondent Instructions to your Ships of war, Cruizers and Courts 
of Admiralty, to except the Articles above mentioned from the 
Catalogue of Articles deemed to be Contraband of War. 

In any of these modes the object at which we aim may be 
attained ; the choice is submitted to your Lordship in the per- 
suasion that the end is one that must receive your Lordship's 
Approbation. 

With perfect Consideration & Respect &c, &c. 

Rufus King. 



R. King to W. Smith. 

London, March 26, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

Farther consideration serves to strengthen my first impression 
respecting the step that has been taken in regard to Russia and 
the Porte. I thought it a little premature, and I still think that it 
will require some management in order to give to it a turn that 
may not embarrass us. There has been, as you will probably 
recollect, an awkward circumstance concerning our Consular ap- 
pointment to Russia ; this would have been easily overcome, and 
the coincidence of the opinion of Russia & of the United States 
in respect to France would have gone far to smooth the way to 
the attainment of the object of the President's late appointment. 

The negotiation with the Porte is an affair of still more interest ; 
and in my opinion it must be a preliminary measure to ascertain, 
thro' some friendly quarter, the disposition of the Turkish Gov- 
ernment before you or any other public character appear there : 
indeed I understand that this practice is invariably adopted. I 
don't know whether the subject has been mentioned in your cor- 
respondence with our Government, but it has constantly been 
treated of in mine for two years past — not the manner of conduct- 
ing the negotiation, but the importance of a Treaty with the Porte, 
as well in respect to the advantage and extension of our Com- 
merce, as to the Security that it would give to our Treaties with 
the Barbary Powers. 

Previously to the return to Constantinople of the Turkish Am- 
bassador, whom I found here on my arrival, and who was a quiet 



59<D RUFUS KING. [l799 



good old man, I had several conversations with him upon the 
Subject of a commercial Treaty, and on his going, gave him a 
short memoir, drawn up chiefly with a view of shewing the advan- 
tages which such a Treaty would give to Turkey. 

Upon the coming of the present Ambassador, who is a more 
intelligent man, who shewed his exact knowledge by saying, when I 
was first presented to him, that he was glad to see a man who 
came from the country of Diamonds and of Gold ! ! ! !, I took an 
early occasion to renew the Conversation with him, but with more 
caution as I was unable to discover his sentiments. 

As soon as we received the advice of Lord Nelson's victory, it 
appeared to me that a favorable occasion was about to offer itself 
for me to take measures for the conclusion of a Treaty with the 
Ottoman Empire ; and in the very next conference I had with 
Lord Grenville, I mentioned the project to him, entirely as 
from myself, and observed that the influence that England must 
acquire by the victory of the Nile, that with her favor and the 
good will of Russia, which we had no reason to suppose would 
be withheld, we might probably succeed in establishing a Treaty 
that, exclusive of some commercial advantages, would be of value 
to us by giving stability to the Treaties, which at great expence 
we had lately concluded with the Barbary Powers : his Lordship 
answered that he could beforehand assure us that we might rely 
upon the influence and good office of the King in the course of our 
negotiation. 

About the same time, a conversation took place between me 
and the Russian Ambassador, which began on his part, relative to 
a Treaty between Russia and the United States, in the course of 
which I said possibly we might desire to avail ourselves of the 
present moment to negotiate a commercial Treaty with the Porte, 
in the course of which negotiation the influence of Russia would 
be of great service to us : his answer was such as I could have 
desired ; but the whole was merely a personal conversation, and 
ended by a mutual promise to send to our respective Govern- 
ments a report of it. It was in November last that I reported to 
Col. Pickering as well my conversation with Lord Grenville as 
with the Russian Ambassador. 

In a Letter of the 6th of February he barely mentioned the 
matter as one of importance, that was under consideration : My 



1799] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 59 1 

next intelligence is the appointment announced in the News- 
papers. 

I went immediately to the Turkish Ambassador in order to 
give the intelligence in his mind a turn that might prevent em- 
barrassments. I told him of the conversation I had had with Lord 
Grenville, and of his answer : that I had reported the same to my 
Government, as well as the conversation I had before had with 
him and with his Predecessor : that according to our Forms, the 
Senate must approve the appointment of Ambassadors ; that the 
Senate was not a body in permanent session, but like the English 
Parliament commonly assembled only in the Winter ; that it is 
therefore often necessary that an appointment should be made a 
longtime beforehand, and that notwithstanding the news that you 
were appointed, which I believed tho' I had no regular informa- 
tion of it, still all the customary measures would be observed in 
order to manifest our respect to the Sultan and to ascertain 
whether it would be agreeable to him to receive our Ambassador : 
and tho' I was not authorized to speak to him on the subject, yet 
perhaps he would think it adviseable to send an account of our 
conversation in order that unfavorable impressions might be pre- 
vented, adding that I had only to desire that he would not state 
the conversation so as to give the idea that any answer was 
expected. 

He told me that he would pursue the course I recommended 
which I believe he will do : he then said his Predecessor had spoken 
with him on the Subject, and that after his arrival at Constanti- 
nople he had made some favorable communications to the Reis 
Effendi concerning it. He said that in August last he mentioned 
the Subject to Lord Grenville, and added that if England 
approved, who was their Great Ally he thought it would be 
favorable. 

He then enquired particularly respecting you, your age, Profes- 
sion, former Employment and political opinions. I answered that 
you were about 38 or 40 (too young a man would not do), a 
Gentleman of fortune, a man of Letters, always employed in great 
affairs and a distinguished member of Congress, answering to 
Parliament, lately come abroad and for the first time, a pronounced 
friend of order and an enemy of the Philosophy and Politicks of 
France. The answer shewed that all this pleased, and he en- 



592 RUFUS KING. [1799 

gaged to report the whole, and if he received anything on the 
Subject, to communicate it to me. I shall wait for my Letters 
before I say anything further to Lord Grenville. 

I have thought it adviseable to send you this — and shall cheer- 
fully assist in collecting such books and information as may be 
useful to you. 

With respect to myself, I am persuaded that my nomination has 
been made on the supposition that the Treaty with Russia would 
be negotiated here : this cannot be done, and I presume the 
business will pass into other hands. 

I send you a letter from Murray, who complains that he shall 
never again hear from Philadelphia, that Dispatches from the 
Secretary of State, which I forwarded passed his letter on the 
way. I received notice a day or two since that all the Ports of 
Holland are blockaded by the English Fleets. The war has, 
according to our accounts, recommenced, and the first affair has 
been against the French. But I am afraid to expect what I hope 
for, so often and great have been our former Disappointments. 

Nothing interesting from Philadelphia. We have to-day a Re- 
port that Truxton in the Constellation has taken the Insurgente 
French Frigate after an action of two hours, and carried her into 
Martinique. The Report wants confirmation and I hope will 

have it. 

I am with great Respect & Esteem 

Your faithful friend

to give Him Success occasioned his Death — I did not again come 
forward as a Candidate — The Contest lay between Jacobin Jo. 
Nicholson (who I am sorry to say carried his Election, He had 
however only a Majority of 74) & Federalist Jno. Goldsborough ; 
had the latter declared Himself sooner than He did, He would 
have been elected. 

In One of my Letters to You, I gave You a hasty Statement 
of the new House of Representatives, (which it is expected will 
be more fcederal than the last was) perhaps the enclosed list may 
be more correct. The last Congress died gloriously, I never 
knew the fcederal men hang better together, & act with more 
Firmness than at the last Session. I wish the new Congress 
with their Accession of Fcederalism may do as well. 

The last Information I had from Virginia was, that Genl. 
Marshall would be elected ; if so, it will be complete Victory 
over the Jacobinic jeffersonian Junto ; & many Gentlemen have 
been so sanguine as to think there will be returned from that 
State 7 or 8 fcederal Members ; the People there are certainly 
fcederalising very fast. 

I have great Hopes that our Friend Sedgwick will be the 
next Speaker, his Merits are great, He behaved nobly in consent- 
ing to be chosen to the House of Representatives, to keep out 
the late insignificant Member from that District, or some other 
who might be equally bad & contemptible. 

I rejoice much to hear of the late French Disasters, I sincerely 
pray They may speedily be shut up within their own Territory, 
or extirpated from the Face of the Earth. 

I was elected last Winter to a Seat in our State Senate, which 
I have accepted. 

Yours very sincerely & affy.

R. King to Secretary of State. No. 35. 

London, April 12, 1799. 

Dear Sir : 

I have received another Note from Lord Grenville on the sub- 
ject of the Blockade of the Dutch Ports. We are now informed 
that all the Ports of the United Provinces are in a state of vigour- 
ous Blockade. The former notice of which I sent you a copy 
with my last Letter respected the Ports of Holland only. 

Tho' I have carefully watched the French papers, I have not 
yet seen any Report of the proceedings of the Council upon the 
Message of the Directory mentioned in my No. 14. A master 
of one of our ships who arrived here a few days past from France 
brought the copy of a Letter written and published in English 
in Paris by Dupont, formerly Consul at Charleston, to the Com- 
missary of the Directory with the Court of Cassation. This 
Letter purports to be written at the Desire of the Commissary, 
and in order to explain the kind of papers ordinarily given to 
American vessels. The explanations are tolerably correct, and 
the Letter throughout is in favor of the Restoration of all Ameri- 
can Vessels and Cargoes captured on account of a supposed 
irregularity in their papers. Most probably you will have seen 
Copies of this Letter before this reaches you, as there can be no 
doubt that it was written for the purpose of appearing in our 
newspapers. 

This Letter seems also to have had some relation to the late 
Arrete of the Directory of the 18th of March, a copy of which 
taken from the Redacteur of the 23d ultimo, is annexed. It is 
not obvious what the Alteration is, that is professed to be made 
by this arrete, in that of the 2d of March 1797. We complained 
that any other Paper than the ship's Passport was demanded and 
justified ourselves in doing so by the Treaty. The present arrete 
applies to us in common with all Neutrals, the Regulations of 
1744 and 1778, and consequently lays the Treaty out of the ques- 
tion. It is true that the Regulations of 1744 and 1778 do not 
require any precise form in the Roles d'Equipages and it maybe 
intended to leave the Liberals at liberty to admit our ship's 
Articles as the Roles d'Equipages required by their regulations. 

We have received American Newspapers containing the two 



1799] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 595 

Messages of the President respecting another Mission to France ; 
and about ten days before a mail from the West Indies brought 
us an account of the capture of the French Frigate l'lnsurgente 
by the Constellation. 

With perfect Respect and Esteem &c, &c.

R. King to Secretary of State. No. 36. 

London, April 16, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

In a former Letter I have taken notice of a Resolution of the 
Council of Five hundred adopted upon a reference from the 
Tribunal of Cassation, and which declared that the Law author- 
izing the Capture of Neutral Vessels having on board Articles of 
the growth and fabric of Great Britain should operate from the 
date of its passage. This Resolution has been the subject of long 
and elaborate discussion in the Council of Ancients, where it was 
finally rejected according to the late French Papers by a large 
majority on the first of March. The Tribunal of Cassation was 
divided, a part of the Members being of opinion that the Law was 
to take effect from the day of its Passage, and the residue con- 
tending that previous notice should be given to all Neutral 
Nations before their Vessels could be affected by it. The two 
Councils are also divided upon this question : the immediate 
consequence must be a delay in pronouncing Sentences by the 
Tribunal of Cassation. I have no means of judging how the 
Question will finally be settled. 

We have Paris Papers to the 18th instant ; There seems no 
longer any Doubt that Joardain after several severe actions in 
Suabia has been driven back by the Arch Duke ; and that 
Massena has not been as successful as was for some time sup- 
posed in his repeated Efforts to penetrate from the Grisons into 
the Tyrol. 

The French Papers state that their Army has entered the 
Dominion of Tuscany, and that the Grand Duke has retired to 
Vienna. I have not a word from France respecting the Capture 
of the Insurgente Frigate, nor of our appointment of another 



596 RUFUS KING. [i799 

Mission to the Directory, tho' the news of both these events was 
probably known at Paris on the 6th or 7th instant. 

With perfect Respect and Esteem &c &c.

R. King to John Jay. 

London, April 19, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

By my Letter of the 7th of December, I informed you that I 
had given orders to Mr. Pitcairn, our Consul at Hamburgh, to 
purchase three thousand German Muskets for the State of New 
York. Under date of the 25th ulto, he informed me that he had 
accordingly engaged two thousand five hundred Muskets at 
26/6 d. sterling each. Under date of the 5th instant he informs 
me that on the 10th he should be called on for part and in one 
month for the remainder of the Payment for these arms, and on 
the 12th he adds that the 2500 Muskets for New York were prin- 
cipally received, and that he should give me information when 
they are shipped. As the funds are not yet arrived, I authorized 
him to draw on the house of Bird, Savage and Bird, who will 
accept his Bill in the expectation that the Remittances will come 
to hand before their acceptance falls due. 

The Muskets will be shipped from Hamburgh in Vessels bound 
to New York, and Insurance may be made accordingly, tho' the 
name or names of the Vessel or Vessels are not known. 

With great Respect &c. &c.

R. Troup to R. King. 

New York, 19th April, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

. . . I am almost afraid to write to you about the State of 
our political affairs. We have experienced a sad reverse in the 
temper, ardor and zeal of our fellow citizens. The late nomina- 
tion of the President for the purpose of renewing negotiations 
with France has given almost universal disgust. This measure, 
besides the intrinsic unfitness of it, was secret and without advice, 
which has also contributed to render it more disgusting. There 



1799] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 597 

certainly will be serious difficulties in supporting Mr. Adams at 
the next election if he should be a candidate. 

The army is progressing like a wounded snake. Last year its 
progress was obstructed by the President's retiring to Braintree. 
He is now there and likely to continue there during the whole 
season. All the measures of the government are retarded by this 
kind of abdication. The only apology, in my opinion, for the 
present abdication is that Mrs. Adams was left sick last Fall at 
Braintree and that she has ever since continued there. General 
Maitland, who lately arrived here on the supposed St. Domingo 
business, has, we understand, been delayed and embarrassed by 
the President's absence in the objects of his Mission, the result of 
which has not yet transpired. 

The insurrection in Pennsylvania may be considered as quelled. 
All the ringleaders, very few excepted, are apprehended and 
in prison. Their conduct has been dastardly and without con- 
cert. * . . . 

Burr is again a candidate for the Assembly and I believe he 
will succeed. He is acquiring much influence and is disposed to 
profit by it. The last winter he procured a bill to pass for incor- 
porating a company by the name of the Manhattan Company. 
Its ostensible object is to bring water to the city ; but its real 
object is to furnish new projects and means for speculation. The 

* This insurrection was caused by a resistance against the direct tax, which 
was ordered by the late Congress, to increase the revenues of the government ; 
among the articles to be taxed were houses, of which the classification was 
made by measuring the windows. The officers appointed to do this work were 
resisted in several of the counties, and the Marshal, under "the warrants 
from the District Court of Pennsylvania " was unable to execute his writs against 
the rioters. " The President immediately issued a proclamation requiring sub- 
mission to the laws. He called upon the Governor of Pennsylvania for a 
detachment of militia," which was granted. " No opposition was made to the 
troops and Fries and some thirty others were secured and carried to Philadel- 
phia. Fries was indicted for treason . . . and was found guilty. The 
court held that to resist a law by force, with intent to defeat its execution alto- 
gether, amounted to levying war. But as it appeared after verdict that one of 
the jury, previous to being impanelled, had expressed his opinion that Fries 
ought to be hung, a new trial was granted. Several of Fries' companions were 
found guilty of misdemeanor." Fries was tried a second time and found guilty, 
but was pardoned by the President. — Hildreth, Hisiojy of the United States, 2d 
ser., vol. ii., pp. 312-366.

capital of the company is to consist of two millions of dollars. 
The shares are $50. each ; and the capital may be applied to any 
monied operations whatsoever. The charter is to be forfeited if 
the company within ten years does not supply the city with 
water. . . . Burr governs everything by a decided majority 
amongst the directors. . . . The most respectable mercantile 
and monied interests are decidedly opposed to the measure ; and 
they attach much blame as well to the Council of Revision as 
to the Assembly and Senate. I have no doubt that if the com- 
pany carry their schemes into effect, they will contribute power- 
fully to encrease that bloated state of credit, which has of late 
essentially injured us, by repeated and heavy bankruptcies. It is 
given out that we are to have a new bank established by the Com- 
pany and that they will also embark deeply in the East India 
Trade — and perhaps turn their attention to marine insurance. . . . 
Mr. Gouverneur Morris is at Morrisania. . . . He is in excellent 
health and is very happy to see his friends, to whom he is all hos- 
pitality. His wines are of superior quality and given with great 
liberality. His attachments to his own country and government 
have encreased by what he has seen in Europe. . . . He seems 
determined to remain a farmer, and not again to embark in pub- 
lic life. . . . 

God bless you.

R. King to Sir Joseph Banks. 

Great Cumberland Place, Ap. 21, 1799. 
Sir: 

I have too much pleasure in obeying your commands to delay 
my reply to your polite and obliging Note of yesterday. By a 
Law for the Establishment of our Mint passed in 1792, we settled 
the proportionate Value of Gold to Silver in the Coins of the U. 
S. at 15 to 1, according to quantity in weight of pure Gold or 
pure Silver. 

By the same Law the standard of our gold coins is established 
to be eleven parts fine to one part alloy, the alloy to be composed 
of silver and copper in such proportions not exceeding one half 
silver, as should be found convenient ; and the standard of our 
silver Coins to be fourteen hundred and eighty five (1485) parts 



1799] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 599 

fine, to one hundred and seventy nine (179) parts alloy ; the alloy 
to be wholly of copper. 

Our Gold Coins are Eagles, half-Eagles and quarter-Eagles ; 
the Eagle is of the value of Ten Dollars, and contains 270 grains 
of standard gold, of which 247 grains and \ part of a grain are of 
pure Gold. The half-Eagles and quarter- Eagles express the 
Proportions of the Eagle they respectively contain. 

Our Silver Coins are Dollars, Half-Dollars, quarter-Dollars, 
Dimes & half-Dimes. The Dollar (which corresponds in value 
with the Spanish milled Dollar, current in the U. S. at the Estab- 
lishment of our Mint) contains 416 grains of standard silver, of 
which 371 Grains and a \ part of a Grain, are pure silver ; the 
Half-Dollar, quarter-Dollar & Dime & half-Dime respectively con- 
tain the half, the quarter, the tenth and the 20th part of the 
standard silver Dollar. 

The Dollar is our money unit ; the money of account of the 
U. S. is expressed in Dollars, dimes, cents & mills, corresponding 
to units, tenths, hundredths, thousandths ; and the public ac- 
counts, Proceedings of the Judiciary of the U. S. are kept and 
had in Conformity to this Regulation. 

With perfect Respect &c. 

Rufus King. 

R. King to Sir Joseph Banks. 

Gr. C. Place, 21st April, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

I am sorry that I have not a piece of each denomination of our 
Coins to offer you ; but I take the liberty to send and beg you to 
accept as Specimens of our Coinage, a half-Eagle, a Dollar and a 
quarter-Dollar. I add to them three medals as samples of a large 
number that by order of our Govt., and under my direction were 
last year struck by Boulton, for the purpose of being distributed 
among the Indians within our Territory. A small ring is soldered 
to the edge of the medal by which according to the Indian cus- 
tom, it may be suspended as an Ornament of Dress. 

The Devices * have been chosen with a Reference to our En- 

* The Devices were made by the Painter, John Trumbull at the request of 
Mr. King. Mr. Trumbull was at this time in London, a member of the Com- 
mission under the 7th Article of the Treaty with Great Britain.

deavours to change the manners of the Indians, & as far as prac- 
ticable to civilize them. For this purpose, we at stated periods 
deliver to them seeds of various kinds, Cattle, Sheep & the differ- 
ent implements of Agriculture.

R. King to Lord Grenville. 

Gt. Cumberland Place, 30th April, 1799. 

Mr. King presents his Compliments to Lord Grenville, & has 
the honor to acknowledge the rect. of his Ldp's. Note of the 
2 2d inst., enclosing a specification of such Nails as are understood 
not to be included in the Catalogue of Articles deemed Contra- 
band of War. Mr. K. is not certain that the proposed Specifica- 
tion includes the different Sorts of Nails used for Housebuilding 
and various other purposes other than Shipbuilding in Gt. Britain, 
as the rose headed Nail, & perhaps others are omitted ; & he is 
the more apprehensive that any description by mere names will 
be insufficient, as different names are given to nails of the same 
sizes in the U. S. and Engd., the American names being generally 
taken from the uses to whh. the nail is apply'd, or from the price 
per hundred or per thousand ; other names differing from those 
of Engd. & the States may be given to the same nails in the Brit- 
ish Colonies & the article intended to be explanatory may itself 
require explanation. 

To avoid this want of precision Mr. King takes the Liberty to 
suggest instead of the enumeration or a Specification as has been 
proposed, that it shd. be agreed that all Iron Nails under the size 
of Spikes or Deck Nails should be excepted from and not in- 
cluded within the provisions of the 18th article of the Treaty of 
Amity, Commerce & Navigation between the U. States & Gr. 
Britain. 



APPENDIX I. 



The kindness of Mrs. Daniel Kilham Dodge, of Brooklyn, 
N. Y., enables the Editor to publish here, though properly 
belonging to the previous volume, some letters, found in 
March, 1894, in an old trunk of her husband's great uncle, 
Daniel Kilham, of Newburyport, Massachusetts. They are 
letters between Dr. Kilham and Rufus King, and throw some 
new light upon the public affairs of the day and illustrate 
Mr. King's private as well as public life. 

R. King to D. Kilham. 

Boston, Feby. 18th, 1784. 
Dear Kilham : 

By the Gazette you learn that the def. Treaty is at last ratified 
by Congress. The General Court are now agitating the propriety, 
and calculating the expence of some public exhibitions of Joy, 
accompanying the proclamation of the peace completed. Some 
say it has become an old story, others reply that granting the fact 
it will bear telling again and again. How the question will be 
determined is perhaps immaterial ; but the spirit which governs 
very generally here, is very pitiful and I fear will prove prejudicial. 

Notwithstanding a liberality of sentiment upon some subjects 
and a general toleration of almost all opinions, except political, 
prevail, yet is it certain, that there is not a great deal still to be 
corrected ? The ability of the country is substantial — her debts 
are trivial, but there is a parsimony which many in office call Re- 
publicanism, that casts an ill feature upon all public doings. This 
mistaken sentiment of political economy checks all public grants 

601 



6o2 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

to the servants of Government ; and in effect discourages men of 
abilities from qualifying themselves for national departments ; of 
consequence the state is badly served. When justice is withheld 
from those who have ably and faithfully served the public, little 
is to be expected from such a government in favor of the arts and 
sciences : and the prevailing spirit above referred to, I fear, will 
wholly suppress an institution which I could wish at least at- 
tempted ; I mean that of a Botanical Garden at Cambridge. 

By a letter from St. John, the French Consul at N. York, ad- 
dressed to President Willard and Doctr. Holyoke, as Pres. of the 
Academy, it appears that the King of France in aid of such an 
institution has directed his minister to communicate to the Uni- 
versity of Cambridge in Massachusetts that, as a testimony of the 
Respect he bears to that University and to enable them to effect 
a purpose ornamental as well as beneficial, he will, by their per- 
mission, cause to be sent and transported to them annually, at the 
proper season, free from every charge, the annual seeds and plants 
of his own Royal Gardens, of every description. No answer has 
been as yet made. It strikes many persons agreeably, and it is 
supposed that the purpose would be very extensively practical at 
Cambridge. Amongst a few friends I have heard the subject can- 
vassed — and my own sentiments have been flattered in the fre- 
quent observation of others, that, should the distribution be 
attempted, it would be most safely trusted to your protection and 
guidance. Could a fund be established that would give an indepen- 
dent annuity to a man of genius and letters, for his attention to such 
an institution, I should feel most happy in seeing you in such a 
character. I have some sentiments upon the practicability that I 
will waive until we meet. Perhaps the matter is not so Utopian as 
you may imagine. I am anxious to attempt something for the 
medical professors. I wish altho' it is small, that it may succeed 
— something like a general infirmary at Cambridge, to be under 
your care &c — this last idea you will receive in confidence — 
Should you meet with good Parson Bass congratulate him for me 
on this intelligence, viz 

" His holiness the Pope has caused to be written to Congress a 
letter congratulatory upon the peace and independence of the 
United States, and to convince them of the sincerity of his con- 
gratulations, informs, that as the English Church have a special 



APPENDIX. 603 



union with their civil government in the King of the one being 
the head of the other, and as a difficulty from that source may be 
in the way of a regular ordination of Ministers of the Gospel in 
the United States thro' the English Bishops, he offers to ordain 
such person or persons as Congress shall designate as Bishop or 
Bishops in the United States by the true apostolic imposition of 
hands — and agreeable to such ritual as Congress may adopt." 

This information is true — I expect in a few days a copy of the 
Letter. But your time nor friendship can be no apology for me 
adding, — except that I am with the utmost sincerity your friend & 

Hum. Servt.

R. King to D. Kilham. 

Trenton, 12th Dec, 1784. 
Dear Sir : 

I have been here so short a time, that I can say very little to 
you upon the subject of our general affairs ; wait a little time, 
and I will give you a general state of them. This place for the 
residence of Congress has many inconveniences and a motion was 
a few days since made to adjourn to Philadelphia, but passed in 
the negative. We shall however adjourn I think from this place, 
either to the city of New York or to Philadelphia. 

We have before us a serious remonstrance from the Spanish 
Agent against our navigating the River Mississippi ; they deny 
the right under our treaty with the Court of London, and say that 
any American Vessel which may come into that River will be 
confiscated. 

This is a subject that alarms the Southern States, and will 
require a considerable degree of delicacy and firmness to be con- 
ducted with safety. 

No account from the British Court favors the idea of a cordial 
amity towards the United States, and the detention of the Forts 
on the western frontier is probably under positive instruc- 
tion. 

With esteem and friendship, 

R. King.

New York, March 8, 1785. 
My dear Sir : 

. . . I wish to know how you proceed in your affairs : how 
is honest Nat. Carter ? Does he think of me ever as he smokes 
his pipe ? If he does, pray tell him that I am gratified, that my 
idea associates with agreeable objects ; for such alone pass the 
mind of a hearty smoker. You will oblige me in mentioning me 
to Swett that I am truly interested in his friendship and pros- 
perity. I think he deserves as much as he has a prospect of 
obtaining, and his prospect is good in the situation where he is. 
When I shall be fortunate in meeting him and you again, which I 
hope is not far distant, I think I can remark to him some ideas 
which will be to his benefit. 

Smith I suppose gives you a dinner twice or thrice in a winter 
— you take your supper with him, hear a German battle and ogle 
Miss Hannah once a week. . . . 

With real esteem,

R. King to D. Kilham. 

New York, Ap. 26, 1785. 

Yours of the 30th of March was received this evening ; it is 
written in the stile of friendship and with the most obliging ex- 
pressions of attachment ; accept in return my most sincere ac- 
knowledgments, and rely upon this, that my friendship is founded 
on so long an acquaintance, and so full a conviction of ingenuous 
merit, that I shall not soon relinquish it. . . . 

You obligingly inquire of my affairs ; I reply that I never have 
spent any period of my life with so close an application to busi- 
ness, or with so few amusements as since I left you. In a situa- 
tion the duties of which may subject me to public examination, 
and with some little ambition, I have been desirous of pursuing a 
conduct that would not hazard me in the first view, nor dishonor 
me in the second. As to my victim condition, that you say is re- 
ported, I assure you that there could no report be circulated con- 



APPENDIX. 605 



cerning me that would be less true. At present I think it 
improper to bow to beauty or bend to fortune. So negligent 
have I been on this subject, that upon my honor I assure you that 
I think of neither except when I think of home. 

Adieu yours affectionately, 

R. King. 



R. King to D. Kilham. 

New York, July 25th, 1785. 
My dear Sir : 

I have yours of the ninth instant for which accept my thanks. 
Little is to be immediately expected remedial of the embarrass- 
ments which almost the whole of the American Commerce is ex- 
posed to. The Gentlemen in trade, almost universally through 
the States, are uneasy and complaining. It has been the fashion 
to suppose all grievances originated with the British nation ; but 
in this instance much of the pressing difficulty, of which constant 
complaint is making, is to be carried to the account of the exces- 
sive importations made on credit, and the mismanagement of the 
importers in the sale of their merchandize. 

Congress it is said must have additional powers or commerce 
will be totally ruined ; do those, who make this observation, know 
the difficulties of effecting what only costs them a breath to ex- 
press ? Have they considered the mode of effecting their wishes? 
Do they know that one third of the States are individually inter- 
ested in opposing any commercial treaty or negotiation whatever ? 
Have they heard the Southern States remark that their countries 
yielded a plentiful and valuable export in their Indigo, Rice, 
Wheat, & Tobacco — that the freer the trade the more valuable to 
the State possessing these staples — that the more numerous the 
nations are, who come to their countries to buy their produce, the 
greater the competition among the purchasers, and consequently 
the higher the price at which the produce will sell ; whilst the 
quantity of goods in different hands suitable for their market may 
be purchased at a lower price than if the laws of trade restricted 
any power or nation in their intercourse ? 

These are some of the difficulties which will authorise an opin- 
ion that little can at present be expected from Congress. The 



606 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

Eastern States will consent to vest powers in Congress competent 
to a regulation of foreign Commerce, but the Southern States will 
never consent to regulations which will effect what the Northern 
States desire. . . . 

Adieu your's affectionately, 

R. King. 

Supplement — Mr. Adams was received with the usual cere- 
monies and honors at the British Court on the first of June. We 
have dispatches from him, informing only of his reception &c. &c. 
— his private interview with the King must have been curious. 
What he will negotiate time must manifest. Young Mr. Adams 
arrived here a few days since, having left his father about the 
middle of May on his departure for London. As late as the last 
of May the drought had continued to be most severe ; the corn 
will be short in Europe, the herds are greatly diminished for want 
of forage, and the apprehension is great as common in populous 
countries that the human race will suffer from famine. 

This remark may be drawn from this information, that if the 
United States had energy sufficient to prevent the supply of pro- 
visions to the West Indies and wheat to Europe, we should be 
able to negotiate commercial treaties on more advantageous terms 
than at present.

R. King to D. Kilham. 

New York, Aug. 24, 1785. 
My dear Friend : 

. . . When I shall meet you is wholly uncertain ; I fear not 
so soon as I could desire. I am in a situation which perplexes 
me ; was I a man of moderate fortune, I would follow my present 
pursuit ; for I think I could do it with honor and with a prospect 
of some service to my country ; but if this opinion should prevail, 
I must abandon my profession ; by this I could live with con- 
venience, in peace and without hazard ; leaving this quiet pros- 
pect, I find much at hazard and little certainty except constant 
vigilance of numerous enemies, for Parties will exist. I am unde- 
termined.

New York, Oct. 10th, 1785. 
Dear Kilham : 

. . . I thank you for your last of the nth of September. I 
find that some of my friendly admonitions to you were unneces- 
sary. I am perplexed with your opinion upon my subject — Pol- 
iticks or Peace. I do assure you that I balance. Even in my 
profession I could better my prosperity by removing from New- 
buryport. But I think I never shall remove. 

I can only bid you adieu. 

R. King. 



R. King to D. Kilham. 

New York, Oct. 12th, 1785. 
My dear Friend : 

. . . I have nothing politically important to communicate. 
The subject of commercial embarrassments is exhausted — Con- 
gress have no powers — and their recommendations are nugatory. — 
A Treaty of commerce has lately been concluded between Prussia 
and the United States. This Treaty contains some articles in 
favor of humanity and for the protection of the weak, which are 
new and without precedent between any nations. But Prussia un- 
derstands the principles of war better than those of commerce. 
The Treaty gives an important friend to the United States, so far 
as paper, ink and seals can convey, but will in a very small de- 
gree advance their commerce or riches. A negotiation is upon 
the tapis with Spain — but the progress is cautious and slow — and 
when the business will terminate, no mortal can conjecture. 
England will form no Treaty of commerce in her present exas- 
perated temper. The loss of America and the difficulties in Ire- 
land irritate the nation to an extreme degree. However well the 



6o8 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

King's ministers may be upon the subject of a commercial Treaty, 

they will not dare proceed under present circumstances. 

Unless the several States vest power in Congress to regulate 

commerce, or will themselves agree in some uniform measures, 

no Treaty can ever be expected — the reasoning of the British upon 

this subject is so obvious, that I will not state it to you. — But 

enough — I bid you farewell for this time 

And am your 

R. K. 
This is currente calamo. 

To this letter Dr. Kilham gave the following answer : 

"Both yours of the 10th & 12th are come to hand and are 
favors indeed. . . . The Treaty with Prussia was new to me. 
It is always happy when I find a Prince who recollects the cause 
of humanity. . . . What are the advantages expected by the 
mercantile interest of this country from a treaty of commerce 
with G. B. I cannot conceive. Will she stipulate a repeal of her 
navigation laws ? Will she oblige herself by treaty, which is an 
irreversible law, to admit us to a free commerce in her W. I. 
Islands, where she will not admit us by an Act of her Legislature, 
revocable at pleasure ? We have nothing to give her which she 
esteems an equivalent for those favors ; and to expect her to en- 
tertain a partiality for our interest in opposition to her own, we 
must be young indeed. We must devise to make her less neces- 
sary to us by becoming our own manufacturers notwithstanding 
the two mighty objections of want of people and high price of 
labor. The observation is so obvious as to be almost frivolous 
that if our population is small the consumption of manufactures 
must be proportionally so. Our population is quite sufficient for 
a proper division of labor and that is all that can be requisite. 
When there are a sufficient number of subjects for every species 
of industry, they ought to be introduced by Government, for by in- 
creasing the species of industry there will be an increase of the gen- 
eral ?nass of industry, for many children and infirm persons, out 
of the whole variety, will find something to which they may apply 
themselves. 

The high price of labor operates equally against exporting as 
against manufacturing and is the reason why many cargoes are 
sold abroad for less than they cost.

R. King to D. Kilham. 

New York, Deer. 8th, 1785. 
My dear Friend : 

. . . The unaccountable policy of the commercial powers 
of Europe concerning the Barbary powers renders it necessary 
that America should also pay tribute to these Pirates. 

I am very grateful to my friends for any inquiry they may make 
about me or my affairs, and hope before many months elapse to 
convince them in person of the sincerity of this declaration. Not 
even the Ladies of this city, agreeable as many of them are 
shall with all their Frailties detain me. I am, I thank God, no 
prisoner — my system will not admit the idea. Both you and I 
have passed that feverish age, which leads to indiscreet attach- 
ments and subjects the reason to the passions. 

You ask me what are my habits of business, of amusement ; you 
know my disposition upon the general pursuits of life, by having 
observed my practices. I have too much pride to be an ignorant 
man ; and that constant industry to understand, and form dispo- 
sitions of, the complicated and various business before Congress, 
is to me a pleasure and amusement. 

The amusement of leisure men here lies in the frequent and 
elegant private Routs or parties given by the Ladies and Gentle- 
men of the city. In addition to these a public assembly and 
concert alternately every fortnight. A company of players fur- 
nish the pleasures of a theatre three nights every week. I con- 
fess this last amusement is very agreeable, and that I partake of 
it more frequently and with more satisfaction, than of any other 
which this gay City affords. 

This is not a letter from the Delegate, but from your friend 
and is confidential. I embrace you, adieu ! 

R. King. 

R. King to D. Kilham. 

New York, March 5th, 1786. 
My dear Friend : 

. . . Our domestic affairs are greatly embarrassed, the sub- 
ject of revenue is intricate even in the simplest forms of Govern- 
ment ; but complex as our federal Government is, all questions 
of revenue are complicated in the highest degree. A late act of 

vol. II. — 3Q 



6lO LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

Congress, stating some of their money engagements, and their 
means of complying with them, is a plain statement and refers to 
the determination of the States a question infinitely important to 
the existence of the Confederacy. The doctrine of Expedients 
has brought us thus far ; but expedients serve only to postpone, 
and not to remove, the evils which for a time they alleviate. They 
are therefore improper and impolitic in a Republic, where the 
people determine on all governmental acts, and consequently 
ought not only to know, but also to feel, every evil which sur- 
rounds them. A false delicacy has sometimes governed the pub- 
lic acts of Congress ; an apprehension has been formerly enter- 
tained that foreigners would not sufficiently honor and esteem us 
if they knew our real situation. This has been a mistaken policy 
— America was respectable in arms, she was admired. But peace, 
so far from advancing her fame, has diminished her former repu- 
tation ; and there are few nations whose public credit is at so low 
an ebb as our's. The only method of repossessing what we have 
lost, is by giving true information to the people and submitting to 
their judgment the promotion and establishment of their own 
Glory and Honor. . . . 

I am authorized to affirm that I am with the purest esteem and 

regard your sincere and obliged friend, 

Rufus King. 



R. King to D. Kilham. 

New York, Apr. 5th, 1786. 
My dear Kilham : 

Have you wholly forgotten me — if this is the case the event 
which I wish to communicate will afford you no pleasure, but like 
many pieces of uninteresting intelligence will be read and thought 
of no more. I will not believe this to be the case, since the very 
information will be an apology why I have not been so diligent a 
correspondent as you had good right to expect. The lady to 
whom six days since I was married has merits to demand your 
esteem ; and when you know her, which I hope will soon be the 
fact, will convince you that I ought to be, what I really am, ex- 
tremely happy. 

I cannot be particular ; time will not permit it, and perhaps 
the patience of friendship would be exhausted with the detail. I

hope and expect to take you by the hand in June, when we will 
put and answer questions till we are mutually satisfied. 

Pray present my respects where they are due — my gratitude to 
my fellow townsmen was never more lively than at this moment ; 
to them I am indebted for an unmerited partiality and with them 
I hope to spend a life not destitute of grateful recollection. 
Adieu my dear friend — I embrace you. 

R. King. 

R. King to D. Kilham. 

New York, June 17, 1786. 
Dear Kilham : 

I was pleased with the instructions of Newburyport to their 
Representatives, but much more so when I found you was chair- 
man of the committee which reported them for the town's adop- 
tion. They have been reprinted in all the newspapers this way, 
and have received the approbation of liberal men. . . . You 
never have mentioned a word in any of your letters concerning 
Doctor Swett ; by the Gazette account of the medical Society, I 
am satisfied in finding his name mentioned among the living. I 
earnestly wish he may long continue their friend and physician. 
When you see him, be good enough to tell him that there is a 
Doctor White in Congress from North Carolina who has fre- 
quently mentioned to me his acquaintance with Doct. Swett at 
Edinburgh. White is a very clever fellow and loves good Bur- 
gundy as well as his friend Swett. 

I have nothing new to mention to you, except that it is an un- 
pleasant thing to be the daily witness of the humiliating situation 
of the federal government ; without power, destitute of revenue, 
pledged for engagements, and without ability to execute them. 

Adieu. 

R. King. 

R. King to D. Kilham. 

New York, Oct. 29, 1786. 
Dear Sir : 

Two posts have arrived and I heard not a word from any 
member of the General Court. You must be impressed with the 
sentiment that we are extremely anxious to be informed of every 



6l2 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

step taken by the Legislature at this critical juncture of the Gov- 
ernment. What measures you will pursue to preserve the Com- 
monwealth, it is your duty diligently to inquire. Wisdom and 
Fortitude ought most highly to distinguish the present Assembly. 
Upon what they do, or omit, in an eminent degree must depend 
the national safety. The evil is of great magnitude, and the 
remedy must be equally extensive and wholly efficacious. I con- 
fess that I was greatly surprized when in Boston to find such 
apathy among the people when the Government was convulsed 
and the existence of the Commonwealth was in danger. Very few 
men appear to be informed (or if informed continue silent) of the 
dangerous principles avowed by the leaders of the Insurgents. 

These men publicly avow the opinion — that all America, which 
was formerly under the British Government and now within 
the United States, was acquired by the people of the United 
States, and by their joint exertions ; that all men being by 
nature equal, the Property ought to be equally divided among all 
the citizens of the United States ; and that upon the principles of 
this acquisition, and the dissolution of the Government existing 
before the Revolution, all debts contracted before that period are 
annihilated and any attempts to inforce their payment are attempts 
for plunder and robbery. 

I have the best authority for affirming that these pernicious 
principles are cherished and industriously propagated by the lead- 
ers of the Insurgents. If when opinions so fatal to the Common- 
wealth are openly taught and justified, they, who by their office 
are bound to watch for the safety of the Government, content 
themselves with limited applications and detail reforms, when the 
evil is general, and the disease has possessed itself of the vitals, 
there is good reason to despair of the Commonwealth and to give 
up all to Anarchy and confusion. 

Farewell yours sincerely 
Rufus King. 

R. King to D. Kilham. 

New York, Nov. 19, 1786. 
My dear Sir : 

Your account of the proceedings of the General Court has 

afforded me much more information than I had received from any 



APPENDIX. 613 



other quarter ; pray continue to write to me, as you must be con- 
vinced of the anxiety I entertain concerning the public affairs at 
this very critical juncture. I will write to B. T., but I wish you 
had been particular in suggesting the points that I should 
dwell upon. 

I can hardly suppose it possible that he should entertain any 
Ideas unfavorable to public or private credit. As to the griev- 
ances of the People, so loudly and generally complained of, I 
confess myself in opposition to the opinions of those who unite in 
these complaints. Grievances can not be suffered in a Govern- 
ment constituted as our Government is. The laws are the acts 
of a majority of the people — every citizen by the nature of the 
social compact is bound to submit to this majority — the execution 
or administration of such laws are not grievances. If the laws 
are incautiously or unwisely enacted, and the majority think so, 
they may be annulled by the new Legislature — the operation of 
a law, inconvenient or unwise in itself, can continue but a single 
year, because it will be repealed, if the majority unite in opinion 
that it is inconvenient or unwise. No law would be passed which 
would be so enormous or bad, that it would be intolerable for one 
year ; what reason is there then for the complaints, and rash pro- 
ceedings of the present opponents of our Government ? 

I will not add upon this subject — you have fully considered 
and are extremely capable of examining, the subject — my re- 
marks must therefore be either erroneous, or unnecessary because 

they have before passed in your mind. 

Farewell 

R. King. 

We have not yet made a Congress. Who will be President is 
yet uncertain ; probably Mr. Nash of No. Carolina, or Mr. Jno. 
Langdon of New Hampshire should the latter come on. 



R. King to D. Kilham. 

New York, Jan. 28, 1787. 
Dear Kilham : 

. . . Nothing has taken place in the general affairs of the 
Union since I saw you of any consequence except the measures 



6 14 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

that you are well acquainted with. Indeed Congress separated 
in October and have not since been organized. Seven States will 
probably be represented tomorrow, when possibly we may elect 
a President. I pray you to write me. . . . 

Farewell, be assured that I am most affectionately yours, 

Rufus King. 



Dr. Kilham writes to Mr. King about the same date. 

" I think the proceedings of the Gt. in its present sessions must 
give you the greatest pleasure, & the present spirit I doubt not 
will be a remedy superior to the great misfortunes we have actu- 
ally suffered, and to prevent the of Rebellion. They 
passed an act disqualifying all who have acted as non-commis- 
sioned officers or privates from holding any civil or military 
or town offices for a term, and conditioned also from being elec- 
tors in the choice of any of these offices. This we hope will 
be a security against corruption in the approaching election. 
Gen. Lincoln is to be continued with a force of iooo or 1500 men 
in the disaffected counties till the peace shall appear to be per- 
fectly restored and confirmed. The time being nearly expired for 
which the first drafts were made, they are to be replaced by them- 
selves or others, and good funds are provided for their subsist- 
ence and payment. This last circumstance is the most material. 
Gentlemen of property are growing prudent and begin to insure 
by advancing liberally, and the dishonest part of the Legislature 
begin to discern that faith is as necessary in politics as in religion. 

" After the spirit of Rebellion is completely subdued the busi- 
ness will be half done ; a spirit of obedience and industry is to 
be restored which is the greatest object of Legislation. 

" I have learned by the Gazette that Congress have assembled. 
The affairs of the Union are daily growing more serious. I 
should be much gratified to know what order will be taken on 
them. In my last I wrote you on the subject of the Con- 
vention. I hope to have your opinion before you receive this. 
To me the difficulties appear unsurmountable." 



APPENDIX. 615 



R. King to Daniel Kilham. 

New York, Nov. 25, 1787. 

It is a long time since I heard anything from you. Permit me 
to inquire of you how the public opinion stands relative to the 
measures of Government in the suppression of the Rebellion ? 
How goes Electioneering ? Men and measures are now very inti- 
mately united. Displace men and you disapprove measures such 
men supported. 

Farewell 

R. King. 

On the reverse of this, without date, is the following in 
Dr. Kilham's handwriting : 

" I have of late been absent, therefore did not receive your's of 
25th ult. till you must have learnt the public opinion on the 
subject of your enquiry. 

" You will perceive by the new Elections that the public are 
dissatisfied & very unhappy & so long as the people remain their 
own governors and mistake the cause of their misfortunes they 
must continue so. In this country there will be almost a total 
change of Senators — those most probably elected are Mr. Good- 
hue, Mr. Coffin, Mr. Wood, Mr. Osgood ; some of whom have 
never been men in any public office. There will undoubtedly 
be as great changes in the House, but what they will be is yet too 
early to determine. Many draw the most unfavorable conclu- 
sions from these circumstances. I do not. If the people are 
pleased with their governors they will more patiently submit to 
the government, and it is essential that a free people should be 
satisfied with their Rulers. After the present change the people 
I wish may begin to be composed, but if not, though I believe G. 
himself scarcely knows by what operation it is to be effected, 
some material change must take place in our national government. 
So many men & so much property can never be without some 
government, & if they are very corrupt and very licentious, it 
must be an absolute one, which G. avert — I expect to hear from 
you in B." (No signature.) 



6l6 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

APPENDIX II. 

Endorsed in Rufus King's handwriting : 
"Conference with Ld. Grenville Aug. ioth, 1796." 

According to Ld. Grenville's appointment I waited on him at 
11 o'ck A.M. 

I stated to him that I brought with me Dispatches altogether 
favorable to a firm Friendship & perfect Harmony between our 
two Countries and that my endeavours would be directed to this 
object. 

After shewing him my second Commission authorizing a con- 
tinuation of Mr. Jay's Negotiation, &c, I observed that the objec- 
tion to the XII Article was the limitation of the Tonnage, and 
the Restriction not to export from the U. S. certain enumerated 
articles — that altho' formerly perhaps f of our Vessels, employed 
in the W. In. Trade were at or under 70 tons, that now perhaps 
not one in Eight of our Sea Vessels were of so small a Tonnage — 
that the duration of the article wd. not in Prudence permit the 
building of New Vessels, and besides that they wd. be un- 
profitable as nearly the same men and expenses would navigate 
a vessel of perhaps 100 tons, and that in the carrying of Lumber 
the Freight wd. not be an object in a vessel of that Tonnage. 

That in respect to the Restriction not to export the enumerated 
articles, we had thought we might agree in applying it solely to 
such as were reed, from the Br. Islands, and that our system of 
Drawbacks wd. execute the Stipulations — but that on a fuller 
consideration, we had found that if we entered into this Stipula- 
tion with G. B. the other Powers holding W. In. Cols. wd. expect 
us to form a similar Stipulation, the consequence of wh. would 
be to reinstate the Article in its originally objectionable shape. 
That we thought the regulations of little consequence to G.B. in- 
asmuch as we shd. rarely take from them any articles except their 
Rum ; their other productions being ordinarily higher in their 
price than in the neighbouring Islands. Besides all the coloniz- 
ing Powers had for the last half Century opened their W. In. Cols, 
in time of war without any such Restriction and that it would be 
better to suffer the Commerce to stand on its ordinary Footing 



APPENDIX. 617 



which wd. give us a share of it in time of war, than to form a 
Stipulation that would contain the Restraints proposed. 

Lord Grenville said that the limitation of the tonnage was de- 
sired by them on the same principle as they wished a Restraint 
agt. our re-exporting W. In. Produce — that they wished to pre- 
vent our becoming the carriers of their W. In. Produce to the 
different European Powers — that they had not been sensible that 
so few of our vessels were of the proposed tonnage — that it would 
be requisite that he shd. confer on these Points with those at the 
Head of the Trade and Colony Systems, &c. &c. 

I then observed that no subject was so embarrassing as that of 
our Seamen — and that I hardly knew how to express myself re- 
specting it — that I fear our claims might be wide of each other, 
and that the true mean wd. be difficult to agree in. His Lordship 
said that he was sensible of the Difficulty ; that placing himself 
on our side it was obvious, and he requested me to take his Place 
for a moment in order to perceive the motives which influenced 
them — that their Navy was their safeguard — that their Admirals 
and Admiralty Board were constantly complaining that the navy 
was decaying from the Embarrassment experienced in manning 
their Ships — that the British Seamen were escaping the public 
service by engaging in the American Employ and challenging the 
Protection of the American Flag. 

I said that my Ideas were far from settled on any precise plan 
— that we thought, after fair reflection, and a full view of the 
situation of the claim of G. B., that we were entitled to pass the 
High Seas without interruption — that when we came within the 
Br. Jurisdiction a right of Examination in order to obtain Br. 
Seamen wd. not be contested — that in the Ports of the Kingdom 
some Embarrassment might result from the Examination, yet it 
wd. be much less than would be the Case in the Colonies where 
the exercise of this Claim was very injurious to our Citizens, and 
ruinous in some cases to our Merchants. 

That if we could by convention adjust these Points in a fair 
and reasonable manner, it would wonderfully tend to promote 
Friendship & Good Will between us. 

That a Plan of Protection had been adopted, (here I explained 
to Ld. G. the Tenor of the late Law, which his Lordship appeared 
to have in some degree misconceived and to have thought very 



6l8 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

lightly of) but the ex parte Representations would be of little 
avail to compose the public opinion entertained on either side : 
hence the advantage of an adjustment by Convention : that the 
Proofs after all would constitute the real Difficulty. We did not 
desire to withdraw from their Duty their people, in order to en- 
gage them in our Employ ; our only wish was to secure our own 
People from being forced out of our Ships, whereby they were 
injured and our Commerce exposed to infinite Embarrassment. 

Lord Grenville said that with respect to an exemption from 
examination, &c, on the High Seas, unless great latitude was 
given to their Doctrine of the four Seas, &c, the Position would 
differ from what they had practiced, and as they supposed with- 
out injustice to for. stations — that they man their Navy by 
cruising with their Frigates in the chops of the Channel where 
they met their Merchantmen, which, as soon as they have come 
near their Ports, usually suffer their seamen to go on Shore, leav- 
ing only the Officers & a Boy or two, with Protections on board 
to Navigate the Vessel. 

It was understood between Lord G. & me that this conversa- 
tion shd. be viewed as only breaking the Subject, that he shd. 
consult with Lord Spencer and his Colleagues, and that instead 
of writing we shd. freely converse on this and such other Topics 
as shd. come up, and shd. we advance towards any Result, that 
then it shd. be put in Paper. 

Lord Grenville here adverted to our late Law authorizing the 
appointment of an Agent to reside in their VV. Ind ; he said he 
wished this measure had been considered, and if it should have 
been found proper, that Instructions shd. have been given to their 
Governors &c respecting it — that at present it was not allowed to 
any Nation to send an Agent into yr. colonies, that looking at 
their laws, he apprehended that their Governors wd. not think 
themselves authorized to permit the Residence of such a charac- 
ter, and he felt uneasy lest the sending away of such agent should 
be unfavorably construed in America. I suggested the expedi- 
ency of an early attention to the subject, promised a copy of the 
Law and intimated the idea of an Instruction wh. shd. allow such 
agent to reside, say in Jamaica, there to receive applications from 
Amer. Seamen &c, confining his agency to a correspondence with 
the Govr., who shd. in this respect have authority to enquire of 



APPENDIX. 619 



their Navy officers. This arrangement suggested itself from Ld. 
G's having said that a secret correspondence between such Agent 
and the Admirals, Captains & seamen would undiscipline their 
Navy. 

We were here interrupted by a Messenger with Letters, wh. 
Lord Grenville on opening found to come from the D. Portland's 
office, being dispatches of the 11 & 18 June from Lord Dor- 
chester. He read them and said he wd. send me copies. They 

stated Cap. Lewis' arrival at Quebec, his dispatches from 

and his arrangements to give up the Posts immediately, wh. he 
says Cap. Lewis desired might be delayed till our Troops arrived 
to receive them. The last letter mentions Lewis' Departure from 
Quebec & the order being issued to the several Posts by the Adj. 
Genl., duplicates of wh. were given to Cap. Lewis for the delivery 
of the Posts to the American Detachments. 

I mentioned to Ld. Grenville that it would be satisfactory, 
could I have it in my Power to say when I wrote to America that 
the Commissioners on their and our part had formed their Board 
and that the preparatory arrangements were in train for their 
commencing business. He replied that Mr. Hammond had reed, 
his instructions to have the Commission to yr. Commrs. prepared, 
and he had signed an order for the placing the Great Seal to it, 
but that Mr. H's departure wh. was sudden, had produced some 
delay ; that the measure shd. advance, and if the Commissioners 
could agree to meet on Saturday or Monday, he wd. endeavor 
that Dr. Nicholl & Mr. Anstey should be previously furnished 
with their commissions. 

I then asked his Lordship whether he had any Evidence of the 
authenticity of the Letter published a day or two since, as from 
the Directory to M. Barthelemi, announcing the determination to 
stop neutral cargoes bound to Br. Ports, &c, &c. He said he be- 
lieved it authentic, but had no other than the same Evidence that 
was before the Public, that he had intended to have spoken to me 
about it, indeed he had been desirous of writing to me in order 
that I might have it in my power to contradict the allegation that 
G. B. had issued any order of the tenor alleged in the letter in 
question, but that he did not know how to take notice of a Docu- 
ment of the authenticity of whh. he was not fully and regularly 
ascertained ; but that he expected shortly to hear from the King's 



620 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

minister at Basle, when if the Document proved, as he believed it, 
true, he would write me a letter on the subject. 

He added on my enquiry that no new order had been issued on 
the subject of captures, &c. 



APPENDIX III. 

The great importance of the proper adjustment of the 
questions involved in the settlement of the claims of Ameri- 
can citizens against Great Britain, under the 7th article of 
Jay's treaty, is sufficient warrant for giving here the long 
dispatch of Mr. King to the Secretary of State, showing 
both the ability and excellent spirit with which the case was 
stated and maintained by Mr. King and responded to in 
the same temper by Lord Grenville and the Lord Chancellor. 
The consequence was, as will be seen, that the proceedings 
of the Commission, which had been interrupted and seemed 
likely to come to an end without accomplishing the purpose 
for which the Commission was appointed, were renewed and 
continued, with one slight break, until the claims were set- 
tled to the satisfaction of both governments. 

In the letter of January 14, 1797, to the Secretary of State, 
Mr. King refers to the embarrassments which had occurred 
in the proceedings of the Commissioners in London, under 
the 7th article of the treaty with Great Britain, and which 
had been happily removed, and promised a more detailed 
report of the occurrences. This report, with that of an ad- 
ditional conversation with Lord Grenville on the subject, is 
presented in this appendix. 

R. King to the Secretary of State. 

London, Feby. 26th, 1797. 
Dear Sir : 

Having already informed you, that the embarrassments, which 
have been experienced by the Commissioners under the 7th arti- 
cle of the Treaty with this country had been satisfactorily removed, 



APPENDIX. 62 1 



it may seem useless that I should send you a particular report on 
that subject. But as the provisions of the 6th article are analo- 
gous to those of the 7th, the proceedings which have taken place 
respecting the latter may have some influence in giving a con- 
struction to the former, and hence the propriety of your being 
made acquainted with them. 

The repeated objections to the jurisdiction of the Commission- 
ers, having about the middle of December brought the board to a 
stand, I considered it to be my duty to ask of Lord Grenville 
a conference upon the subject, which took place on the 16th of 
December in the following manner. 

I have desired this conference, my Lord, in order to state from 
the communications of the American Commissioners what I under- 
stand to be the situation of the Questions that have been brought 
before them ; it is my duty to report the same to my Government ; 
but it is previously proper to ascertain with precision how far the 
proceedings under the directions of the King's Advocate General 
are to be considered as having received the approbation of his 
Majesty's Government, and whether they are to be followed up 
in the consequences to which they lead. A case of each class 
into which the American claims divide themselves has been 
brought before the Commissioners by Mr. Bayard, the American 
agent. These cases, pursuant to a rule of proceeding adopted by 
the Board, have been severally notified to Mr. Gostling, the King's 
Proctor, who has, in each case, given in an answer denying the 
jurisdiction of the Commissioners. Thus in the class of cases, 
which have been decided in the High Court of Appeals, Mr. Gost- 
ling replies that the Commissioners have no jurisdiction, because 
the sentence of that Court is definitive : in the class depending be- 
fore the High Court of Admiralty, and before the High Court of 
Appeals, that the Commissioners have no jurisdiction, because 
the claimants, if entitled, may obtain compensation in the ordi- 
nary course of justice ; in the class, in which unsatisfactory De- 
crees have been rendered in the lower Courts, and against which, 
for various reasons, appeals have not been claimed, or prosecuted, 
that the Commissioners have no jurisdiction because it has been 
from the neglect of the claimants, that they are unable to obtain 
compensation in the ordinary course of justice. — The consequence 
of which replies appears to be that there is no case in which the 



622 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

Commissioners can act. — The Commissioners on the part of his 
Majesty's Government have moreover intimated an opinion that 
it was their duty, in every case in which the King's Proctor should 
deny the jurisdiction of the Board, to abstain from deciding such 
question of jurisdiction, and to refer the cases to their Government 
for instruction ; and that, in case a majority of the Board of 
Commissioners shall differ from them in this opinion, it would be 
lawful for them to withdraw and thereby incapacitate the Board 
from deciding such Question. 

I am not prepared, said Lord Grenville, to answer officially 
upon this subject. I have read over the Papers presented to the 
Commissioners by Mr. Bayard, and the answers of Mr. Gostling, 
and they are in circulation preparatory to a meeting of the Council, 
where the subject must be considered before I can give you a 
regular answer. I have no difficulty, however, in communicating 
to you my way of thinking upon most of the points. Without 
making professions, I may be allowed to say that I have an 
earnest desire that this Business should proceed in a satisfactory 
manner. I labored much in forming the Treaty with America, 
and I have considered it as an act that was likely to afford me 
much pleasure and some reputation. I must, therefore, wish the 
removal of every obstruction that can in any way defeat the ob- 
ject of my labor ; but we are obliged, sir, to pay great deference 
to every thing connected by law, or usage, with our national 
marine, which forms our national safeguard. England, therefore, 
holds high those maxims of the Law of Nations, which respect 
maritime questions, and she has always maintained what this Law 
sanctions, that every nation has a perfect right by her own Tri- 
bunals to decide questions of Prize. Her Supreme Court for the 
trial of such questions is composed of characters distinguished for 
their learning and respectable for their rank ; it is the Highest 
and most honorable Court of the Nation, excepting only the 
House of Lords. It is natural, therefore, that we should en- 
deavour to preserve all possible respect for, and by every suitable 
means prevent the existence of a doubt concerning, the justice of 
this Court. I am fearful, continued Lord Grenville, that these 
questions have been unadvisedly raised ; a few which might have 
been omitted, have given birth to reflections, that with a little more 
caution would not have existed. Mr. Bayard should not have 



APPENDIX. 623 



alleged, an illegal and unjust decree of the High Court of Appeals, 
as the ground of his applications to the Commissioners. In cases 
of Costs, Demurrage, Freight, &c, in which there have been no 
appeals, and in which the omission or delay can be accounted for ; 
in cases under the order of the 6th of Novr. ; in cases where new 
evidence can be procured ; in cases where a general opinion pre- 
vailed that it would be of no advantage to appeal ; and possibly 
in other cases, there would be a propriety, said Lord Grenville, 
that the Commissioners should afford relief. In respect to the 
cases in which the Decrees of the High Court of Appeals were 
not satisfactory, it is now somewhat difficult to form a correct 
opinion. Had no question arisen, it would be much less embar- 
rassing. It would seem to be an extraordinary situation for 
England to place herself in, to appear before the Commissioners 
to contest a precise charge of illegality and injustice in the Decree 
of the High Court of Appeals, and upon a re-examination of the 
matter of such Decrees to see them reversed. Would not the rule 
that each Nation has an exclusive right of deciding maritime 
questions be weakened thereby ? Might not foreign Nations, 
hereafter, impeach the justice of our High Court of Appeals and 
adduce in support of their charge a decision of these Commis- 
sioners reversing its Decrees ? It must not, however, be under- 
stood that the King's Government will of course support the pleas 
offered by Mr. Gostling. The Government employ him as their 
Proctor, who in imitation of the lawyer of other clients, will en- 
deavour to make the best defense for his principal, and in doing 
so may offer a plea that the Commissioners will perhaps adjudge 
a bad one. The conduct of our Commissioners, continued Lord 
Grenville, appears to have been cautious and prudent, the right to 
withdraw is perhaps countenanced by that part of the 7th Article 
that requires the presence of one commissioner at least of each 
side ; thus leaving with the respective Governments a power, by 
instructing their Commissioners to withdraw, to prevent the deci- 
sion of any question not intended to be submitted to them. Thus 
if ihe Lot should give to Great Britain the fifth Commissioner 
under the 6th Article, and these Commissioners should attempt 
to draw within their jurisdiction questions clearly without the 
same, perhaps the American Government might instruct their 
Commissioners to withdraw and thereby in such cases arrest the 



624 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

proceedings of the Board. Under all circumstances, said Lord 
Grenville, it may be adviseable to defer for the present giving any 
information to your Government upon this subject. I shall proba- 
bly be able to answer officially in the course of a week and the 
Packet will sail in the beginning of January : If you think it requi- 
site in the present posture of the Business to write to your Gov- 
ernment, I must also write to Mr. Liston. 

I am quite content, my Lord, to defer writing in hopes that it 
will become unnecessary ; I will however ask your Lordship's at- 
tention to a few short observations at this time ; and I will begin 
by observing, that I am persuaded, and might add that I know, 
that the few objectionable points which are found in Mr. Bayard's 
memorials to the Commissioners, did not originate with us ; they 
were suggested by and added at the instance of Doct. Nicholl, 
one of your Commissioners, and of this fact I will take care to 
furnish your Lordship with satisfactory proof. We adopted the 
language of the Treaty, which was sufficient for our purpose, and 
were, therefore, without inclination or motive to impute injus- 
tice to the High Court of Appeals. We well understood that the 
Commissioners were not to be considered in the precise light of 
an appellate Court, having authority to reverse the Decrees which 
have been rendered in any of his Majesty's Courts of Admiralty, 
or to order the restoration of the thing which had been condemned 
by them. The Remedy of the Treaty, instead of such restoration, 
is a compensation in money for the loss of it, which supposes the 
sentence of condemnation, as between the original parties, to 
stand unreversed, and the property vested accordingly. We, how- 
ever, never doubted, nor, in our opinion, does the language of the 
Treaty permit a doubt, that we may demand compensation, in 
money to be paid by his Majesty's Government for losses and 
damages sustained by reason of the condemnation, as well as on 
account of the irregular capture of our ships and cargos. Without 
going into a particular examination of the Article, I can not sup- 
pose that any difference of opinion will exist upon its true con- 
struction in this respect. Disclaiming the opinion that the 
Commissioners can reverse the Decrees of your Courts of Ad- 
miralty so as to affect the title to the property held under them, 
we conceive that every question to be decided by the Commis- 
sioners is between different parties, and that their awards will 



APPENDIX. 625 



operate not against the original Captors, but upon the King's 
Treasury. 

But, my Lord, I am not surprized that difficulties of this sort 
have arisen without ascribing improper, much less impure, motives 
to Doctr. Nicholl, from whom they have proceeded, or to any 
others of the learned corps to which he belongs. I will take the 
liberty to observe, that I have apprehended a strong and sys- 
tematical, as well as a skilful and persevering opposition to any 
interpretation of the Treaty, which will remove the many Ameri- 
can Causes depending in the Courts of Admiralty and submit 
them to an extraordinary and more summary Tribunal. It is 
natural enough that this should happen — three or four hundred 
Causes, prudently managed, would prove very profitable, and for a 
long time so. This is a delicate suggestion, and I rely upon your 
Lordship's candor for my apology. Of one fact, we can give your 
Lordship the strongest assurances, which is, that we have no pref- 
erence of mere forms ; that which shall be efficacious to pro- 
cure for us the compensation we claim and expect, and which 
shall be most satisfactory to you will be most agreeable to us. 

Lord Grenville entered into no farther observations on the sub- 
ject and concluded the conference by expressing a wish that 
I would have a conversation upon the subject with the Lord 
Chancellor. 

On the next day I met the Lord Chancellor at the Duke of 
Portland's, who told me that he was desirous of conversing with 
me respecting Questions which had arisen relative to the powers 
of the Commissioners. On my replying that I should be happy 
to meet him at any time that he should appoint, he named the 
next morning. I accordingly waited on him, when he began by 
observing, I have been reading Mr. Bayard's & Mr. Gostling's 
papers, and I do not think either of them such as they ought to 
be. It was not necessary for Mr. Bayard to allege formally, that 
the Decree of the High Court of Appeals was illegal and unjust, 
in order to make out a case proper for the examination of the 
Commissioners. It seems to me, therefore, that Mr. Bayard 
should take back, or amend, or prefer in a different form his 
claim, so that it should adopt and follow the terms of the Arti- 
cle ; and on the other side, these general demurrers of Mr. Gost- 
ling are absurd and he must take them back. The reasons 

VOL. II. — 40 



626 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

assigned by him against the Jurisdiction of the Commissioners, or 
in bar of the claim, are the very cases which it was intended 
should be examined and decided by the Commissioners. I told 
the Lord Chancellor that his observations confirmed me in my 
opinions, and then stated to him the observations which I had 
made to Lord Grenville. Having with me an abstract of the 
Papers of Mr. Bayard and Mr. Gostling, I referred to several of 
the cases, and the Lord Chancellor concurred in the remarks that 
I made respecting them. Adverting to the Case of the Betsy, 
Furlong Master, in which the High Court of appeals had con- 
firmed the condemnation in toto, I suggested that this was under- 
stood to be a case in which upon every principle the claimants 
ought to be compensated ; and saying this, I asked the Chancellor 
in what manner and on what allegations it could in his opinion be 
brought before the Commissioners — He replied that the Decree 
might have been proper as between the captor and claimant, 
though the claimant might thereby have suffered loss and damage, 
on account of which according to the stipulation of the Treaty, 
he may have a fair demand upon the King for compensation ; 
that therefore it might be alleged that on all the circumstances 
of the case, the claimant was under the Treaty entitled to com- 
pensation for loss and damage from the King's Treasury. 

I said that I was apprehensive that the Corps of civilians would 
embarrass us. He replied that he thought he had seen in that 
question a dislike to the article and to the proceedings of the 
Commissioners ; but that if Mr. Gostling persisted in his Demur- 
rers, they must change him. I again alluded to an opposition 
from Doctor's Commons, and added that I had understood that 
they expressed themselves pretty strongly upon this subject — some- 
times intimating an opinion that the order of the King for pro- 
longing the time within which appeals could be claimed was 
illegal, and at others, going still farther and declaring that the 
King had no right or power to make a Treaty, stipulating what is 
contained in the 7th Article. The Chancellor said, this was go- 
ing very far indeed — that he however was not a stranger to the 
character of Doctor's Commons, that he had himself found some 
trouble with them, and related a decision that had lately taken 
place in the Probate of a will which appeared extraordinary ; he 
added that Sir William Scott was undoubtedly a fair and honora- 



APPENDIX. 62 7 



ble character, and in his belief would be disposed to give the 
natural and proper course to the business that should be brought 
before the Commissioners. I expressed my hope that this would 
be the case and observed that the complaints of our merchants 
and the commercial injuries which we sustained induced Mr. 
Jay's mission — that we have always conceived that these cases were 
to be fairly and liberally examined and that those who have suf- 
fered were to be fully compensated — that in respect to the amount, 
great or small, if just, it was due ; and the sum was of small con- 
sequence compared to a liberal settlement which should inspire 
harmony and a friendly correspondence between the two coun- 
tries. The Chancellor replied that these reflections were cer- 
tainly just. I suppose, said he, the sum will be large, but that is 
of no importance. He then expressed a desire to see our Com- 
missioners, and concluded by asking me to send him a formula, 
such as I would approve, to be used by Mr. Bayard in presenting 
our claims to the Commissioners. 

On the following day I sent him the formula ; and likewise 
sent to Lord Grenville a copy of a letter written to me by Messrs. 
Gore and Pinkney, explaining the manner in which the objec- 
tionable part of Mr. Bayard's memorials had been adopted. My 
note to Lord Grenville likewise supplied an omission that had 
occurred on my part in the conference I had had with him. The 
following is a copy of the note : 

Mr. King presents his compliments to Lord Grenville, and in order that the 
origin of the form employed by Mr. Bayard in presenting the claims of the 
American citizens to the Comms. under the 7th Article of the Treaty between 
his Britanc. Majesty and the United States may be fully understood, he takes 
the liberty for his Lordship's information, to inclose the copy of a letter on the 
subject, that he has received from Messrs. Gore & Pinkney the Amer. Comrs. 
In reviewing the conference which Mr. King had the honor to hold with Lord 
Grenville on Friday, it occurred to him that he had omitted to state to his Lord- 
ship an opinion that he has supposed to be correct, respecting a point of some 
importance which his Lordship may have seen in a light somewhat different 
from that in which it has appeared to Mr. King. 

Mr. King alludes to the intimation of an opinion on the part of the British 
Commissioners that in every case in which the jurisdiction of the Board of Com- 
missioners should be questioned by his Majesty's Proctor, it would be proper that 
the Board should refer such question to the decision of the two Nations and in 
the meantime forbear to act respecting such case — and that if after the sugges- 
tion of a question of jurisdiction by his Majesty's Proctor, the Board should at- 



628 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUE US KING. 



tempt to proceed, it would be justifiable in the British Commissioners to with- 
draw and thereby prevent the Board from acting on any question that should 
arise in such case. The provision in the Treaty which requires the presence of 
at least one Comr. of each party to make a Board, is supposed to authorize this 
course of proceeding ; and a supposed case of an obviously improper extension 
of jurisdiction has been stated as one, that would require to be thus arrested. 

Without detaining his Lordship with a recital of the numerous references, and 
endless negotiations that must result from this practice, it seems pertinent to 
observe, that neither of the reasons appear sufficient to excuse, much less to 
authorize, so hazardous a course. It was essential to the impartiality of the 
Board, and conformable to common usage in private submissions, that one of 
the arbitrators named on each side should be present at the examination and 
discussion of every question : but has it ever from hence been inferred, that the 
arbitrators of either party could with propriety be withdrawn in order to arrest 
the hearing and defeat the decision of the question submitted ; or, is this the 
only, and therefore the proper, mode of avoiding the inconveniences of the de- 
cision of a question, not submitted, or without the jurisdiction of the Commission- 
ers ? The decision of a question not submitted, or without the jurisdiction of the 
Comrs. would be utterly void and in no degree obligatory. If, for example, the 
Board should receive a complaint, and award the payment of money in the case of 
a capture that happened since the exchange of the Ratification of the Treaty, or 
before the commencement of the existing war, as such award would be plainly 
without jurisdiction in the Board, it would be void, and his Majesty's Govern- 
ment would not be bound to pay the money so irregularly and illegally awarded ; 
and so in every case in which the Commissioners should make a decision with- 
out, or beyond the limits of their jurisdiction ; and in this principle which seems 
incontrovertible in public as well as in municipal law, is found a perfect security 
against every irregularity of this sort that can be imagined or apprehended. Mr. 
King has taken the liberty to present these hasty reflections to Lord Grenville, 
which he omitted when this topic was the subject of their late conversation : as 
that was understood to be not official, Mr. King requests the favor of Lord 
Grenville, to receive these observations as a part of that conversation which was 
omitted. 

Great Cumberland Place, Dec. 18th, 1796. 

Nothing further occurred till the 26th of Dec, when on the in- 
vitation of the Lord Chancellor, Messrs. Trumbull, Gore and 
Pinkney accompanied me to his Lordship's house ; who, after the 
customary salutations, observed that he had gone over all the 
cases, except one, which had been presented by the Commission- 
ers ; and that he thought these cases would divide themselves into 
three classes. 

The First, including the cases of condemnation in the High 
Court of Appeals, 



APPENDIX. 629 



The Second, including the cases in which there have been Decrees 
of restoration, but without costs and damages and if con- 
demnation without freight and costs. 

The Third, including the cases in which the right of appeal had 
been lost. 

In respect to the first class, the Lord Chancellor said that the 
Decrees must stand ; that they settled the property and could not 
be affected by any act of the Commissioners. There may have 
been sufficient reasons for the Court of Appeals to condemn as the 
questions stood before them — and nevertheless there may exist a 
fair and equitable claim upon the King's Treasury, under the pro- 
visions of the Treaty for complete compensation for the losses 
sustained by such condemnations. 

The like observation is applicable to the second class ; the de- 
cree of restoration in the opinion of the claimant was just, but he 
thinks it did not go far enough and claims Costs and Damages ; 
and the decree of condemnation in certain cases has been legal, 
but the claimant expected freight ; the captures under the order 
of the 6th of Novr. fall within this class. Here the captors had 
colour of authority to seize and send in for adjudication : the 
Court would restore the property, but would not condemn the 
captors in Costs ; and yet it will be just that the claimants should 
receive his Costs and Damages. 

In respect to the Third Class, the Court of Appeals were obliged 
in some instances to refuse the appeal, because a limited time 
having been allowed to prefer the appeal, and that time having 
expired, the captors thereby acquired Rights, not within the dis- 
cretion of the High Court of Appeals to impair. Still the claimant 
may be able in a satisfactory manner to account for his not having 
come seasonably forward with his appeal. This is undoubtedly a 
case within the provisions of the Treaty. The property will not, 
it cannot, be restored ; but the full value thereof may be, and in 
such cases, must be paid out of the King's Treasury. 

The Commissioners are not a Court of Appeals, above our High 
Court of Appeals : they are however competent to re-examine 
questions decided by the High Court of Appeals as well as all 
other cases described in the Treaty ; and they can give redress, 
not by reversing Decrees, already passed, and restoring the iden- 



630 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

tical property, but by ascertaining the amount of the Loss or 
Damages that the claimant has sustained and awarding the pay- 
ment thereof to be made by his Majesty's Treasury. The Chan- 
cellor continued by saying, he had examined the case of the 
Betsey — Furlong, Master ; there is no reason, said the Chancellor, 
assigned by the Judge of Bermuda sufficient for the condemna- 
tion. The circumstance of this capture's being made as the vessel 
was coming out of Guadaloupe (which Island, Admiral Jarvis, in 
a letter he wrote upon the subject, declares to have been blockaded 
from the date of the arrival of his Majesty's fleet in the West In- 
dies) did not authorize the Vice- Admiralty to condemn her, nor 
for this cause & any of those alleged by the Vice-Admiralty Judge, 
could the High Court of Appeals have affirmed the decree of con- 
demnation. The question of Blockade is one of fact ; there 
cannot be a blockade by construction : the capture must be by 
the fleet, or ship, which makes the blockade ; and the vessel must 
be in the act of attempting to enter the blockaded place — A vessel 
on her voyage, and at a distance, but intending to go to a place 
blockaded, is not for such intention liable to capture, but two 
points which were new, and which the claimants could not be pre- 
pared to meet, were made before the H. C. of Appeals ; one was, 
that Patterson, one of the claimants, was a British subject ; the 
other, that another of the owners was domiciliated at Guadaloupe. 
Now if the claimants are able to controvert these points, and can 
shew the allegations not to be true, the Commissioners will cer- 
tainly award compensation for their Loss and Damage to be paid 
out of his Majesty's Treasury. The Chancellor added that he 
thought the Formula that I had sent him was a proper one ; that 
in his opinion, it would be adviseable that Mr. Bayard should take 
back his memorials and prefer others ; and that Mr. Gostling 
must take back his Demurrers. Upon its being suggested that 
the same embarrassments might arise in future, if upon every ob- 
jection to the competency of the Commissioners, a reference must 
be made to the respective Governments for their Instructions, in- 
stead of such questions being decided by the Commissioners 
themselves, the Chancellor said that the doubt respecting the 
authority of the Commissioners to settle their own jurisdiction 
was absurd ; and that they must necessarily decide upon a case's 
being within, or without, their competency. 



APPENDIX. 63I 



Soon after this conference with the Lord Chancellor, Parlia- 
ment adjourned for the Christmas Holidays, and the business of 
the Commissioners remained suspended till the 24th of January, 
when by appointment I met Lord Grenville at his office, who in- 
formed me that he had experienced much uneasiness on account 
of the delays which had taken place in the business of the Com- 
missioners ; but they had not been able sooner to come to a 
decision respecting the subject of our former conferences. He 
now hoped that the Commissioners would go on with farther in- 
terruption. He had sent for (he said) their Commissioners and 
had told them " that it was the opinion of the King's Govern- 
ment that they should proceed in examining and deciding every 
question that should be brought before them according to the con- 
viction of their consciences ; in doing which they would examine 
cases already decided and award on them and all others according 
to the Provisions of the Treaty, which it would likewise be their 
duty to consider and interpret." 

Lord Grenville added, that they had thought it would not be 
adviseable to put any thing in writing, as that would have the ap- 
pearance of a new or explanatory article ; and he thought there 
would not arise any future embarrassment. I replied, that I was 
happy to perceive that the business would now proceed ; that I 
had no desire that anything should be in writing : but as many 
persons were interested in the questions depending before the 
Commissioners, and as a rumour had gone abroad that the busi- 
ness had for some time been at a stand, which rumour would un- 
doubtedly reach America, I should think it proper, in order that 
no inconvenience should proceed from these reports, to state the 
result of the Conferences that I had had with him ; I added that 
so confident had I been, that ultimately there could not be a dif- 
ference of opinion, that I had already ventured to say that I was 
persuaded that every embarrassment would be removed — and 
concluded my reply by saying that I should have great pleasure 
in being able in consequence of what had now passed, to write to 
my Government that, agreeable to my former intimation, 1 was 
authorized to say that the Commissioners would in future proceed 
to consider & decide, according to the provisions of the Treaty, 
every question that should be brought before them. I thought 
the occasion a suitable one to insinuate an opinion respecting the 



632 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 



instruction of that part of the Treaty which limits the time within 
which claims must be presented to the Commissioners ; after 
speaking of a letter that I had written to his Lordship complain- 
ing of the delays of Sir James Marriott's Court, which Lord 
Grenville observed was in train to bring the subject under con- 
sideration, I said that I sincerely hoped the High Court of Ap- 
peals would also proceed with greater expedition than hitherto 
they had done ; that for various considerations it was much to be 
desired that the many American Cases now before the Court, as 
well as those which may soon be expected to be there, should be 
decided by them, in preference to the Commissioners. But the 
limitation of time within which our claims must be presented to 
the Commissioners, necessarily limits the time during which the 
Court of Appeals can have the custody of these causes ; and all of 
them, undecided by the Court, upon the last day for the reception 
of claims by the Commissioners, will undoubtedly be removed 
before that Board, who would thereafter be fully competent to 
examine and decide them. As the Commissioners could not, in 
like manner with the Court of Appeals, decree the restoration of 
the property by the captors, but must award compensation in 
money to be paid by the King's Treasury, the Government have 
an interest that may perhaps urge the H. Court of Appeals to 
make greater dispatch. 'T is true the Commissioners may order 
assignments, which will put the Government in the place of the 
claimants, and enable them to pursue the captors, but they will 
be exposed to the inconveniences of an advance of the money to 
the claimants, and will have the trouble and uncertainty of a 
recovery from the captors. 

Lord Grenville made no observation upon this construction, 
and observed only that he hoped the business would be accelerated 
from other considerations, meaning, as I conceived, the obliga- 
tions of the Court to administer justice without delay. I replied, 
that I had thought it proper to intimate at an early stage of the 
business these reflexions, and that I sincerely united with his 
Lordship in hoping that no unnecessary delay would be ex- 
perienced hereafter in the proceedings of the High Court of 
Appeals. 

The result of the Conferences I communicated to our Commis- 
sioners, who now met their colleagues in a temper correspondent 



APPENDIX. 633 



to that which had been shown by the Government upon this 
occasion. 

The Memorials of Mr. Bayard and the Demurrers of Mr. 
Gostling have been withdrawn, and the Commissioners, in conse- 
quence of the renewed application of Mr. Bayard have already 
decided several important cases ; and I am in hopes will hereafter 
proceed without experiencing a renewal of the embarrassments 
which for some weeks entirely arrested their proceedings. 

Dr. Nicholl in our behalf and Sr. William Scott in behalf of the 
Br. Government have likewise recently gone through the cases of 
costs and damages, which have been provisionally submitted to 
their decision. I have not yet received from Mr. Bayard a list of 
those cases, but from eight or ten cases that I have seen, I am in- 
duced to believe that these have been such as will be pretty 
satisfactory. 

With perfect respect, I have the honor to be, Dear Sir, 

Your obt. & faithful Servt. 

Rufus King. 

R. King to Lord Grenville. 

Great Cumberland Place, 18 Dec, 1796. 

Mr. King presents his compliments to Lord Grenville. . . 
In reviewing the conferences which Mr. King had the honor to 
hold with Lord Grenville on Friday last, it occurred to him that 
he had omittted to state to his Lordship an opinion that he had 
supposed to be correct, respecting a Point of some importance, 
which his Lordship may have seen in a light somewhat different 
from that in which it has appeared to Mr. King. 

Mr. King alludes to the intimation of an opinion on the part of 
the British Commissioners, that in every case, in which the Juris- 
diction of the Board of Commissioners should be questioned by 
his Majesty's Proctor, it would be proper that the board should 
refer such question to the Decision of the two Nations, and in the 
mean time forbear to act respecting such case : and that if after 
the suggestion of a question of Jurisdiction by his Majesty's 
Proctor, the board should attempt to proceed, it would be justifi- 
able in the British Commissioners to withdraw and thereby 
prevent the board from acting on any question that should arise 
in the Case. The Provision in the Treaty which requires the 



634 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

presence of at least one Commissioner of each party to make a 
board, is supposed to authorize this course of Proceeding ; and a 
supposed Case of an obviously improper extension of Jurisdiction 
has been stated as one that would require to be thus arrested. 

Without detaining his Lordship with a recital of the endless 
References and numerous negotiations that must result from this 
practice, it seems pertinent to observe that neither of the reasons 
appear to be sufficient to excuse, much less to authorize, so 
hazardous a course. 

It was essential to the impartiality of the board and conform- 
able to common usages in private submissions, that one of the 
arbitrators named on each side should be present at the Examina- 
tion and Decision of every question. But has it ever from hence 
been inferred that either party could with propriety be with- 
drawn in order to arrest the business and defeat the Decision of 
the question submitted ? or is it the only, and therefore a proper 
mode of avoiding the inconveniences of a Decision not submitted 
to or without the Jurisdiction of the Commissioners ? 

The decision of a question not submitted or without the Juris- 
diction of the Commissioners would be utterly void and in no 
degree obligatory. If, for example, the board should receive a 
Complaint and award the payment of money in a case of capture 
that happened since the exchange of the Ratifications of the 
Treaty, or before the commencement of the existing war, as such 
an award would be plainly without Jurisdiction in the board, it 
would be void ; and his Majesty's Government would in no 
degree be bound to pay the money so irregularly and illegally 
awarded. And so in every case in which the Commissioners 
should make a decision without or beyond the limits of their 
Jurisdiction ; and in this principle which seems incontrovertible 
in public, as well as in municipal Law, is found a perfect security 
against every irregularity of this sort, that can be imagined or 
apprehended. 

Mr. King has taken the liberty to present these hasty Reflec- 
tions to Lord Grenville, which he omitted to do when this Topic 
was the subject of their late Conversation : as that conversation 
was understood to be not official, Mr. King requests the favor of 
Lord Grenville to receive these observations as a part of that 
conversation which was omitted.

APPENDIX IV. 

THE REBELLION IN IRELAND IN 1 798. 

The means of communication between the United States and 
England were so uncertain and dependent on the time occupied 
by sailing vessels between the two countries — several months 
often intervening between the sending of a despatch and the 
reception of an answer — that, as has been said in the course of 
this correspondence, Mr. King was obliged on many occasions to 
exercise the discretion he was permitted by his government to use, 
when the necessity of prompt decision and action forbade his 
awaiting definite instructions. The new questions constantly 
arising in the troubled and almost daily changes occurring in 
European politics, and especially as they affected American 
interests, could only be met by general instructions from the 
United States ; while much must be left to the minister in Eng- 
land, requiring his careful watchfulness and wise judgment. It 
was requisite that he should not only have the confidence of his 
government in his ability, judgment and fidelity to his country's 
welfare, but that he should maintain in a courteous but decided 
manner the positions which, either as directly instructed, or acting 
upon his own convictions of duty, he felt himself called upon 
to take. While under these circumstances, Mr. King was ever 
vigilant of events, and kept his government fully informed on the 
special business of the mission, he gained the confidence of those 
with whom he had to deal, by his intelligent handling of the 
questions before them, by the honesty and integrity of his char- 
acter, and by the conviction that he sought only the best 
interests of his country, whose history, people, and wants he 
thoroughly understood. 

Among the matters he was unexpectedly called to decide was 
one which presented entirely new features, for the settlement of 
which no instructions could have been prepared. It was conse- 
quent upon the suppression of the rebellion in Ireland, the dis- 
posal of the leaders in that unfortunate and unwisely planned 
revolt against the English government. Before engaging in the 
examination of the record of Mr. King's agency in preventing the 
British government from sending the leaders to banishment in 



636 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 



the United States, it will be well to ascertain and show why he 
acted as he did ; and to do so it will be proper to bring forward 
some matters, relating to the earlier history, in which he had taken 
a conspicuous part. 

It has been shown in the correspondence how he had been im- 
pressed with the crafty and impudent designs of France, through 
her emissaries from abroad and treacherous sympathizers at home, 
to bring his country under the control of that government, and to 
excite the people against the wise administration of Washington 
by discrediting the motives under which he acted. While reck- 
lessly striving to win the people over to French ideas, they de- 
nounced the treaty recently made with England as a violation of 
our treaties with France, and an insult to her. Mr. King, whose 
especial instructions in conducting his mission were to settle the 
commercial relations with England, found that the hostility be- 
tween that country and France was constantly a hindrance to 
reaching any definite results. France, while professing to be a 
friend, was plundering our vessels, insulting our ambassadors, and 
using all the arts of a subtle diplomacy to blind the eyes of the 
American people, and endeavouring to engage them in the war she 
was waging against England. While England, to protect her own 
interests, and claiming that her action was due to French decrees 
and aggressions, in part, embarrassed the commerce of the United 
States, suffering her naval officers to detain and capture American 
vessels, engaged in legitimate commerce, permitting her admiralty 
courts to condemn them on the most frivolous pretences, and 
impressing American seamen in her seaports and from American 
vessels. 

The recent insult to the envoys in France, and the duplicity 
with which the rulers sought to cover their plans, only increased 
Mr. King's horror and disgust at the demoralizing tendency of 
French principles, and to the possible danger to his own country 
from the dissemination of them, — a feeling and conviction which 
were not likely to be changed by the views of those with whom 
he consorted in England, but were strengthened by the efforts 
there made to resist the machinations of France to bring the 
English people also under her control. 

Ireland was the only side on which England could be attacked 
with any hope of success ; and the disturbed condition of that 



APPENDIX. 637 



island, seeking to gain independence, gave to the French an op- 
portunity of embarrassing England by plotting with the discon- 
tented Irish to wrest their island from her control and establish a 
hostile government upon it. Formidable as was the threatened 
danger to England, the plans of assistance were unsuccessful. 
The expeditions were injudiciously planned, inefficiently carried 
out, through the watchfulness of the British navy and the want 
of proper support on the Island, and failed to accomplish their 
purpose. The rebellion was overcome at last by the power of 
England, and the leaders were captured. The government, how- 
over, consented to spare their lives, which had been forfeited by 
their acts, on the condition that they should be transported to, or 
voluntarily emigrate to some other country. Choosing the latter 
course they selected the United States as that to which they would 
go. Upon the first hint of such a disposition, and of the inten- 
tion of the British Government to send them there, Mr. King felt 
himself called upon to protest against any such action on the part 
of the government, for reasons which are contained in the corre- 
spondence elsewhere presented, but are here brought together for 
a full justification of his action, viewed in the aspect of the times. 
On May 11, 1798, Mr. King wrote to the Secretary of State : 

" . . . Ireland is in a wretched state ; martial law prevails throughout 
the country, and every day supplies new proofs of the intimate connection that 
subsists between the Chiefs of the Malcontents and the Directory. . . . 
Several persons have been taken up and confined. . . . The government 
are said to have obtained proofs of a conspiracy formed by some of the Mem- 
bers of the Corresponding Societies to assist the French in case of a descent, 
to set fire to London, . . . The trial of O'Connor and the other persons 
indicted for Treason, will come on the week after next ; after which the Gov- 
ernment will publish the proofs of the conspiracy." 

Again, on June 14th, he directed the Secretary's attention to 
the probable early suppression of the rebellion, and to the 
opinion 

" that thousands of the fugitive Irish will seek an asylum in our country. 
Their principles and habits would be pernicious to the order and industry of 
our people, and I cannot persuade myself that the Malcontents of any country 
will ever become useful citizens of our own." 



638 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

After saying that in this communication he had discharged his 
duty, he remarked that it belonged to others to decide what was 
to be done. 

In a private letter to Mr. Pickering, of July 19, 1798, Mr. King 
recalled to him the intimation of his official letter of the 14th of 
June, and said : 

" I perceive that members of the disaffected Irish will be expelled and that 
they will be disposed to plant themselves among us. It was the practice of the 
Emigrants from Scotland to bring with them Certificates from the religious 
societies to which they belonged, of their honesty, sobriety and generally of 
their good character. Why should we not require some such document from 
all [italics by the Editor] Emigrants, and it would be well to add to the testi- 
monial that the person, to whom it was granted, was not expelled from his 
country and had not been convicted of any crime. I am, I confess, very 
anxious upon this subject. The contrast between New England and some 
other parts of the United States is in my view a powerful admonition to us to 
observe greater caution in the admission of Foreigners among us. If from the 
emigrations of past time we have suffered inconvenience, and our true national 
character has been disfigured, what are we to expect from the Emigrants of the 
present day." 

Again, on the 28th of July, he writes to the Secretary of State : 

" In Ireland the rebellion is at an end, a general amnesty with a few excep- 
tions, will soon be proclaimed ; many of the inferior chiefs will be permitted to 
go into exile. I have before intimated the probability of such a measure and 
hope the President will have power to exclude from our country all such 
foreigners, whose residence among us would be dangerous." 

The same views are repeated in a letter to Colonel Hamilton, 
July 31, (p. 376 of this volume) and, on the 3d of August, he 
wrote the private note to Colonel Pickering a portion of which 
follows. 



Private. 



London, 3d., Aug., 1798. 



. It appears from the accounts from Ireland that nearly 100 persons, 
including Lawyers, Physicians, Merchants and others, who have been engaged 
as Chiefs in the late Rebellion are to go into Exile for Life. A Bill for this 
Purpose has been brought into the Irish Parliament. Although I do not hnow 



APPENDIX. 639 



it to be the intention of the Exiles, I have many reasons to suspect that they 
expect to find an asylum among us. 

I do my duty in apprising you of the probability of the Measure, it belongs to 
others to make those Regulations that will enable the President to take care of 
the public safety. 

Yrs. &c. 

R.K. 

Having thus discharged his duty in reporting to his government 
the facts above noted and awaiting instructions, he writes on the 
5th of September of an ill-conceived landing of French troops, on 
the 2 2d of August, at Killaloe in Ireland, with military stores from 
three frigates, which had driven back a corps of British troops, but 
against which Lord Cornwallis had gone with a considerable 
force. Without speaking further of this, or of a subsequent ex- 
pedition from Brest to the Irish coast, which was broken up by 
the capture of the vessels engaged in it, or giving any further 
details of the events which led to the putting down of the re- 
bellion and the surrender of the leaders, he says in a letter to the 
Secretary of State September 13, 1798 : 

" The Invasion of Ireland has ended in the Surrender of the Invaders. As 
yet we have no returns of their numbers nor of that of the Irish who joined 
them ; both are supposed to be inconsiderable. The Reports of the Secret 
Committee of the Irish Parliament, which I send to you, fully disclose the prin- 
ciples and views of the leaders of the Rebellion. These are so conformable to 
those which have prevailed in France, so false and so utterly inconsistent with 
any practicable or settled Government, that I have taken occasion to express 
my wishes that the United States might not be selected as the country to which 
any of the State Prisoners should be permitted to retire." 

The letter to the Duke of Portland will show the manner in 
which Mr. King's " Wishes " were communicated to him, and the 
answer of the Duke will show how they were received. 

R. King to the Duke of Portland. 

Private. 

Margate, Sep. 13, 1798. 
My Lord : 

The publication of the Reports of the Secret Committee of the 

Irish Parliament relative to the late Rebellion seems to put beyond 

all doubt the object and expectation of its Leaders ; the pnnci- 



640 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

pies and opinions of the men are in my view so conformable to 
those which have unhappily prevailed in France, so dangerous, so 
false and so utterly inconsistent with any practicable and stable 
form of Government, that I feel it to be a duty to my Country to 
express to your Grace my earnest wishes that the United States 
may be excepted from the countries to which the Irish State 
Prisoners shall be permitted to retire. 

I certainly do not think that they will be a desirable acquisition 
to any Nation, but in none would they be likely to prove more 
mischievous than in mine, where from the sameness of language 
and similarity of Laws and Institutions they have greater oppor- 
tunities of propagating their principles than in any other country. 

I have on many occasions been sensible of your Grace's friend- 
ship for my Country : but at this period of national alarm, when 
all that has been best and most wisely settled by our common 
ancestors is attempted to be torn up and subjected to new specu- 
lations and experiments, your Grace can afford us no stronger 
or more valuable token of your regards than by an interference 
with his Majesty that shall prevent any of the Irish State Pris- 
oners (who appear to be the converts and agents of the new 
School of Philosophy and Politicks) from seeking an asylum in 

America. 

With most perfect Consideration &c &c.

Private. 

London, Saturday 22d Sept., 1798. 
Dear Sir : 

I sincerely beg your pardon for having so long delayed an 
answer to the Letter you did me the honor of writing to me on 
the 13th inst, on the Subject of the Countries to which the Irish 
State Prisoners shall be permitted to retire. 

It is unnecessary that I should trouble you with a detail of the 
difficulties and objections which will embarrass the choice of a 
proper residence for them ; and much more so I trust that I 
should assure you of my entire concurrence in the opinions and 
wishes which the Consideration of the Subject has led you to 
express. I can assure you with the most perfect confidence 



APPENDIX. 64I 

that the King will never permit any of the persons in question 
to set his foot in the Territory of any State in amity with his 
Majesty by whom there is any reason to suppose that such a 
visitor would be objected to. 

I cannot but be flattered by the manner in which you express 
your sense of my conduct, tho' you really do me no more than 
justice ; and I will therefore take the liberty to add from myself, 
that from the knowledge that my particular situation has furnished 
me with, of the sentiments and declarations of these Prisonerz, 
ever since their confession, the country of the United States is the 
last in the World which I should wish to see become their resi- 
dence. Believe me, Sir, 

with very sincere regard & Esteem 
Your faithful and most obt. Servt. 

Portland. 

October 6, 1798, sending to the Secretary of State copies of his 
correspondence with the Duke of Portland, Mr. King says : 

" Though they are both private letters, I have not thought it proper to omit 
communicating them to you. There are occasions, and this is one of them, of 
delicacy, as well as of importance, and in which we can only act from our own 
view of what the public welfare appears to require : I flatter myself in this in- 
stance it will not be thought either that my opinion was ill-founded, or that the 
step it gave rise to was impolitic." 

The next communication to the Secretary of State, October 19, 
1798, says : 

" The newspapers continue to announce that preparations are making to 
send the Irish State prisoners to the United States. I wrote another letter to 
the Duke of Portland upon the subject, a copy of which is annexed, and like- 
wise a copy of his Grace's letter to Lord Cornwallis that has been sent to me 
and which will, I presume, relieve me from any further concern on that head." 

R. King to His Grace, the Duke of Portland. 

Great Cumberland Place, Oct. 17, 1798. 
My Lord : 

I am concerned to trouble your Grace again on the subject of 
the exile of the Irish State Prisoners, especially after the friendly 
assurances your Grace has had the goodness to give me and 

VOL. II. — 41 



642 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

which have induced me to believe that they would not be per- 
mitted to go to America. But the late accounts from Ireland 
which, I hope inaccurately, state that preparations are making to 
send them to the United States, give me much anxiety least I 
have omitted any further Step that might have been expected or 
proper in order to prevent it. It is true that the President of the 
U. S. has power to deny, and in my opinion will refuse, them a 
Residence among us, provided he is apprized of their names and 
delinquencies ; but of these he may be ignorant, especially as I 
have expressed to him my expectation that they would not be 
permitted to go to America. If his Majesty's Government is still 
free to decide, I must repeat my earnest hope that these delin- 
quents may not be permitted to proceed to the United States. If 
the permission of Government has already been given, I take the 
Liberty to ask of your Grace a List of the names and a Descrip- 
tion of the Persons of those of the State Prisoners who are to be 
sent into my Country, in order that I may, if possible, in season, 
apprize my Government of the measure. 

It is quite possible, and I still hope, that these Publications are 
altogether erroneous ; in this case I must beg your Grace's par- 
don for having thus unnecessarily troubled you on a Subject that 
thro' your obliging interference had already been satisfactorily 
decided. 

With the most perfect Esteem and Respect, &c. &c. 

Rufus King 

Duke of Portland to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. 

Copy. 

London, 17th Oct., 1798. 
My Lord : 

The systematick attempts which have been constantly making 
by the French Government to overturn the present Constitution 
of the United States have naturally rendered the American Min- 
ister particularly attentive to every circumstance which bears the 
appearance of contributing in any degree to the accomplishment 
of that design. In the publication therefore of the terms upon 
which the lives of the Irish traitors were spared, he thought he 
saw that his country was threatened by a prospect of the intro- 
duction not only of principles of that dangerous tendency, but of 



APPENDIX. 643 



missionaries of the most alarming description, and those appre- 
hensions being increased and confirmed by newspaper reports 
and extracts of private correspondence, he wrote me the Letter, 
of which I enclose your Excellency a copy, to which I returned 
the answer which you will receive enclosed, by which your Ex- 
cellency will see what has passed between him and me upon this 
subject. But that your Excellency may have no doubt of the 
sentiments of the King's confidential servants upon the question 
generally of the right which our State possesses to transport its 
subjects into the Territories of another, I am to inform you that 
we are clearly of opinion that no such right exists according to 
the Law of Nations, and consequently that his Majesty has not 
the power to banish any one of his subjects to the Dominions of 
any other State or to authorize him to settle or to land them with- 
out the consent of that State having been first specifically ob- 
tained. It is unnecessary therefore for me to enter into the 
Policy of this measure ; but I must not abstain from adding, that 
if the question of right was uncontrovertibly established to be 
the reverse of what I have stated it to be, considering the actual 
circumstances of the United States and their relative situation to 
this country and France, his Majesty wd. not permit any step to 
be taken, which could give the United States any sort of umbrage 
or offence, and this step less, if possible, than any other, from the 
effects it might be capable of producing on that Government, and 
the injury which might result from it to the general happiness of 
mankind. The paragraph which I have seen within these two or 
three last days, purporting the immediate departure of your State 
Prisoners for America have made me feel it necessary for me to 
write thus fully to your Excellency upon this subject and to 
acquaint you that it is his Majesty's commands that not one of 
the Traitors, whose lives have been spared upon condition of 
being banished from Ireland and passing the remainder of their 
days in the dominion of a State in amity with his Majesty, shall 
be suffered upon any account whatever to go to or reside within 
the Territories of the United States until his Majesty's express 
permission for that purpose shall have been signified to your 
Excellency by one of his Majesty's principal Secretaries of State. 

I have the honor to be &c. &c.

644 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

In a letter to Hamilton, Nov. 9, 1798, Mr. King says : 

" You will see that I have prevented the sending to you of about fifty Irish 
State prisoners, who were at the head of the rebellion in Ireland, and closely 
connected with the Directory at Paris. Probably our patriots will think my 
conduct presumptuous. In the present posture of affairs, I could have no 
hesitation." 

Wm. Bingham to R. King. 

" Sept. 30, 1798. 

" I deprecate the consequence of the insurrection in Ireland — if successful, 
as it regards England, — if otherwise, as regards this country. In which case 
we shall have immense emigrations of an ignorant and deluded class of people, 
who will make a merit of resisting every Government they live under. I can- 
not see how we can shut our doors against their admission — a late law has ren- 
dered a longer residence necesssary to naturalization, but this will not prevent 
their seeking an asylum here, altho' it will deprive them of the power of influ- 
encing elections." 

Wm. Bingham to R. King. 

"Dec. 8, 1798. 

" I entirely agree with you in the danger that may arise from the emigration 
of so many Irish insurgents to this country ; amongst whom it appears there 
are many professional characters, who will be able to make an impression on 
society, much greater than the common class of disaffected Irish. They will 
join the party in opposition to the Government and will vent their resentments 
against Great Britain by attacking those who are disposed to be on friendly 
terms with her. They will be discontented and therefore disorganizing char- 
acters whose residence among us cannot be otherwise than injurious in the present 
moment of political agitation." 

The manner in which the President received the above 
communication and approved of the action of Mr. King, is shown 
by the following extract from a letter of the Secretary of State. 

T. Pickering to R. King. 

" 5 Feb., 1799. 

" Your timely interference to prevent the emigration of the Irish traitors to this 
Country is extremely acceptable to the President — And if removed to any other 
Country many of them probably will find their way hither and therefore not 
only a list of their names but a description of their persons & ages would be 
very useful to us if attainable." 

March 16, 1799, Mr. King writes to the Secretary of State : 

" I will obtain the names of the Irish State prisoners, whose pestilentias 
flight to the United States was fortunately arrested. They amount to ninety 
and a list of their names is easily procured. 



APPENDIX. 645 



" I omitted at the time to inform you that at the particular desire of Lord 
Cornwallis communicated to me through the Duke of Portland, I consented 
that one of these State prisoners, by the name of Lynch, Brother to a merchant 
of the same name in New York, should be permitted to go to New York, for 
which place he sailed some months since. He was represented to me as of 
inferior consequence as a conspirator, and by no means likely to be mischievous 
among us. It is proper that you should know the fact that he may be identi- 
fied and remembered." 

Henry Jackson to R. King. 

Dublin, 22d July, 1799. 
Sir: 

I am one of the many that has been implicated in this unfortunate country 
and having obtained the Lord Lieutenant's permission to go to America, pro- 
vided I go with your consent, I beg leave to refer you to the American Con- 
sul in this city for my general character. 

I have been for many years in the Iron Trade and lately sold part of my 
Works for ^"26.250 — and there remains yet to be disposed of what has cost me 
upwards of ^10,000 — a principal part of that sum I have vested in American 
defer'd stock and American Bank Shares. The whole of this property I intend 
removing to America with my family as soon as possible. I have long had a 
predilection for the American form of Government, but my being so engaged 
in manufactures in this country prevented my removing. Should I meet with 
a situation to my liking I hope to make my knowledge of the Iron Manufac- 
ture and Foundry business an acquisition to any part of the Country I may 
settle in. 

The Joseph, belonging to New York, is now here and intends sailing the 

loth of next month ; if I am so fortunate as to get a favourable answer to this 

application, I intend going by her. I take the liberty of sending this open to 

Joseph Wilson Esq to be forv/arded. 

I am with great respect &c. 

Hen. Jackson. 

Mr. Wilson enclosed this in a letter dated July 24, 1799, to Mr. 
King — in which he speaks in strong commendation of Mr. Jack- 
son as to his moral and business qualifications, founded on an 
acquaintance of fifteen years. 

Mr. King's answer to this letter follows. 

R. King to Henry Jackson, Esq. 

Brighton, Aug. 28, 1799. 
Sir: 

I ought to inform you that I really have no authority to give, or refuse per- 
mission to you or any other foreigner to go to the United States : the admission 
and residence of Strangers in that country being a matter that by a late Law 
exclusively belongs to the President. It is true that the Government of that 



646 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 



country in the course of the last year, in consequence of my interference gave 
me an assurance that a particular description of persons in Ireland, who it was 
understood were going to the United States, should not be allowed to proceed 
without our consent ; this restraint would doubtless be withdrawn in favor of 
individuals against whose emigration I should not object ; and I conclude that 
it is upon this supposition that you have taken the trouble to communicate to 
me your desire to go and reside in the United States. Without presuming to 
form an opinion on the subject of the late disturbances in Ireland, I entertain 
a distinct one in relation to the political situation of my own country. In com- 
mon with others we have felt the influence of the changes that have successively 
taken place in France, and unfortunately a portion of our Inhabitants has 
erroneously supposed that our civil and political institutions, as well as our na- 
tional policy might be improved by a close imitation of the models of France. 
This opinion, the propagation of which was made the duty and became the 
chief employment of the French agents resident among us, created a more con- 
siderable division among our people, and required a greater watchfulness and 
activity from the Government, than could beforehand have been apprehended. 
I am sorry to make the remark, and shall stand in need of your candour in 
doing so, that a large proportion of the emigrants from Ireland, and especially 
in our middle States, has upon this occasion arranged itself upon the side of the 
malcontents ; I ought to except from this remark most of the enlightened and 
well educated Irishmen who reside among us, and with a few exceptions I may 
confine it to the indigent and illiterate, who, entertaining an attachment to free- 
dom, are unable easily to appreciate those salutary restraints, without which it 
degenerates into anarchy. It would be injustice to say that the Irish emigrants 
are more national than those of other countries, yet being a numerous, tho' very 
minor portion of our population, they are capable, from causes it is needless 
now to explain, of being generally brought to act in concert, and under careful 
leaders may be, as they have been, enlisted in mischievous combinations against 
our Government. This view leads me to state to you without reserve the hesi- 
tation that I have felt in your case ; on the one hand we cannot object to the 
acquisition of Inhabitants from abroad possessing capital and skill in a branch 
of business, that with due caution, may without risque or difficulty, and with 
public as well as private advantage, be established among us ; but on the other 
hand if the opinions of such Inhabitants are likely to throw them into the class 
of malcontents, their fortune, skill and consequent influence would make them 
tenfold more dangerous, and they might become a disadvantage instead of a 
benefit to our country. You must be sensible that I possess no sufficient means 
of forming an opinion respecting your sentiments, but the motives which lead 
me to interfere with your Government to restrain the Emigration of the Persons 
above alluded to, oblige me to observe a due caution on the present occasion. 
At the same time I desire not to act with illiberality and should be unwilling 
to bring upon my country the slightest imputation of inhospitality. What Mr. 
Wilson has written, so far as it goes, is satisfactory ; and on the whole I have 
concluded after this unreserved communication, which I hope will be received 
with the same candour as it is made, to inform you, authorizing you to make 



APPENDIX. 647 



use of the information, that I withdraw every objection that may be supposed to 
stand in the way of your being permitted to go to the United States, adding 
only my earnest wish that you may carry with you an unbiassed mind, may find 
the state of the Country, as I believe you will, favorable to your views of 
business, and its Government deserving your attachment. 

I must beg your Excuse for the great delay that has occurred in sending you 
this answer, which I assure you has arisen from other causes than the want of 
due respect to your letter. 

With great Consideration, &c, &c, 

Rufus King. 

Mr. King, under the existing circumstances, could not have 
acted otherwise, as he says, than he did. It was not a question 
simply of interfering to prevent Irishmen from emigrating to 
America, as was afterwards charged against him, but of his duty to 
look after the interests of his country and after those chiefs whom 
he characterized as imbued with French principles and would be 
leaders in propagating them among his own people, who were at 
that very time so largely under similar influences and causing 
much embarrassment to the Government. It was the leaders 
that he would keep out, men who had made trouble in their own 
country and were not likely to be quiet in a country where speech 
was free and where much discontent was in the air. The Con- 
gress also had passed Alien and Sedition laws (whatever may be 
thought of their wisdom), which clearly indicated the sentiment 
of the country and the determination that French principles and 
disorganizing ways should be checked by even such questionable 
means. Mr. King therefore must be judged by the circumstances 
and conditions in which he was placed, which show that he acted 
wisely, for those very men who found their way over became 
leaders among those who opposed the government. It was not 
Irishmen because they were Irishmen, that he objected to ; for 
he well knew the services of Irishmen and their descendants in 
the War of the Revolution and in the councils of the nation — his 
own associates in public affairs, — but he feared the present leaders, 
for he knew the principles they avowed and by which they had 
been governed, in carrying out what, as men aiming at liberation 
from what they deemed the oppression of the British rule, they 
believed they had the right to do. It was the principles avowed 
and the associates to whom they allied themselves that made 
those men at that time dangerous citizens for the United States. 



648 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

As will be seen in subsequent periods of his life, indeed 
throughout his public life, this action was the source of bitter 
hostility to him and his family whenever they were candidates 
for public office. In the year 1806, and in 1816, when he had 
been put forward for election as Governor of the State of New 
York, Mr. King wrote for publication an answer to charges, with 
which the newspapers were filled, a vindication of his action in 
this matter, based upon the grounds above noted, as will be seen 
when the events of those years are under consideration. 

In the Life of Hamilton^ J. C. Hamilton, vol. vii., p. 156, we 
find this expression of opinion by him in 1819 — a writer who 
was not inclined to say anything favorable to Mr. King. 

" The oppressed and infuriated Irish also sought an asylum here from their 
poverty and their wrongs. Long suffering from misrule, this impassioned peo- 
ple were led to regard established government as an abuse. Craftily prejudiced 
with the belief, that neutrality was subservience to England, and that Federal- 
ism meant more than a love of the Constitution, of law and liberty, they were 
soon marshalled in the Democratic ranks, of which they became and have con- 
tinued a most efficient part. . . . The great mass of the Irish were 
prompted by misguided prejudices. Warm in their affections, faithful in their 
trusts, their women constituting a part of every household, holding its children 
in their arms and watching over their infancy ; their men building the cities, 
and the public works, and ranging themselves among the first in battle for 
American rights, to them the gratitude is large. But among them were their 
political offenders, who, abandoning their fealty to England, placed their affec- 
tions on France and became her active partisans. . . . The Democratic 
societies organized by Genet, had been denounced by Washington and were 
suppressed. An association was now proposed and entered into, better suited 
to the bolder character of these recent emigrants. . . . ' The American 
Society of United Irishmen' was founded, 'of all such and such only as 
had suffered in the cause of freedom, or who by their zeal for the rights of man- 
kind had rendered themselves distinguished and worthy of trust.' The mem- 
bers were bound by a test oath, ' organized with military gradation and preci- 
sion ; pledged to act with energy and union ; to act upon instant warning— 
what was this monster other than a conspiracy against the government.' Ham- 
ilton characterized it as threatening ' an internal invasion,' and 4 its existence 
was the leading and all sufficient motive for the enactment of a law for the 
removal of aliens,' ' judged dangerous to the peace and safety of the United 
States,' &c." 

Among other evidences that the conduct of Mr. King was sus- 
tained by those whose opinion he regarded, is a letter from Mr. 
G. Cabot, February 16, 1799. He says : 



APPENDIX. 649 



" If the seditious were hardy enough to denounce you for the great service 
you have render'd the country in shutting its doors against Irish Desperadoes, 
you would still have reason to be content, for the praises of the good would be 
increased in proportion to the clamours of the vicious ; but I believe the meas- 
ure is so generally approved that Faction will hardly dare to condemn." 



APPENDIX V. 

Miranda. 

To understand better the circumstances which gave rise to the 
project with which the name of Miranda is connected, the follow- 
ing narrative may be given. The dependencies of Spain in South 
America were very restive under the government of the mother 
country, and especially after the success of the American Revolu- 
tion, and many ardent spirits in these colonies of Spain sought to 
obtain for them their independence. Among those who were 
most prominent, was Francisco de Miranda, a native of Caracas, 
who had studied and observed in the United States the system 
under which they were living, and who had in previous years 
" disclosed his views, among others, to Hamilton, upon whom he 
fixed his eyes as a coadjutor in the great purpose of his life. Nor 
was Hamilton slow to perceive its importance and its ad- 
vantages." * There was no active co-operation at that time, and 
Miranda betook himself to Europe, and endeavored to engage 
some of the European nations in his plan, but without success. 

Taking advantage of a threatened war between England and 
Spain, he had communicated with the British Ministry with a view 
to effecting the liberation of the South American colonies of 
Spain ; but was disappointed by the restoration of good feelings 
between the two countries, though he had been listened to with 
favor. Soon after he had gone to France, hoping to reap some 
benefit from the revolutionary ideas of the leaders, obtained a 
commission in the French army, and under Dumouriez served 
with some distinction. With a change of rulers there, he was 
banished from France and took refuge in England, then engaged 
in a war with France, hoping again to get a hearing from the min- 
istry, and to show that as Spain was the close ally of France, they 

* Life of Hamilton, vol. vii., p. 212. 



650 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

might, by engaging in his scheme, cripple the latter's resources. 
We find that he was successful in obtaining a hearing, and we 
have in the following letters of Mr. King to the Secretary of State 
the evidence of the position he occupied in England. 

On February 7, 1798, Mr. King wrote, in cipher, a letter to 
the Secretary of State : 

" I have had some reason to believe that the prospect of our being engaged in 
the war has renewed the project that on more than one occasion has been meditated 
against South America. I think I am not mistaken in this conjecture. Mi- 
randa, who was certainly engaged in this scheme at the time of the affair of the 
Nootka, and who since has served under Dumouriez in France, came to this 
country a few weeks since. He has been with the ministry and is here by their 
desire or with their permission : the object is the complete Independence of 
South America to be effected by the co-operation of England and the U. S." 

On February 26th, he again writes in cipher to the Secretary of 
State. No. 65 : 

" Two points have within a fortnight been settled in the English Cabinet 
respecting South America. If Spain is able to prevent the overthrow of her 
present Government and to escape being brought under the entire controul of 
France, England (between whom and Spain, notzuithstanding the war, a certain 
understanding appears to exist) will at present engage in no Scheme to deprive 
Spain of her possessions in Sth. America. But if, as appears probable, the army 
destined against Portugal, and which will march thro Spain, or any other 
means which may be employed by France, shall overthrow the Spanish Govern- 
ment, and thereby place the resources of Spain and of her Colonies at the disposal 
of France, England zvill immediately commence the execution of a Plan long 
since digested and prepared for the compleat independence of So. America. 

If England engages in this Plan, she will at Philadelphia propose to the U. S. 
to co-operate in its execution. Miranda will be detained here, tinder one pretence 
or another, until events shall decide the Conduct of England. The Revohiiion 
of Spain is decreed ; the attempt will be made, and the success is scarcely doubt- 
ful. The President may therefore expect the overture of England, and will, I 
am persuaded, act upon it, under the influence of that wise and comprehensive 
Policy, which, looking for zvard to the Destinies of the New World, shall in the 
beginning by great and generous Deeds lay deep and firm the foundations of 
lasting accord between its rising Empires. If possible, I will bring together 
and seasonably arrange, and send to you such information, as I have been able 
to procure upon this interesting and very consequential Subject, having found 
out and acquired the confidence of certain Jestuts, natives of So. America, who 
with a view to its independence are, and for several years have been, in the ser- 
vice and pay of England. I have conversed with them and seen the Reports* 

* It is probable that these " reports " are the document referred to by Mr. 
Charles Francis Adams in his Life of John Adams, vol. i., 523, and published 



APPENDIX. 65 1 



which they have prepared for their Employers. These communications throw 
much light upon the population, the Resources, the oppression and the Tei?iper 
and character of the Spanish Americans. . . ." 

It will be seen that the plan suggested and prepared in England 
was that, " if England engages in this plan, she will at Philadel- 
phia propose to the U. S. to co-operate in its execution." Mi- 
randa was to be detained until England decided upon her course, 
and then " the President may expect the overture of England." 
In the meantime Mr. King promises that he will gather and send 
to the Secretary such " information as I have been able to pro- 
cure," and states some of the sources from which he has obtained 
it. There is no evidence that this matter was previously known 
in America, or even thought of, so as to set the plan of co-opera- 
tion in motion, and yet Mr. C. F. Adams, in his Life of John 
Adams* insinuates that Mr. Hamilton had the idea of this co- 
operation in view as early as January 24, 1798, at which date Mr. 
Adams consulted his cabinet as to the coarse proper to be taken, 
in case the commissioners, who were in France, failed to accom- 
plish the objects for which they were sent. Mr. Hamilton was 
not in the cabinet, but was consulted by the friends with whom 
he generally acted in the Federal party, and Mr. C. F. Adams 
says that the only one, Mr. McHenry, who answered in writing, so 
far as appears, drew his ideas upon the subject from Mr. Hamil- 
ton. In this paper Mr. McHenry suggests among other things 
that " authority, in case of a rupture, be given to the President to 
provide ' by such means as he may judge best,' ships of the line, 
not exceeding ten, the suspension of the treaties with France, an 
immediate army of sixteen thousand men and a provisional one 
of twenty thousand more." It was also proposed, instead of mak- 
ing an alliance with Great Britain, which would not be wise, or 
entering into a formal treaty with her, to give instructions to Mr. 
King to "sound Great Britain as to a plan of co-operation in case 
of open rupture, pointing the co-operation to the Floridas, Louisi- 
ana, and the South American possessions of Spain, if rupture, as 

in full in an appendix G. It is dated Paris, Dec. 22d, 1797. Mr. J. C. 
Hamilton, in his Life of Alexander Hamilton, vii., 213, refers to the same 
document, as furnishing " early in the following month the general terms of the 
agreement arranged with Pitt." 
* Vol. i., p. 515. 



652 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS ICING. 

is probable, should extend to her " ; lodging authority with the 
British Minister for all these purposes.* 
Mr. Adams says : 

" The recommendations are almost identically those which appear in Mr. 
Hamilton's private letters to Mr. Pickering. But in addition to this the paper 
closed with some suggestions which show a coincidence even more marked with 
the peculiar policy which that gentleman was at the time advocating in his cor- 
respondence." 

Now in the letters from Mr. Hamilton to Mr. Pickering, and of 
the latter to Mr. Hamilton, which are from March 17th to April 
9th f inclusive, there is not one word about a plan for anything 
more than a general co-operation with Great Britain in case of a 
rupture, without a hint of making use of the vessels to be bought 
or hired, or of the troops to be raised, in endeavoring to set free 
the Spanish possessions in America. They are not even men- 
tioned, except that Mr. Pickering says that despatches had been 
received which rendered it probable Spain had ordered the evacu- 
ation of the posts about New Orleans, probably thinking to do 
us a grateful thing before surrendering Louisiana to France. 
On March 17th Mr. Hamilton says that the serious condition of 
affairs calls for a " temperate but grave, solemn, and firm commu- 
nication by the President to Congress" in consequence of the com- 
munications which had been received from the commissioners in 
France, and recommends generally the same provisions suggested 
by Mr. McHenry ; but there is not one word about Spanish posses- 
sions in it ; nor is there a hint about them in a letter from him to 
Mr. King, cited by Mr. J. C. Hamilton as " probably March, 
1798," nor in two other letters to Mr. King of " May, 1798," and 
May 12, 1798, in the former of which he says : 

"It is a great while since I have received a line from you, nor have I 
deserved one ; the vortex of business in which I have been, having kept me 
from writing to you. At this moment, I presume, you will not be sorry to 
know my opinions as to the course of our public affairs." \ 

Mr. Hamilton in his letter to Mr. Pickering, March 17th, closes 
with these words : 

* Life of Alexander Hamilton., i., 516. 

f Hamilton s Works, vol. vi., pp. 269 to 279.

APPENDIX. 653 



" In my opinion, bold language and bold measures are indispensable. The 
attitude of calm defiance suits us. It is vain to talk of peace with a power with 
which we are actually in hostility. The election is between a tame surrender 
of our rights or a state of mitigated hostility. Neither do I think that this state 
will lead to general rupture, if France is unsuccessful ; and if successful, there 
is no doubt in my mind, that she will endeavor to impose her yoke upon us." * 

Thus far, whatever may have been Mr. Hamilton's wishes or 
hopes respecting the South American colonies of Spain, no written 
expression appears, and the next communication from Mr. King, 
relative to this matter, is found in the letter in cipher to Messrs. 
Pinckney, Marshall, and Gerry, the commissioners in Paris, April 
2, 1798. 

On the same date Mr. King wrote to the Secretary of State, in 
cipher : 

11 Dear Sir : 

" General Miranda has informed me that his associate and Countryman Mr. 
Caro, is about to return to So. America, and that he will take Philadelphia in 
his way, in order to deliver to the President a Letter that the General has for 
that purpose committed to his care. 

" Having been made acquainted with the object of Mr. Caro's voyage, I take 
the liberty of introducing him to you and of requesting that you will assist him 
in the delivery of the Letter with which he is charged for the President. 

" With perfect Esteem & Respect, 

" Rufus King." 

On April 6, 1798, a further communication is made by Mr. 
King to the Secretary of State, also in cipher, in the following 
words : 

" South America must soon pass through a Revolution ; we have an immense 
interest in the Event, as well as in the manner in which it shall be effected. 
In a former Letter, I have communicated to you the views and intentions of 
England, who will not provoke the Revolt in Case Spain shall be able to save 
herself from a Revolution and keep the French out of Portugal: and thd there 
seems little probability that this will be the case, England since the arrival of 
Miranda here, but without his knowledge , has informed Spain not only that she 
will not countenance or assist the Spanish Colonies in becoming independent, but 
that she will join her in resisting the Endeavours of others to accomplish it, pro- 
vided that Spain will oppose the views of France against her own Dominions 
and those of Portugal. At the same time that this communication has been 
made to Spain, an Expedition has been prepared and the correspondent arrange-

ments at Trinidad have been ordered, for the purpose of beginning the Revolution 
of So. America ; in this event, as I have before intimated to you, England will 
at Philadelphia open herself to, and ask the co-operation of, the United States. 
Miranda who is impatient zuith the Delays that he experiences, as well as igno- 
rant of the provisional Decisions of this Cabinet, has concluded to send his Friend 
and associate, Mr. Caro, to Philadelphia with a Letter for the President ; and 
I have given him a Letter to identify him and introduce him to you. Conjectur- 
ing the intentions of Fratice, and knowing zuith precision those of England, we 
shall be the belter able in season to consider and regulate the conduct that it shall 
be proper for us to pursue." 

Mr. J. C. Hamilton quotes from the Edinburgh Review, xiii., 
291, a paragraph from a letter to Mr. Hamilton from Miranda, 
dated April 6, 1798 : 

" This will be delivered to you, my dear and respectable friend, by my com- 
patriot, Don . . . charged with despatches of the highest importance for the 
President of the United States ; he will inform you confidentially what you 
would desire to learn on this subject. It appears that the moment of our eman- 
cipation approaches, and that the establishment of liberty over the whole Con- 
tinent of the new world is confided to us by Providence. The only danger that 
I foresee is the introduction of French principles, which would poison liberty 
in her cradle and finish by destroying also yours." 

To the same M. Caro, Miranda committed a letter to President 
Adams, which is here given, taken from the Life and Woi'ks of 
John Adams, viii., 569 : 

F. de Miranda to John Adams. 

A Londres ce 24 Mars, 1798. 

Monsieur le President. — C'est au nom des colonies Hispano-Americaines, 
que j'ai l'honneur d'envoyer a votre Excellence les propositions ci-jointes. Elles 
ont ete presentees egalement aux Ministres de sa Majeste Britannique, qui les 
ont reeu tres favorablement, en temoignant beaucoup de satisfaction d'avoir a 
agir dans un cas pareil avec les Etats Unis de l'Amerique. Et il me semble 
que le delai que j'eprouve (affligeant reellement, dansun moment aussi pressant) 
resulte precisement de l'attente ou le gouvernement Anglais paroit etre, de voir 
TAmerique du Nord decidee a rompre definitivement avec la France ; par le de- 
sir qu'ellea de faire cause commune, et de co-operer ensemble a l'indepen- 
dance du continent entier du Nouveau Monde. 

Comme l'esprit de justice, generosite et atachement de mes compatriotes 
vers les Etats Unis, se trouve mieux exprime dans le document qui me sert de 
pouvoir, autant que d'instruction, j'ai voulu y joindre une copie complete. Per- 
suade que cette demarche amicale et franche servira plus efficacement a ac- 
celerer la decision . . . comptant toujours sur la reserve indispensable, 



APPENDIX. 655 



dans tout ce qui ne regarde pas directement les Etats Unis. Si quelque article 
de ceux qui sont contenus dans cette instruction (ou toute autre chose qui soit 
relative) eut besoin d'explication. D. Pedro Josef Caro, un denies compatriotes, 
commissaire aussi des colonies Hispano-Americaines, et charge de vous 
remettre celle-ci, pourra satisfaire amplement et completemment a tout. * 

Sa mission apres avoir recu les ordres de V. E., est de se rendre sans delai 
au continent Hispano-Americain afin d'instruire nos commettans et com- 
patriotes de l'etat actuel des negotiations a nous confiees, ainsi que la situation 
politique de l'Europe. Je vous prie de vouloir bien lui faciliter tout-ce dont il 
auroit besoin pour cet important objet, et pour se rendre incessamment a la 
province de Santa Fe de Bogota. 

Je ne vous dissimule pas, Monsieur le President, mes inquietudes sur l'entree 
prochaine des troupes Franeaises en Espagne. Crainte qu'un movement con- 
vulsif dans la metropole ne produise pas des secousses anarchiques dans les 
colonies ; et que l'abominable systeme de la France ne s'introduise chez nous, 
faute d'avoir pris des mesures promptes et efficaces pour l'empecher. DU 
avertant. Enfin j'espere que le petit secours dont nous avons besoin pour 
commencer, et qui se reduit a. six ou huit vaisseaux de ligne et quatre ou cinq 
milles hommes des troupes, nous les trouverons facilement tant en Angleterre 
que dans l'Amerique . . . Mes souhaits seraient que la marine fut Anglaise 
et les troupes de terre Americains. Veuille la Providence que les Etats Unis 
fassent pour ses compatriotes du Sud en 1798, ce que le roi de France fit pour 
eux en 1778 ! Je me felicite tou jours de voir a la tete du pouvoir executif Ameri- 
cain cet homme distingue, qui par son courage rendit son pays independant, et 
qui par sa sagesse lui donna apres un gouvernement bien balance, en sauvant 
ainsi la liberte. Nous profiterons sans doute de vos savantes lecons, et je me 
rejouis de vous apprendre d'avance que la forme de gouvernement projete est 
mixte, avec un chef hereditaire du pouvoir executif sous le nom d' Ynca, et, ce 
que j'aime davantage, pris dans la meme famille : un S/nat compose de families 
nobles, mais non hereditaire ; et une Chambre des communes elue parmi tous 
les autres citoyens qui auront une propriete competente. Telle est l'esquisse de 
la forme du gouvernement qui parait reunir la majorite des suffrages dans le 
continent Hispano-Americain, et qui empechera sans doute les consequences 
fatales du systeme Franco-Republican, que Montesquieu appelle la liberte 
extreme. 

En vous addressant directement ces propositions, j'ai cru mettre toute la 
reserve requise dans une affaire aussi extraordinaire qu'importante. J'ai l'hon- 
neur en outre d'y joindre un etat de la population, produits, exportation et 
consommation de l'Amerique Espagnole, qui etant fait sur des notices les plus 
exactes, ainsi que les plus recentes, m'a paru meriter votre attention. 

Avec les sentimens de la plus haute consideration et de l'estime la plus 

parfaite, j'ai l'honneur d'etre, &c. 

Francisco de Miranda. 

* M. Caro did not come. Being in great haste to return home, he sent a 
letter to Mr. Pickering, Secretary of State, May 10, 1798, asking him to deliver 
the documents to the President. 



656 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 



The letter of Miranda to the President did not reach America, 
as will be seen, until the 20th of August. In the meantime Mr. 
King on May 12th wrote to Mr. Hamilton : 

" Nothing but vigor and energy will save our country. Unanimity cannot 
be expected. . . . The people of America will support their government, 
if that government acts with decision ; if it appeals to the pride, the patriotism, 
and the honor of the nation ! But if it temporizes, if it wastes itself in words, 
if it stops short of the only course that remains for its adoption, consistently 
with the public safety, the next election will convulse the country, and may, as 
the Directory intend and expect it shall, give the government to those who 
will deliver us up to the same ruin that continues to desolate Europe. . . . 
I received a short letter from you a few days since without date, which gave 
me great satisfaction, as it authorized the hopes that public opinion was sounder 
than that of its representatives. War will increase the public taxes. These 
are unpleasant subjects for meditation ; the passions must be attended to, they 
must have an object — there is a great one. I can't explain myself. I have had 
no occasion for reserve with the Secretary of State, because I can write to him 
in cipher." * 

On July 14th f Mr. King in a letter to Mr. Hamilton sketches 
the condition of affairs in Europe with the remark that 

*' the struggle is left to England, who certainly maintains it with increased 
zeal and resolution. For some months past we have not a word about peace. 
. . . In this state of things, we are (for so I consider our situation) forced 
into a war of defence. Have you received a former letter of mine on this sub- 
ject ? It is of infinite importance that we are not deceived by ourselves or 
others. We must do more than merely defend. I still think that the object 
that I have before suggested, demands all our consideration and energy. Don't 
suppose that I would combine fortunes with those of others. On the contrary, 
whatever our interest may require in regard to a co-operation with others I am 
averse to indissoluble engagements with any one. The Continent of Europe 
cannot be saved, but this is no reason why America should perish likewise. 
France is the only nation that projects enterprises, or succeeds in putting them 
into execution ; all others are puzzled in a perpetual effort to find out and de- 
feat the plans of France, without concerting and attempting to execute one that 
might give to France the disadvantage of defence. If we follow this course, I 
dread the issue." 

On 31st July, 1798, in a letter to Col. Hamilton, Mr. King, 
after adverting to the firmness of the English Government in its 
course towards France, and his opinion that in consequence the 

* Works of Hamilton, vi., 285. f Ibid., vi., 3. 



APPENDIX. 6 $? 



people will be more and more likely to support it in the measures 
to be taken, says : 

" This opinion should be taken in connection with an observation (the import- 
ance of wh. appears to me the greater the oftener I consider it) that I have 
suggested in more than one of my late letters. The composition of addresses 
and the forming of volunteer associations who will have nothing to do, are for 
the present well ; but they will cease to be novelties and soon become tiresome ; 
and to be secure you must have some sufficient object that will interest and em- 
ploy the passions of the nation. The mere defensive system of the enemies of 
France has been the principal cause of her success, and if we adopt the error 
we shall be exposed to greater risque than by a bold and active system, which, 
exclusive of being the most certain means of safety, would promise the acquisi- 
tion of great and lasting advantages. 

" The Destiny of the new world, and I have a full and firm persuasion that it 
will be both happy and glorious, is in our hands. We have a right and it is 
our duty to deliberate and act, not as secondaries, but as Principals. The object 
and the occasion are such as we ought not in respect to ourselves and others to 
suffer to pass unimproved." 

This letter was not acknowledged by Mr. Hamilton until 
October 2d, when he says : 

" Mr. R. delivered me your letter of the 31st July. The opinion in that and 
other of your letters concerning a very important point, has been acted upon 
by me from the very moment that it became unequivocal that we must have a 
decisive rupture with France. In some things my efforts succeeded, in others 
they were disappointed ; — in others I have had promises of conformity to lay 
the foundation of future proceeding ; the performance and effect of which 
promises are not certainly known to me. The effect, indeed, cannot yet be 
known." * 

As before stated, Miranda's letter of March 24th, and docu- 
ments with it, reached the Secretary of State on August 20th, 
as appears by a letter from him to the President, of the 2ist,f 
with which he also inclosed Mr. King's letters of February 2 2d 
and April 6th : 

" Sir: 

" I inclose a letter which I received last evening under cover from M. Pedro 
Josef Caro, accompanied by a letter from Mr. King, intended as an introduc- 
tion to M. Caro ; but the latter having missed a passage to the United States, 
in the British cutter which sailed from Falmouth for New York on the 20th of

April, and circumstances requiring his arrival in South America with as little 
delay as possible, he forwarded the packet to me. A copy of the translation 
of his letter to me I have the honor to inclose. 

"Under the same cover were inclosed two letters, one for Colonel Hamil- 
ton,* the other for General Knox, which I forward by this post to those 
gentlemen." 

The inclosed letter of M. Caro is dated, 

" Falmouth, 10 May, 1798. 

"Sir — The annexed letter of the Hon. Mr. King to you will serve as a cre- 
dential in my favor in presenting myself to you with the important mission it 
announces. An unforeseen accident has frustrated my voyage hence to your 
Continent in his Majesty's Cutter, which sailed for New York on the 20th April 
last ; and a combination of circumstances requiring my arrival in South America 
with as little delay as possible, I have received instructions immediately to 
depart by the shortest route of the leeward islands, and am ordered to com- 
municate it to the government through the medium of you, by transmitting the 
pamphlet which I inclose, and should have conveyed personally. I pray you 
to deliver it into the hands of His Excellency the President ; and, as eventually 
some answer may be practicable in so interesting a business, General Francis 
de Miranda, our compatriot and principal agent of all Spanish America in 
union, a person extremely well known, and in particular to the Hon. Mr. 
King, whose intervention is as to both parties safe and secret, will remain in 
London. 

" I also hope you will have the goodness to receive the first tribute of my re- 
spects in the Spanish language and style, as I am unable to render it in Eng- 
lish and that you will not confide the secret to interpreters who are not known." 

In reference to the letter, inclosed in M. Caro's package, to 
Colonel Hamilton, sent by Mr. Pickering to him, Mr. Picker- 
ing says August 22, 1798 : 

" Not to miss a mail, I wrote" you one line today and inclosed a letter from, 
I suppose, General Miranda. If its contents give rise to any questions which 
it will be prudent for you to ask, and for me to answer by the mail, it may be 
done ; otherwise the information may be suspended until we meet." — Hamil- 
ton's Works, vi., 343. 

There does not appear to be any answer to this. 

Alexander Hamilton to Rufus King. 

New York, Aug. 22, 1798. 
My dear Sir : 

You will be no doubt fully instructed of the measures which have taken place 
on the part of our government and you will have seen in the numerous addresses 
to the President a confirmation of the opinion I gave you respecting thedisposi-

tion of this Country. From both you will have derived satisfaction though you 
should not think we are yet where we ought now to be. But console yourself 
with the assurance that we are progressive in good. The indications are to my 
mind conclusive that we are approaching fast to as great unanimity as any 
country ever experienced and that our energies will be displayed in proportion 
to whatever exigencies shall arise. 

I have received several letters from General Miranda. I have written 
answers to some of them, which I send you to deliver or not according to your 
estimate of what is passing in the scenes where you are. Should you deem it 
expedient to suppress my letter, you may do it & say as much as you think fit 
on my part in the nature of a communication through you. 

With regard to the enterprise in question, I wish it much to be undertaken, 
but I should be glad that the principal agency was in the U States — they to fur- 
nish the whole land force necessary. The command in this case would very 
naturally fall upon me — and I hope I should disappoint no favorable anticipa- 
tion — The independency of the separated territory under a moderate govern- 
ment, with the joint guarantee of the co-operating powers, stipulating equal 
privileges in commerce, would be the sum of the results to be accomplished. 

Are we yet mature for this undertaking ? Not quite — But we ripen fast, and 
it may (I think) be rapidly brought to maturity, if an efficient negotiation for 
the purpose is at once set on foot upon this ground — Great Britain cannot alone 
ensure the accomplishment of the object. I have some time since advised cer- 
tain preliminary steps to prepare the way consistently with national character 
and justice. I was told they would be pursued, but I am not informed whether 
they have been or not.* 

Yrs. Affecly.

A. Hamilton to General Miranda. 

New York, August 22. 1798. 
Sir : 

The sentiments I entertain with regard to that object have been long since 
in your knowledge. But I could personally have no participation in it, unless 
patronised by the Government of this Country. It was my wish that matters 
had been ripened for a co-operation in the course of this Fall on the part of this 
Country. But this can now scarcely be the case. The Winter however may 
mature the project and an effectual co-operation by the U States may take 
place. In this case I shall be happy in my official station to be an instrument 
of so good a work. 

The plan in my opinion ought to be a fleet of Great Britain, an army of the 
U. States. — a government for the liberated territory agreeable to both the Co- 
operators, about which there will be probably no difficulty. To arrange the

plan a competent authority from Great Britain to some person here is the best 

expedient. — Your presence here will in this case be extremely essential. 

We are raising an army of about Twelve thousand men. Genl. Washington 

has resumed his station at the head of our armies. — I am appointed second in 

command. 

With esteem and regard 

I remain Dr. Sir, 

Yr. very Obt. Servt. 

A. Hamilton. 

In the meantime Mr. King, on August 17th, communicates 
in cipher to the Secretary of State the following report of a 
conference with Lord Grenville : 

Our conference here took a turn to the probability of the Revolution of 
S. America *: He was fuller and more explicit than he had been on any former 
occasion, always understanding that my conversation on this subject was personal 
and wholly unauthorized. The digression which treated of the practicability 
and of the means of effecting the measure, tended to shew to me that they have 
at times considered and combined with their views of a future connection with 
the United States, the independence of the Spanish Continental Colonies. I did 
not perceive, nor do I believe it to be the case, that they have any recent infor- 
mation of the present temper, disposition or plans of these Colonies, a knowledge 
more easily procured from the United States than from Europe and which is in- 
dispensably requisite to the success of an enterprize to accomplish the Revolution. 
He spoke of the government to be established in these as a Revolution ; he thought 
our System would attract and receive their approbation, and made some remarks 
upon the apprehension to be entertained on account of their genius and charac- 
ter, which especially in Peru, was said to be highly animated and full of en- 
thusiasm, and concluded by observing that he was more and more confirmed in 
the opinion, that none but Englishmen and their descendants knew how to make 
a Revolution. 

On the same date, General Miranda wrote another letter to the 
President, Mr. Adams, f in which he says : 

" Depuis le depart de ma depeche, les circonstances sont devenues plus 
favorable encore. Les evenemens survenus et en Europe et aux Etats Unis 
rendent merae la separation des colonies Hispano-Americaines indispensables ; 
d'autant plus qu'elles sont decidees a ne pas devenir les agens, encore moins les 
sujets, de la republique Francaise. . . . Je vois avec plaisir que l'Angleterre, 
sentant enfin que son salut et son bonheur futur dependent absolument d'une

alliance et d'un attachement intime avec l'Amerique, est resolue, en deposant 
tout esprit de jalousie et de monopole commercial, a co-6perer avec vous en 
faveur de cet important objet, dont le succes assurera non seulement le bonheur 
reciproque, mais encore la gloire immortelle, des trois parties interesse'es. 

" Mr. King, votredigne ambassadeur aupres desa Majeste Britannique, etqui 
joint ici a tant de titres de l'estime generate, entrant dans tous les details, vous 
communiquera les renseignemens qui vous seront necessaires, tant a l'egard de 
l'Europe qu' a l'egard de l'Amerique du Sud. Nos interets etant les memes, 
et mes commettans ayant mis toute leur confiance dans leurs compatriotes du 
Nord, j'ai cru ne pouvoir mieux remplir leurs desirs qu'en agissant d'accord avec 
lui, sans la plus legere reserve, et avec une confiance mutuelle. 

" Puisque votre reponse doit en quelque sort decider le sort de l'Amerique 
meridionale, et combler les souhaits de mes compatriotes, jevousprie, Monsieur 
le President, de vouloir bien me la faire parvenir le plutot qu'il vous sera possi- 
ble." 

"F. de Miranda." 

These letters were not received in America until the following 
October, on the 3d of which month the President wrote to T. 
Pickering, Secretary of State, from Quincy : 

"Dear Sir : 

" Inclosed is a duplicate of a letter from Miranda, with some estimates. Read 
it and think of it. A number of questions and considerations occur. We are 
friends with Spain. If we were enemies, would the project be useful to us ? It 
will not be in character for me to answer the letter. Will any notice of it, in 
any manner, be proper ? " * 

It does not appear that the Secretary ever answered these ques- 
tions, " and," Mr. C. F. Adams says, " the grand plan thus 
perished by inanition." f Of course, without the President, no 
efficient action could be taken. But the fact is that the com- 
munication from the British Government, to that of the United 
States, of which Mr. King had spoken as a preliminary to any 
arrangement, was not ever made ; the whole correspondence had 
been unofficial, except that of Mr. King to the Secretary of State, 
as to the possibility and probability of co-operation between the 
two countries, and that of General Miranda with the President and 
Mr. Hamilton, Miranda himself being earnest and sanguine, and 
believing that Great Britain seriously contemplated the expedition 
which he desired and which perhaps at one time it apparently did.

For had it not done so, how could Mr. King have written in a 
private letter to Mr. Hamilton, as he did on October 20th ? 

" My dear Sir : 

" I have received your letter of the 22d August, with the enclosure that has 
been delivered as directed. On that subject things are here as we could desire. 
There will be precisely such a co-operation as we wish the moment we are 
ready. The Secretary of State will show you my communication on this sub- 
ject. Though I have not a word from him respecting it, your outline corresponds 
with what has been suggested by me, and approved by this government. For- 
tunately some months past I obtained a fac simile of the latest map of the coun- 
try. It has been now two months in the hand of an engraver, who has engaged 
to deliver the copies in January. This government has considerable informa- 
tion respecting the interior, as well as concerning the condition and dispositions 
of the inhabitants, though I apprehend it is not of a recent date. What we 
know is favorable ; but if we are to be betrayed by France, the glorious oppor- 
tunity will be lost. I am gratified on receiving your opinion of the good con- 
dition of our public affairs, but I do not feel confident that we are as safe as you 
appear to think we are. It is fraud, not force, I fear. ... A Paris paper 
of the 8th instant, which is the latest that takes any notice of the United States, 
says : Les dernieres lettres de Bordeaux assurent qu'ily est arrive un courier ex- 
traordinaire porteur d'ordres pour remettre l'embargo sur les navires Ameri- 
caines. Voila done la guerre inevitable avec ce peuple, du moins toutes nos 
correspondances coincident." 

In a private letter to Mr. Pickering, October 20, 1798, Mr. King 
says : 

" You are silent concerning South America *y I have again and again touched 
upon it ; I have wished to say much more, but I have not thought it prudent. 
As England is steady, she will furnish a fleet and military stores, and we should 
furnish the army. A map of the cozmtry that some time since I procured, is in 
the hands of the engraver ; the copies will be delivered in January." 

R. King to A. Hamilton.-^ 

London, March 4, 1799. 

Our opinions do not differ upon a very important subject that has more than 
once been mentioned in our correspondence. I am entirely ignorant of the sen- 
timents of the President, though I have again and again treated of it, and 
sometimes with earnestness, in my dispatches. This silence gives me some

inquietude.* Mr. G. will send you the reflections that have occurred to him, 
and will also explain the motives for putting them into your hands. I cannot 
at this distance decide upon the expediency of publishing these reflections, but 
I am much inclined to recommend it, as all our conjectures, explained and 
confirmed by everything we see, enjoin us to look for safety only in our own 
courage and upon our own continent. 

With perfect regard and attachment, &c. 

R. King to A. Hamilton. 

London, March 9, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

By Mr. Erskine, whom I have introduced to you, I send you a copy of the 
famous Map of So. America that Fayden has lately engraved. It is a facsimile 
of the Spanish map so carefully concealed at Madrid. 

Fayden is employed in another map upon the same scale of the Spanish Ter- 
ritories North of the Isthmus ; it will be less accurate and authentic, but such 
as it is it will supply a desideratum. I am from many considerations restrained 
from saying what ought to be said and must not be delayed respecting this im- 
portant Country. I am entirely convinced, if it and its resources are not for 
us, that they will speedily be against us. 

Spain and Portugal are completely in check ; and the game may be termi- 
nated with them at the pleasure of France. The next step is plain and will be 
by and by unavoidable. What do we expect, what, without infatuation, can we 

expect of France ? Why then any further Reserves ? 

Yrs. truly 

R. K. 

It does not appear that anything further was done in Miranda's 
business. Tired of awaiting the decision of Great Britain to 
commit itself to and engage in his scheme of revolution, finding 
also that the earnestness of England varied with the success or 
disaster of France in her affairs on the Continent, and being 
straitened in means, he desired to come to America, possibly to 
see if he might meet with a more favorable reception. On the 
21st of January, 1799, Mr. King applied for a passport for him to 
leave England for the West Indies, which was not granted to 
him, and again on the 1st of August he addressed a private note 
renewing his request, to Mr. Huskisson, Under Secretary with 
Mr. Dundas, which, with Mr. King's note to General Miranda 
and one to Mr. Pickering, are here given : 

* The only notice of the President's opinion is to be found in his letter to Mr. 
Pickering, Secretary of State, on October 30, 179S, which does not appear to 
have been communicated to Mr. King.

R. King to W. Huskisson, Esq. 

Private, 

G. C. P., Aug. i, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

It is not without reluctance since the receit of your note of that I renew 

the subject of a Passport for General Miranda ; my sole inducement proceeds 
from the extreme embarrassment in which I see him, and from which he has 
no means of extricating himself while he remains in England. 

It is not suitable that I should enter into or even entertain an opinion, on 
the policy of granting or denying a Passport for Trinidad ; besides that point 
is decided. He now desires a Passport to leave England to go to the U. S., 
and as I have no reason to think his going there would be disagreeable to the 
American Government, I take the liberty of asking you to submit to Mr. Pitt, 
this request of the requisite permission for him to leave England for the U. S., 
and that you will at the same time explain to him that my interference origi- 
nates in the knowledge of the pecuniary Embarrassments of General Miranda, 
and of his utter want of resources to enable him any longer to subsist in this 
country. 

With Sentiments &c. &c. 

Rufus King. 

Rufus King to General Miranda. 

Brighton, Sept. 1, 1799. 
Dear General : 

I have just received a note from Mr. Dundas, informing me that on applica- 
tion to Lord Grenville, a Passport will be granted to you to leave England for 
the U. S. of America. As you may wish to take immediate measures on the 
Subject of your Passage, I do not suffer the Post to return without sending you 
this agreeable information. 

We shall be at home on Wednesday or Thursday, when I shall have the pleas- 
ure of seeing you in Cumberland Place. I charge myself with the completion 
of your wishes respecting the Passport. 

Ever & with great truth yours &c. 

Rufus King. 

Rufus King to Col. Pickering. 

London, Sept. 9, 1799. 
Dear Sir : 

I take the liberty to introduce to you the Bearer General Miranda to whose 
name and reputation you cannot be a Stranger : few persons have had greater 
opportunities of seeing the different Countries of Europe, of observing their 
various institutions, or of being acquainted with their distinguished Statesmen 
and Men of Letters. 



APPENDIX. 665 



Numerous and favorable as these occasions have been for the acquisition of 
extensive and useful information, you will perceive by conversing with the 
General, that he has not suffered them to escape unimproved. 

As he proposes to pass some time at Philadelphia, I shall be particularly 
obliged to you to receive him with the kindness and respect due to a man of 
uncommon Talents and rare acquirements. 

With the greatest Truth and Attachment &c. &c. 

Rufus King. 

Note— Mill Hill, Middlesex, Oct. 18, 1799. 

Miranda could not obtain permission to leave England for the U.S. — this 
letter will not therefore be delivered. 

The detail with which this proposed adventure of Miranda has 
been given, is to meet a suggestion made by Mr. C. F. Adams,* 
that " Mr. King's public and private papers, not yet before the 
world, must throw a flood of light on these transactions." They 
are now before the public, and certainly do not warrant the 
charge that Mr. Hamilton at the time of making the suggestion 
for " a more extensive force than was needed merely for defence," 
was doing more than to prepare for an emergency that might 
arise under the strained relations with France. Whatever was 
done was to be done under the direction and with the consent of 
the government, though he might justly look forward to the com- 
mand of an expedition, should one be organized, " to attack 
where we can. France is not to be considered as separated from 
her ally. Tempting objects will be within our grasp." f The 
Floridas and Louisiana were " tempting objects." 

There was no opportunity for testing any plans he may have 
had, for the action of the President, Mr. Adams, in determining to 
send another Envoy to France, to meet what he considered the 
advances of the French Government towards a settlement of the 
questions between the two countries, put an end to all active 
movements on the part of the United States. 

As regards the conduct of Mr. King in urging this co-operation 
between England and the United States, there can be no doubt 
of its having been the result of the strong desire to punish France 
by decisive measures, for her perfidy and atrocious acts against 
the United States, that prevented him from foreseeing that such

f Hamilton's Works, v., 184. 



666 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

co-operation, as was proposed, was really to ally the country with 
a foreign power against a mutual enemy, and that such an alli- 
ance would have been full of danger to the United States. It is 
the more extraordinary because his correspondence will show how 
little confidence he had in the certainty that the British Govern- 
ment would act against her own interests, were peace in Europe 
restored. The United States would have been left alone to carry 
out the plan, which must have failed, and failure under the cir- 
cumstances would have justified the friends of France in their 
clamor against the government.
