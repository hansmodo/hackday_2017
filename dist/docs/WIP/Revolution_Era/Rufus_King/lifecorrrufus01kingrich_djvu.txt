EDITOR S PREFACE. 

In presenting, at this late period, the interesting papers 
which are made to tell the life-work of one who, for so long 
a time, was prominent in the history of the country from 
1 784 to 1 825, an apology is due to the public that they have 
been so long withheld. Nearly fifty years ago, the duty of 
writing the life and editing the correspondence of Rufus 
King had been assumed by his son, Charles King, then 
President of Columbia College in New York ; except for 
some valuable but scanty sketches of certain periods of that 
life, which have been somewhat modified and drawn upon 
in the present work, little was done other than the collec 
tion of material. The scope of his plan is clearly indicated 
in the Prefatory Remarks, and the present editor can only 
regret that he, who was so competent, both from a close 
personal knowledge of his father and from the possession 
of a practised pen and marked felicity of language, did 
not accomplish his purpose. 

It was not until many years after the death of Mr. 
Charles King in 1868 that the papers came into the pos 
session of the present editor, who now gives them to the 
public. As is stated in the Prefatory Remarks, the copi 
ousness of the material which came into his hands makes 
(for some periods) the task of selection difficult ; while at 
other times, when questions of deep interest are involved, 
there are gaps in the correspondence which cannot be filled 
up. He has, however, carefully reproduced, verbatim, the 
letters and many summary statements by Rufus King, in 
his handwriting, explanatory of public events and throwing 
light upon persons and the times. There is no desire on 



IV EDITOR S PREFACE. 



his part to do more than to present a faithful picture of them 
as they appear, and to vindicate Mr. King where exceptions 
have been taken to his course in public matters. 

A continuous narrative has not been attempted through 
out the work, the correspondence filling up the gaps, tied 
together by explanatory remarks and notes. In an appen 
dix to each volume there will be found many papers of in 
terest, containing some of the writings and speeches of Mr. 
King during his long public career. 

Among these, one in particular will claim attention. Mr. 
King took notes of the Proceedings of the Constitutional 
Convention of 1787, of which he was a member. These are 
now published for the first time, and are confirmatory of 
the accuracy of Mr. Madison s notes, though perhaps not 
presenting any materially new matter. 

It may be here stated, to account for the reproduction of 
some letters which have appeared in the biographies of 
many contemporaneous statesmen, that during the life of 
Mr. Charles King the correspondence was at different times 
carefully examined by their writers, and such papers or let 
ters as bore upon these persons were published by them. It 
is deemed right to introduce them here again, so that their 
connection with the subject of this work may be preserved 
and his relations with them may be clearly shown. 

With these remarks the volumes are now given to the 
public, the editor believing them to contain matter interest 
ing for the study of the early periods of the history of the 
United States, and believing also that they " embody the 
record of an honorable life devoted to the service of the 
country. 

CHARLES R. KING. 



PREFATORY REMARKS. 

BY CHARLES KING, LL.D. (WRITTEN ABOUT 1860). 

The period embraced within the public life of Rufus King 
is one which cannot be too thoroughly examined and eluci 
dated by the descendants and successors of those who were 
partakers in the early struggles of the Revolutionary War, 
and who assisted in laying the foundations of and carrying 
out into successful and beneficent operation the institutions 

under which a nation of millions spread from the 

Atlantic to the Pacific, and numbering - - States is now 
flourishing in peace and prosperity, in freedom and in union. 

Broad as is the canvas thus attempted to be spread 
before his countrymen, it was found little difficult by the 
editor to fill it up with scenes and characters of dignity and 
interest. The embarrassment has been rather in the copi 
ousness than in the penury of the materials, and even now, 
after laying aside much that to him seemed precious, the 
editor fears that he may be thought to have sinned rather 
by overloading than starving the narrative. 

It must of course happen in treating of a period of 
which in the biographies, histories, and correspondences 
heretofore published, so much has been said that absolute 
novelty cannot be predicated of all that appears in these 
pages ; but it may be claimed without presumption that in 
the numerous letters now for the first time published from 
distinguished personages at home and abroad, and in the 
general historical narrative, which for a portion of the time 
embraces European as well as American events, there will 



vi PREFATORY REMARKS. 

be found a variety and a freshness that will have zest for 
the general reader. 

Writing under the impulse of filial affection and admira 
tion, and at a period of life and after varied experience of 
the world when no personal hopes or fears are likely to 
bias his judgment or restrain his pen from honest truth, 
the editor presents these volumes to his fellow-citizens as 
contributing some precious materials to the history of his 
country, and especially as embodying the record of an 
honorable life, devoted to the service of that country free 
in every stage of it from the reproach of weakness, of self 
ishness, or of personal intrigue, and marked throughout by 
high aims loftily carried out, an enlightened love of liberty, 
and by the unhesitating devotion of the individual, his 
faculties, and his possessions to the service of that land.

THE LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF 
RUFUS KING. 



CHAPTER I. 

Ancestry and early Years Enters Harvard College closed Studies at New- 
buryport Family Letters Studies at Harvard renewed Battle of 
Bunker Hill Montgomery s attack on Quebec. 

Rufus King was born in Scarborough, Maine, then form 
ing a part of the Province of Massachusetts, on March 24, 
1755. His father, Richard, was the son of John King, who 
came to America from Kent, England, soon after the year 
1700, settled in Boston, and in 1714 married Sarah Allen, by 
whom he had a son, who died in infancy. Upon her death, 
he married Mary Stowell, daughter of Benjamin Stowell, of 
Newton, Massachusetts, in 1718, and by her had several 
children, of whom Richard, the eldest, was born in Boston 
in 1718. 

Of the early years of Richard s life there are no records, 
but there is much evidence that he received a liberal educa 
tion, which prepared him for the active life which marked 
his later years. We find him, in 1740, settled in Watertown, 
Massachusetts, in prosperous business as a trader and factor 
for Ebenezer Thornton, one of the principal merchants in 
Boston, for whom he purchased and prepared large quanti 
ties of timber. 



RUFUS KING. [i755- 



It is probable that, in the prosecution of the timber busi 
ness, he visited Scarborough, for in 1744 he was at that place, 
though he did not then remain there. In the spring of 1/45, 
on the invitation of Governor Shirley, he took part as a 
commissary of subsistence, with the rank of captain, in the 
famous expedition gotten up by the Governor against Cape 
Breton, and seems to have been much relied on for co 
operation in raising men. He sailed with the expedition 
for Louisburg and was present at the capture of that fortress, 
with the whole French force which was there concentrated. 
On his return from this successful expedition he sold his 
properties in Watertown and removed permanently to Scar 
borough until his death on March 17, 1775. He was both 
a farmer and a merchant, and in each capacity was so suc 
cessful as to become the owner of three thousand acres of 
land, divided into several valuable farms, and to be the 
largest exporter of lumber from Maine. 

For the last twenty years of his life, Richard King was the 
foremost man in Scarborough, both in respect and capacity. 
The few scraps of his literary productions * which have come 
down to us evince his familiarity with the ancient classics, 
his political sagacity, his prudence and solid sense. As a 
magistrate, he had an honorable name, and it was said by 
one who knew him long and well, "that his ability, assiduity, 
and uprightness in private life were the means of his being 
called to serve his country in a public sphere, where his at 
tention, ready apprehension, and integrity of mind produced 
a justness of sentiment and soundness of judgment honora 
ble to the magistrate." He was so remarkably fond of 
children that the chief tradition preserved of him among his 
descendants is : " How he loved children ! " He died, as he 
had lived, a Christian gentleman. 

Richard King was twice married. His first wife was 

* A fire, which occurred a few years before his death, destroyed nearly all his 

papers and probably what family records he had. What were left passed into 

the hands of Dr. Southgate, and after his death " they were ruthlessly destroyed 

by those who did not appreciate their value." 



1784] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 3 

Isabella Bragdon, daughter of Samuel Bragdon, of York, 
Maine, whom he married November 20, 1753, and by whom 
he had three children : Rufus, the eldest ; Mary, who married 
Dr. Robert Southgate, of Scarborough ; and Paulina, who 
became the wife of Dr. Aaron Porter, of Portland. Upon 
the death of his first wife, in 1759, Richard King, on January 
31, 1762, married Mary Black, her cousin, daughter of Samuel 
Black, of York, who survived him many years, dying May 
25, 1816, after having borne him five children, Richard, 
Dorcas, William, the first Governor of the State of Maine ; 
Elizabeth, and Cyrus, who was a prominent man in the 
councils of the nation. 

Rufus King, after receiving such elementary education as 
the town and times afforded, was sent, at the age of twelve, 
to Byfield Academy, in Newburyport, of which Samuel 
Moody was the master. With that excellent and exact 
teacher he completed his preparatory studies, and in August, 
1773, was admitted to Harvard, being then in the eighteenth 
year of his age. The Rev. Samuel Locke was at that time 
the President of the college, though " his presidency was dis 
turbed by the political turmoils," which were coeval with 
the entrance of Rufus King upon life, and which had a great 
influence upon his character and career. On the resignation 
of Mr. Locke, at the end of 1773, no election of President 
was made until July 18, 1774, when Samuel Langdon, of 
Portsmouth, was chosen, and in October entered upon the 
duties of the office. " The Statement of Hutchinson," says 
the historian of the college, " concerning the influence of 
politics on the affairs of the college, is corroborated by the 
election of Langdon. He had rendered himself highly ac 
ceptable to Hancock and the other Patriots of Massa 
chusetts by his open and bold opposition to the measures 
of the British Government, and unquestionably owed his 
elevation as much to this circumstance as to his learning 
or general character." * 

* Quincy, History of Harvard, ii., 162. 



RUFUS KING. [ J 755- 



With such elements at work around him, and, indeed, 
within the body of which he was a member for already the 
students had publicly demonstrated in various ways their 
interest in and sympathy with the movement for liberty, 
it may well be supposed that Rufus King, of quiet, suscep 
tible, and ardent temperament, largely shared in the com 
mon sentiment, yet it is certain that he pursued with 
diligence the studies of his course and did not suffer the 
excitements of a civil war and revolution without to inter 
fere with his education. 

In January, 1775, his father died, leaving a good estate, 
though with little money yet sufficient to enable his son, 
through the considerate and liberal friendship of his brother- 
in-law, Dr. Southgate, to finish his collegiate course. It 
was indeed fortunate for him that the management of the 
paternal estate devolved upon Dr. Southgate, who had 
married his eldest sister. The most entire confidence and 
affection existed between Rufus King and his brother-in- 
law, older by several years than himself ; and to the skilful 
arrangements by the latter in the disposal of the estate and 
to advances made by him from time to time, young King was 
deeply indebted. In after life Mr. King continued to repose 
unlimited gratitude and confidence in Dr. Southgate, and 
still left to him chiefly the management of the family 
property ; and that from one so methodical and exact in all 
his transactions, and so strictly just, was the highest evidence 
of his entire trust in the integrity of Dr. Southgate and in 
his affectionate interest for the family. 

The following letters, though long, illustrate well the 
characters of Dr. Southgate and of Rufus King. 

" N. Y., 3ist Dec., 1786. 

" I have been reflecting whether you have written to me since I 
left Massachusetts in 1784, but cannot recollect an instance. I 
have written to you occasionally and should have done so more 
frequently, could I have promoted your interest or afforded you 
amusement. 



1784] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 5 

" I expected and intended to have seen you this last autumn, 
and it was a disappointment, with which I am most sensibly 
affected, that you had left Boston but a few days before I arrived 
there. It is now uncertain when I shall see you. My present 
determination is to be in Massachusetts next summer but objects 
may so alter, and such different engagements may present them 
selves, that I can answer for the certainty of no project so remote. 
In addition to the very great pleasure and satisfaction which I 
should enjoy in seeing all the branches of the family and in being 
informed of their situation and views, I wish extremely to make 
a final settlement with you and Porter relative to the pecuniary 
affairs which remain unsettled between us. I have always in 
tended that the monies in the hands of Porter, should go to you. 
Indeed I have desired you to apply to him, whenever you judged 
proper on my behalf, and he has assured me that he would attend 
to your requests. I have neither books nor papers with me here ; 
they are at Newburyport. I pray you to apply to Porter, and 
desire him to make out a statement of our accounts ; he has in 
his power the necessary materials ; he knows the amount and 
terms of his obligation to me ; he also knows the payments which 
I have received." [Here follows an account of wood, board, etc., 
received by R. K., in the scarcity of a circulating medium, in 
payment from his brother-in-law Porter.] "The payment he has 
made may be very readily ascertained by reducing the price of 
the article at the time by the scale of its specie value ; whatever 
that may be it will be placed to his credit on interest, deducting 
the capital and interest thereon of the sums I have received, from 
the principal and interest of the sum Porter owes me, when 
ascertained as above. The balance will exhibit the debt due to 
me at the time of adjustment. This I conceive to be the principle 
whereby Porter and I ought to settle our accounts. I wish you 
to show him this letter and that he would consider it as well 
addressed to him as to you. I also desire that both he and you 
would be candid in giving me your opinion on the subject and 
to remark freely to me your ideas concerning the manner in 
which this account ought to be adjusted. 

" I have mentioned these sentiments relative to the settlement 
between Porter and me, not as the only just ones which may be 
entertained concerning that business, but because I think they 



RUFUS KING. I 1 7 SB- 



a principle founded in law and justice. However I wish 
not to be my own judge. I will be governed as much by what 
you and Porter shall think equitable and just as he can desire. I 
entreat you to confer together and make a settlement of the busi 
ness, send it to me with your wishes, and I am certain you will not 
be dissatisfied with my conduct. 

"I must add another request. It ^proper that I should ; it is 
justice to you that I should attend to it. Altho there has never 
been a period, since I first went to Newburyport, when I could 
satisfactorily attend to, and finally close the accounts between you 
and me, yet my intention has always been that in any event that 
might happen to me, you should be secure, and there never was a 
time when you were not so. We went once or tv/ice cursorily 
into an examination of these accounts, but never made an explicit 
settlement. I want you to make a statement of your account with 
me, in such a manner as you think is just &amp; proper. As the debt 
arose during the circulation of paper, it may probably be more 
easily liquidated by the scale than in any other way. I say more 
easily ; how far a liquidation by the scale will be equitable or just, 
in your estimation, I cannot say ; if such a rule of adjustment, 
notwithstanding its advantage in point of facility and its authority 
in contemplation of law, is not wholly agreeable to you, I pray you 
to apply such other rule for the adjustment of our account, as may 
be more conformable to your expectation and agreeable to your 
sentiments of equity and justice. Be assured that it is my intention 
that you should be perfectly satisfied in this business as well as in 
the manner of closing it." 

This letter seems to have been received and acted upon in 
the spirit in which it was written, as the following letter from 
Mr. King, while he was attending the Federal Convention in 
Philadelphia, will show : 

" ROBERT SOUTHGATE, Esq., 

" Scarborough. 

" PHILAD., Aug. 19, 1787. 
" MY DEAR FRIEND : 

" I am entirely and perfectly satisfied with your adjustment of 
the account between us, but am so engaged at this time, that I 



1784] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. J 

have it not in my power to reply to several important points in 
your kind and affectionate letter. You observe that you may 
have occasion for some part of the balance which I owe you, and 
that Porter will not probably have it in his power to give you cash 
on my account. I have a sum of money in the hands of my 
friend Christ. Gore of Boston and will write to him to pay you 
on my account such sum as you may have occasion for. . . . 
If you have a demand for the whole sum which I owe you, (tho* 
I always supposed that Porter would be able and willing to pay 
his debt) I will make provision to discharge it at any time on 
notice of 20 or 30 days. Indeed as I have it in my power, as I 
justly and with gratitude owe you the balance stated in your 
account, it will afford me the highest pleasure to discharge it 
whenever your convenience shall require." 

In April, 1775, immediately after the battle of Lexington, 
fought on the iQth, the college buildings were taken posses 
sion of and occupied by the American troops. The college 
term was broken up and the students were dispersed. The 
library and archives of the college were removed first to 
Andover and afterwards to Concord, at which place the 
studies were resumed and continued until the evacuation of 
Boston by the British troops in March, 1776, enabled the 
Legislature, under whose authority the college buildings at 
Cambridge were used for public purposes, to restore them to 
their appropriate use. On June 2ist the students were 
again assembled at Cambridge after a dispersion of fourteen 
months. This interval appears to have been passed by 
Rufus King in and about Newburyport. His attention and 
feelings were deeply interested in the political struggle going 
on with the mother country, and his letters of that day, full 
of the incidents of the struggle, show how ardently he em 
braced the American cause. On June 25th, for instance, he 
thus writes to Dr. Southgate : 

" Mr. Preble of Falmouth calls upon me this morning from Cam 
bridge. I take my pen to write to you all the news I have. My 
dear Friend, I think the crisis has almost arrived ; a day import- 



8 RUFUS KING. L I 7SS- 

ant to America is at hand, a day in which every one feels himself 
deeply interested. Two and twenty transports have arrived this 
week ; the number of soldiers they brought cannot be ascertained. 
Five hundred horses were shipped in these transports ; part have 
arrived but very much enfeebled. The soldiers who came in the 
transports are said to be irregulars and chiefly recruited out of 
jails and places of punishment. Gage has at this period sent out 
a most scandalously false relation of known facts, and after offering 
in his poor way safety and protection to every one who shall be 
so wicked and so abandoned a villain as to desert his country s 
cause, he with great appearance of pomp and pious sanctity de 
nounces death and confiscation to every one who shall not com 
ply with his despicable request. But America spurns the produc 
tion of the petty tyrant, and treating it with deserved contempt, 
stands firm upon the pillars of liberty, immoveable as Heaven 
and determined as fate. One kindred spirit catches from man to 
man. . . . The continental Congress are unanimous and 
determined. They have voted to raise 70,000 men and three 
millions of money." 

Another letter, written apparently soon after the battle 
of Bunker Hill, contains a narrative of this battle, which is 
mainly interesting as recording the facts as understood on 
the spot at the time. 

R. KING TO DR. SOUTHGATE, 

[Probably July, I775-] 
DEAR SIR : 

. . . I suppose you must have heard before now very near 
the Truth, concerning the engagement at Bunker s Hill. Never 
theless, I having been at Cambridge since the Action, &amp; having 
had opportunity of enquiring, concerning the Conduct on both 
sides, of persons who are capable of giving a reasonable &amp; just 
account &amp; who were really in the Action, shall relate in short 
what I learnt concerning the affair. That a Detachment of be 
tween i ooo &amp; 1500 of our Men was sent on Friday Night the 
i6th June to throw up an Intrenchment upon the Back side of 
Bunker s Hill, back of Charlestown ; they continued their work 
with great Diligence until ye morning, when they were discovered 



1784] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. g 

by the Enemy in Boston &amp; on board the Ships, upon which a very 
sharp cannonade began, which considerably annoyed our Men in 
their Works. Intelligence was soon had at head Quarters of the 
state of matters, &amp; the Camp was ordered to be in readiness in 
case of an Alarm. The Cannonade continued from Corpse Hill, 
the Ships in Harbr. &amp; from sundry floating Batteries untill abt. 2 
o clock, when our Men perceived that the Enemy were abt. bring 
ing over their Forces to force them from their Intrenchment. 
The Enemy soon transported themselves, to abt. 3000 in Number, 
to the point of Land between Mystick &amp; Charles River, there 
they formed regularly &amp; with great Calmness. They then began 
their march, with a very wide Front, in the centre of which there 
was a field piece &amp; one at each wing. They soon came within 
shot of our Men, in the Intrenchment, who fired with great cour 
age and very severely. The Enemy sustained the Fire of our 
Men, which was extremely warm, with admirable Fortitude &amp; 
Bravery ; they in their advancing stood shoulder to shoulder and 
as soon as one Man was shot down in the front, another from the 
Rear immediately filled his place, &amp; by that means in a wonderful 
manner kept their Body inform, upon which alone their success 
depends. 

In this manner they continued their advancing until they forced 
our Men from their Intrenchments, by their Wings closing in 
order to surround and cut them off. The most of those who 
were slain on our side, were killed after they left the Intrench 
ment. Previous to their (the Enemy s) advancing against our 
Intrenchments, they fired the town of Charlestown, which was 
entirely consumed. Our Loss was abt. 60 slain, 30 taken Prison 
ers, &amp; about 1 80 wounded, likewise 4 field pieces were left. All 
accounts confirm the supposition that the Enemy s Loss, kill d &amp; 
wounded can t be under 1400 : amongst whom were 84 com 
missioned Officers. America lost a Good Friend in Dr. Warren 
and a brave Soldier in Maj. McClary. The Enemy have fortified 
Bunker s Hill, &amp; our Men have intrenched in such a manner 
round them, that they would find it difficult to get out. Gage 
fires some of his Cannon from the Neck now &amp; then into Rox- 
bury, but does no great Execution. 

It is generally thought, that if the officers had led on their men 
according to their orders, our Men would have prevented the 



10 KUFUS KING. [i755~ 

Enemy s forcing our Works, and obliged them to have retreated. 
Officers did not do their duty, nor were our men led on to the 
action.* 

R. KING. 

My Paper is all out &amp; this is written in great haste, therefore 
you ll excuse. Mr. Winthrop the Librarian was in the Engage 
ment and received a slight wound in his head. 

It does not appear whether he went on with his class at 
Concord when the duties of the college were resumed there ; 
he rejoined them, however, as soon as the college buildings 
were restored to their original use, and continued a diligent 
student to the close of the term of 1777, in which year he 
was graduated with some distinction for his classical and 
literary attainments, and for his oratorical powers, which he 
had studiously cultivated. 

On leaving his Alma Mater he forthwith entered upon the 
study of the law in Newburyport under Theophilus Parsons, 
already an eminent lawyer and afterwards distinguished for 
a long and honorable career as Chief-Justice of Massa 
chusetts. 

But he brought with him from Cambridge unabated zeal 
for the cause of his country. In July, 1776, while yet a 
collegian, in writing to Dr. Southgate giving an account of 

* It is known that a severe scrutiny was instituted into the conduct of the 
officers charged with delinquency in this battle, and that some of them were 
cashiered. Frothingham in his Siege of Boston, pp. 66, 67, gives the names of 
and sentences upon several of them so tried. Among these were four colonels 
of regiments, one major and one captain, of whom all but two of the colonels 
were cashiered. The Major Mr. McClary, whose death is deplored in the 
above letter, was attached to Col. Stark s regiment, and is thus described : 
" He was a favorite officer. He was nearly six feet and a half in height &amp; 
of an athletic frame. During the action he fought with great bravery ; and of 
amidst the roar of artillery, his stentorian voice was heard animating the men 
and inspiring them with his own energy. After the action was over he rode to 
Medford to procure bandages for the wounded &amp; on his return went with a few 
of his comrades to reconnoitre the English, then on Bunker s Hill. As he was 
on his way to rejoin his men, a shot from a frigate lying where Craigie s bridge 
is, passed through his body ; he leaped a few feet from the ground, pitched 
forward &amp; fell dead on his face." 



1784] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. II 

the efforts making in the neighborhood of Cambridge 
to send recruits to the northern army to oppose Burgoyne, 
he adds : " Were I free from my present connection, I would 
surely enter immediately into the service designed for this 
quarter." When two years afterward, in 1778, from the 
town of Newburyport, where he was at his law studies, a 
detachment went forth under the command of General 
Glover, of that town, to assist in the attempt that was to be 
made by General Sullivan to retake Rhode Island, it Is not 
a matter of surprise that Rufus King, abandoning his books, 
hastened to the camp, was welcomed by General Glover, 
honored with the position of aid-de-camp, and was so an 
nounced in general orders of August 17, 1778. 

That expedition, as is well known, failed of its object by 
reason of the withdrawal of the French fleet under Count 
D Estaing to other services in the West Indies. The com 
mand of the waters thereby reverting to the British, all the 
efforts of General Sullivan s force to dislodge the enemy 
from Newport were rendered abortive ; and indeed the 
situation of the force itself, on an island, became perilous ;. 
therefore after a short and vigorous campaign, the American 
army was withdrawn to the main land and the volunteer 
portions of it disbanded. The aid-de-camp s services were 
dispensed with by the following order, as it appears in the 
order book of General Glover still in existence.* 

Text of General Order 5th September, 1778: 

" Major King &amp; Few, all having served as volunteer aids to 
Gen. Glover in the late Expedition against R. Island, and having 
merited the approbation of Gen. Glover, the Commander in Chief 
(Genl. Sullivan) dismisses them with his thanks for their faithful 
services." 

This brief service is Rufus King s only connection with 
the military annals of the Revolution. In a letter to Dr. 
Southgate, 1st October, 1778, we find this allusion to it : 

* In the hands of Robert Hooper, grandson of General Glover, President in 
1851 of the Boston Bank. 



12 RUFUS KING. [&gt;755~ 



" I determined to have given you a particular account of my 
Rh. Island expedition immediately upon my return, when the 
matter was fresh and talked of, but no opportunity presenting, I 
delayed from day to day and now it is become an Old Story. I 
enjoyed fine health upon the Island and the scene was not dis 
agreeable to me ; I saw and experienced enough to satisfy my 
curiosity.* . . . Adieu. 

"R. KING." 
&amp; 

Having thus tasted of war, Mr. King returned to New- 
buiyport, where he applied himself diligently to his profes 
sional studies, and being admitted to the bar in 1780, he 
entered at once upon the practice of the law. His success 
was rapid, and both as a speaker and careful and painstaking 

* A singular illustration of a common saying and perhaps belief among soldiers 
" that every bullet has its billet," nearly affecting the subject of this biography, 
is thus related by Colonel Trumbull, who was a volunteer aid to General 
Sullivan : " As I rode back to the main body on Bull s Hill, I fell in with a 
party of soldiers, bearing a wounded officer on a litter, whom I found to be 
my friend H. Sherburne, brother of Mrs. John Langdon of Portsmouth, N. H., 
a fellow volunteer. They were carrying him to the surgeon in the rear to have 
his leg amputated. He had just been wounded by a random ball while sitting 
at breakfast. This was a source of lasting mortification, as he told me after 
wards : If this had happened to me on the field, in active duty, the loss of a 
leg might have been borne, but to be condemned through all my future life to 
say I lost my leg under a breakfast-table, is too bad. Mr. Rufus King was 
acting that day as volunteer aid-de-camp to General Glover, whose quarters were 
in a house at the foot and east of Quaker Hill, distant from the contested 
position of the rear guard a long mile. The General and the officers who com 
posed his family were seated at breakfast, their horses standing saddled at the 
door. The firing on the heights of the Hill became heavy and incessant, when 
the General directed Mr. King to mount and see what and where the firing was. 
He quitted the table. Poor Sherburne took his chair and was hardly seated, 
when a spent cannon-ball from the scene of operations bounded in at the open 
window, fell upon the floor, and rolling to its destination, Sherburne s ankle, 
crushed all the bones of his foot. Surely," adds Colonel Trumbull, in language 
which translates reverently the idea of the military saying quoted above, " there 
is a Providence which controls the events of human life and which withdrew 
Mr. King from this misfortune." Colonel Trumbull s Autobiography, pp. 
53, 54- 

Mr. King in after life occasionally met Mr. Sherburne with his wooden leg, 
\vhich, he used to say, should by right be worn by him, Mr. King.

attorney, he obtained reputation and employment.* Peace 
being restored, the political condition of his country, now 
an independent nation, could not fail to enlist his interest ; 
for its sufferings and perils had not passed away with the 
war. A disordered currency, the absence of any strong 
national authority, languishing commerce, a heavy debt, and 
no certain or adequate revenue, combined to depress all but 

* Mr. George Lunt writes to Mr. Charles King, Boston, June 9, 1854, the 
following : 

" Hon. CHARLES KING, Pres. Col. Coll.: 
" Dear Sir: 

" I heard an anecdote a few days since of your father s daily life, which I 
thought unlikely to have reached you, and which, whether of use to your 
biography or otherwise, it could not but be pleasing to you to learn. 

" The story is to the following tenor. That on some occasion he had been 
attending court at Plymouth, and having been detained until Saturday night 
and, we will charitably suppose, his business requiring necessarily his presence 
at home on Monday morning, he took advantage of the fine Sunday morning 
preceding, to start on his homeward way, of course in those times on horse 
back. Upon riding through the town of Hanover, on a solitary road, he came 
upon a plain and quiet place of public worship ; whereupon he hitched his 
horse, and upon entering found himself in a Quaker Meeting-house ; the 
town then and now having many inhabitants Quakers. 

"After sitting quietly for some time and observing no outward manifestation 
of the movement of the Spirit among the brethren, Mr. King arose, addressed 
the astonished assembly in a style, we will presume, so much higher than the 
ordinary devotional exercises, and at the same time in a manner so entirely 
appropriate to the place and the occasion, that in the midst of their amazement 
at his sudden appearance among them (where strangers were not often seen), 
and the effect of his extraordinary eloquence and (as I have been told) very 
handsome person he stepped out and mounted and roundly he rode away. 

" The consequence was that certain, at least, of the honest brethren, not to 
speak of the sisters, always insisted upon it, that an angel had appeared among 
them. But some years afterwards, at the commencement of the session of the

the most firm and hopeful among the patriots, who had suc 
cessfully carried on the war for independence. Massachu 
setts felt the full share of all these difficulties, and Newbury- 
port, then one of the most active and flourishing of her sea 
ports, called upon the young lawyer in 1783 to be one of 
her representatives in the General Court.* On the 7th of 
October he took his seat, soon becoming conspicuous there 
by his power as a debater and by his intelligence and in 
dustry in the discharge of his duties. He early perceived 
that the evils of the times could only be remedied by a 
faithful and willing adherence on the part of each State to 
the provisions of the Confederation, so as to enable the 
General Congress to take care of the interests of all the 
States, to provide for the common debt, common expendi 
ture, the common defence, and the common welfare. Yet 
when, in 1784, Congress called upon the States severally to 
authorize the raising of the five per cent, impost, for the use 
of the general government, Mr. King led the party in the 
Legislature of Massachusetts, which opposed the duty and 
necessity of conceding this impost to the General Congress; 
and although opposed by General Sullivan, whose great age 
and revolutionary service necessarily imparted weight to his 
opinions, Mr. King prevailed and the measure was defeated 
at the time.f

"A return was made from the Selectmen of the town of Newburyport, 
whereby it appeared that the inhabitants of said town, by virtue of a precept 
issued to them the last sitting of court, had made choice of Rufus King, Esq., 
to represent them in the General Court in the room of Jonathan Titcomb, Esq., 
who had been chosen a naval officer. Mr. Bartlett was directed to attend to the 
qualifying of Mr. King in the usual manner." 

f " About the year 1784, Congress recommended to the several States to 
grant to the general government, a five per cent, impost. The proposition 
met with much opposition in the general court. A distinction immediately 
arose between the federal and state interest ; those members who were adverse 
to the grant, being classed as friends of the states, those in favor of it as the 
friends of the general government. The leader of the latter party, on this 
occasion, was the late Governor of Massachusetts, Sullivan, then the most

popular speaker in the house ; of the former, Mr. King, lite debate was in 
the highest degree interesting, and after being protractedLfor several days, 
terminated in the triumph of those who voted with Mr. King. Of the nerits 
of the controversy, however, we forbear to speak ; for it would necessarily lead 
us into too wide a discussion, to be enabled to ascertain the precise point at 
which state jealousies became unreasonable. But Mr. King was then in the 
season of warm and ingenuous youth, and if, in this instance, he did not take 
the better side, it may safely be asserted that, at least, his choice was made 
from pure and proper feeling." William Coleman, " Sketch of Rufus King," 
in Delaplaine s Repository, vol. i., p. 178. 

" Mr. Coleman s authority for this is a memorandum of Mr. King, in 1817, 
in these words : 

" My impression now is that the discussion in the Legislature of Mass., in 
wh. I was opposed to Mr. S. and other distinguished men, was relative to the 
recommendation of Congress to the several States to grant them power to levy 
for the use of the general Government an impost of 5 pc. on the value of all 
goods imported into the United States. 

" In the course of the War of the Revolution, a jealousy was excited by the 
Adamses and other men in Congress, that France was acquiring too great an 
influence over our public affairs ; that certain men and particular States were 
devoted to the views of France and that the welfare of the respective States 
required, that instead of encreasing the power of Congress the general Govt. 
should be held to a dependence on the States for supplies, wh. would enable 
the States to enquire concerning the policy and measures pursued by the Govt. 

" Another question propounded to the States by Congress and concerning 
wh. we had much discussion, was the alteration of the article of the old Con 
federation which apportioned the supplies among the several States according 
to a valuation of lands granted and surveyed in each State, including the houses 
thereon and improvements thereof for the rule by wh. direct taxes are appor 
tioned among the States by the present Constitution. 

" The recommendation of Congress on both points was followed by Mass, 
and if I can trust my recollection I opposed the first and supported the second."

f The Continental Congress had met hitherto at Philadelphia, when it was not 
in possession of the enemy ; but by reason of the mutinous conduct of a portion of 
the Pennsylvania line of troops, who marched upon the Hall where Congress 
was assembled in June, 1783, and sought by menace of arms to extract from 
that body the arrears of pay due to the army, it adjourned to meet in Prince 
ton, the Governor of Pennsylvania and the city authorities being unable, or 
dilatory in efforts, to afford proper protection to Congress. The College build 
ings at Princeton were promptly offered for its use, and the citizens as well as 
the public authorities of that town, and indeed of the State at large, pledged 
themselves that in New Jersey, Congress should be secure from all interruptions 
or insult. After a brief session at Princeton, Congress on November 4th, both 
for its own convenience and not to be the cause of interrupting the studies in 
the College, adjourned to Annapolis, Md., and at the close of the session re 
solved to hold the next session at Trenton, where it met on November i, 1784.

sion, in which his name appears, it is among the Nays on a 
motion of Virginia to strike out from the bill then under 
consideration for establishing a permanent seat of govern 
ment for the Confederation, the provision requiring it to be 
established "on the banks of either side the Delaware below 
Lamberton," and to insert in lieu thereof the words" at George 
town, on the Potomac." This was the beginning of a lorn 
struggle, which was eventually successful, of the South to 
carry the seat of the General Government into the slave 
States. By a vote of Congress, in which Mr. King concurred, 
it was decided on motion of Mr. Howel, of Rhode Island, 
seconded by Mr. Jay, that there should be only one fixed 
place for the meeting of Congress, and a committee was ap 
pointed " to lay out a district not less than two, not exceeding 
three, miles square on the banks of either side of the Dela 
ware not more than eight miles above or below the lower 
Falls thereof for a federal town," and to contract for the 
erection of suitable buildings, etc. ; and it was stipulated 
that until these should be ready for the accommodation of 
Congress, that body should sit in New York. 

It was during this short session at Trenton that Mr. King 
became personally acquainted with Lafayette, whom it was 
his good fortune in after years to serve ; for on the nth of 
December Lafayette was formally received by a committee 
of Congress, Mr. Jay being chairman, that he might finally 
take leave of them previous to his return to France.

was to take off a quantity of Sheep, horned Cattle &amp; Horses. The 
Sheep &amp; Cattle belonged to Men in Chelsea and round the same ; 
the Horses belonged to Genl. Gage. They effected their Design 
without the loss of any Lives on our side ; the Loss upon the side 
of Genl. Gage is uncertain, tho probably 40 or 50 killed or mor 
tally wounded : the Armed Schooner, of about 90 Tuns burthen, 
was burnt, &amp; the Swivels &amp;c belonging to her, with some of the 
sails &amp;c, fell into our people s hands. They brought off from 
these two Islands abt. 600 Sheep, together with their lambs ; the 
number of horned cattle uncertain, together with 39 horses. Upon 
Thursday last, a Detachment was sent off from Genl. Putnam s 
Forces in Roxbury, who went to an Island, called Deer Island, in 
Boston Harbour, to take off a number of Sheep which was there 
on. A Barge with a Number of Men was sent from some of the 
ships in the Harbour, to discover what our Men were after. The 
Barge proceeded so nigh to the Island, before they discovered 
our Men that upon our Men s discovering themselves, she found 
herself within their power &amp; surrendered themselves prisoners. 
Our Men drove off about 300 Sheep and after they had hauled 
up the Barge and hoisted their sails upon the Land, they placed 
their prisoners in her, and dragged her &amp; them to Cambridge in

your first inquiry. Montgomery, alas twas an unhappy repulse 
a great, good man lost How, I ll tell you. Whether the plan was 



1784] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 19 

founded on cool reason, deliberation &amp; prudence I shall not pre 
tend to say. Matters of fact will suffice ; much doubtless may 
be urged in favor of ye former however, leaving Speculation : 
by the last Express, (one Parker, a gentleman with whom I have 
no intimate acquaintance) the state of affairs in ye Northern 
world appears to have been this. Genl. Montgomery at ye head 
of about 1200 Men, flushed with success, formed in his mind the 
plan of storming the City of Quebec, defended by about 1300 or 
1400 Men, the greater part of whom were Sailors : which being 
approved of by his fellow-warriors he attempted in the following 
manner. Abt. 300 men under Col. Arnold were to enter the lower 
Town early in the morning when the tide of the St. Lawrence 
was out ; at the same time a very considerable part of ye remainder 
of the Army was to enter the upper town with scaling ladders 
under Genl. Montgomery. Arnold succeeded in his Quarter, 
entered the lower town, but being wounded, by advice retreated. 
The party which was under Arnold waited with anxiety for the 
signal of Montgomery s having succeeded in entering ye upper 
town : but in this unhappily they were disappointed, for Mont 
gomery upon attempting found it impossible to succeed in his 
plan unless he could destroy the North West Gate of the upper 
town ; which, after fruitlessly attempting to persuade some of his 
Men to attempt, the greater part of whom were thrown into a 
great panick, upon the opposition they met with, he and his aid- 
de-camp endeavoured to accomplish by setting fire to the Gate, 
but were both unluckily killed in retiring ; which immediately 
spread confusion amongst his men, who instantly fled in great 
disorder. Arnold s party finding themselves unable to support 
the charge of the beseiged, who assumed great courage after the 
death of Montgomy. and the Repulse of his party, endeavoured to 
retreat and escape out of the city, but found themselves hemmed 
in by ye Tide, which had risen after he entered ye town, &amp; they 
were obliged to surrender themselves and became prisoners. 
However the army did not forsake the Suburbs of ye City, but 
when Parker came away, they were hanging abt. ye City. Large 
Re-inforcementshave gone, and still are going to yt. Quarter. What 
success they may have can t say ; hope for ye best. Col. Knox 
has lately got in from Ticonderoga with a considerable train of

When the sally was made from Montreal and Allen taken prisoner, 
in less than three days 2000 of them took up arms for Carleton ;

Johnson had embodied themselves, formed a fort, publickly

America was ingaged manifested their determination of not 
assisting them and resolution to oppose them in case of a

of our frontiers. So that it was thought expedient to crush the 
conspiracy while young ; and Schuyler having performed his 
march at the head of 2 or 3000 men, entered their fort without 
opposition, disarmed them &amp; having demolished the fort, returned, 
after being assured of the friendship of the Savages, with 7 or 8 
of the chief insurgents, whom he has confined within the limits of 
the city of Albany. Johnson s person became sacred by reason of 
the affection the Indians have for him, otherwise Schuyler un

MY DEAR FRIEND : 

Fortune seems to lower upon us in our public matters ; the 
situation of wh., at present, is embarrassing. Canada proves an 
unlucky Department. Our Troops, tis said, have retreated to St. 
Johns, Burgoyne having arrived with 10,000 Foreigners. New 
recruits are raising to march that way. 6. bounty is given. Was 
I free from my present connections, would surely enter imme 
diately into the service designed for that quarter. 

From York we have, as yet, no account of any action, as has 
been expected. A most high conceived, villainous plot has been 
discovered there, for taking off the General Officers &amp; blowing up 
the magazine. Particulars have not yet transpired. . . . 

Believe me, my dear Brother, when I tell you, that the situation 
of our family, added to the gloomy prospect, which a young man 
in my condition, has before him upon entering into the world at 
this day, distracts my soul and renders me almost desperately 
resolved to engage in my Country s service, hoping thereby so far 
to drive away reflection as to be moderately happy. I confess 
that could I enjoy domestic ease &amp; pleasure with my friends &amp; 
acquaintance, twould be more agreeable than the fatigues &amp; 
tumults of war. In the former Ambition would be dead, but 
nevertheless, I should be calm &amp; happy. In the latter I doubt 
not I should likewise be happy. In Camp there is a spacious

field for ambition to play in ; &amp; the man who places " death in 
one eye &amp; honour in the other," will never fail of acquiring that 
distinction his soul thirsts for. But for the present, I suspend 
these notions, &amp; as well as 1 am able, content myself with my 
situation. . . . 

With greatest sincerity your s, 

R. K. 



R. KING TO DR. SOUTHGATE. 

CAMBRIDGE, Aug. 6, 1776. 
DEAR DOCTOR : 

The last time I wrote you, I mentioned the discovery of the 
plot * at York. . . . Suffice it to say, that it appears from all 
accounts that the lowest &amp; most infamous methods were employ d 
by Government to bring about their darling plan of subjugating 
the Colonies, &amp; that no groveling baseness was stuck at, no sums 
of money spared in bribing Villains to their purpose. 

The plot was by far more extensive, I believe, than is generally 
imagined, &amp; had the scheme been executed with success, in its 
greatest latitude, it would, I doubt not, have been attended with 
most fatal &amp; ruinous consequences to the common cause of 
America. 

A happy discovery has saved what could never in our present 
situation (have) been restored. The Life of one General, with 
some other officers, who would have been sacrificed with him, had 
their plot taken effect, is of more importance perhaps than that 
of a very considerable Army. 

How affairs will finally turn is impossible to say with certainty. 
Much, very much, probably depends as to the continuance of the 
war, upon the Event of this Campaign. Great is the anxiety of 
men concerning the expected Battle of York. Genl. Howe has or 
will soon have at least 20, if not 5 and 20,000 effective Men. 
These with Officers experienced in Practice of War, brave by 
custom, are no contemptible Enemy ; whenever they strike, small 
difficulties will not oppose them. Half their numbers must fall 
before they give up their point. On the other hand 47,000 Men, 
or more, strongly intrenched with 5 or 600 good pieces of Ord 
nance, commanded even as they are, engaged in the Cause of 

* Marshall s Life of Washington^ v. ii., p. 392 ; Irving s Life of Washington, 
v. ii., p. 245. 



1784] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 2$ 

America, with a firm persuasion of a peculiar justness &amp; righteous 
ness manifest in their cause, are an enemy which I dare say Genl. 
Howe thinks of in many a wakeful moment. Many pretend to 
say that the British troops must suffer a repulse should they, 
which I think their sullied honor will oblige them to, make an 
attack upon our troops in their Intrenchments. 

Respecting the Northern quarter, I imagine you must know as 
much with you, as is known here. Genl. Gates doubtless will 
make a stand at Ticonderoga I hope an effectual one. His men 
at present, I believe, are in fine health by the latest accounts it 
appears so. Phinney s Regiment is ordered from Boston to 
Ticonderoga. I guess the pious Elder would as lieve tarry where 
he is ; but he was formerly fond of action hope now he will be 
satisfied. Genl. Sullivan left the Army at the Northward, im 
mediately upon the arrival of Genl. Gates, by whom, in every view, 
he was superceded. A great uneasiness appeared among the 
Soldiers upon the appointment of Gates. A number of the field 
officers addressed Genl. Sullivan upon his leaving the Camp, ex 
pressing their fondness not only of his conduct while Commander- 
in-chief, which by the bye is spoken of in the highest terms, but 
of his general character since the first formation of our Army &amp; 
regretting most unfeignedly his determination of leaving the Camp. 
He answered their generous address with great complaisance &amp; 
likewise with an enthusiasm highly becoming him as a Soldier. 
Is it not probable as he is gone to Philadelphia, that he will have 
the Command of the flying Camp, forming at this time in that 
quarter ? The Command, I think, as yet, is not given to any one. 
Genl. Lee has acted in character* according to our accounts from 
the southward concerning him. . . . Adieu.

our people are growing stronger, being much reduced with Fevers 
and Fluxes. Venison in great plenty on the mountains upon the 
tops of which the snow begins to make its appearance. They are 
firm at present. I write you as things cross my mind. Our 
General Assemblies have chosen committees to go to York and 
Ticonderoga for raising the new army. They give no additional 
bounty, to that of the Congress. They engage a suit of clothes 
yearly, together with a blanket and Hat. 

I imagine by what I learn from various quarters, that few of 
the men now with Genl. will tarry longer than the expiration of 
their enlistments. At York appearances are good respecting the 
matter ; the soldiers show a disposition of continuing in the Service. 
The papers have doubtless informed you of Major Bigelow s 
return home, together with the other Americans taken prisoners 
at the attempt of Storming Quebec. They all gave their parole 
not to take up arms again against His Majesty until exchanged. 
Major Bigelow speaks in the highest terms of Genl. Carlton s 
humanity &amp; noble generosity towards the Americans who were 
prisoners. He wipes off all those aspersions thrown on his 
character and represents him as a Courtier, a Gentleman &amp; a 
Soldier.

have a stolen horse or even the horse a Tory ever rode upon.

so suspicious of every face. Farewell.

MY DEAR SIR : 

. . . I have received your letters and noticed their contents ; 
find them nearly what common report had before informed me. I 
am very sorry matters have taken this turn. It is what I was 
unprepared for. I have no consciousness of having myself 
conducted in a manner unfriendly to my country : Nor did I 
conceive my Friends in Scarboro had. But it is the Spirit of the 
Times. An honest zeal, or rather the zeal of a man who means 
to conduct uprightly and well is sometimes detrimental ; often 
injures the Cause it was meant to promote. I think in your, and 
my, circumstances it is unfortunate, to say no more, that we should 
feel the effects of this zeal which I hope is not mixed with any 
base and unmanly Passions. As it is, let us make the best of it. 
Innocence, says the Divine, always finds protection. It would 
have been better expressed by saying it ought always to find 
protection. With respect to myself, let the game go on ; I am

out of their power : and should the matter have been other ways 
circumstanced, I should have feared nothing from an honest 
unprejudiced jury. My heart tells me I have no grounds of fear. 
They must prosecute me as an inhabitant of Scarboro , which 
I am not. With respect to you and others make yourselves as 
easy as you can. Be seasonable in looking out for evidences of 
your generally friendly disposition to the country ; the cheerful 
ness of paying your Taxes ; your observations you have made in 
private companies ; your readiness to conform to the Rules and 
Laws prescribed by the Government, &amp;c., &amp;c. Everything in this 
way is evidence. I have letters of yours that may serve you. 
Not a single person has been convicted who had counsel. Mr. 
Parsons, with whom I am, thinks the above recommended conduct 
the best. He is a generous, liberal man, and bids me inform you, 
that should you be brought to trial, if Mr. B. s character would hurt 
him as a Counsellor, or he should think it imprudent to appear in 
this, he will come and take upon himself your defence. But it is 
more than probable, that the matter will subside. ... An 
unfortunate accident happened about ten minutes past. The 
Privateer armed ship Neptune owned by a Marine Society of this 
town, new off the stocks, sailed about an hour since from our bar, 
and about ten minutes since overset in the Bay, about 80 men on 
board. She was going round to Cape Ann.

MY DEAR SIR : 

In addition to the ungrateful disposition of my Fellow Citizens 
which must give me pain, you mention the unhappy situation of 
our Family. It is inconceivable the uneasiness and anxiety I have 
experienced on this score. Early did I fear unfortunate conse 
quences from my honored Father s Death. But indeed my fear 
never represented what I have experienced. Why the affairs are 
so circumstanced you as well can say as I inform. How to con 
duct I scarcely know : My plan is a daily one ; I content myself 
as well as I can from morning to evening, &amp; so from day to day : 
You know my circumstances ; I must go thro with my Educa-

tion ; if I can acquire that, and live to see peace, I am content. 
It would have been pleasing to me to have retained my Patrimony 
entire. But that is impossible ; I grasped some ideas for realities ; 
but the late transactions at Scarborough have determined me. 
Some plans I had in my mind respecting my settlement in your 
part of the country, founded upon contracted notions prejudices. 
But I renounce them all. My Education I will have. My Patri 
mony I trust will be sufficient. The expense as now counted is 
high, is great. Board I pay high for ; clothes are scarcely to be 
bought. You say you are uncertain whether you can supply me 
as heretofore. I wish it may be in your power. I can t live in 
this place under ^90. per annum. That I shall want quarterly 
If you could not procure me that supply suppose Porter &amp; you 
could do it between you. I could easily sell at this time, but I 
want not the money on my hands. ... I write as if I ex 
pected no ill consequences from your being upon the list at Scar 
borough ; as in truth I do not. Fabyan, John A. Milleken, 
Moulton, &amp;c, are your friends. Your Salt-petre making is a 
sufficient proof of your good wishes in favor of your country. 
Point the man in Scarborough who has done more than yourself 
to save your country. These matters would effectually clear a 
Person accused this way. Hope the Zeal of your countrymen 
does not overboil. Much Zeal maketh mad. Love to Friends. 

Your affectionate,

have remained in its unhappiness. Any plan being proposed that 
will effect the desired purpose and that I can prudently concur

DEAR SOUTHGATE : 

. . . I think there is but a distant probability of a speedy 
peace. What will turn up is uncertain. This is certain. Great 
Britain never saw so gloomy an hour and so dark a prospect since 
her existence as a Nation. In former wars with France &amp; Spain, 
Britain has fought and conquered them one after the other. They 
want the genius of Russel or Blake to command their Fleets ; 
their sea Commanders may be personally brave, but they are 
ambitious, jealous, &amp; not inspired with the sagacity and compre 
hension of their ancestors. Their Land commanders are De- 
bauchers and men ambitious of Fortunes &amp; pleasure more than 
Fame &amp; the Glory of their Nation. The immense Fortunes which 
the Land &amp; Sea Commanders have extorted from the wretched 
defenceless East Indians, have proved a Fountain of Corruption 
that has poisoned the whole British Nation. I think their glory 
is in the wane &amp; that her naval power is critically situated. If 
France &amp; Spain can maintain a superiority in the British Channel, 
the nation would perish. The people of England live by com 
merce this destroyed, the Nation is in distress. . . . Adieu.

"I wrote you not long since requesting you to adopt some 
method to convey Betsy [his sister, who had been at school in 
Boston afterwards at Newburyport] from this place to you, with 
the intention she should pass the winter with you. The time I 
proposed was the last of October. But this will be too early. 
Some friends of mine in Boston have the care of a small pox 
Hospital at Point Shirley in Boston ; the season is favorable to 
take the small pox, and from the frequency of that disease in 
Boston, especially this fall, I esteemed it a piece of prudence to 
embrace the opportunity of giving Betsy the small pox by inocu 
lation. She was inoculated last Monday, and yesterday was in a 
very good way. Pray communicate this information to Mrs. King. 
I myself next week shall go to Boston and expect to continue 
there some weeks, at the General Court. Shall choose to keep 
Betsy with me upon her return from the Hospital for some time 
in Boston. Add to this I should not judge it safe for her to visit 
you green from the Hospital. .

CHAPTER II. 

Difficulties in forming the Confederation due to the Claims of different 
States to western Territories Claims of Virginia Finally yielded New 
York sets the Example Followed in the End by all Others R. King 
appointed a Commissioner by Massachusetts to transfer her Lands to the 
United States Land Law of 1784 Mr. Jefferson s Proposal against Slavery 
northwest of the Ohio Land Law of 1785 Mr. King s Proposal to forbid 
its ever being permitted there Correspondence with Mr. Pickering relative 
to this Law Exclusion Provision not passed Law passed. 

After the Declaration of Independence, when the different 
States were called upon to make a Confederation for mutual 
support in establishing their rights and forming a general 
government, many of the States made claim to western terri 
tories, and, as in their acts of adhesion, the boundaries of 
these States were not specifically made a difficulty in as 
certaining their limits was met with, which for some time 
threatened to prevent the formation of the Confederation. 
Many efforts were made to adjust this question, but failed, 
and the settlement was postponed from time to time, until 
the State of Virginia, in 1779, opened an office for the sale 
of unappropriated lands claimed by her. This act brought 
the whole matter before Congress again, and by a vote from 
nearly all the States present, Virginia was asked to recon 
sider their late act for opening a land office, and it was 
recommended to " the said and all the other States similarly 
circumstanced, to forbear settling or issuing warrants for 
unappropriated lands, or granting the same during the con 
tinuance of the war." * Congress not only remonstrated, but 

* Journ. of Congress, i., 383. 
VOL. i. 3 33 



34 RUFUS KING. [1784- 

sent an officer, Col. Brodhead, with a competent force to 
prevent intrusions an act which in the next year was con 
firmed by resolving that the officer should be supported in 
any act or order which the nature of his service had made 
or might make necessary. * 

This assertion of title on the part of Virginia attracted the 
attention of some of the States, which insisted upon an ex 
press stipulation in the Articles of Confederation by which 
they might be effectually secured from these unreasonable 
claims. The settlement was again postponed, until Rhode 
Island, New Jersey, and Delaware, three of the protesting 
States, under the pressure of the war, were induced to accede 
to the Confederacy, while Maryland instructed her delegates 
not to sign the articles till the pretensions of Virginia 
were relinquished. 

Under these circumstances Virginia, without further action 
as to her claims, authorized her delegates to ratify the Arti 
cles of the Confederation, though some of the other States 
should refuse to do so, in which decision Connecticut joined 
her. Thus the Union was brought to the brink of destruc 
tion divided as it was into two parts by the determination 
of the most central States not to accede to the Articles of 
Confederation so long as Virginia adhered to her claim, 
and Virginia pertinaciously insisting upon what she regarded 
as her rights ; whilst the enemies of the country were ex 
ulting in the disorganization and distraction prevailing in 
the States and fondly expecting that the Confederacy was 
on the point of dissolution. 

In this emergency New York led the way to the removal 
of the difficulties, by passing an act authorizing her dele 
gates to limit and restrict the boundaries of the western 
part of the State in such manner as they should think 
proper ; " to manifest their regard for their sister States, pro 
mote the general interest and security, and more especially 
to accelerate the federal alliance, removing as far as it 

* Journ, of Congress, vi., 124. 



1785] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 35 

depends upon them the sole impediment to its final 
accomplishment." 

Virginia still asserting her claims, in a remonstrance to 
Congress against the instructions of Maryland to her dele 
gates, a committee was appointed to consider the whole 
matter. Their report, on September 6, 1780, while stating 
the opinion that a discussion of the question would fail to 
bring about conciliation, recommended that Congress should 
" press upon those States which can remove the embarrass 
ments respecting the western lands, a liberal surrender of 
their territorial claims, since they cannot be preserved en 
tire without endangering the stability of the general confed 
eracy." The report urges every possible consideration to 
bring about this result, " the indispensable necessity of the 
federal union, for public credit and confidence, for the sup 
port of the army," and the vigor of public measures, for 
" tranquillity at home," "reputation abroad," and " our very 
existence as a free, sovereign and independent people." It 
cites also the action of the New York Legislature, noted 
above, and offers a resolution directing a copy of the report 
to be sent to all the States, urging those " which have claims 
to western territory to give to their delegates in Congress 
such powers as may effectually remove the only obstacle to 
a final ratification of the articles of Confederation ; and 
that the Legislature of Maryland be earnestly requested to 
authorize their delegates in Congress to subscribe the said 
articles." * 

This and a similar recommendation passed on October 
10, 1780, and the example of New York produced the 
desired effect. In the same month Connecticut passed 
an act of cession, and on January 2, 1781, Virginia fol 
lowed her example. Though neither of these acts was 
entirely satisfactory, they were at least indications of a 
conciliatory spirit, and Maryland, on February 2d, au 
thorized her delegates to the Confederation to sign the 

* Journ. of Congress, vi., 279. 



36 RUFUS KING. [1784- 

articles ; but declared, at the same time, that by this con 
cession the State did not relinquish any right which she had 
with the other States to the back country, and relied upon 
the several States to do justice in this matter. 

On March I, 1781, her delegates ratified the Articles 
of Confederation, and those from New York executed a 
deed of cession to the United States of all her claims to 
territory west of a meridian line twenty miles west of the 
river Niagara and north of 45 of latitude. 

The Articles of the Confederation were thus completed ; 
but the terms of cession, on the part of Virginia especially, 
were far from satisfactory, and that State refused to produce 
the grounds on which her claims were based. Under these 
circumstances, an able committee of Congress, as appears 
in the Journal of May I, 1782, after careful examination and 
earnest endeavor to remove this difficulty, reported resolu 
tions recommending 

u to Massachusetts and Connecticut that rhey do without delay 
release to the United States in Congress assembled all claims and 
pretensions of claims to the said western territory without any 
conditions or restriction whatever. 

" Resolved, That Congress cannot, consistent with the interests 
of the U. States, the duty they owe to their constituents, and 
the rights necessarily vested in them as the sovereign power of the 
U. S., accept of the cession proposed to be made by the State of 
Virginia, or guarantee the tract of Country claimed by them in 
the act of cession referred to your Committee." * 

No final action was taken on these resolutions, and no 
advance was made towards an adjustment until, on Septem 
ber 13, 1783, the report of a committee of Congress was 
adopted, which dissenting from the claim of Virginia that 
the United States should guarantee to Virginia all the terri 
tory southeast of the Ohio, included between the boundaries 
of Pennsylvania, Maryland, North Carolina, and the Atlantic, 
on the ground that such guarantee was either unnecessary 

* Journal of Congress, vii., 363. 



1785] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 37 

or unreasonable : unnecessary, for if the territory be really 
the property of Virginia, it is secured by the Confederation ; 
and if not the property of that State, there is no considera 
tion or reason for the guarantee recommended that if 
Virginia would make a cession in conformity with the 
report, Congress should accept it. Virginia acceded to the 
suggestion, and on March i, 1784, ceded to the United 
States its claim to the Northwest Territory upon the line 
and upon the terms prescribed in the above report. On 
April 24th the other States, which had not ceded their 
claims, were again urged to do so. 

The Legislature of Massachusetts, in conformity with this 
recommendation, in November, 1784, authorized its dele 
gates to cede to the United States, without condition, the 
title of that State to all territory west of the western boun 
dary of New York. On the 3d of November, the State 
appointed Rufus King, who had just been chosen a delegate 
to Congress from that State, an agent, together with Mr. 
Holton, his associate, to make and execute a proper deed of 
cession of the aforesaid lands. This was done by those gen 
tlemen, and accepted by the unanimous vote of Congress on 
April 15, 1785. 

Among the acts of the Congress, on October 10, 1780, 
it was specified that the lands ceded to the United States 
by any of the States should be disposed of for the common 
interest of the United States, and should be settled and 
formed into distinct republican States, which shall become 
members of the Federal Union and have the same rights of 
sovereignty, freedom, and independence as the other States ; 
that each shall have a suitable extent of territory, not less 
than one hundred nor more than one hundred and fifty 
square miles ; and that any necessary and reasonable 
expenses which any particular State shall have incurred 
since the commencement of the present war in subduing 
British posts, in maintaining posts or garrisons within, or 
for defending or acquiring any part of, the territory ceded 
to the United States, shall be reimbursed, and that these 



38 RUFUS KING. [1784- 

lands shall be granted or settled on such terms and under 
such regulations as shall hereafter be agreed on by the 
United States in Congress assembled, or any nine or more 
of them. 

From this recital it will appear natural that the attention 
of Mr. King should be specially turned to the great import 
ance of the question of the proper disposal of the public 
lands. He saw how great and dangerous an obstacle that 
question had proved to the establishment of the Confedera 
tion ; he saw how earnest and repeated were the invoca 
tions of Congress to the States having claims to the western 
lands, to cede them for the common benefit of the United 
States ; he saw how great and beneficial a step had been taken 
by New York, in being first to make such cession ; and honored 
as he was, almost contemporaneously with his election to 
Congress, by the appointment as agent for the State of 
Massachusetts to make in her name the formal cession of all 
her claims west of New York, he could not but apply his 
faculties to the study and comprehension, in all its bearings, 
of this wide question. The sequel will show that he never 
lost sight of it, nor of any opportunity, within his reach, of 
giving such a solution of it as would most conduce to the 
general welfare. 

As has been said, Mr. King took his seat in Congress on 
December 6, 1784, and on the 24th of the same month he 
joined with his colleague from Massachusetts and with the 
delegate from New York in nominating certain commission 
ers to constitute a federal court, in order to settle the con 
flicting claims of the two States to jurisdiction on what was 
known as the New Hampshire grants, now the State of 
Vermont. 

On March 4, 1784, an ordinance for locating and regula 
ting the sale of the public lands was reported and read a 
first time. On April 23, 1784, certain resolves of Congress 
on this subject were adopted, which were reported by a 
committee of which Mr. Jefferson was chairman, having for 
colleagues Mr. Chase of Maryland and Mr. Howell of 



1785] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 39 

Rhode Island, and contained, when reported, this clause 
aimed prospectively against slavery : " that after the year 
1800 of the Christian era there shall be neither slavery nor 
involuntary servitude in any of the said States (to be carved 
out of the western territory) otherwise than in punishment 
of crimes, whereof the party shall have been convicted to 
have been personally guilty." 

During the debate on these resolves it was moved by Mr. 
Read of South Carolina, and seconded by Mr. Spaight of 
North Carolina, to strike out this proviso ; and the question 
being put in the form then usual, " Shall the words moved 
to be struck out stand ? " there appeared but six ayes, and 
as the Articles of Confederation required seven, or a major 
ity of the whole, they did not stand, and were consequently 
struck out. Every vote north of Maryland was in favor of 
retaining the proviso, and Mr. Jefferson himself and Mr. Wil 
liamson of North Carolina also voted in the affirmative, but 
in vain.* These resolves merely provided for the division of 
the territory into States to become States of the Union 
upon certain conditions, of being subject to the Articles 
of Confederation, having a republican form of government, 
renouncing all right to tax or interfere with the disposition 
of the public lands within their borders, etc., etc., but made 
no reservation of land for education or any other purpose. 

When then on March 16, 1785, the consideration of a 
proper disposition of the public lands was resumed, Mr. 
King, seconded by Mr. Ellery of Rhode Island, moved 
the proposition : " that there shall be neither slavery nor 
involuntary servitude in any of the States described in the 
resolve of Congress of the 23d of April 1784, otherwise 
than in punishment of crimes, whereof the party shall have 
been personally guilty, and that this regulation shall be an 
article of compact and remain a fundamental principle of the

and Pennsylvania voted Aye ; New Jersey had but one representative present, 
and so lost her vote, though he was in the affirmative. Maryland, Virginia, 
and South Carolina voted No ; North Carolina divided, and Georgia absent. 



40 RUFUS KING. [1784- 

Constitutions between the thirteen original States and each 
of the States described in the said resolve of 23d April 

1784.-* 

On the question of committing this ordinance, the yeas 
and nays being required by Mr. King, it was carried in the 
affirmative vote of every State north of Virginia (except 
Delaware, which was not present) ; the vote of Virginia, the 
two Carolinas and Georgia were against it. f The committee 
appointed w r ere Mr. King, Mr. Howell, and Mr. Ellery, and 
on April 6th Mr. King reported back, in his own hand 
writing, his resolution materially changed from its original 
draft : " allowing slavery in the Northwest until the first day 
of the year 1801, but no longer," and it " provided that always, 
upon the escape of any person into any of the States de 
scribed in the resolve of Congress of the twenty-third day 
of April, 1784, from whom labor or service is lawfully claimed 
in any one of the thirteen original States, such fugitives 
might be lawfully reclaimed and carried back to the person 
claiming his labor or service, this resolve notwithstanding. " J 

The journals of Congress and contemporary history are 
entirely silent as to the final disposition of this report. It 
does not appear to have been called up again or acted upon, 
and an ordinance was passed for the disposal of the public 
lands without reference to slavery on May 20, 1785. In 
the discussion attending the passage of this ordinance, 
Rufus King took a constant and leading part, and if his 
anti-slavery proviso could have been brought up, it may be 
assumed confidently that it would have been. Owing pos 
sibly to the fact that the ordinance under consideration was

merely and exclusively a regulation for the proper survey 
ing of the lands and not for their political government, the 
introduction of such a proviso may have been deemed irrele 
vant ; and this may seem the more probable as it was subse 
quently brought forward and adopted, in a modified form, 
in the famous ordinance of 1787, which was wholly devoted 
to the political organization and government of the territo 
ries, and had no reference to land sales.* 

* The suggestion above made (it is from the notes of President King) of the 
reason which induced Mr. King to allow the proviso, reported back amended, 
to remain upon the table, may have been one which prevented its consideration ; 
but, in the absence of any proof that it was the only reason, may not another 
be assigned. Earnestly as he had been urged by Mr. Pickering in his letters of 
the 8th March, 1785, to do something to prevent the extension of slavery into 
the Northwest Territory, and in view of the remark in his second letter, " But 
why do I expostulate with you who already see all the reasons on this subject 
in points of view more striking than I can make them," suggesting that the 
subject was not new to him, it cannot be supposed that he willingly suffered the 
question to rest. Mr. King s proviso contemplated the absolute and immediate 
exclusion of slavery from the Northwestern Territory without any restriction. 
When this was discussed in the committee, and possibly outside, with a view to 
ascertain the prospect of the passage of such a clean proposition, it was proba 
bly found that it could not be carried, and Mr. King was obliged to accept the 
modifications, which entirely changed its character, and to report it back as the 
voice of the committee. 

Having made his report, feeling that he had failed in his purpose, and that, 
if the measure were passed in that form, he would see engrafted upon the ordi 
nance the essence of slavery in allowing it a temporary foothold in that free 
country, and in the enactment of the fugitive-slave clause taking the right from 
those who might escape into this territory, of trial, to ascertain their obligations, 
a right belonging to every human being, and consign them summarily back 
to slavery, he hesitated in urging such a proposition. As Mr. Merriam says in 
his pamphlet, History of the Ordinance of 1787, p. 13 : "It will be noticed 
that the subject of private securities for persons and property, with which 
the final ordinance deals so fully, was wholly overlooked in the ordinance of 
1784." 

The Southern States, quick to see whatever might in the future affect slavery, 
probably thought that any restriction as to the character of the population which 
should inhabit those lands would prevent them from settling there with their 
slaves ; and therefore intimated outside of the Congress that the naked proviso 
could not be adopted, and for that reason the measure was tabled. Indeed, it was 
upon this very issue that the admission of Missouri with slavery was demanded 
the right to extend the institution into the common domain, with its ftigitive- 



42 RUFUS KING. [1784- 

But although not able as yet to engraft the principle of 
personal freedom on this western territory, or rather the 
absolute, immediate, and perpetual exclusion therefrom of 
slavery, Mr. King exerted himself diligently and successfully 
so to regulate the partitioning and surveying of this great 
dominion, and the reservation of liberal portions for uses 
and purposes which could not fail to promote its aggregate 
value as property, and, more important still, to simplify and 

slave law and that the war of the Rebellion was afterwards waged, resulting 
as it did in the abolition of slavery itself. 

May it not be then that the conduct of Mr. King was controlled by such 
reflections and by what he then saw of the temper of the slave States, especially 
as no other motive of sufficient weight has been suggested.* For we find in the 
debates in the convention of North Carolina which finally adopted the Consti 
tution of the United States, a speech of Mr. Iredell, f in which he says in refer 
ence to the 3d section of the 4th article, which relates to " persons held to 
service or labor in one State under the laws thereof escaping to another : " 

" In some of the Northern States they have emancipated all their slaves. If 
any of our slaves," said he, " go there and remain there a certain time, they 
would by the present laws be entitled to their freedom, so that their masters 
could not get them again. This would be extremely prejudicial to the inhabi 
tants of the Southern States ; and to prevent it this clause is inserted in the 
Constitution. Though the word slave is not mentioned, this is the meaning of 
it. The Northern delegates, owing to their particular scruples on the subject 
of slavery, did not choose the word slave to be mentioned." 

General Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, \ in the debates on the South Carolina 
Convention on the adoption of the Constitution, while stating strongly his opin 
ions, " that while there was an acre of swamp land in South Carolina, they could 
not do without slaves," and that at the same time every effort had been made to 
procure the passage of the clause, " the migration or importation of such per 
sons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be 
prohibited by the Congress prior to the year 1808," etc. 

" By this settlement we have secured an unlimited importation of negroes for 

* James C. Welling, LL.D., in his paper " On the Land Politics of the United 
States," read before the New York Historical Society, May i, 1888, in a note, 
page 25, suggests this same solution of the action of Rufus King in not calling 
up the resolution about slavery reported by the committee on 6th April. 

" Though the resolution is preserved in the handwriting of Rufus King, his 
well known views on the subject of slavery make it probable that he was over 
borne in the committee by his two colleagues, and that for this reason he was 
little inclined to press for the adoption of the regulation in its altered shape."

secure the title of its future inhabitants, and to encourage 
and provide means for their moral and religious training. 
He carefully watched the bill throughout its whole progress, 
and, as appears by the letters we are able to give, entered 
into an extended correspondence with Colonel Pickering, 
still attached to the army, and whose habits, experience, and 
education qualified him, as will be seen by his letters, to 
give wise counsel in the premises.* 

Mr. Pickering had before him the ordinance reported on 
the 23d April, 1784, for regulating the survey and sales of 
the western territory, which ordinance differs essentially 
from that subsequently adopted on 2Oth May, 1/85, and in 
nothing more than in the divisions it proposed of these 
lands. Under date of 8th of March, 1785, Col. Pickering 
thus writes to Rufus King, in Congress in New York : 

&lt;k I write what occurs to me on examining the proposed ordinance 
and a general consideration of the subject. The first paragraph 
orders the manner of dividing each new State : but it seems to me 
it will be found impracticable. Each hundred is to be ten miles 
square, and each mile to consist of 6086 feet ; yet the lines making 
the eastern and western boundaries are to be true meridian lines : 
but meridian lines converge as you increase latitude ; and to such a 
degree that if you take any meridian, say at the 39th degree of lati- 

twenty years. Nor is it declared that the importation shall then be stopped ; it 
may be continued. We have a security that the general government can never 
emancipate them, for no such authority is granted ; and it is admitted on all 
hands that the general government has no powers but what are expressly 
granted by the Constitution, and that all the rights not expressed were reserved 
by the several States. We have obtained a right to recover our slaves in what 
ever part of America they may take refuge, which is a right we had not before. 
In short, considering all circumstances, we have made the best terms for the 
security of this species of property it was in our power to make. We would 
have done better if we could ; but, on the whole, I do not think them bad." 

* These letters were written in consequence of a suggestion from Mr. E. 
Gerry, who had sent to him " the draught of an ordinance for ascertaining the 
mode of locating and disposing of lands in the Western Territory," and asked 
him " to communicate to you (R. King) such thoughts on the subject as maybe 
judged to have a beneficial tendency." 



44 RUFUS KING. [1784- 

tude, and on that parallel set off ten geographical miles ( = 60860 
feet) from such meridian, and then proceed northward to the 
45th degree of latitude, and then from the same meridian set off 
the like number of ten geographical miles, their extremity will be 
about 1800 feet beyond the meridian of the like extremity at the 
parallel of 39. I am aware that mathematical accuracy in actual 
surveys may not be expected ; but a difference of 600 yards in 
ten miles must surely produce material errors." 

The letter suggests several verbal alterations in the ordi 
nance, as well as some additional guards for the interest of 
the public as well as for future settlers : 

" In that Western Country are various articles essential to the 
future inhabitants ; but the most important is Salt. The person, 
already acquainted with it, will certainly seize on all the licks and 
salt springs, and make monopolies of them. Some at a great 
distance, or who may be less attentive to their interests, and re 
gardless of the common good, may neither manufacture salt them 
selves, nor suffer others to do it. This will be the very dog in 
the manger. Others will extract from the settlers what sums they 
please for an article so indispensable. To prevent this intolerable 
evil, will it not be expedient for Congress expressly to reserve 
every salt spring and lick with a certain number of lots around 
it, well wooded and sufficient to supply the salt works which shall 
be erected with fuel for any length of time, which shall be thought 
necessary ? These works to be erected under some prudent regu 
lations which shall most conduce to the common benefit of the 
inhabitants. Perhaps coal and lead mines may deserve a like con 
sideration." 

" Water communications in that country will always be in the 
highest degree interesting to the inhabitants. It seems very neces 
sary to secure the freedom of navigating these to all the inhabi 
tants of all the States. I hope we shall have no Scheldts in that 
country. . . . 

" There is one article in the report of the committee on which 
that act (of 23d April 84), was made, which I was extremely sorry 
to see was rejected. The committee proposed that after the year 



1785] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 4$ 

1800, there should be no slavery in the new states. I hardly 
have patience to write on a subject, in which what is right is so 
obvious and just, and what is wrong is so derogatory to Americans 
above all men ; so inhuman, so iniquitous in itself." 

In another long letter of the same date, so great was the 
interest taken by this pure and patriotic man in the right 
disposition of a question which concerned so largely the 
welfare of future millions, Mr. Pickering, after pointing out 
additional errors of detail, as he viewed them, thus pro 
ceeds : 

" In looking over the Act of Congress of the 23d of April 1784 
(Mr. Jefferson s act) and the present report of an ordinance 
relative to these lands, I observe no provision is made for 
ministers of the Gospel, nor even for schools and academies. The 
latter might have been brought into view ; tho after the admis 
sion of Slavery, it was right to say nothing of Christianity. Yet 
so glaring an inconsistency could not have occasioned much sur 
prise. It is easy to be inconsistent. Congress made this import 
ant declaration that all men are created equal ; that they are 
endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, and that 
among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and 
these truths were held to be self evident. These great truths are 
echoed through the U. S., nevertheless a proposition for prevent 
ing a violation of these truths in a country yet unsettled and from 
which such violence might easily have been excluded, did not 
obtain ! What pretence (argument there could be none) could be 
offered for its rejection ? I should indeed have objected to 
the period proposed (the year 1800) for the exclusion of slavery, 
for the admission of it for a day or an hour ought to have been 
forbidden. It will be infinitely easier to prevent the Evil at first, 
than to eradicate or check it at any future time. How would Con 
gress wish the new states to be settled, by slaves or by freemen ? 
Take any given period, say 50 years Will those States in that 
time have more acres of improved land by the admission than by 
the exclusion of slaves ? In respect to population and improve 
ment, compare Pennsylvania with Maryland and Virginia, par- 



46 RUFUS KING. [1784- 

ticularly the latter. But why do I expostulate with you who already 
see all the reasons on this subject in points of view more striking 
than I can place them ? Forgive me if my solicitude to prevent 
the greatest of evils has rendered me prolix. To suffer the con 
tinuance of slaves until they can gradually be emancipated in 
States already overrun with them may be pardonable, because un 
avoidable without hazarding greater evils ; but to introduce them 
into countries where none now exist, countries which have been 
talked of which we have boasted of as an asylum to the op 
pressed of the Earth can never be forgfven. For God s sake, 
then, let one more effort be made to prevent so terrible a calamity. 
The fundamental constitutions of the States are yet liable to 
alterations, and this is probably the only time when the evil 
can certainly be prevented." 

It may not be doubted that the earnest wisdom of these 
letters was appreciated by him to whom they were addressed ; 
for within a week of their date, viz. the i6th March, 1/85, 
as has already been stated, R. King introduced his propo 
sition for the immediate and total and absolute exclusion of 
slavery from the Northwestern Territory. On the I5th of 
April Mr. King thus acknowledges the letters of Mr. 
Pickering : 

"Dr. SIR: 

" The best return in my power to make to you for your ingenious 
communications on the mode of disposing of the Western Territory, 
is to enclose for your examination the form of ordinance reported 
to Congress on the subject (that of the i4th of April). You will 
see thereby that your views have had weight with the Committee 
who reported the ordinance, and I have only to add that I shall 
hold myself particularly obliged by you for these communications 
on the subject. I likewise enclose you the report of the Com 
mittee on a motion for the exclusion of slavery from the new 
States. Your ideas on this unjustifiable practice are so just that 
it would be impossible to differ from them." 

In acknowledging the receipt of this letter, under date of 
Philadelphia, 3Oth of April, Mr. Pickering, referring to the 



1785] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 47 

copy of the ordinance, speaks again of his remarks on the 
apparent impracticability of the direction for making the 
surveys in exact squares : " but perhaps such accuracy was 
not intended by the words the surveyors shall divide the 
said territory into townships of miles square/ and it is 
only expected that the townships should be as nearly square, 
as the taking of meridians for east and west lines would 
admit." He refers to other suggestions in his former letters, 
and concludes : " Upon the whole, Sir, you will naturally sup 
pose the report will meet with my approbation if for no 
other reason, because the principles of it coincide with the 
ideas I had previously conceived and communicated to 
you." 

The ordinance was finally passed on the 2Oth of May, 
1785, with some other modifications. As originally pre 
sented, the section of land immediately adjoining and to the 
northward of " that reserved for school purposes in each 
township was to be for the support of religion ; the profits 
arising from each to be applied forever according to the will 
of a majority of male residents of full age within the same." 

A long struggle took place on the one part to preserve, 
and on the other to strike out the provision for religion ; 
R. King contending for its preservation, but unsuccessfully. 
On the motion to strike out made by Mr. Ellery, of Rhode 
Island, and Melancton Smith, of New York, New Hamp 
shire, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Virginia 
voted aye to retain it. New York and North Carolina were 
divided, and Connecticut, South Carolina, and Georgia, hav 
ing each only one member present, each voting aye, but 
ineffectually. Rhode Island and Maryland were the only 
States that voted no. The requisite number to carry the 
measure, seven States, not being obtained, the provision was 
lost. Mr. Johnson of Connecticut, seconded by Mr. King, 
then sought to set aside the section " for charitable uses " ; 
but for this only four States, New Hampshire, Massachu 
setts, Delaware, and Virginia, voted, and the section passed 
shorn of its provision for either religious or charitable pur- 



48 RUFUS KING. [1784-1785 

poses. Possibly harm might have resulted from thus endow 
ing religion, for it would have been difficult to settle the 
mode of application of the fund ; for the exceeding sensi 
tiveness which characterizes all sectarian discussions would 
possibly have prevented such a provision as was originally 
reported into a bane rather than a help to true religion. 

With reservations as to lead mines and salt springs, the 
ordinance was framed and passed, and laid the foundation 
of the admirable system which has ever since prevailed over 
the enormous territorial limits to which our Union has been 
extended, and which introduced and has maintained 
method, order, and certainty as to title and boundaries, so 
as to render litigation impossible. 



CHAPTER III. 

Rufus King spoken of as Ambassador to The Hague Massachusetts Resolution 
relative to the Appointment of Members of Congress to Offices in the Gift 
of Congress Letters between Rufus King and Timothy Pickering Want 
of Power in the Confederation to regulate Trade or raise Revenues. 



Various changes in the diplomatic representation in 
Europe took place during this session of Congress. Benja 
min Franklin, who had long been the Resident Minister in 
France, asked urgently for permission to return home, which 
was accorded to him on the 7th of March, 1785 ; and on the 
roth, on motion of Mr. Howell, of Rhode Island, Thomas 
Jefferson was unanimously chosen to succeed him. On the 
24th of February, John Adams, the Minister at the Hague, 
was transferred as Minister to London, and on Monday, /th 
of March following, Mr. King, seconded by Mr. Pinckney, of 
South Carolina, moved that a successor to Mr. Adams at the 
Netherlands should be chosen. An appointment was not 
then made, but on the 23d of June Mr. Wm. Livingston was 
chosen, and he having declined, Mr. John Rutledge on the 
5th of July was selected, but declined on the 4th of August. 
There was no subsequent election, though in May, 1786, a 
motion was made to proceed to one, and the decision post 
poned. This is mentioned here in order to connect it with 
a rumor, which I have not been able to verify or disprove, 
that Mr. King was talked of for the post in the course of the 
winter of 1785-6. His early and constant friend, Christopher 
Gore, of Boston, thus writes to him on the 5th of February, 
1786: 

49 



50 RUFUS KING. 



" We have a report here, my good friend, that you are going as 
Ambassador to the Hague. Jf promotive of your honor and 
felicity, I sincerely wish it may be true : that it would be greatly 
beneficial to our country, we are all convinced. Therefore, as 
citizens of America, we are anxious to have it confirmed." 

Upon what particular suggestion, or to meet what particu 
lar case, I know not, but on February i8th it was resolved, Mr. 
King voting in the affirmative, that the commission of every 
foreign minister or charge" should be deemed to terminate at 
the expiration of three years from its date. This provision 
was contested on the ground that Congress always had 
reserved its power of recalling at any moment any foreign 
minister or agent, and therefore that there could be no 
necessity for such a limitation of choice when all held during 
pleasure. The motion nevertheless prevailed ; all the eastern 
and middle States voting for it. 

The attendance of the delegates was at this time, and in 
deed at all times, exceedingly irregular, and frequently States 
were for weeks and months together unrepresented. It is 
to be noted, and a characteristic early exhibited and never de 
parted from in Mr. King s public career, that he was always 
at his post, and very often the only delegate from his State. 

Although Mr. King did not succeed in engrafting upon 
the general land ordinance the provision for aid to religious 
purposes, he seems to have been more successful in a bill for 
the sale of a large tract of land in Ohio in July, 1787 ; for in 
the report which was adopted 23d July, made by a com 
mittee consisting of Mr. Carrington, Mr. King, Mr. Dana, 
Mr. Madison, and Mr. Benson, specifying the extent, boun 
daries, and terms of sale of the tract of land sold to what 
was known as the Ohio Company, the lot No. 16 is expressly 
reserved for school purposes, and " lot No. 29 in each town 
ship, or fractional part of a township, is to be given perpetu 
ally for the purposes of religion." A like reservation was 
made in a patent subsequently granted for another large 
tract in Ohio to John Cleves Symmes. Yet another and 



1785] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 51 

more liberal provision for educational purposes was made in 
the grant to the Ohio Company, " of not more than two 
complete townships to be given perpetually for the purposes 
of a university to be laid off by the purchaser or purchasers, 
as near the centre as may be, so that the same shall be of 
good land, to be applied to the intended object by the Legis 
lature of the State." These reservations were gifts of the 
United States and were paid for by the purchasers. 

The State of Massachusetts, always thoroughly Republi 
can and therefore distrustful of delegating power, in May, 
1785, instructed her delegates to endeavor to procure from 
Congress a resolution that no member of the body should, 
during the term for which he was elected, be appointed to 
any office in the gift of Congress. " The world," say these 
instructions, " cannot but admire the prudence and wisdom, 
which by providing for a rotation of members of Congress, 
fixed one important barrier against corruption ; but the 
Legislature of this Commonwealth observes with concern 
and regret that no provision is made to prevent the members 
of Congress from appointing themselves to offices ; and it 
requires no very great share of sagacity to foresee that unless 
this point is more effectually guarded, the offices of the 
federal government may hereafter be filled with men who 
will not be the most capable of serving the people, or most 
remarkable for their integrity ; and that some persons, for 
saking the true interests of their country, will take corrupt 
measures to become members of Congress, with a view to 
possess themselves of lucrative employments, whereby offices 
in themselves unnecessary may be created and multiplied, 
and the injured fabric of our federal government overthrown 
by the same means that have been employed in prostrating 
those extinct republics, which are seen no more but in the 
pages of history. The Legislature of the Commonwealth 
therefore instruct you," etc., etc.* 

* How signally the suggestions of this resolution were founded in truth, the 
history of the country, and especially in latter years, shows the far-seeing 
sagacity of the founders of the Republic in their endeavor even in a special 
case to avert an evil so great and so dangerous to free institutions. ED. 



52 RUFUS KING. [1785 



In conformity with the instruction, the delegates in attend 
ance, Dr. Holten and Mr. King, moved that it be " Resolved, 
that the election and acceptance of any person as a member 
of Congress, shall forever hereafter be deemed to incapacitate 
and disqualify such person from being elected by the United 
States in Congress assembled, to any office of trust or profit 
under the said States, during the term for which he shall 
have been so elected a member of Congress." The yeas and 
nays being required by Mr. King, the proposition was 
unanimously committed, and was heard of no more. 

This restriction under the Articles of Confederation when 
the whole executive power, as well as the legislative was in 
the hands of Congress, seems not unreasonable. But though 
it has often since been suggested as advisable in our present 
Constitution, which separates completely the executive and 
legislative branches, it is not probable that any Congress 
will consent thus to disqualify its members, or to advance 
farther on the way of security against the corruption of their 
own body, than in the existing provision of the Constitution, 
which forbids the appointment of a member of Congress to 
a civil office created, or of which the emoluments shall have 
been increased, during the time for which he was elected, 
and disqualifies all persons holding office under the United 
States from being a member of either House. 

It is not out of keeping with this subject to introduce an 
example of how little need there would seem to have been 
at that day for guarding the integrity of official persons or 
of those who might become such, by laying before the reader 
the following correspondence : 

R. KING TO T. PICKERING. 

11 N. Y., May 8th, 1785. 
u DEAR SIR : 

"When Congress accepted the cession of western territory 
from Virginia, they engaged to reimburse Virga. the amount of 
her expences in protecting the lands ceded, during the late war. 



1785] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 53 

A Commissioner is to be appointed by Congress, another by Va., 
and a third by the two first, who, or a major part of whom, are 
to ascertain the sums to be reimbursed as aforesaid. If your 
engagements are such as would permit your acceptance of the 
appointment under Congress, it would give great satisfaction to 
a number of your friends and remove an apprehension, that at 
present obtains, that the U. S. are in danger of being charged 
with a very enormous sum to defray the expence of Genl. Clark s 
Expedition against the Kaskaskias. It may require three months 
or more to execute the business ; the salary is at the rate of $1500, 
the year, and authority to employ as many clerks as may be 
necessary at $500, the year. The pecuniary consideration I am 
sensible cannot be an inducement, but the opportunity of essen 
tially serving the U. S. will be a powerful motive." 



T. PICKERING TO R. KING. 

"PHIL., i2th May, 1785. 

"I have been honored with your letter of the 8th. My engage 
ments are incompatible with the service, in which you suppose a 
number of my friends might wish me to be employed. It is 
obviously of material consequence to the U. S., and I am per 
suaded the apprehension you entertain is but too well founded." 

Mr. Pickering was then busily occupied in closing up and 
settling his accounts as Quarter-master-General ; which office 
was shortly afterwards abolished (with the consent, if not 
upon the suggestion of Mr. Pickering) and its duties trans 
ferred to the Secretary of War. Concerning this office Mr. 
Pickering wrote to Rufus King on June 1st : 

" In respect to the Q. Master s department I reply, that as 
soon as other provision shall be made for performing the few 
occasional duties required of it, it may be abolished. More than 
a year ago, I proposed to some gentlemen that these duties 
should be given in charge to the Secy, of War." 



54 RUFUS KING. [1785 



Subsequently Col. Pickering thus stated his wish to be a 
candidate for the office of Treasurer : 

PHIL., gth June, 1785. 
DR. SIR : 

I have heard that the Treasurer s office is likely to become 
vacant. If such vacancy should happen, I shall then be willing 
to stand a candidate to supply it, if there is a prospect of obtain 
ing an election. But for this, I do not mean to become a solicitor. 
If there be several candidates, let him who is equal to the duties 
of the office and at the same time most deserving of the confi 
dence of the country be elected. 

The office of Treasurer would coincide with my views as much 
as the temporary office you lately mentioned would divert me 
from them. The salary I know is small compared with the pay 
of persons in the first offices of the government ; but on the other 
hand a stricter economy will be admissible without the hazard of 
reproach for frugality. Though personally we are scarcely 
known to each other, yet I hope you will think the correspond 
ence with which you have honored me, sufficient to authorize 
me to make this communication. I am respectfully, dear Sir, 
your Most Humb. Servt. T. P. 

Mr. King s reply is not less characteristic or delicate ; it is 
of the I /th of June. After stating that the Treasurer would 
be obliged to remove from Philadelphia to New York, or 
resign, he goes on to say : 

" Should the latter event happen, I do assure you that my duty 
could not be more faithfully discharged in the appointment of a 
successor than by aiding your election. An opinion which, pre 
vious to the receipt of yours by Doct. Craigie, I had given touch 
ing the conduct of Mr. Hillegas, had drawn upon me the 
imputation of wishing him a successor, and at this time prevents 
my sounding the opinion of gentlemen on your subject. Should 
Mr. Hillegas resign, or be dismissed, I shall be at liberty to 
pursue my wishes and your interest." 

Mr. King s course in Congress seems to have been very 
acceptable to his constituents, as testified by his re-election, 



1785] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 55 

of which we find this notice in a letter from Elbridge Gerry, 
dated Boston, i6th June, 1785 : 

"MY DEAR KING : 

" The Legislature this day proceeded to the choice of delegates. 
Four only out of five were elected on the first ballot, you had the 
highest number of votes, Gorham next, Sedgwick and Dane 
lowest. Mr. Hancock was the highest on the list of non-elect, 
and by a second ballot was appointed." 

The same letter adds: 

" I received your land ordinance. I think it complete, except 
the price which is looper cent, too much in my opinion." 

Yet the price was only one dollar per acre. 

The great defect of the Confederation, the want of power 
to regulate trade, or raise a revenue (independently of State 
action or inaction), pressed heavily upon this Congress. 
The mode of levying upon each State its proportion of the 
common charge, and issuing therefor a requisition on the 
State was, now that the pressure of war had ceased, in 
operative. The requisitions were either not complied with 
at all, or complied with tardily and partially. An effort was 
made by a committee, of which Mr. King was a member, to 
procure the passage of a law vesting in Congress (July 13, 
1785) the power of regulating trade. But it failed and on 
the iSth, the General Committee (Mr. King being the member 
from Massachusetts) made a report on the supplies needed 
for the year 1785, and apportioning the amount among the 
States. At this day it may almost excite a smile to state 
that the whole expense of the federal government, including 
Congress, Indians, diplomatic service, army, and the marine, 
was only four hundred thousand five hundred and fifty-five 
dollars. The sum to be levied for the year, however, was 
three millions, two and a half millions being for interest on 
the foreign and domestic debt entailed upon the country by 
the war. 



56 RUFUS KING. [1785 



Small as was the amount apportioned to each State, it 
was not forthcoming on the requisition ; for at the very 
time that these new estimates and demands were voted, 
more than half the requisition of the previous year for eight 
millions was unpaid, and this new requisition was in fact 
only a call for three fourths of what was already due. This 
evil continued and increased ; happily, we may now say, to 
such a degree as to produce that universal conviction of 
the inefficacy of the Articles of Confederation which led to 
the adoption of the present Constitution. 

Mr. King s active participation in the leading business of 
Congress is evinced by the fact that his name recurs either 
as member of the various committees, to which were referred 
from day to day the topics of interest, or as discussing them 
when presented for the action of the House. On his motion 
the Board of Treasury was instructed (iQth August) to pre 
pare an ordinance fixing the standard of weights and meas 
ures throughout the United States, a measure not effectually 
accomplished till nearly forty years afterwards. He was also, 
with Mr. Pinckney of South Carolina, earnest in pressing a 
call upon the State Legislatures to respect and protect the 
immunities of foreign ministers. Whether the matter in 
hand were domestic or foreign, his vigilance seems to have 
been ever on the alert, and his punctuality of attendance 
exemplary, when so much negligence in that respect was 
common. 



CHAPTER IV. 

Unsettled Condition of Foreign Trade Massachusetts Resolutions about 
it Letters to the Deputies in Congress Their Answers to Gov. 
Bowdoin Rufus King s Statement why they took no Action on the 
Resolutions Letter of Nathan Dane about the Resolutions. 

The conclusion of the Treaty of Peace with England, 
acknowledging our independence as a nation, left unsettled 
the terms of our foreign trade with the Powers of Europe, a 
condition of things which was sure, sooner or later, to cause 
embarrassment and trouble in the different parts of the Con 
federation, as each State claimed for itself the right to 
regulate this important business in accordance with what it 
deemed its own peculiar interests. There was no controlling 
power in the Articles of Confederation to authorize the Con 
gress to compel obedience to any laws they might pass ; 
and the only remedy appeared to be in some way to give 
Congress larger powers, which could only be done by general 
consent. Early in April, 1785, the merchants in Boston 
met and, among other resolutions adopted, ordered a peti 
tion to be presented to the Legislature, reciting the embar 
rassments of the foreign trade, and urging them to instruct 
their delegates in Congress to endeavor to obtain early action 
for the regulation of this business. 

In consequence of these suggestions, towards the end of 
May, Governor Bowdoin called the attention of the Legislature 
to the serious troubles in the foreign trade, pointing out the 
fact that though the evil was felt by all, many of the States 
were unwilling to grant full power to Congress, from fear of 
an entrenchment upon their reserved rights ; that the settle- 

57 



58 RUFUS KING. [1785 



ment of this trouble would demand some new power to be 
given to Congress, and that this could only be obtained by 
a meeting of delegates from each State assembled in con 
vention. On the 1st of July the General Court of Massachu 
setts, after a full discussion, passed a series of resolutions, 
as follows : 

" Resolved, That it is the opinion of this Court that the present 
powers of the Congress of the United States, as contained in the 
Articles of Confederation, are not fully adequate to the great pur 
poses they were originally designed to effect. 

" Resolved, That it is the opinion of this Court that it is highly 
expedient, if not indispensably necessary, that there should be a 
Convention of Delegates from all the States in the Union at some 
convenient place, as soon as may be, for the sole purpose of 
revising the Confederation and reporting to Congress how far it 
may be necessary to alter or enlarge the same. 

" Resolved, That Congress be and they are hereby requested to 
recommend a Convention of Delegates from all the States at such 
time and place as they may think convenient, to revise the Con 
federation and report to Congress how far it may be necessary in 
their opinion to alter or enlarge the same in order to secure the 
primary objects of the Union." * 

Gov. Bowdoin, on the same date, addressed a letter to the 
delegates in Congress, with a copy of the resolutions, 
covering letters to the President of Congress, and to the 
governors of each of the States, calling their attention to 
the condition of affairs, and to the resolutions of Massa 
chusetts, and urging the co-operation of the governors in 
carrying out the views of those resolutions, when adopted 
and recommended to them by Congress. These documents 
reached "the delegates in Congress, Messrs. E. Gerry, S. 
Holten, and R. King, only on the ist of August, as appears 
by the following letter of the i8th of August from the 
Delegates in the handwriting of Mr. S. Holten.*

NEW YORK, iSth Aug., 1785. 
SIR : 

We have received your Excellency s letters under date, Aug. 
i, the nth, the 18 &amp; 28. July, and of the August, with 
the enclosures they severally refer to : these dispatches have 
been disposed of conformably to the sense of the Legislature as 
communicated by your Excellency, except in the instance of the 
resolves recommendatory of a revision of the articles of confed 
eration &amp; perpetual union between the states : at the time we 
received these resolves, Congress had, &amp; still have, under 
deliberation propositions to remedy the commercial embarrass 
ments experienced in many of the states : the prevailing opinion 
discovered in the progress of deliberation gave us no cause to 
expect an adoption of the plan proposed by the Legislature in 
the resolves referred to ; we ourselves considered the object &amp; 
extent of these resolves as highly important. We have delayed 
any communication with Congress upon this subject with an 
intention to state to your Excellency our sentiments upon the 
probable tendency &amp; consequences of the measure should it be 
adopted by Congress, and acceded to by the States. We are 
sensible that our duty points out a prompt and exact obedience 
to the acts &amp; instructions of the Legislature, but if a case arises 
wherein we discover most clearly consequences so fatal, that had 
they been known, perhaps the measure adopted would not have 
been proposed, it may not be improper to delay a final execution 
untill we have the instructions of the Legislature after such per 
nicious consequences of the measure shall have been submitted 
to their examination. But this may be a questionable opinion,, 
we will therefore ask the advice of the supreme executive con 
cerning it ; and that they may truly know our situation, we will 
fully communicate our sentiments on the plan proposed for a 
revision of the Confederation. The business of Congress requires 
so great a portion of our time, that hitherto we have not been 
able to make this communication, but it shall be transmitted to 
your Excellency by an early post.* With the most perfect con- 

* Within the folds of the letter is this by the Clerk : " Your letter was com 
municated to ye Council, but it was apprehended the advise, thus requested, 
was meant by our Delegates to be given after they should write their sentiments

sideration &amp; respect, we have the honor to be your Excellency s 
most obedient servants, 

E. GERRY, S. HOLTEN, R. KING. 

His EXCELLENCY, Gov. BOWDOIN. 

On the attested copy of the letter of Governor Bowdoin 
to Gov. Richard H. Lee which had been sent to the Mas 
sachusetts delegates, there is in R. King s handwriting 
the following endorsement : 

" Resolutions of Mass, of July, 1785, for calling a federal con 
vention to revise the Confederacy. These resolutions with the 
circular letters to the Governors of the several States were 
transmitted by Gov. Bowdoin to the Mass. Dels, in Congress, viz, 
Gerry, Holten &amp; King, who doubting the expediency of the 
measure, suspended it till the next session of the Genl. Court, 
wrote to them (3rd of September) their reasons for their conduct, 
and the Genl. Court resolved that the same should be suspended 
until further notice." 

His second letter of the 3d of September, which, as we 
find by the clerk s memorandum, did not reach the Gov 
ernor until after the General Court adjourned, contained 
a carefully prepared and able statement of the reasons why 
the delegates were induced to suspend their action, placed 
as they were in the daily intercourse of those who would 
have to decide upon this question, and with whose general 
opinions they would be familiar. As this letter is important 
it is here given in full as taken from a copy in Letter Book 
viii., pp. 210-213, in the office of the Secretary of State of 
Massachusetts, the original not being found. 

NEW YORK, 3d Septemr,, 1785. 
SIR : 

We have deferred a communication of the reasons which urged 
us to Suspend the delivery to Congress, of your excellency s letter 

which they desire might be laid before the General Court, the Council could not 
consider, as there was no meeting of ye Council after ye receiving of that 
letter." 



1785] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 6 1 



to them for revising &amp; altering the Confederation, &amp; to each of 
the executives of the States, on the same Subject, in expectation 
of an answer to the Letter, which we had the honour of address 
ing to you the i8th of August last : but lest any inconvenience 
should result from a longer delay, we now beg leave to Suggest 
our Sentiments on the Subject. 

It may be necessary previously to observe, that many are of 
opinion, the States have not yet had experience sufficient to de 
termine the extent of powers vested in Congress by the Confed 
eration ; &amp; therefore that every measure at this time, proposing 
an alteration is premature. But admitting the necessity of im 
mediately investing Congress with more commercial powers, it 
may be expedient to enquire. First Whether good policy does 
not require, that those powers Should be temporary ? in de 
termining this question, we are led to consider, the commercial 
evils to be remedied : the efficacy of temporary powers for this 
purpose : &amp; the disposition of the Several States touching the 
Subject the evils principally consist, in the impositions, re 
strictions, &amp; prohibitions, of foreign powers on our commerce ; 
&amp; in the embarrassments resulting from the commercial regula 
tions of our own States. How far temporary powers can remedy 
these evils, perhaps time &amp; experience, can only determine. Thus 
much may nevertheless be Suggested, that as the several treaties, 
which are now negociating by our Commissioner in Europe, 
are not to exceed the term of fifteen years ; if the commercial 
powers to be vested in Congress should be of a similar duration, 
they may remedy the evils for that term : &amp; at the expiration 
thereof, a new commercial Epoch, will commence, when the 
States, will have a more clear &amp; comprehensive view of their 
commercial interests, &amp; of the best means for promoting the 
same, whether by treaties abroad, or by the Delegation &amp; exer 
cise of greater commercial powers at home Whatever the dis 
position of the States may be, it can only be known by their 
Acts : but the different views which they have had of the Sub 
ject, give reason to Suppose that some Legislatures will think 
temporary commercial powers eligible under present circum 
stances ; &amp; should this be the opinion of but one, an attempt 
immediately to delegate perpetual commercial powers, must fail, 
&amp; may prevent a delegation of temporary powers for in politics 



62 RUFUS KING. [1785 



as in private life by aiming at too much, we oft times accomplish 
nothing. 

Secondly If the States are unanimously disposed to encrease 
the commercial powers of the Confederacy ; should not the ad 
ditional powers be in the first instance temporary ; &amp; the adoption 
of them as part of the Confederation depend on their beneficial 
effects ? this is a question on which we propose not to venture 
a decided opinion ; but experience teaches us, that in the forma 
tion of Constitutions &amp; Laws, the wisest men have not been able 
to foresee the evasions &amp; abuses which in the operation have re 
sulted from vague terms &amp; expressions, latent inconsistencies, 
artful constructions, &amp; from too full &amp; unguarded a delegation 
of powers. 

Whether the subject of commerce, &amp; the danger to which the 
States may be exposed by a Surrender to the Union of their com 
mercial authority, are so fully understood as to justify the con 
sideration of an immediate attention of the Confederation, is a 
matter that the Legislatures alone are competent to determine 
any of them, who may not be clear with respect to either of those 
points will probably (as in the other case) be in the first instance 
in favour of temporary commercial powers, &amp;, if approved by 
experience, of adopting them as part of the Confederation. But 
Should all the States be in favour of an immediate alteration of 
the articles, will it not be expedient for them previously to con 
sider, that however great the abuse of this trust may hereafter 
be ; however grievous to a considerable part of the Union ; the 
powers once delegated in the Confederation cannot be revoked 
without the unanimous consent of the States that this may be 
earnestly Sought for, but never obtained that the federal &amp; State 
Constitutions are the great bulwarks of liberty, that if they are 
Subject, on trivial or even important occasions, to be revised, &amp; 
re-revised, altered &amp; re-altered, they must cease to be considered 
as effectual &amp; Sacred barriers ; &amp; like land marks frequently 
changed will afford no certain rule for ascertaining the boun 
daries, no criterion for distinguishing between the rights of Gov 
ernment &amp; those of the people. &amp; therefore that every alteration 
of the articles, should be so thoroughly understood &amp; digested, 
as scarcely to admit the possibility of a disposition for a recon 
sideration. 



1785] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 63 



Thirdly Shall any alteration, either temporary or perpetual be 
proposed in a way not expressly pointed out by the Confedera 
tion ? the thirteenth article provides "that the articles of this 
Confederation shall be inviolably observed by every State &amp; the 
Union shall be perpetual ; nor shall any alteration, at any time 
hereafter be made in any of them, unless Such alteration be 
agreed to in a Congress of the United States &amp; be afterwards 
confirmed by the Legislature of every State." 

Here no provision is made for or against a convention &amp; there 
fore it may be said not to be inconsistent with this article ; but as 
the proceedings of a convention, would not be binding on Con 
gress should the latter think themselves under the necessity of 
rejecting the report of the former, would not the States after 
having thus incurred a considerable expence be dissatisfied 
on the occasion ? would not the members of the convention who 
it must be Supposed would be men of the first abilities and in 
fluence in the Several States, be hurt &amp; opposed in this instance 
to Congress ? and would not parties in the Legislatures, and 
amongst the people, be the consequence ? if so may not an ap 
prehension of these evils, have a tendency to influence some 
members of Congress to give up their opinion respecting the re 
port, rather than to be considered as pertinacious, &amp; involved in 
contentions ? And if such are the prospects of a Convention, 
will not Congress consider it as being contrary to the Spirit of 
the Confederation ? indeed, we are doubtful, whether, a measure 
of this kind would not be viewed as manifesting a want of confi 
dence in Congress, &amp; on this ground meet their disapprobation. 

Fourthly If an alteration, either temporary or perpetual, of 
the commercial powers of Congress, is to be considered by a 
Convention, shall the latter be authorized to revise the confedera 
tion generally or only for express purposes ? the great object of 
the revolution was the establishment of good Government, &amp; each 
of the States, in forming their own, as well as the federal Consti 
tution, have adopted republican principles. notwithstanding 
this, plans have been artfully laid, &amp; vigorously pursued which 
had they been Successful, we think would inevitably have changed 
our republican Governments into balefull Aristocracies. Those 
plans are frustrated, but the same Spirit remains in their abettors : 
And the institution of the Cincinnati, honourable &amp; beneficent 



64 RUFUS KING. [1785 



as the views may have been of the Officers who compose it, we 
fear, if not totally abolished will have the same fatal tendency. 
What the effect, then may be of calling a Convention to revise 
the Confederation generally, we leave with your Excellency &amp; the 
honourable Legislature to determine. We are apprehensive &amp; it 
is our duty, to declare it, that such a measure would produce 
thro out the Union, an exertion of the friends of an Aristocracy 
to Send members who would promote a change of Government : 
&amp; we can form some judgment of the plan, which Such members 
would report to Congress. but Should the members be altogether 
republican, such have been the Declamations of designing men 
against the Confederation generally : against the rotation of mem 
bers which perhaps is the best check to corruption. And against 
the mode of altering the Confederation, by the unanimous con 
sent of the Legislatures, which effectually prevents innovations 
in the articles, by intrigue or Surprise, that we think there is great 
danger of a report which would invest Congress, with powers that 
the honourable Legislature have not the most distant intention to 
delegate ; perhaps it may be said, this can produce no ill effect ; 
because Congress may correct the report however exceptionable, 
or if passed by them, any of the States may refuse to ratify it 
true it is, that Congress, &amp; the States have such powers but 
would not such a report affect the tranquility &amp; weaken the 
Government of the Union ? We have already considered the 
operation of the report as it would respect Congress ; &amp; if ani 
mosities &amp; parties would naturally arise from their rejecting it, 
how much would these be encreased, if the report approved by 
Congress &amp; some of the States, should be rejected by other States ? 
would there not be danger of a party spirit being thus more gen 
erally diffused, &amp; warmly Supported ? far distant we know it to 
be, from the honorable Legislature of Massachusetts, to give up a 
single principle of republicanism, but when a general revision 
Shall have proceeded from their motion &amp; a report which to them 
may be highly offensive, shall have been confirmed by Seven States 
in Congress, &amp; ratified by Several Legislatures, will not these be 
ready to charge Massachusetts with inconsistency, in being the first 
to oppose a measure, which the State will be said to have origi 
nated ? Massachusetts has great weight, &amp; is considered as one 
of the most republican States in the Union ; &amp; when it is known, 



1785] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 65 

that the Legislature have proposed a general revision, there can 
be no doubt that they will be represented as being convinced of 
the necessity of encreasing generally, the powers of Congress, &amp; 
the opinion of the State will be urged with Such art, as to con 
vince numbers that the articles of the Confederation are altogether 
exceptionable thus whilst measures are taken to guard- against 
the evils arising from the want, in one or two particulars, of power 
in Congress, we are in great danger of incurring the other 
extreme. 

" More power in Congress," has been the cry from all quarters ; 
but especially of those whose views, not being confined to a Gov 
ernment, that will best promote the happiness of the people, are 
extended, to one that will afford lucrative employments, civil &amp; 
military. Such a Government is an Aristocracy, which would re 
quire a Standing Army, &amp; a numerous train of pensioners &amp; place 
men to prop &amp; Support its exalted administration. To recommend 
one s self to such an Administration, would be to Secure an estab 
lishment for life &amp; at the same time to provide for his posterity. 
these are pleasing prospects which republican Governments do 
not afford ; And it is not to be wondered at, that many persons of 
elevated views &amp; idle habits in these States, are desirous of the 
change. We are for encreasing the power of Congress, as far as 
it will promote the happiness of the people ; but at the same time 
are clearly of opinion that every measure should be avoided which 
would strengthen the hands of the enemies to a free Government : 
&amp; that an administration of the present Confederation with all its 
inconveniences is preferable to the risque of general dissentions 
&amp; animosities, which may approach to Anarchy &amp; prepare the 
way to a ruinous system of Government. 

Having thus from a sense of the duty we owe to the United 
States as well as to our Constituents, communicated to your ex 
cellency, our Sentiments on this important Subject ; we request 
you to lay them before the honourable Legislature at their next 
Session, &amp; to inform them, that their measures for a general 
revision of the Confederation, if confirmed shall be immediately 
communicated to Congress ; that no time will be lost by the 
Suspension Since the requisition, &amp; other important matters 
before Congress would have prevented them from an early atten 
tion to the propositions of Massachusetts ; &amp; that, if these had 



66 RUFUS KING. [1785 

been approved by Congress, many of the Legislatures being now 
adjourned could not take the same into consideration. 

We have the honour to remain Sir, with the most perfect respect

That Mr. King and his colleagues were not desirous of 
" suppressing" these important resolutions and instructions 
will be sufficiently apparent from the above letters, which 
fully explain the situation. The Legislature was not in 
session when the letter was received, but as soon as they 
met Governor Bowdoin, on 24th October, addressed to them 
the following communication : 

" In regard to the enlargement of the Powers of Congress I 
signed and forwarded to your Delegates, agreeably to your 
request, the several letters you had prepared on that subject. 
They viewed it, and justly, as being of great consequence ; and 
wishing their sentiments on it might be known to their con 
stituents, they have, from a sense of duty they owe to them, 
delayed taking any measures concerning it until they shall 
receive your further instructions. The reasons of the delay, 
their letters of the i8th of August and 3rd of September will 
inform you. This being matter of great importance will require 
your attentive consideration." f 

The Legislature, after consideration of this communica 
tion, with the letters, decided to suspend their resolu 
tions until further orders. Mr. King, to inform himself 
more thoroughly upon the matter, wrote to Nathan Dane, 
a member of the Legislature, to obtain from him some 
positive statement as to the animus of that body in origi-

nally passing these resolutions, and received from him the 
following answer, showing the wisdom of the delegates in 
at present withholding them. 

N. DANE TO HON. R. KING. 

BOSTON, Oct. 8, 1785. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

I have just received yours of the iyth ulto. The evidence of 
your friendship expressed in it gives me peculiar happiness, and 
merits from me those friendly returns of affection and confidence 
that are more easily felt than expressed. Your request to me to 
reexamine the motives of the Legislature in recommending to 
Congress to propose to the several States a Convention of Dele 
gates for the express purpose of a general revision of the Confed 
eration, and to make some communication to you on the subject, 
shall be cheerfully complied with, so far as I am able to reexamine 
and recollect what hath here passed. 

It is difficult, as it respects the Commonwealth or Legislature 
at large, to determine what the motives were which produced that 
proposition to Congress, or what, on more mature deliberation, 
would be the sense of this State on the subject. Perhaps we 
have proposed a most important measure to Congress on our 
federal policy, without having sufficiently considered the interests 
and motives of the different States, of landed and commercial men, 
of Republican and Aristocratical politicians, for inducing them 
to concur or not to concur with us, and the consequences to which 
those interests and motives, called into action, may lead us. 

It seems to be the general received opinion here, that our 
federal compact is defective, and that Congress have not sufficient 
powers to controul the several parts of the Union for the Gen 
eral welfare of the whole. How far this opinion is the re 
sult of reflection and real information I cannot determine. 
However, I am persuaded, but a few gentlemen, of public or 
private characters, have precisely formed ideas of the powers to 
be given or taken from Congress in the proposed revision of the 
Confederation, or contemplated the infinite hazard and difficulty 
there is, generally, in enforcing a new, or altering the fundamental 
articles or compacts of government, especially in our Republican 



68 RUFUS KING. [1785 

and combined system, where the consent of every freeman is so 
essential. 

But to give you an idea of the motives of our conduct and 
which produced the proposition in question, I need only to state 
the inconveniences we feel in our national and commercial affairs 
and our wishes to remedy them. You will determine how far 
the proposed revision is expedient or necessary to cure the evils 
felt, or whether some less dangerous and less extensive plan might 
not be adopted, better proportioned to the object in view &amp; more 
likely to succeed. These inconveniences whether general or 
temporary in their nature and effects, or not, become the subject of 
the day and produce a general disposition in those who experience 
them for a remedy of some sort ; and, it is natural in Govern 
ments, like ours, to confide in a select convention of respectable 
individuals to point it out leaving the mode and prospect of 
success among the things that are possible. The defects and 
difficulties chiefly complained of are the want of a general and 
uniform power lodged somewhere to levy and collect monies 
sufficient to discharge the demands against the United States, 
and to regulate trade and commerce. 

As to the Continental revenues, we find at present no motives 
in the several States sufficiently strong to induce them to furnish 
the means necessary to discharge the contracts made by Congress. 
The several States, it is said, will not consider the engagements of 
the Federal head as their own &amp; of sacred obligation upon them^ 
and a mere recommendatory power only in Congress to the States 
is inadequate to the important purposes of calling forth resources 
of the people to discharge the expence of war and peace, the 
foreign &amp; domestic engagements entered into by Congress. At 
least, as our Government is at present, it is in the power of the State 
or States that constitute a minor part of the community to with 
hold their grants unless compelled by the sword ; a power in the 
whole society to controul &amp; govern its parts of little consequence 
in matters of taxation. It is further said that so long as the 
supplying of the Continental Treasury shall depend on the inter 
ests and pleasures of the several States, there is no certainty of 
their doing it ; and for w T ant of a certain and uniform mode of 
supplying that Treasury, the character and dignity of the Union 
must ever suffer, and the Union itself come to nothing. 



1785] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 69 

To find a remedy for this evil, the Legislature appeared to me 
to rely principally on the wisdom of the Convention. But how 
far the yeomanry or the body of the people of this State would 
accede to any proposition that might be proposed by a Conven 
tion for enlarging the powers of Congress in matters of taxation 
in any form, I have mighty doubts. They might consent that 
Congress should have a temporary power of taxing imports at a 
certain and fixt rate. The embarrassments our gentlemen in 
trade have for some time experienced, principally gave the tone of 
our late measures. These embarrassments are, I conceive, chiefly 
produced by the operation of the British alien laws and by our 
own imprudences. We cannot support our modes of living with 
the usual profits of trade and our moderate capitals and many, 
by their imprudent contracts made in Great Britain on account 
of the great but unprofitable importations from thence, have 
involved themselves in difficulties truly distressing. The restric 
tions laid by the British on our trade, and which may hereafter be 
laid by them and other nations on it, produce here a general 
disposition especially among mercantile men, to lodge a power 
somewhere in the Union equal and effectual to the purposes of 
retaliation and thereby to obtain commercial treaties equal and 
just and the powers of the Union vested in Congress appear to 
them to be the qply means of effecting this object. But in what 
manner these powers are to be vested in that body, whether by 
temporary laws, or by a new &amp; perpetual article in the federal 
compact is a matter, I believe, not well considered nor often men 
tioned. Among the mercantile interests, a few months ago, the 
main object appeared to be to vest Congress with commercial 
powers to regulate trade, particularly the carrying business of the 
Continent, perhaps to confine it to our own bottoms ; but the more 
we consider the subject, the less sanguine are our expectations of 
finding the general interests of the people at large in laying any 
restrictions on the trade and commerce of the country. 

Upon the whole the measure proposed to Congress and the 
laws we have lately passed respecting it were, I fear, rather the 
effects of the impulse of the times of partial interests than the 
general purpose of the people ; because but a few appear to have 
any system or idea to be adopted by the proposed Convention, or 
to be pursued by this Government. We all believe our Con- 



7O RUFUS KING. [1785 

tinental Government may in time be amended not only in the 
articles above mentioned, but in some others, particularly as to 
the mode of suppressing revolts in the respective Governments, &amp;c. 
These are the ideas I have collected I have had only a few 
hours wishing to write by the next mail. With respect to the 
Delegates elect for this State, none as yet have given their 
answers. I believe Mr. Gorham will accept his appointment I 
cannot answer for the others. 

I have not yet seen your letter to the Governor ; he is gone on 
a journey to the Eastern Country. I will do myself the pleasure 
to examine it the first opportunity and candidly give you my ideas 
on the subject of it. I prefer writing by this post a few things 
on the subject of your letter, because it is time by the date of 
yours for you to expect this and because I wish to take a few 
days to make up my own opinion upon the principal matter pro 
posed in your s. You will, Dear Sir, excuse the length and con 
tents of this &amp; I hope comply with my sincere wishes that you 
accept your late appointment as a Delegate to Congress. 
With great respect and friendship 

I am, Sir, your obedt. Servt, 

NATHN. DANE. 

The papers thus presented, and they have been given in 
full, make it evident that the Massachusetts*delegates were 
not justly liable to the charge made against them by Mr. 
Bancroft, " that they saw fit to disobey their instructions 
and suppressed the acts and resolves of Massachusetts," * and 
by Mr. John Bach McMaster: " They (the Massachusetts 
delegates) received the letter in July (it was not till after 
the 1st of August), and flatly refused to lay such docu 
ments before Congress. But the 1st of September was 
come before they assigned any reasons for their conduct. "f 
In the letter of the i8th of August, they state, generally, 
their objections, based upon their knowledge of the prevail 
ing opinion in Congress, and their own judgment that the 
measure was questionable, believing that it might be wise to

delay final action upon it, a conclusion which the Legisla 
ture adopted after the delegates had more fully explained 
themselves on September 3d. The leading thought in their 
letter was that a revision of the articles of the Confederacy 
at this early period after its establishment and before they 
had been fairly tried, was of doubtful expediency, and that 
while they " were desirous of increasing the power of Con 
gress, so far as it will promote the happiness of the people, 
at the same time they were clearly of opinion that every 
measure should be avoided which would strengthen the 
hands of the enemies to a free government, and that an ad 
ministration of the present Confederation, with all its incon 
veniences, is preferable to the risque of general dissentions 
and animosities, which may approach to anarchy and pre 
pare the way to a ruinous system of Government " ; and 
" that besides no time would be lost by the suspension, 
since the requisition &amp; other important matters before 
Congress would have prevented them from an early atten 
tion to the propositions of Massachusetts, and that if these 
had been approved by Congress, many of the Legislatures 
being now adjourned, could not take the same into con 
sideration." 

The time had not yet come for the calm consideration of 
the question of the amendments to the articles of the 
Confederation.

T. PICKERING TO E. GERRY. 

PHILA., March i, 1785. 
DEAR SIR : 

As you have expressed your wishes to be concerned in the 
purchase of lands on the other side of the Allegany Mountains 
thro our agency, we think it very material to your interest as well 
as our own that we be informed, if possible, what plan Congress 
will probably adopt in disposing of those lands which lie west of 
the Ohio. If they mean to permit adventurers to make a scram 
ble for them (as has been the case in this State &amp; Virginia) it 
will behove us to engage seasonably with some enterprising, but 
confidential character, to explore the country and make loca 
tions. But I would rather suppose Congress would fall on a 
more regular plan as that of surveying a district or districts for 
a state or states, dividing the same into counties &amp; townships 
and then selling the townships at public auction. The surveyors 
to be ordered to add to their survey such explanations as would 
enable purchasers to judge of the value of the lands. The officers 
and soldiers of those states which have made no provision of lands 
for their troops may perhaps have their district alike surveyed, &amp; 
their several portions assigned to them by lot. I am aware these 
surveys would be expensive ; but this is an expense which must 
inevitably be incurred in whatever way the locations &amp; divisions 
shall be made. If the surveys be made, as above proposed, by 
persons appointed by Congress, the expences may nevertheless 

72 



1785] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 73 

be charged to the purchasers or assignees who are now obliged 
to bear the like expences of locations, surveys &amp; patents in this 
state &amp; Virginia. 

In this way the settlement of that country may be effected with 
regularity with much more safety than in the desultory way 
practised in the two states before mentioned and with much 
greater advantage to the United States. If but a single state be 
sold, on the other side of the Ohio, settlers will flock thither im- 
-mediately. As soon as more lands shall be wanted, another 
adjoining state, surveyed into townships as before (&amp; these town 
ships too should be divided into lots) may be set up for sale &amp; so, 
in succession, as lands are in demand. All subsequent sales, in 
this way, would probably be increasing in their amount in pro 
portion to the increase of settlers in the adjoining state or states. 
But if adventurers should be permitted to ramble over that ex 
tensive country, and take up all the most valuable tracts, the best 
lands will be in a manner given away, and the settlers thus dis 
persed, it will be impossible to govern ; they will soon excite the 
resentments of the nations and bring on an Indian war ; to the 
destruction of multitudes of the settlers and to the injury of the 
public. The ideas here suggested, I am sensible, are rather for 
eign to the interest of persons who would speculate in these lands, 
but they appear to me adapted to promote the public interest, 
and therefore I shall be pleased if a plan of the kind proposed 
be pursued. But if there must be a scramble, we have an equal 
right with others and therefore the information desired in the 
beginning of this letter may be of essential importance. 

Your answer to this letter will much oblige your sincere friends, 
who wish to advance your interest with their own.

E. TO R. KING. 

MONDAY, \ past n, I4th March, 1785. 

DEAR KING : 

I arrived in town last evening and this morning Osgood, 
Lowell, Knox and Otis having called on me, have given me an 



74 RUFUS KING. [1785 

opportunity of sending you some information by this post. Mr. 
Osgood I fear will be discouraged from accepting in consequence 
of the bonds. General Knox will accept. The Gubernatorial 
party are pushing for Gushing, the adverse party for Mr. Bow- 
doin. Our friends Dalton &amp; Warren will have a few votes, 
Lincoln fewer. Heath is opposing every necessary expence of 
Government, as I am informed, to make himself popular &amp; to be 
appointed L. Governor. Parsons accepts as Agent. 

Rh. Island have passed an import Bill, which I think a most 
extraordinary one indeed. I read it cursorily, and as well as I 
recollect it provides certain Duties, to be raised by officers of 
their own appointt. ; applies 8000 Dollars of this Revenue to the 
order of Congress for ye Interest of ye Foreign Debt ; the sur 
plus is appropriated by the State to pay the Interest of Loan 
Office Certificates (&amp; the Commissioner who is liquidating the 
public accts. in that State) in the possession of their own Citizens, 
excluding the Army Debt &amp; Commutation entirely, and making 
provision that ye other States shall not exercise certain powers 
respecting the laying Duties on Goods of the Citizens of other 
States. They say in Newport this is H 11s plan to pay the In 
terest of J n B ne Certificates. So much for politics. . . . 

Yrs., E. G. 

E. GERRY TO R. KING. 

Endorsed Mar., 85. 

Enclosed, my Friend, is the Edict of France, respecting their 
West India Commerce, which they are encouraging at the Expence 
of our own. Their object, it appears to me, is to pursue their 
prospects of a powerful Navy, by increasing their nursery for sea 
men &amp; destroying ours. France has been evidently averse to our 
being powerful by land or sea, &amp; this Edict strikes at the Foun 
dation of our naval Establishment. Something should be done 
to reciprocate this injurious System, but what, I confess, I do not 
at present conceive. . . 

This is my fourth letter to you since I arrived in this State ; &amp; 
some of them are so lengthy that I presume you must return 
before you can find leisure to read, much more to answer them. 

Adieu in Haste, 

E. GERRY.

T. DALTON TO E. GERRY AND E. G. TO R. KING. 

Mar., 85. 

DEAR SIR : 

A Resolve passed to indemnify any persons, whom Congress 
may accept as Sureties with, &amp; in behalf of, our good friend 
Osgood. 

Our friend King is also appointed joynt Agent, with those 
already chosen to manage the Claims of this Comm th at the fed 
eral Court next June, &amp; with equal powers. 

The Bill of 25 p. ct. duties, which you mentioned was referred 
by the Senate to the next Session. At the last moment of the 
Session the Stamp Act passed. The parents died the instant after 
that was born. Altho a weak child, begot in fear, and born in 
haste, its sponsors hope to see it thrive grow to manhood and 
become a blessing in its day. 

The Senate after long debate on the subject of the late Gov 
ernor s recognition of Mr. Soderstrom, referred the matter 
so that no proceedings are determined upon indeed this night I 
hope will finally be found to belong exclusively to the United 
States in Congress assembled. . . . 

Wishing you a happy sight of your friends, I am yrs. affect ly, 

T. DALTON. 

I send the preceding to Friend King, it being an answer of Mr. 
Dalton s to my question on what passed this Session. 

Pray quere the State of Rh. Island whether they mean to include 
the Army Debt &amp; Commutation in their Impost Act. I was posi 
tively informed at Newport that both were intended to be excluded, 
notwithstanding the plausible appearance of the Act. [In hand 
writing of E. Gerry.] 



E. GERRY TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, 28th March, 1785. 
MY DEAR KING : 

The Court is up ; it rose this evening, &amp; I will endeavour to give 
you some Idea of Matters and Things. 

I find by a person who conferred with the L. G. that the G 

in a Freak, without consulting a single person, or even his most 



76 RUFUS KING. [1785 

intimate Friends, sent his first Message to the Court. He expected 
they would be unhappy on the Occasion, be silent for some time 
on his proposition to resign, &amp; then request him to continue in 
the Chair and pursue measures to recover his Health, while the 
Duties of the office should devolve on the L. G r. But when 
the Gov r found that his Message was taken up the second day 
after it was made, &amp; that his proposition to resign was in polite 
Terms encouraged by the Legislature, he was much chagrin d &amp; 
disgusted, but delayed his Resignation three weeks, and was then 
under the necessity of proffering it, as all Resources failed him 
for making Retreat. He is undoubtedly determined now to sup 
port the L. Gr. and no one can tell whether he or Mr. B n will 
carry the Election. But it is believed on all sides that it will lie 
between them. Our Friend D. proposes to return to Newbury- 
port in about three weeks, after being suspected by some who love 
to be shrewd, of coming to Boston to be made Governor. When 
D. first arrived here, having been on good terms with the Gr., it is 
said much dependence was placed on his politeness &amp; friendly 
Reception ; but in lieu of these, a coolness ensued, &amp; neglect, 
which was extended from other quarters &amp; rendered Boston 
rather disagreeable. However D. concealed his Resentment, if 
he felt any, for it has leaked out from some of the G r s party so 
as to be known to a particular Friend of mine, that Mrs. D., after 
the G r s Resignation, said before one of his trusty Friends some 
handsome things of the G r, which were soon after communi 
cated to him, &amp; that he immediately declared, " I know what he, 
meaning D., wants, but he never shall have IT." This accounts 
for the Gov rs coolness to our Friend D., when he came to town, 
&amp; HIS going home so soon after electioneering will confirm the 
other in his suspicions. 

Having on Monday, being the day after my arrival, informed 
the Legislature thereof, my attendance was desired by the Senate 
&amp; House, &amp; enquiries made respecting our foreign affairs the 
Establishment of a War office the Indian Negotiations the Im 
post Recommendation by how many States it was come into 
the Treasury Affairs the federal Court, &amp;c. 

I informed the Court of the ministerial arrangements &amp; Regu 
lation of their temporary appointments, with the principle of pol 
icy which we had pursued in adopting the last Measure also the 



1785] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 77 

probability of an European War, of the necessity of establishing 
our Credit at Home &amp; abroad, attending to the discipline of our 
Militia and to the care of our military Stores, lest G. B., whose 
appearance is by no means friendly, should be disposed in case of 
a general War to enter the List with us. I explained the neces 
sity of a War office very fully, as it was said G. Heath had pro 
moted an instruction to the Delegates to abolish it the quantity 
of Land in our possession by the last Negotiation, 1 also men 
tioned, &amp; the Intention of Congress to open a Land office to sink 
the Domestic Debt as expeditiously as possible. I explained the 
Rh. Island Act respecting the Impost, &amp; how it stood at present 
in Congress. I also mentioned the Requisition reported for 
Troops, the Ideas of our Delegation on the Subject, and the 
Measures you would pursue, if the Requisition was urged. I 
stated the advantages to the State &amp; Citizens of it from having a 
Member of the Treasury from this State, &amp; suggested the pro 
priety of authorizing our Delegates, in case of Necessity to give 
bonds for him. I urged likewise the advantage which would result 
from adding you to the agency, in order to attend to the Repre 
sentations which may be made at ye Federal Court, of the pro 
ceedings of Congress, and afterwards to see the Entries properly 
made on ye Journals of Congress. 

In consequence of the two last hints, you are appointed an 
Agent to prosecute ye Claims against New York, and the House 
passed a Vote for the Delegates to be bound for Osgood, but I 
have not yet heard whether ye last is concurred by the Senate. 

A Stamp act has passed which will raise a permanent 
Income of ^2000 per annm., as a further fund for our State 
Debts. Likewise an Act* laying 25 pr. ct. on all Imposts belonging 
to the Citizens of any States, who shall not have passed the Impost 
recommended by Congress. An Act has also passed, as I am 
informed, to answer the purpose of the Supplementary Funds, as 
they were called by Congress, but I have not seen it, nor had I 
much time to enquire about it. 

I communicated, (with the Galleries closed) the Representation 
&amp; Report respecting Mr. Soderstrom ; who is generally viewed 
here as an honest man, and supposed able to recover himself in a 

* This act, I think, has not passed the Senate. 



78 RUFUS KING. [1785 

little time from his Difficulties. My friend Russel has a favorable 
opinion of him, but as Delegates we have only to rectify the error, 
if it is one, of the Proclamation. In a report of a Committee, an 
Instruction, or rather a private letter to the Delegates passed, 
which was afterwards fortunately revoked, justifying the principles 
on which the proclamation was issued, and the matter rests sub 
silentio. If Mr. Soderstrom, as was suggested, and as he would 
have done, if Mr. Lowell had approved of the measure, had signi 
fied to the Legislature his Desire that a Resolve might pass, 
annulling the operation of the proclamation, if it could possibly 
have any, I think Congress would have been satisfied with such 
a resolve, he would have removed suspicions respecting his inten 
tions being unfair, our New York Friends would have been secure, 
and the Legislature have stood on good Ground without disgracing 
the Governor ; but Mr. Lowell, thinking his letter to Mr. Jay will 
answer every purpose, w r as opposed to the other plan. I think it 
unpardonable of Rh. Island to attempt to prevent the payment of 
Debts, such as the Army and Commutation, after the solemn 
manner in which they have been confirmed by Congress ; if the 
latter are the constitutional judges of all claims against the U. 
S., every attempt to evade payment, is in the face of the Con 
federation. . . . 

God bless you King, give my kind respects to enquiring friends 
&amp; be assured I am always yrs., 

E. GERRY. 



J. LOWELL TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, March 18, 1785. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

Yesterday by the adjournment of the Genl. Court, I was relieved 
from the close Engagements which have for six or eight weeks 
past prevented my being able to write to you on several subjects, 
which I was desirous of doing. I thank you for several com 
munications to Mr. Sullivan &amp; myself, all of which have passed 
only into my hands, for he has been so very sick as to be unable 
to attend to any business. You have been informed I dare say that 
Bror. Parsons has been joined in the Agency ; he has accepted of 
his appointment. I have also the pleasure of informing you that 



1785] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 79 

yesterday by Resolve of the Genl. Court, you was also added to 
the Number, &amp; I shall by the next Post write you more fully on 
this Business. You must not think of declining. I trust on the 
whole, tho the Business will be arduous, there are many things 
that will render it agreeable ; I am very apprehensive Mr. S. will 
not be able to go on. 

It is strange to me that the Comn. to the Judges has not been 
made out, I cannot conceive how the President can excuse himself 
if on this account the Business should be retarded or perplexed. I 
wish you would attend to making out the Commission, &amp; have 
it so constructed that the Property &amp; Pre-emption as well as Juris 
diction may be tried. I must beg your attention to Mr. Soder 
strom so far as to prevent Injustice being done him by any act of 
Congress, founded on a Misapprehension of his Case ; I am confi 
dent our Friends Sears &amp; Smith must have conceived of the affair 
differently from the Reality, or they would never have exerted 
themselves to have injured a man whom they must thoroughly 
know, &amp; upon whose integrity and remarkable good Disposition 
they have themselves a thousand times spoken. Mr. Soderstrom 
has made very large Remittances to Europe, on which S. &amp; S. 
state to Congress he had a Right to draw to the amount he has ; 
his bills have unaccountably failed of payment, yet he is still in a 
situation to give security for all that have returned, &amp; will be 
enabled to do it for all that shall return as fast as that event 
happens. I shall enclose you a State of his affairs, and a State 
(handed me by Bror. Tudor) of the manner in which Mr. Soder 
strom conducted as to the demand made by Mess. S. &amp; S. on him 
here. I intend to write to Mr. Jay respecting his Report about 
Mr. Soderstrom, which I will inclose for your Perusal &amp; beg you 
to seal &amp; deliver. I have never had an idea that a Consul has such 
Priviledges as seem to be apprehended, or that he can be screened 
from the Payment of his Debts. Mr. Soderstrom was advised to 
lay before the Governor his Credentials, who very honestly sup 
posing himself to be right, ordered him to be acknowledged. 
Had I known of the affair, I should have advised of their being 
first sent to Congress ; but I have no Doubt that both he and the 
Governor acted with great Singleness of Heart on the occasion. 
He had been on to Trenton, but Congress had not assembled as 
they ought, &amp; he transmitted his Credentials to the President as 



80 RUFUS KING. [1785 

soon as the Govr. returned them to him. I cannot conceive there 
is any real Foundation for the Report of the Secretary of Foreign 
Affairs ; it will operate cruelly as to Mr. Soderstrom, who, I dare 
engage, will prove as unexceptionable a public officer, as will be 
sent by any European power to America ; and I cannot believe 
Messrs. S. &amp; S. can wish or desire to have a Man with whom they 
have lived in all the Habits of unrestrained friendship, so deeply 
injured. 

The Genl. Court, on your joint Letter respecting this matter 
&amp; asking to be advised, have adopted a Report of a Letter to the 
Delegates, in which they express much Doubt on the Subject, 
and rather incline to an opinion that the sole authority of acknowl 
edging a Consul (whom they could not conceive to be an Ambas 
sador) was not expressly given to Congress by the Confedn.; and 
if not, expressly, then &amp;c, but Mr. Gerry was afraid it might 
involve us in a disagreeable controversy with Congress ; and it is 
suppressed. On the other hand, as they may be assured, that 
neither Soderstrom, or the Govr. had any Design to oppugn the 
Views or Powers of Congress, or interfere with them, I hope &amp; 
trust they will not on their part, make up a controversy with us in 
order to the Vindication of either. 

If they chuse to declare in the act of his Recognition, that the 
measure was premature, it may answer all purposes. ... I 
must bid you adieu with much Esteem &amp; Friendship, I am your 
Bror. &amp; most ob. Servt., 

J. LOWELL. 



C. GORE TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, March 20, 1785. 
MY DEAR FRIEND : 

Permit me to offer you my warm congratulations on your 
appointment to the Commission of prosecuting the Massachu 
setts Claim to the Western Lands. Sure I am that my country 
men cou d not have made a choice, that would have reflected 
equal honour upon their judgment ; and to one emulous of 
true fame, the appointment, as it arises from the free suf 
frages of a discerning people, cannot fail of affording satisfac 
tion. I was not a little mortified that in the remembrance of your 



1785] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 8 1 

friends, you forgot, or what is worse, did not chuse to rank me in 
the number ; a letter from you wou d have gratified me much. 
Tis in your power to communicate matters interesting and 
important to us ; tho in return therefor you may only receive 
accounts of some sordid tricks of an attorney or the petty 
squabbles of a town about the situation of a bridge. But these to 
a mind, sometimes wearied with unremitted application to the 
affairs of a nation, may not be void of entertainment ; their very 
want of importance may render them serviceable to relax and 
relieve the understanding. If on these terms you are willing to 
correspond you will afford me much pleasure, and I will promise 
to communicate to you ev ry thing that may conduce to your 
happiness or amusement. The General Court has adjourned. 
During their Session much bickering passed between the Senate 
&amp; House of Representatives. The late Governor s resignation 
was a source of great joy to his opponents &amp; much grief to his 
friends. When he attended on the floor of the House of Repre 
sentatives to take leave of the legislation, his enemies discover d 
marks of indecent joy, while his admirers chose to display their 
sorrow by unmanly blubbering and sycophantic speeches. 

Who is next to take the chair remains quite problematical 
many expect and wish to see Mr. Bowdoin the chief magistrate, 
while the lovers of Mr. Hancock are warm for the present 
lieutenant Governor, supposing that the latter will at any time 
give way to his quondam Excellency, if, as is expected, he should 
again desire an election. Adieu, my dear friend, accept the 
warmest wishes of Mrs. Gore myself for your health &amp; happi 
ness &amp; believe me with sincere attachment your friend 

C. GORE. 

E. GERRY TO R. KING. 

MARBLEHEAD, March 21, 1785. 

I arrived here, my Friend, on Saturday evening, &amp; will you 
believe it ? The snow on the average between this and Providence 
is 3^ or 4 feet deep, in most places level with the walls, &amp; in some 
six or seven feet, &amp; so cold, that in my sherrevallies, two outside 
garments, fur gloves &amp;c, I suffered exceedingly with the cold. At 
this season of the year (as one of Mrs. Mercer s Geniuses says) 

VOL. I. 6 



82 RUFUS KING. [1785 

this is "surprizing," " wonderfull," "astonishing," but not "im 
possible." . . . 

Mr. Osgood goes on and I presume you will see him at the 
Board of Treasury soon after the receipt hereof. The agents for 
supporting our claims are to have ^300 each. Mr. Robins 
informs me, your Colleagues of the Law were in general rather 
opposed to your Election. This I account for on the principle 
of its giving you Reputation in your profession. The objection 
is consistent with the feelings of human nature, but not candid. 
Robins was your friend. 

I mentioned to the Court the impolicy of negotiating our 
claim for a pecuniary consideration. The attempt would weaken 
the claim, and if this was relinquished on an obligation of N. 
York to make a certain payment, you would have to apply to 
Congress for a federal Court to receive the money, &amp; the negotia 
tion would in effect produce only a change of Claims. . 
Sincerely, 

E. GERRY. 



R. KING TO E. GERRY. 

NEW YORK, March 24th, 1785. 
DEAR GERRY : 

I this moment received your s written the morning after your 
arrival at Boston. I am pleased with the acceptance of Genl. Knox 
and hope that the measures adopted by Congress after you left 
us will induce Mr. Osgood to come forward without delay. I have 
once and again written to the Agents of Mass, on the subject of 
the controversy between us &amp; N. Y. ; but as the gentlemen make 
me no reply, I shall decline farther communication. Wythe, 
Johnson &amp; Monroe accepted within the two months ; Grayson &amp; 
Harrison declined no answer from any of the other gentlemen. 
New York are moving for an alteration of the place of trial. I 
will oppose my feeble strength to them, but I shall regret your 
absence. Delaware is represented so that there are now twelve 
states on the floor and a full representation is daily expected by 
an additional Delegate from Georgia. We have by the last post a 
very rugged instruction from our Legislature. We will manage 
it as well as is in our power, consulting the gentle demeanor of our 



1785] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 83 

colleague the Doctor, who I hope will now come up to what you 
&amp; I believe our duty on the subject of the federal buildings. I 
thank you for the Politicks you give me ; the R. Island Act for 
an impost had reached us before your letter ; New York have 
been you know upon the subject of Impost, and yesterday the 
question upon a Bill, copied from the Mass. Act, was lost in the 
Senate, there being only Eight in favor and Ten against it. The 
business of Congress proceeds with great facility by so full a 
representation. Congress have agreed on a Treaty to be held at 
Port Vincent in June with the Indians North West of the Ohio ; and 
also to a Treaty South of the Ohio. This Treaty was opposed by 
the circumscribed States, because it might cover the States of 
Georgia, So. &amp; No. Carolina in purchases of Indian Rights of soil 
within the boundaries of those States. It was well answered that 
the U. S. are bound to procure peace to all the Citizens of the 
Union, and that the Citizens of the Southern States had a right to 
require the U. S. to establish peace with the enemy within their 
Country. The Object of the Treaty is confined to peace only ; 
and the Commissioners restricted upon the subject of a boundary 
of property between the Indians and the several States. The 
Commissioners for this Treaty are Mr. Perry of Delaware, Mr. 
Carroll of Maryland, Mr. Hawkins of N. Carolina, Mr. Martin of 
Virginia &amp; Mr. Pickens of So. Carolina. . . . 

Believe me to be with sincere esteem yours, 

R. KING. 



E. GERRY TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, March 28th, 1785. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

. . I find the officers of the army are calling a Meeting to 
petition Congress for a Location of their Lands &amp; payment of 
the interest due on their Certificates. They have advertized a 
Meeting in the public papers, which is a Measure I was apprehen 
sive of before I left Congress. Pray anticipate their views, for if 
they petition for merely the Interest of their money, you cannot 
refuse so reasonable a Request ; and I fear the Success of one 
petition will encourage others, which however just, you may be 
under the Necessity of denying and thereby producing Confusion. 



84 KUFUS KING. [1785 

What think you of our Taxes here ? a few Days past I was 
saluted at Marblehead with a tax Bill for upwards of ^100, ster 
ling. This I suppose is in Consideration of the lucrative office of 
a member of Congress. . . . Yours in haste, 

E. GERRY. 

Osgood set off this Morning for N. York. 



GENL. KNOX TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, March 28, 1785. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

I have this moment received your kind favor of the i4th instant 
for which I pray you to accept of my sincere thanks. You will 
have known by my letter to Mr. Thompson, that I accepted uncon 
ditionally of the office of Secretary of War. It is true I was fully 
of opinion that the salary was considerably inadequate to the 
honorable support of so confidential an officer ; but I thought it 
would be injurious to the dignity of Congress to state that cir 
cumstance, as an objection to my acceptance. I was induced to 
hope that the reasons you have stated, which arose in my mind, 
would operate to convince a future Congress of the propriety of 
some additional allowance. 

I am happy that my reasoning in this instance, and acting in 
consequence, will be agreeable to you and my other friends. I 
shall endeavor by my conduct to merit a continuance of your 
esteem. I wrote you by the last post of my intention of being in 
New York by the middle of next month. . . . 

I am, my dear Sir, your obliged &amp; most obedient Servant, 

H. KNOX. 



R. KING TO E. GERRY. 

March 31, 85. 
DR. GERRY : 

We have a Letter from J. Adams dated Auteuil, loth Jan y, 85 
which informs that by a Letter from his Bankers at Amsterdam, 
he learns that the last Loan is nearly complete. Of consequence 
we must have in Europe subject to the order of Congress a very 
considerable sum of money. 



1785] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 85 

Mr. Adams advises the opening of a new loan, but laments that 
he has put his hand heretofore to contracts which leave so heavy 
a load on his fellow citizens, and which will prove so injurious a 
drain on the industrious earnings of his countrymen. Somehow 
or other this is inconsistent, Mr. Adams laments our burdens, 
yet advises an increase of them. I do not know why we slid, bor 
row more money. 

Nothing new has taken place in Congress ; we are now warmly 
entered into the business of requisition for money, troops, &amp;c. 
My Colleague the Doctor has been sick this week past, and we are 
unrepresented. However I hope he will soon be out. Adieu, 

R. KING. 

You will observe this to be a letter written in Congress, &amp;c., &amp;c. 



R. KING TO E. GERRY. 

NEW YORK, March 3ist, 1785. 
DR. SIR : 

I this moment reed, by post a short line from you without date 
inclosing the Edict of the French King regulating the commerce 
of the W. Indies you mention that you have repeatedly written 
me since your leaving us, but the letter by this post is but the 
second that has come to hand. The post goes at one o clock &amp; 
I will add a few words whilst the House are settling the duties of 
the secretary of Congress, in a second reading of the ordinance 
New York yesterday reviewed their proposal to write to Mr. 
Wythe, proposing to him to come farther northward than Wil- 
liamsburgh to hold our federal court I remain in the same 
opinion on this subject as when the proposal was before made 
and if we agree on the form of a letter, my colleague &amp; I shall 
join. It will not be possible for the court to be held so soon as 
was expected. 

The business of a requisition for monies for 1785 is soon to be 
determined on ; the amount will be Three millions of Dols. 
After some considerable opposition the G. Comee agreed to a 
payment of one Half only in real money, and the other Half in 
Facilities The apportionment was made by the G. Comee con 
formably to the former apportionment of the 1,500,000 Dols. 



86 RUFUS KING. [1785 

This is conceived to be hard on Virginia &amp; New Jersey too light 
on N. York, Pennsylvania, North Car, South Car, &amp; Georgia if 
any alteration takes place I shall urge the peculiarity of the situation 
of Massachusetts ; considering her former advances, her punctual 
redemption of the old money, her loss by the want of that 
punctuality in other states her exhausted condition in relation 
to real specie the want of a staple &amp; the languishing appearance 
of her commerce, and hope that the statement may be such as 
rather to exonerate her from the proposed apportionment, than 
hold her forth as able to bear a part of those States burdens who 

may conceive themselves overloaded 

but farewell, yours, 

R. K. 



E. GERRY TO R. KING. 

MARBLEHEAD, April 7th, 1785. 

. . . I am happy to hear Mr. Jefferson is appointed to 
Versailles, &amp; I hope, e er this, Mr. Rutledge is elected to the 
Hague. I think you have not allowed sufficient Time to the pub- 
lick Creditors ; the Report extended it to two years, before they 
were excluded from allowance. 

On the Receipt of your Letter (24th March), being in Boston, I 
called on Mr. Lowell, who informed me he had wrote you fully on 
the Subject of the Court. The second Agreement is mislaid by the 
Clerk of the Senate or House. I feel exceedingly for you, know 
ing the difficult part you have to conduct, &amp; wish to be with you ; 
not from an Idea that you would derive any assistance, but from 
the uneasiness of seeing you alone opposed to a phalanx of able 
and intriguing politicians. 

I am sorry to hear New York has negatived the Impost ; per 
haps they will think better of the Subject. 

It is a doubtful point whether a Governor is elected by the 
people. Mr. Bowdoin has probably a great number of Votes. 

Mr. C g has been in a quandary ; his simple ambition urged 

him to attempt the Chair. The consequence of his Election would 

be this ; that his patron Mr. H k, whose inordinate Love &amp; 

unfortunate Manoeuvre for legislative adulation has lost him the 
Gubernatorial office, would offer himself as a Candidate the next 



1785] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 87 

year, and remove his occasional Excellency from the first place 
without his assurance of obtaining the second, after it had been 
filled the preceeding year by another Gentleman. And indeed 
the consequence of his attempting the Chair makes it doubtful in 
my mind, whether he will not oust himself this year from his 
present office ; if so, &amp; we should have a new Secundus as well 
as primus, the whole affair will be truly laughable. Mr. S. Adams 
was put up in Boston &amp; this place for L. Governor. 

Enclosed are one hundred Dollars of new Emission Money 
which Col. Steward desired me to have exchanged for Specie. 
Pray inform him they are all counterfeit. 

I am glad you opened Mr. Osgood s Letters. Your Resolve 
may perhaps facilitate the acceptance from Mr. Gervais, whose 
Declension of the office, I apprehend, would produce a Candidate 
whom you &amp; I can never vote for. Mr. Osgood is with you, I 
presume, by this time. 

I observe you are in a fair way of having a full Represen 
tation. We pushed A s. Election in the nick of time. 

I have a multitude of private concerns, &amp; am exerting myself 
Day &amp; Night to dispatch them &amp; be with you. Adieu dear 
King. . . . 

Sincerely yours, 

E. GERRY. 

R. KING TO E. GERRY. 

NEW YORK, April nth, 1785. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

I thank you for your repeated favors since leaving us, they have 
satisfied curiosity and given instruction. Congress proceed with 
great harmony and moderation ; the Report for 1500 men byway 
of requisition has been changed to a recommendation to the four 
States that raised 700 militia last year, to raise 700 men to serve 
for three years unless sooner discharged. A little firmness and a 
great deal said about candor and harmony brought the measure 
to adoption without much difficulty. A new ordinance has past 
upon the report you must have with you, regulating the duties of 
the Secretary of Congress ; and I am preparing to introduce our 
instruction for the annual appointment of the Secretary the 
measure is right, but I think will not pass. . . . 



88 KUFUS KING. [1785 

You say " my Colleagues of the law were rather opposed to my 
election." Do you mean Lowell, Sullivan &amp; Parsons, or generally 
those who were in the House of Reps. ? If the former, I shall 
not think of serving with them ; as God knows I am unambitious 
on the subject, as I have a strong presentiment the issue will not 
be a foundation, on which great reputation will be raised. . . . 

Yours, 

R. K. 



R. KING TO E. GERRY. 
In a postscript to a letter of April 18, 1785, R. K. says: 

" I inclose you the New York Paper of this Date. You will find 
this State have opened a Land Office to sell the Territory in dis 
pute between them &amp; us. It is a very unfair mode of procedure. 
If the Legislature of Mass, was now sitting, I should advise the 
passing a Resolve directing the Governor to issue a Proclamation 
stating the Dispute between the two States &amp; declaring that in 
case Mass, recovered the Territory, she would not hold herself 
bound to quiet such persons in their Titles as shd. purchase after 
such Notice. 

%&lt; I have it in contemplation to move Congress to pass some 
Resolve on the subject if passed or negatived, I could publish 
it and this would prevent rapid sale. 

"R. K." 

E. GERRY TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, April 28, 1785. 

. . . The opposition to your appointment was mentioned to 
me by Robbins, who was your Friend on the occasion. Your Col 
leagues could not be in opposition ; Mr. Parsons was at New- 
buryport, Mr. Sullivan was confined by sickness, and Mr. Lowell 
you know to be friendly. The attempt was faint and unworthy 
your notice. ... I think you should send official information 
to the Legislature respecting the Land Office in N. York. . . . 

Yours, 

E. GERRY.

E. GERRY TO R. KING. 

MARBLEHEAD, April 23d, 1785. 
DEAR KING : 

I am favoured with two of your Letters, dated March 3ist, in 
one of which you say, that only two of my Letters have come to 
Hand. I recollect six &amp; am not sure that I have not wrote 
seven before this, some of which contained confidential Infor 
mation on various Subjects. If any have miscarried, I am 
determined to trace the cause, whilst there is any probability of 
detecting it. 

I am glad you have taken up the Business of the Requisitions. 
It is high Time to make provision for the payment of the Interest 
of the Army notes. If you order the Interest to be paid to the 
ist of Jany last, there will be one year s arrearages, for which the 
Holders must be satisfied to give longer Credit. There is one 
matter that ought to be immediately rectified. The State of 
Pennsylvania, notwithstanding the Remonstrances of Congress, 
have repeatedly neglected to pay the Interest due on Continental 
&amp; our Certificates, unless the Holders are their own Citizens. 
This is an unconstitutional appropriation of the money required 
by Congress, or rather it is a neglect of making the provision in 
part required ; &amp; the Consequence is Irregularity in the payment 
of the publick Creditors, Injustice, Confusion &amp; Discontent. To 
rectify this Neglect, I think it will be best to order the Interest 
(thus omitted) to be paid out of the money raised by that State, 
&amp; paid to the Continental Receivers or if this is not palatable to 
Congress, order the continental Loan officer in Pennsylvania to 
make Report to the loan officers in the other States of the 
Numbers, Dates &amp; Amounts of Certificates issued from the Penn 
sylvania Continental loan office to the Citizens of those States 
respectively that they may receive the Interest from the Conti 
nental offices of the States in which they may severally reside. 
Then each State will conduct in the same manner with the citizens 
of Pennsylvania, who now obtain the Interest of their Certificates 
in those States whose Citizens are refused payment in Pennsyl 
vania. 

I am clearly of your opinion respecting this State. We are 
overburdened in our proportion of Taxes. What makes this 



90 RUFUS KING. [1785 

demonstrable is, that a Farm of equal Value on the other side ye 
Line of our neighbouring States, does not pay above f the Tax 
of one on the Massachusetts side. 

I received two Letters from Mr. Adams at Auteuil, in one of 
which he thinks the Coolness and Distance of the British Court 
to America promises no good. You will see by the papers, the 
Spirit of the people at Boston ; I am happy to see things in this 
situation. A lucrative Commerce with that cursed, Malevolent 
Nation, would subject us more to their Influence than any other 
consideration, or their deepest Systems of policy, and therefore I 
conceive the injurious plans which they are pursuing against our 
Commerce, are or will eventually be political blessings. . . . 

Always yours, 

E. GERRY. 

Mr. Adams mentions his presenting Tracy, Jackson, &amp; Bing- 
ham to the French Court. With respect to further loans, I am 
clearly of your opinion, they are not necessary. 



R. KING TO E. GERRY. 

NEW YORK, Apr. 26th, 1785. 

I this evening received your s of the yth April, for which ac 
cept my acknowledgments I am surprised that I hear nothing 
from Mr. Lowell on the subject of the federal court Doctr. 
Johnson joins me in opinion that it will be wholly improper to 
think of trying the cause in June, indeed it is impossible the 
time is too short to give notice to the Judges No commission is 
yet made. Mr. Rutledge has given no answer three Judges are 
to be appointed, notice thereof given them, and time to receive 
their respective answers &amp;c., &amp;c. I see no benefit from hurrying 
the trial, but from a delay that will give sufficient opportunity to 
arrange documents, and understand the cause, benefit certainly 
may be expected No minister is yet appointed to the Hague 
some weeks since we tried a ballot and the votes were divided 
between Rutledge, Harrison &amp; Govr. Livingston the matter sub 
sided, and nothing is said upon the subject. 

I wrote you that Gervais had declined his appointment at the 
Treasury, no Election has been attempted to supply his place, 



1785] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 91 

the sense of the House appears to be, to wait until they can hear 
whether Eveleigh of S. Carolina will accept. 

Osgood &amp; Livingston have opened their office ; Knox is also 
here, and in his office and if the States were fully represented, 
we might proceed with great facility in public business Nine 
States only are represented ; Connecticut, Jersey and Delaware 
are off the floor, and it is uncertain when they will be here again 
New York are not represented by their former members the 
Chancellor, W. Livingston, &amp; Platt, are out, our friend I. Law 
rence, and two other gentlemen, all new, supply their places We 
have been this fortnight about a land ordinance Virginia makes 
many difficulties the eastern States are for actual survey, and sale 
by Townships, the Southern States for indiscriminate Locations 
&amp;c, what will finally pass, if anything does, is wholly uncertain. 
I close or lose the Post. 

Yours, 

R. KING. 



T. PICKERING TO R. KING. 

PHILADELPHIA, April 30, 1785. 
DEAR SIR : 

I was duly honoured with your letter of the i5th, inclosing 
the new report of an ordinance for disposing of the Western 
Lands. Nothing struck me more at that time as requiring altera 
tion or amendment except the apparent impracticability of the 
direction for making the Surveys in exact Squares, and yet taking 
the true meridian for the east and west lines. To this the same ob 
jection particularly stated in my former letter applies. But per 
haps such accuracy was not intended by the words " the surveyors 

shall divide the said territory into townships of miles 

square " ; and this only expected that the townships should be as 
nearly square as the taking of meridians for the east and west lines 
would admit. 

If the reservation of 100 acres around a salt spring be pro 
posed for anything more than the accommodation of the manu 
facturer of salt with room for his buildings &amp; a small farm, 
it is evidently very inadequate. One hundred acres of land, if 
well wooded, cannot be expected to yield more than four or five 



92 XUFUS KING. [1785 



thousand cords of wood. If the latter object was in view, the four 
surrounding sections would appear to me little enough. 

I observe nothing is said respecting the navigation of the 
rivers ; perhaps at present it may be unnecessary. 

Upon the whole, Sir, you will naturally suppose the report 
will meet with my approbation, if for no other reason, because 
the principles coincide with the ideas I had previously conceived 
and communicated to you. The method proposed for ascertain 
ing the rights of the officers and soldiers struck me agreeably ; 
t is obviously the only proper one and practicable. 

The report being in my view so perfect, and yet so simple, there 
hardly seemed to be occasion for troubling you with another let 
ter on the subject ; and with this conclusion I had almost forgot 
the other part of your letter in which you request a copy of 
Smith s Pamphlet on the Connecticut Claims to lands within the 
boundaries of Pennsylvania. I now do myself the honour to in 
close it. I had borrowed a day or two since one of Dr. Smith s 
Pamphlets, but yesterday found one at the printers, which is 
inclosed. 

I am respectfully, Dear Sir, your most obedt servt, 

TIM. PICKERING. 

R. KING TO E. GERRY. 

NEW YORK, May ist, 1785. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

This is Sunday evening, we have been adjourned since friday 
A Packet yesterday arrived from L Orient in thirty days ; the 
president informs me that there is a joint letter from the commis 
sioners on the progress of their commission I don t yet know 
the contents to-morrow will possess me of it from private let 
ters of authority, I fear little will be done with England, Spain, 
or the Emperor embarrassments as to place perplex at present 
these may be real difficulties, but they are as likely to be osten- 
sibles.l I find that the ideas of the commissioners touching the 
sum nlecessary to treat with the Barbary powers, are far more 
extensive than those entertained by Congress whether the sums 
in their power will be sufficient to begin the treaty with, or 
whether they will do nothing until they state their sentiments to 
Congress, I cannot form an opinion I am inclined to suppose 



1785] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE, 93 

they will commence a negotiation. The danger to the American 
ships from these Robbers is real, but for mercantile purposes 
is magnified. /The resolves of Boston have reached us, and the 
flame will communicate from State to State There is a report 
this evening that a ship is coming up the harbour, which has fled 
from Boston ; if so I believe she will not better her condition the 
Whig merchants will make opposition to the landing of her goods. 

If this well founded uneasiness is attended to by wise &amp; 
moderate men, in the several States, it may be improved to pur 
poses the most beneficial, to our national government, as well as 
to our national commerce you understand me, without my add 
ing too much precipitancy may injure us moderation &amp; delay 
have ever served our true interest. A fresh proof of this senti 
ment, it gives me pleasure to mention to you ; you remember the 
anxiety the Marquis (La Fayette) discovered at Trenton concern 
ing the demand made by his Court for satisfaction for the viola 
tion of National Law in the affair at Philadelphia. 

We now have it in our power to conduct the business in a 
mode consistent with our own honor, &amp; satisfactory to the other 
party 

I cannot be particular the delay of a decision has been very 
convenient 

Mr Lowell wrote me under date of the 25th of April, mention 
ing the intention of the Agents to come on about the yth of this 
month. I conclude that they had not received my two last let 
ters ; I think I wrote you to the same purpose No commission 
is yet made out the number of Judges is incomplete no supply 
can be made until you come on No answer is yet returned from 
Mr Wythe. In short there is no possibility of trying the cause 
in June I think the business is in a good train but Doct John 
son joins me in opinion that the trial must be postponed until 
the fall the Agents of New York are of this opinion likewise. 

I shall write again to Mr Lowell to this purpose by this post 
pray see him and explain the situation. 

By the bye, the secretary has given me no Notice of my ap 
pointment as one of the Agents I don t understand the reason 
Should I choose to attend the trial I have no authority. 

I observe by the papers that Dalton is not included in the list 
of Senators for Essex What is the reason ? Did he decline ? 



94 RUFUS KING. [1785 

I hope you will soon be with us indeed I earnestly wish you 
back ; I should have a little respite was you here, as well as great 
pleasure in your society Never in my life have I been so closely 
confined as since I have been in this city You know very well 
my situation. Constant watching, fatigues the strongest, &amp; most 
experienced what must then be my condition ? 

Adieu my dear friend believe me affectionately your friend, 

R. KING. 



R. KING TO E. GERRY. 

NEW YORK, May 8th, 1785. 
DEAR GERRY : 

. . . We are not yet thro the land ordinance ; it has con 
sumed a great deal of time, but I think will have a third reading 
and pass this week. I will send you a copy as soon as it passes. 
I am persuaded great benefits will result from it. You will find 
that it bears strong features of an eastern system. When I tell 
you the History of this ordinance you shall acknowledge that I 
have some merit in the business. 

As soon as this affair is over, we shall pass the Requisition, if 
States sufficient are in Congress. We have letters from the Com 
missioners in Europe, but nothing new Ministerial correspond 
ences &amp;c., &amp;c. containing many compliments and little sincerity. 

I intend writing to, or rather for, the Legislature next post. I 
observe in some of the eastern papers that it is affirmed that Con 
gress have established a Plan regulating the Duties of Consuls, 
&amp;c : pray where does that information come from ? Nothing of 
that kind has been transacted since your departure ; and what is 
singular, nothing is said on the subject by Doct. Franklin. 

We have a letter from Mr. Wythe in answer to a letter sent since 
your being in Boston, wherein he expressly declines coming north 
ward to attend the federal Court. New York are now concluded 
and easy. We must go in the fall to Williamsburgh. Rutledge 
has given no answer ; Grayson and Harrison have declined. If 
you &amp; one of the Agents, or the two Agents will agree on two 
Gentlemen from our list, to supply the places of Rutledge and 
Grayson, and make &amp; sign a proper certificate thereof, which we 
may sign and present to Congress, we may complete the number 



1785] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 95 

of Commissioners without the trouble of the Agents making a 
special journey for that purpose. You may make &amp; sign a blank 
certificate to be filled up here, by agreement with the N. York 
Agents, with some one to supply the place of Harrison. In this 
case you would advise us of such persons as would be agreeable 
to you, and from those named, undoubtedly we may agree with 
the N. York Agents on one. It will be necessary in this mode 
of supplying the vacancies to send on the original agreement, if 
the same is found. 

Sitgreaves goes home tomorrow ; Williamson s time expires 
this week, and Spaight has been confined to his room for six 
weeks with a scorbutic complaint. Jersey have been absent these 
ten days, so that I have had no opportunity to laugh at Steward. 
Delaware are absent Houston only from Georgia, and Doctr. 
Johnson gone home to bring his colleague ; or perhaps to receive 
the Right Reverend Bishop Seabury, who is daily expected in 
Connecticut. 

I am very much dissatisfied with the appointment of this 
Bishop. I never wished to see the lawn sleeves in America. This 
Bishop may be the channel of improper information to his spirit 
ual head, the King of England. I never liked the hierarchy of 
the Church an equality in the teachers of Religion, and a de 
pendence on the people, are Republican sentiments, but if the 
clergy combine, they will have their influence on the Government. 

Adieu your real friend, 

R. KING.

A curse on the Ague &amp; on Grand Mamma Eve likewise ; if In 
justice is not done her, in saying that she was the cause of such 
Maladies. While I am writing this, My Head, by the assistance 
of Handkerchiefs, Flannel &amp; other Trumpery, is as big as a half 
Bushel, and it would take me an Hour to find my Mouth. The 
last circumstance is indeed not an unfortunate one, for I can 
neither eat nor drink ; and if you was to enter the Room, I should 
make Signals of Joy, but should not be disposed to speak to you. 



g6 RUFUS KING. [1785 

However I intend to see you early in June, Misfortune of this 
kind notwithstanding. 

Mr. Lowell informed me that he &amp; Mr. Parsons were to set off 
on Friday last for New York ; &amp; the Judge proposed to leave 
Boston soon after. I shall therefore only observe on the subject 
of the federal Court, that I am clearly of your opinion as ex 
pressed in your letter of the i6th of April &amp; your proposition will 
I think meet the approbation of your Colleagues. 

What is the matter with Virginia ? Their attachments to their 
opinions originate I fear from mistaken Ideas of their own im 
portance. They have certainly many good qualities, but has not 
their Ambition been bribed by artifice &amp; Flattery to beseige and 
undermine their Reason &amp; good policy ? 

My Time has never been so occupied, than since my Return to 
Boston. I have made every Exertion for leaving Massachusetts 
to share the Difficulties of your situation ; but I am easy now as 
you will be sufficiently reinforced. ... I have just heard 
that C g has the Vote for Governor : but the person who re 
ports it is uncertain. I think from the information reed, when 
last in Boston, he cannot be elected by the people. 

Adieu &amp; yours,

Before this can reach you, my Friend, you will be in deep 
counsel with your Colleagues for conducting the contested Claims 
of this State to the Western Territory. The Result, as it respects 
the new Election of Judges, I am anxious to know ; as it relates 
to the Time of Trial, I can foresee, it will be a necessary adjourn 
ment of the Court. ... I shall enquire at the Secretary s 
office how it happens that you are not furnished with a Commis 
sion : perhaps his Honor does not approve of the choice I mean 
Mr. L. G. 

It is impossible to determine where the choice of Governor 
will fall. I do not propose to attend the Election, for political 
reasons, which I shall communicate at our next meeting. C g 
has the vote for second in command. Mr. B n, it was generally 
supposed declined a seat in the Senate ; but I know not whether 
this Idea was well founded, or only the effect of a political 
Manoeuvre to prevent his Election ; if the latter, I was duped 
amongst the rest, for he certainly might have had a general vote 
in Marblehead, &amp; as matters were circumstanced, he was not in 
the Ballot. . . .

R. KING TO E. GERRY. 

NEW YORK, May iqth, 1785. 
DEAR GERRY : 

Mr. Lowell, Sullivan &amp; Parsons arrived here yesterday. The 
Negotiations will commence soon, for filling up the federal Re 
port. I am disappointed in your not coming on with these 

VOL. I. 7 



98 RUFUS KING. [i? 8 5 

gentlemen. We shall want your good assistance in this business ; 
and I am anxious for your Society in Congress. 

We have no public information whatever. A very great uneasi 
ness is discoverable among the Merchants &amp; Trades generally 
through the States, from the disordered condition of Commerce. 
What can be done ? Eight States only have complied with the 
recommendation of last year for granting to Congress power to 
prohibit certain importations &amp; exportations. Nothing therefore 
from this quarter can Jbe expected at present : indeed it may be 
questionable, whether,*if all the States had complied, the power 
granted, which is only to prohibit, and not to regulate, certain 
courses of Trade, can give a remedy to the Difficulties, which 
threaten fatal mischiefs to our Commerce. Pray examine the 
recommendation to the States by Congress last year. Suppose a 
complete compliance on the part of the several States, could Con 
gress proceed to regulate the foreign trade, carried on in this 
country by imposing Duties ? 

The situation of the impost laws you know the unprosperous 
condition of commerce, you must have entire information con 
cerning the disposition of Congress you cannot be a stranger to 
What can be done ? Repeated recommendations on the same 
subject will produce consequences unfavorable to the measures 
of the Union ; and the Delays in compliance will be ruin 
ous. . . . 

Adieu. 

E. GERRY. 



E. GERRY TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, May igth, 1785. 

I have but a moment to inform you I have had an interview 
with our Friends Tracy and Jackson. . . . They both say 
that Congress and their constituents are most cordially con 
temned in Europe ; first on account of the Inefficiency of the

R. KING TO E. GERRY. 

NEW YORK, May 27th, 1785. 
DEAR GERRY : 

This accompanies the land ordinance which hath at length ob 
tained its passage through Congress. I hope it will meet your 
approbation. We are now occupied by the business of a Requi 
sition for monies. The recommendation of the 2yth of April, 
1784, is the source of great embarrassment Congress thereby 
declare that they will call for farther monies, until the States have 
all paid up former deficiencies and they engage to credit ad 
vances over a moiety of the eight millions of dollars in the next 
Requisition. South Carolina, by management with Mr. Morris, 
have obtained a credit for specific supplies equal to their quota 
of the eight millions of dollars, and now contend that as they have 
obtained a credit on their quota of eight millions, equal to the 
whole amount thereof, the present demand on the States, being 
for the remaining moiety of the eight millions, they ought not to 
be called on for any part of the sum, necessary for the current 
year. 

The Recommendation of last year, which is a very complex 
affair, also states that before the residue of the eight and two 
millions of dollars, not thereby called for, should be required, 
Congress would revise the Rule of apportionment, and make it con 
formable to justice, upon the best evidence in their power at the 
time. S. Carolina, in the apportionment of the eight millions, 
stands at the same sum as New Hampshire revise the Rule and 
conform it to justice, and South Carolina will stand with a larger 



100 XUFUS KING. [1785 

sum, and other States at a less. This is what I contend for, 
and if it succeeds, we shall bring in S. Carolina. 

Indeed it may be questionable whether we ought not to recon 
sider the Recommendation of last year on this subject to enjoin 
it upon the States to comply with the expectations of Congress in 
paying a moiety of quotas of the eight millions last year required ; 
and make a new Requisition for the monies necessary for the 
present year, without reference to former requisitions. 

It will be the occasion of confusion and intricacy, if every new 
requisition upon the States for money is to operate as a ballance 
Bill to all preceding demands. What think you of this idea ? 

Adieu, my dear friend Believe me affectionately yours, 

R. KING. 

E. GERRY TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, May 27th, 1785. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

I most heartily congratulate you on the appointment of Mr. 
Bowdoin to the Chair. The most vigorous Exertions were made 
on both sides, &amp; he was sent up by 86 votes with Gushing, who 
had about 134 out of one hundred and forty odd votes. I had no 
share in the Election, but the Senate being doubtful, they ap 
pointed me a Member &amp; upon the earnest Request of my Friends 
who previously by Express notified me thereof at Marblehead 
about five o clock yesterday morning, I came to town to take my 
seat in this dumb Department ; but on scanning the members 
found it unnecessary and shall with the greatest pleasure decline 
the appointment. Mr. Bowdoin had 18 out of 28 in Senate. Mr. 
H. was proposed as Speaker by some, but the Boston set deter 
mined to support Mr. O., notwithstanding which, to his great mor 
tification, Mr. Gorham was elected. He, Mr. G., is very popular 
in the House and yesterday after the Election gave some evidence 
of his attachment to the present Governor. I will give you the 
anecdote. I move, says Mr. H., sir, that a Message be sent to 
the Senate to inform them we are ready to proceed to the Choice 
of a Secretary. The Motion passed &amp; the Speaker desired Mr. 
H. to do the Message ; but the latter did not incline to hear until 
the Request was repeated &amp; then said : Sir, I hear you and can 
do the Message. What little mortifications great men are liable to ! 



1785] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. IOI 

I have three of your letters unanswered, viz, the 8th, 1 2th, &amp; i yth 
instant. Genl. Knox informs me the land ordinance is past, &amp; I 
am happy to find you approve of it ; for I have no Doubt that it 
will be equally agreeable to my own Ideas of the matter. The 
price, if 6/ will I fear make the plan labour. 

In the Requisition do not forget to rectify the conduct of those 
States, who refuse to pay the Interest of securities held by the 
Citizens of other States. People will murmur unless the Interest of 
all the securities is paid to the latter end of the current year, but 
I do not expect you will be able to compleat more than the Inter 
est due to the first of January last. 

The state of the Consular Convention is curious ; I want to 
know of Mr. Marbois what authority he has to suppose it has been 
signed ; for at Trenton, some of the Southern Gentlemen affirmed 
the Fact from his Information. 

The federal Court is in good Hands. I feel myself very happy 
in knowing that if we have a Right to the Contested Lands, they 
cannot be lost without a corrupt Court, &amp; if it is in the power of 
men to prevent this Evil, our Commissioners will evince it. 

I am equally concerned with yourself about the Connecticut 
Bishop. The D 1 is in that State. They are like a young puri 
tan (since the Establishment of our Independence) who having 
been trammelled with piety from his Birth, and being just freed 
from his domestic Confinement, runs into every Excess, religious, 
moral &amp; political. . . . 

I am not sorry the States have not adopted the Recommenda 
tion of the last year, respecting Commerce. They were the best 
that could be then obtained, but would prove vastly inadequate 
to the Exigency of our affairs at this Time. If Congress &amp; the 
Legislatures have not sense sufficient to rectify the commercial Evils 
they will remedy themselves. . . . Adieu, E. G. 

I am determined at all events to leave the State on or before 
1 5th of June. 

E. GERRY TO R. KING. 

MARBLEHEAD, May 30, 1785. 
DEAR KING : 

Our friend Mr. Tracey spent the last Evening with me, &amp; com 
municated a Letter from Mr. Jefferson to him, dated at Paris the 



102 XUFUS KING. [1785 

1 3th of March last annexed is an Extract of what respects the 
Barbary States. If Congress have not received this Information, 
it may be useful to them ; but from Mr. Jefferson s Caution, there 
is reason to suppose a publication will do Injury to the negotia 
tion with the Emperor &amp; the other States. The Sea-ports 
throughout the Union should be informed of this Matter, because 
the Merchants of Britain are taking advantage of those of Amer 
ica, by representing the Danger of shipping property in American 
Bottoms, &amp; obtaining a preference of Freights for their Ships, 
whilst ours are charged in their Insurance offices with additional 
premiums of 8. or 10 p. cent to America. The Wisdom of Con 
gress can however best determine respecting the Communication 
&amp; mode of making it. Adieu, 

E. G. 

" I am glad I have it in my power to give you information as 
to the situation of our affairs with the Barbary States. I think it 
sufficiently certain that no prize has ever been made on us by 
Tripoli, Tunis, or Algiers. I do not choose to commit myself by 
affirming a Negative ; but no probable Evidence has ever yet 
come to me as to any such Capture. The Emperor of Morocco 
has made one prize only which was the Betsey, Capt. Irvin from 
to Philadelphia. We have a Letter from his English 
Interpreter, written by his order, informing us, that as soon as he 
heard that we had declared ourselves independent, he had noti 
fied the powers of Europe, that he was ready to enter into friend 
ship with us ; that he had some time ago notified this Disposition 
to Ourselves ; that having received no answer, he had made a 
single prize on us ; that he had not however permitted the Crew 
to be made Slaves, nor the Vessel or Cargo to be confiscated, &amp; 
that he had ordered no more of our Vessels to be molested, till 
there should be Time for him to hear from us. On the conclu 
sion of a Treaty he will redeliver the Crew, Vessel and Cargo. 
The Vessel is however tho t incapable of going to sea again, &amp; 
her Cargo, which was Salt, is mostly damaged since she came 
into port. We are taking measures to prevent a Repetition of 
Hostilities from this power ; and as to the others, tho we shall 
do the same with them, yet I do not think there is any Danger 



1785] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 1 03 

from them out of the Streights of Gibraltar. I write this informa 
tion with the consent of my Colleagues &amp; therefore, tho we do 
not choose to deliver it officially, or have any extract published 
in our Name, yet for the Good of our Trade, we are willing you 
should inform whom you please of the substance of this Com 
munication &amp; that it comes from us." 



R. KING TO T. PICKERING. 

NEW YORK, May 30, 1785. 
DEAR SIR : 

The return and letter, you transmitted to Genl. Knox some 
weeks since, are now before a Committee of Congress, and 
the object of the reference is the abolition of the Department. 
Similar proceedings are in examination touching the Depart 
ment of the Commissary of Military stores. Since the Secretary 
at War, is expressly charged with the care of the last men 
tioned Department, I can see no reason for keeping it up 
separately. 

It has been suggested that a proper allowance be made to you 
for the time employed in the settlement of the Accounts of 
your Department, and the Department abolished. Pray inform 
me what, if any, advantage will arise from keeping the Department 
in existence. 

I transmit you a copy of the Land Ordinance, such as it 
finally passed. All parties who have advocated particular 
modes of disposing of this Western Territory have relinquished 
some things they wished &amp; the Ordinance is a compromise of 
opinions. 

It is proposed to hold a Treaty on the Wabash to obtain a ces 
sion of Indian claims to the Land between the Ohio and Missis 
sippi Southerly. Would it not be preferable to try the Sale 
of the Lands already obtained, before we purchase farther ? 
Would not the Indian Claims prevent emigrants on the Western 
Side of the Ohio ? Pray give me your sentiments, and believe 
me very respectfully your ob. Servt. 

RUFUS KING. 



104 XUFUS KING. [1785 

T. PICKERING TO R. KING. 

PHILADELPHIA, June i, 1785. 
DEAR SIR : 

I was yesterday favoured with your letter of the $oth ulto. 

In respect to the quarter-master s department, I reply, That as 
soon as other provision shall be made for performing the few 
occasional duties required of it, it may be abolished. More than a 
year ago I proposed to some gentlemen that those duties should 
be given in charge to the Secretary at War. He may need an 
agent or agents, according to circumstances, to execute his orders. 
For instance there is a considerable quantity of stores at West 
Point, of which somebody should have the care. Troops may be 
raised to take possession of the frontier posts ; somebody must 
provide boats &amp;c for their transportation, and of the provisions 
and stores accompanying them. Whether troops are marching 
or stationary, forage, fuel and quarters must be furnished them. 
These are quarter-master s duties ; tho , indeed, it will doubtless 
be best that fuel &amp; forage, as well as provisions be supplied by 
the same contract. 

When we get possession of the posts of Niagara and Detroit, it 
will be necessary to build a decked vessel for navigating each of 
the Lakes, Ontario &amp; Erie. If these vessels be built by Govern 
ment, a considerable share of the expence of supporting them may 
be defrayed by private people for passages &amp; freights which will 
offer during seven or eight months in every year. At Niagara is 
a Carrying-Place of some length. Teams will be necessary for 
that communication between the Lakes. It is not improbable 
there will be applications for the exclusive right of providing those 
teams. In this case terms advantageous to Government may be 
fixed, and at the same time exorbitant demands on private persons 
prevented. I have dropped these hints as subjects of inquiry on 
which you will find some people in New York able to give you full 
information. 

You ask my opinion on a question of great moment. I should 
give it with some confidence if I had ever before considered it, 
or heard the subject canvassed ; but t is perfectly new. Your 
queries, however, suggest powerful reasons for resting at present 
where we are. Tho numbers, in defiance of the authority of the 



1785] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 10$ 

States, cross the Ohio to the purchased lands, yet few would be 
hardy enough to settle on Indian ground. But if the purchase 
be extended westward, even to the Mississippi, like lawless emi 
grants will spread over the whole of it ; especially as the most 
tempting objects lie beyond the present purchase. Pennsylvania, 
and I believe Virginia, formerly made laws with severe penalties, 
even to putting to death, to restrain such emigrations : but in vain. 
These laws have rather encouraged such settlements ; the offend 
ers have not only escaped punishment, but eventually received 
rewards for disobedience, by grants of preemption rights of 
the land so unlawfully possessed. 

I am not sure that I know the extent of the late purchase. I 
have understood the boundaries to be the Little, or Great, Miamis, 
from the Head Waters thereof to Sanduski River &amp; down the 
same to Lake Erie. If so, we have already land enough. I 
should be sorry that at present we acquired a right to more. The 
demand for what we now have would lessen in proportion to the 
additional acquisitions. The purchase will be as easily made at 
any future period as at this time. Indians having no ideas of 
wealth, and their numbers always lessening in the neighbourhood 
of our Settlements, their claims for compensation will likewise be 
diminished ; and besides that, fewer will remain to be gratified, 
the game will be greatly reduced, and lands destitute of game will, 
by hunters, be lightly esteemed. In the mean time the money 
requisite for a purchase will answer more pressing demands. 

There is at this time too much land at market. A large field is 
opened in Pennsylvania. Their late purchase of the Indians com 
prehends five or six millions of acres. The Territory in dispute 
between Massachusetts &amp; New York will likewise be set up for 
sale as soon as that dispute shall be settled. The military grants 
of Virginia are so extensive, that warrants for those lands, tho 
the best on this side the Ohio, &amp; equal to any on the other, are 
sold for cash at -/^ to -^j- of a dollar an acre. 

You favoured me with a draught of your motion for the exclu 
sion of Slavery on the other side of the Ohio. Did it prevail ; or 
was avarice powerful enough to reject it ? 

Dear Sir, yr. most humble &amp; obedient servant, 

TIM. PICKERING. 



IO6 RUFUS XING. [1785 

T. PICKERING TO R. KING. 

PHILA., June 4, 1785. 
DEAR SIR : 

You wrote me a few weeks since relative to the claim of Virginia 
for the stipulated indemnification for the expences of their ex 
pedition into the Indian Country during the late war. In respect 
to the United States, I believe those expeditions were of little 
utility, and probably t is to be regretted that the cession was 
accepted on the condition referred to. However, the condition 
having been agreed to must now be performed ; and nought re 
mains but to fix the amount. This must doubtless be a work of 
some difficulty ; but whether greater or less for the circumstance 
I am going to mention, I know not. Since I answered your letter 
on this subject, I have seen Col. Carrington. He told me the 
State of Virginia (without previous Notice I believe) appointed 
him their agent (or an agent) to conduct their claim. I asked 
him the amount ; it had not been ascertained ; the present state 
ment rose to upwards of a hundred thousand pounds, Virga. cur 
rency ; and when all the charges were collected, he supposed the 
amounts would be about two hundred thousand pounds. He 
added words to the following effect. That these charges would 
not rest on specific receipts for expenditures, for regular accounts 
had not been kept, and that their claim must rather be judged of 
by arbitrators than liquidated by auditors of accounts. This is a 
circumstance which I thought of some consequence to communi 
cate ; as arbitrators ought to be acquainted with the nature of the 
service on which the charges have arisen ; much more than if as 
commissioners they had only to examine duly authenticated 
vouchers. The time necessary for the discussion he supposed 
would not exceed one month. 

Yesterday being in company with Mr. Wilson (member of 
Congress from this State) I observed That it had been made a 
question, whether the United States ought to make an additional 
purchase of the Indians ? He replied * The answer is obvious. 
They ought to purchase ; if they do not, emigrants will settle on 
the Indian lands and directly bring on a war." I remarked that 
to prevent this, I could wish the Indians might be expressly 
authorized, by treaty, to break up every settlement within their 



1785] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 107 

territory. It were to be wished, he replied, if such license could 
be safely granted them. Here the conversation ended. 

But if Mr. Wilson s reason for extending the purchase, be a good 
one, where shall we stop ? If we purchase to the Mississippi, still 
there will be Indian lands to the Northward, as far as the Lake 
of the Woods and farther still, beyond any limits that can be 
named. The emigrants to the frontier lands, referred to by Mr. 
Wilson, are the least worthy subjects in the United States. They 
are little less savage than the Indians ; and when possessed of 
the most fertile spots, for want of Industry, live miserably. In 
stead of cultivating the land, they depend chiefly on hunting, and 
this disposition urges their advances into the wilderness. As they 
will be beyond the control of civil government, a well disciplined 
military force, I suspect will be indispensably necessary to pre 
serve any order in that frontier, and maintain a peace with the 
Indians. If such savage emigrants encroach on the Indian Ter 
ritory, or commit any outrages, nothing short of a military force 
will be able to bring them to Justice. Wherever the boundaries 
be fixed (and as I said in my former letter, those of the late pur 
chase appear to me sufficiently extensive) there, it strikes me, 
should the principal military force be stationed. Their com 
manding officer ought to be a man of judgment &amp; vigour, and of 
consummate prudence. Perhaps such stations may be taken on 
the boundary line, as would be convenient for erecting truck- 
houses where traffic and exchanges with the Indians might be 
carried on, under the protection &amp; controul of the Troops. 

If my letters furnish and suggest any hints which may be useful 
in these public concerns, I shall be gratified if not, you will 
receive them as evidences of my wishes to advance the public 
good. 

Your most obedt. serv., 

TIM. PICKERING. 

E. GERRY TO R. KING. 

MARBLEHEAD, June 4, 1785. 
DEAR KING : 

. . . The Information respecting the federal Court, con 
tained in your favor of the 23d. of May, gives me pleasure. Great 
Advantages are to be expected on our part by postponement of 



108 RUFUS KING. [1785 

the Tryal, &amp; I doubt not you will obtain a Court that under all 
circumstances will suit you, as well as you could reasonably ex 
pect. . . . Yours sincerely, 

E. GERRY. 

R. KING TO E. GERRY. 

NEW YORK, June 5, 1785. 

I have yours of the 2yth of May, with the history of Elec 
tioneering. I am satisfied with all that has been done &amp; with 
all that has not been done. There is but one piece of informa 
tion that you give me that I am not content with, and that is your 
intention to remain until the i5th inst. in Massachusetts ; I have 
for six weeks past daily been saying, that you would be here in 
twelve or fifteen days ; and these assertions have not only been 
made to the best and most reputable men in Congress, but to a 
number of the most beautiful women in this city, all of whom 
laugh at my credulity in believing that you seriously intend leav 
ing Massachusetts this summer. Now, sir, this has become a 
very serious business ; I am not only disappointed in the society 
of my friend, but I am pointed out as a very weak man in my 
understanding, and a very great man in faith. 

But this aside. Seriously, your friends wish you here, and I 
have been disappointed in your not returning. However, as you 
have tarried so long, for the greater good I will consent to your 
remaining a few days longer for the appointment of Delegates. 
I wish to know who is talked of, &amp; who will probably be 
chosen. You well know the importance to Massachusetts and 
to the Eastern States, that Massachusetts should always have, not 
only a full, but an able delegation. The State requires abilities 
in the present condition of her affairs ; but I fear she will not 
obtain them ; although she hath many able men, who would serve 
her, provided when they are taking care that the Commonwealth 
takes no harm, the Commonwealth would take care that their 
private affairs receive no detriment. 

Georgia is represented. North Carolina &amp; Delaware un 
represented. We have eleven States on the floor. 

Adieu, my dear Gerry. Yours affectionately, 

R. KING. 



1785] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. \ 09 

A Letter from J. A. states the little prospect of effecting anything 
from their commercial Commission, and desires that the Commis 
sion may not be renewed ; if renewed, he requests to be left out of 
the Commission. But all this was written before he had knowl 
edge of his appointment to London. I begin to entertain doubts 
of the propriety of forming commercial treaties upon the plan of 
the present instructions to the ministers, and I fear we expose 
ourselves in offering these Treaties to so many powers but these 
are doubts I have been reading Smith s Wealth of Nations ; if 
his theory is just, our plans are all wrong : upon his system, our 
commerce may be wholly regulated within ourselves without 
Treaties. Once more adieu. 



E. GERRY TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, June i6th, 1785. 
MY DEAR KING : 

The Legislature this day proceeded to the choice of Delegates. 
Four only out of five were elected at the first Ballot. You had 
the highest number of votes, Mr. Gorham the next, Sedgwick &amp; 
Dane the lowest. Mr. Hancock was the highest on the List of 
non-elects, and by a second Ballot was appointed. 

This is Thursday ; on Tuesday next I expect to pass thro*

connected with the fate of the Irish propositions when decided 
upon will enable politicians pretty exactly to calculate the

say Sic transit Gloria Mundi." 

Suggesting an increase of his salary, under the considera

They will never get any just ground of complaint against me. I 
will behave myself towards them in character, but I will do my 
duty to young Samson, and constantly advise him to preserve 
his locks. There will still be insinuations to Congress, I doubt 
not. Let me beg of you and your friend Mr. King to inform me

JAMES SULLIVAN. 

R. KING TO JOHN ADAMS. 

NEW YORK, November 2d, 1785. 
SIR : 

A confidential intimacy with our common friend Mr. Gerry,, 
with whom I have served during the past year, has given me full 
information of the correspondence which has lately passed be 
tween you and him, and it is in consequence of a sentence in 
ycur last letter to Mr. Gerry that I take the liberty of addressing 
this to you. If Mr. Gerry remained in Congress, I should sup 
pose that the communications, which I might make, would not 
be worth the trouble of your perusal ; but in his absence from 
Congress, it may be convenient that you should know the opinions 
entertained by this body, relative to the object of your legation, 
and other subjects important to America. 

If in communicating this information, I shall have not only the 
honor of corresponding with a great minister, but also the satis 
faction of serving my country, I cannot want motives to proceed. 

The sentiments uniformly expressed in your official letters to 
the Secretary of Foreign Affairs since your residence at London 
meet correspondent opinions in all the States eastward of Mary 
land. You very well understand the false commercial reasonings 
and ill-founded policy of the other states. Their present conduct 
will hereafter be the cause of bitter regret. The Navigation act of 
Massachusetts you undoubtedly will have seen before this reaches 
you. New Hampshire has passed a similar law, and other states 
probably may follow their example ; yet granting that the measure 
will not become general, still the Confederation has put it in the 



1785] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 113 

choice of the seven or eight eastern states to become great com 
mercial powers. Even admitting what is affirmed in England 
that the Southern and Eastern states cannot agree in any system 
of commerce which will oppose to Great Britain commercial 
disadvantages similar to those which she imposes on our com 
merce and navigation, yet the eight Eastern states can agree. 
They have common objects, are under similar embarrassments, 
would vest adequate powers in Congress to regulate external and 
internal commerce ; &amp; in case the Southern States decline, to vest 
similar powers in Congress, or to agree in some uniform system ; 
the former by confederation are competent to form, &amp; in the event 
must form, a sub-confederation remedied of all their present 
embarrassment. 

This is a matter that will be touched with great delicacy ; the 
subject is better &amp; better understood every day in America, for 
it is the general conversation and examination. You, sir, know 
your countrymen, you have witnessed their enterprize &amp; reso 
lution under superior difficulties. Will they suffer their com 
merce to languish &amp; expire ? Will not the spirit which dictated 
the non-importation agreement and which once pervaded these 
states again appear ? It still exists, and though it may have slept 
for a time, it can again be roused ; and if once more it becomes 
vigilant, &amp; can be made active by the pride of independence, the 
idea of national honor &amp; glory, the present embarrassments of 
trade &amp; the vain sophisms of Europeans relative thereto, will not 
only direct but drive America into a system more advantageous 
than treaties and alliances with all the world a system which 
shall cause her to rely on her own ships &amp; her own marines, and 
to exclude those of all other nations. 

I will not add, be pleased to esteem this as introductory to such 
opinions prevailing here, as future safe opportunities may author 
ize me to communicate. If a stranger can without impropriety 
offer his homage to a lady of distinguished merit, I pray that you 
will be pleased to make mine acceptable to Mrs. Adams for whose 
happiness together with that of her companion &amp; daughter I 
entertain the warmest wishes, and have the honor to be yr. 
obedient servant

JOHN HANCOCK TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, Nov. 30. 

This day I was favour d with your Letter of 23d inst. and feel 
myself exceedingly honour d by its Contents. I most sincerely wish 
I could boast of fine health equal to my Desire to render every pos 
sible service to my Country ; such as it is, under the present call of 
Congress, it shall be devoted to them, and I will as quickly as pos 
sible undertake the Journey which I hope to be able to effect in 
ten or twelve Days, and while my health will admit shall use my 
best exertions to pursue the Business of Congress to their Satis 
faction. The intelligence convey d to me in your Letter was quite 
unexpected. I had previous to the Reception of it, settled with 
Mr. Gorham to leave this place with him for Congress the last of 
next month ; but this Appointment will alter our Arrangement as 
I must earlier depart and I cannot think of residing at York 
without Mrs. Hancock and I think you will approve my Deter 
mination. When I have the Happiness of seeing you, I shall in 
person express my obligation to you, which for want of time I 
am prevented doing on paper, as I have been the whole evening 
engag d at the General Court, and it is now twelve o clock They 
propos d Rising in the forenoon of Tomorrow that I know you 
will excuse me and can only add that I am most sensibly affected 
with this instance of the very respectful notice Congress has ex 
hibited to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and to me in 
particular which I hope soon to have an oppor y of expressing to 
them and you. I have the honor to be with every Sentiment 
of Respect and Esteem, Dear sir, 

Your obliged &amp; very humble servant 

JOHN HANCOCK. 

I have scarcely yet Recover d from a late very severe fit of the 
Gout, so as to have the free use of my hands, but I must make 
the best of it, and hope a journey may be of some advantage, 
tho I cannot say much in favor of the season for travelling. 



R. KING TO J. ADAMS. 

NEW YORK, December 4th, 1785. 
SIR : 

I had the honor to write to you under date of the second of 
November, at which date the Congress of the last year was at the 



1785] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 115 

point of separation to make way for their successors. States 
sufficient to form a new Congress did not assemble until the 25th 
ultimo when they proceeded to the choice of a President, and Mr. 
Hancock although absent was elected, whether he will accept the 
appointment is uncertain. 

Mr. Temple arrived here about ten days since, &amp; having pre 
sented his commission, Congress on the 2d inst. passed an Act 
recognizing him as Consul General. I inclose a copy of the 
Act which explains itself, and manifests what would be the 
opinion of Congress on the question in case no commercial treaty 
should take place between Great Britain &amp; the United States. 
Perhaps the delays of the British ministry may operate more 
advantageously to the United States than those acts which now 
might be esteemed the most liberal and kind. You very well 
remember that Spain delayed Mr. Jay formerly as England now 
delays you. The event may be such in the latter case as it was 
in the former, &amp; the United States hereafter may decline what 
they once solicited. Time is more favorable to young than to old 
nations ; the states are more &amp; more embracing the opinion that 
they must rely upon themselves rather than upon alliances or 
treaties with foreign nations : the navigation law of Massachusetts 
has been literally adopted by New Hampshire ; Rhode Island 
has even gone beyond them ; New York will probably follow 
their example : Pennsylvania has now a bill before their legisla 
ture, the heads whereof as printed in the Gazettes I enclose you ; 
Maryland will do something, which will strengthen the common 
cause ; South Carolina had a short session of their Legislature this 
Autumn, adjourned to meet in January having appointed a 
respectable committee to prepare a bill for the regulation of navi 
gation &amp; commerce. The rotation of members established by the 
confederation retained many old delegates to their respective 
states ; these gentlemen having a more comprehensive knowledge 
of the affairs of the Confederacy, impressed with the importance 
of a more close union between the states and a greater uniformity 
in their laws as they affect foreign powers, will not only exert 
themselves to produce these desirable objects, but probably will 
have considerable influence in bringing them forth. The mer 
chants throughout all the states are agreed ; they urge the 
necessity of commercial regulations, &amp; the sessions of the several 



Il6 RUFUS KING. [1785 

legislatures during the winter will be employed on this subject. 
The opening of the Budget of the British Minister will not be more 
important to the Nation than the Acts which the states may 
probably pass during the winter will be to the United States. 

Much time and almost the whole attention of the majority of 
the citizens of this country have been diverted since the war from 
public employment, &amp; engaged in the recovery of their private 
affairs, deranged &amp; injured by the progress of the revolution. The 
success of their application is almost incredible ; towns have been 
rebuilt more beautiful on their former ruins, &amp; the waste fields 
of the husbandman are again inclosed &amp; covered with their flocks 
and herds. These citizens will again attend to the public con 
cerns &amp; engage in every measure which can effectually secure their 
peace &amp; happiness, with the zeal &amp; firmness of freemen. All 
opinions of the future character of the United States, which are 
founded upon their measures or pursuits since the war, must for 
the reasons alluded to, be in a considerable degree erroneous. A 
few years will exhibit this confederacy in a condition far different 
from that which is past or is present. The conduct of England 
discovers their sentiments to the citizens of America, and being 
known, the latter will be guarded and prepared for every event. Is 
it so certain, as Englishmen suppose it, that the United States 
cannot do without them ? Is it clear because they prohibit the 
introduction of our oil into England, &amp; of our fish into their 
Islands, that therefore our fisheries will languish ? How is the 
fact ? France is desirous of purchasing our oil, &amp; it comes to 
a good market in some other states. The cod fishery is in a 
prosperous condition. Plymouth in Massachusetts has as many 
fishermen, or more as some say, than ever. Marblehead has up 
wards of forty sail besides boats ; Salem, thirty ; Beverly, 30, Cape 
Ann 20, &amp; other towns to the eastward in proportion to their 
wealth. A few months since, these towns had no fishermen : and 
by the next summer, it is the opinion of good judges, they will 
have a third more vessels than they now possess ; nor is it prob 
able they will want a market for all the fish they can cure. Are 
not these circumstances in our favor ? They certainly are. 

But I will not be sanguine. On the other hand I see no cause 
to despair. The letters you wrote to Mr. Jay in August &amp; Sep 
tember, were very satisfactory to Congress, contained much 



1785] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 1 1/ 

valuable information &amp; by their timely arrival I hope will produce 
good effects in the Southern States. 

Mr. Gerry who has not yet left me for home, presents his most 
affectionate regards to you ; some private concerns detain him 
here for a short time, and I thereby enjoy his good society longer 
than I expected. 

With most faithful consideration I remain &amp;c., 

RUFUS KING. 

R. KING TO J. ADAMS. 

NEW YORK, roth December, 1785. 
SIR : 

Mr. Hancock has accepted as President of Congress and will 
be here in a few days. Seven States have been represented for a 
few days only since November commenced ; six states only are 
now represented. ... A bill passed the House of Representa 
tives of Massachusetts during their Autumn session repealing all 
the laws preventing the return or residence of tories or refugees 
to their state, &amp; admitting them on the footing of Aliens. But 
meeting with opposition in the Senate, it was postponed until the 
next Session. It passed the House on a division of 141 for and 
1 8 against the bill, the question being taken by yeas &amp; nays. 

Although this measure failed, yet the Legislature passed a law 
relative to the whale fishery which is greatly to be commended &amp; 
taken as a part of a system is certainly wise &amp; politic. The 
Navigation act was altered so as to conform it to the commercial 
treaties entered into by the United States, containing the impo 
sitions upon all British commerce. . . . 

In great haste &amp;c. 
RUFUS KING. 

J. ADAMS TO R. KING. 

GROSVENOR SQUARE, Deer. 23, 1785. 
SIR : 

I am much obliged to you for your kind letter of the 2d of 
November, and hope that a Correspondence so agreeably begun 
may be prosecuted to the Benefit of the Country we have the 
Honour to serve. Although I may not be personally known to 
you, the Character uniformly given of your Talents, Application 



IlS RUFUS KING. [i7 8 5 



and public spirit, leave me no room to doubt, that I shall derive 
much necessary Information from your letters, and if I am not 
always able to make an equivalent return you will charge the Bal- 
lance in your favour to the Publick. 

Your Letter has given me great Light, and opened a field to 
view of the highest importance for me to look into. 

You will be amused I doubt not with Letters from this Country, 
which hold up a probability of a Treaty. Political lies enough 
appear in the Newspapers of my frequent audiences of the King, 
of my visits to Windsor, and of even the Prince of Wales Suppers 
at my house, to make me suspect that such allurements will be 
held out in America. These Paragraphs are made for the Stock 
Exchange, and are fabricated by Ministerial Brokers, as I sup 
pose, without the least foundation. 

There is indeed a stir at present among some of the Merchants, 
occasioned by an application of Lord Carmarthen to four Houses 
for their advice. But it is not the intention of Ministers to make 
a Treaty, and my Proposal will be answered by an Act of Parlia 
ment, not however before the Spring. It is their Design to 
regulate the Trade for themselves, and they think themselves so 
necessary to us, that we shall submit to what they think proper 
to do. 

If the United States could act with Unanimity and Spirit, it 
would be as much for our advantage to remain unbound as to 
theirs and more. If the eight States you speak of should pursue 
the plan you mention, and the other five should only lay on heavy 
Duties upon British Tonnage and prohibit British Ships from 
importing anything but the Productions of Great Britain, this 
might answer. This would cut off Hemp and Duck, Silesia 
Linnens, Irish Linnens, and all East India Goods, and make this 
Country tingle in every vein. Irish productions should be care 
fully distinguished and confined to Irish Bottoms or American. 
This is a great Point, for immense quantities of Irish Linnens go 
now to America in British Bottoms. 

Joseph Brant was yesterday at the Drawing Room. The 
Ministerial Runners give out that he is come to demand Compen 
sation for the Indian hunting Grounds ceded by the English at 
the Peace of the United States, and to get something for himself 
as half pay as a Colonel. 



1785] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 1 19 

The inclosed Arrets of France, please to inclose to Mr. Gerry 
or if you want them in Congress I must beg you to write him an 
account of them. 

I hope, Sir, to hear often from you, and with the Freedom 
which becomes a Correspondence between Persons whose Aims 
are for the Public Good, and I pray you to consider as Your 
Friend and Humble Servt. 

JOHN ADAMS. 



CHAPTER VI. 

Congress of 1785 Difficulty of obtaining Money Report of a Committee on 
the System of Imposts Public Lands as a Source of Revenue Connecticut 
cedes Claim to them New York s Action on Law to levy Duties Not 
conformable to Law of Congress Committee to remonstrate with the 
Legislature of Pennsylvania Rufus King and James Monroe The Man 
ner in which their Mission was conducted Congress of 178; Passage of 
the Land Ordinance of 1787 Mr. King s Agency Nathan Dane entitled 
to the Honor of introducing the Anti-Slavery Clause in it. 

The new Congress, in which Nathan Dane became for 
the first time the colleague of Mr. King, commenced its sit 
tings in New York November 7, 1/85. We find the same 
ever recurring difficulty of obtaining funds from the States 
for defraying the federal expenses, and meeting the interest 
of the debts, still weighing upon Congress. On February 
15, 1786, a committee, of which Mr. King was chairman, 
made a long and earnest report on the subject, from which 
it appears that seven States, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, 
Connecticut, New Jersey, Virginia, North and South Caro 
lina, had granted the impost asked by Congress the previous 
year, in such manner that, had the other six States done 
likewise, the plan of general impost might have gone into 
operation immediately ; that Delaware and Pennsylvania 
had indeed granted the impost, but connected it with pro 
visos which suspended the operation of their grant until all 
the other States should fully comply with the injunctions of 
Congress ; and that Rhode Island, New York, Maryland, 
and Georgia had not decided in favor of any part of the 
system recommended so urgently by Congress. 

1 20 



1 7 86] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 121 

The committee, after reviewing the principles of the 
system recommended, and the hesitation of these States to 
adopt it, declare " as the result of their inquiries into the 
nature and operation of the plan, a clear and decided opinion 
that it is more free from well founded objections, and is 
better calculated to secure the approbation of the several 
States, than any other that the wisdom of Congress can 
devise." To show the utter hopelessness of continuing to 
rely upon requisitions on the States to supply the necessary 
funds for the support of government and of the public 
credit, the report gives an abstract of the receipts from that 
source into the federal Treasury for four years from Novem 
ber i, 1781, to January i, 1786, amounting to $2,458,000, 
while the requisitions had called during that period for more 
than seven millions. 

The report closed with a series of resolutions, recommend 
ing anew to the States which had only partially or condi 
tionally complied with the call of Congress, to abrogate 
those conditions and make their assent complete ; and to 
the States of Rhode Island, New York, Maryland, and 
Georgia, which had not adopted the system at all, to pass 
laws without delay in full conformity with the same. 

While looking for revenue from imposts specially as a 
source whence the interest on the foreign debt and the in 
stalments of principal to fall due from time to time might 
be paid, Mr. King regarded the public lands as the main 
security and source of payment of the domestic debt, and 
therefore lost no fitting opportunity to urge on the surveys, 
so that the land might be brought into market. On the Qth 
of May he seconded a resolution of his colleague, Mr. Dane, 
calling on the geographer of the United States and the sur 
veyors appointed under the land ordinance of the 2d of 
May preceding, to proceed at once with their work ; and 
again, on the I2th of May, he moved and carried a resolu 
tion, in order still further to obviate delay, repeating the 
clause in that ordinance, directing the surveyor to observe 
and carefully note on each separate plot the variation of the 



122 RUFUS KING. [1786- 

needle. On the same day the wise and provident suggestion 
made in one of Timothy Pickering s letters before cited, that 
the navigable waters, and portages between them, should 
forever be free, was carried out, and adopted by Congress in 
the following resolution, moved by Mr. Grayson of Virginia, 
and seconded by Mr. King. 

" Resolved, That the navigable waters leading into the Missis 
sippi and the St. Lawrence, and the carrying places between the 
same, be and are hereby declared to be common highways, and 
to be forever free, as well to the inhabitants of the said territory, 
as to the citizens of the United States, and those of any other 
States that may be admitted into the Confederation without any 
tax, duty or impost therefor." 

The mode in which Connecticut should cede her claim to 
the western territory was much discussed and closely 
\vatched, as all land questions were, by Mr. King, with whom 
his colleague, Mr. Dane, acted in concert. The cession was 
finally accepted after much discussion and many amend 
ments proposed and rejected, in the simple form of yielding 
the jurisdiction, right, title, and claim of Connecticut for the 
benefit of the United States. 

The State of New York, having on May 4, 1786, passed a 
law purporting to be in compliance with an act of Congress 
of April 1 8, 1783, calling upon the State to invest Congress 
with the power to levy duties in order to provide means 
for making payments of interest and principal of the foreign 
debt. The law was referred to a committee of \vhich 
Mr. King was chairman. On July 27th he reported that 
said law was not in conformity with the call of Congress, 
because, 

1st. Instead of investing " the United States with power 
to collect the duties therein mentioned, it reserves to the 
State the sole power of levying and collecting them, accord 
ing to an act imposing duties on goods, wares, and mer 
chandize imported into the said State, passed November 18, 



1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 123 

1784, thereby preventing the operation of the impost in 
those States which had made the exercise of their power by 
the United States in Congress assembled an express and in 
dispensable condition of their grants." 

2d. That the said law does not make the collectors of 
said duties amenable to, and removable by, the United 
States ; but subjects them to the jurisdiction of State courts, 
to be tried and punished for offences against the State law, 
which is a material departure from the plan recommended 
by Congress. 

3d. That it authorizes such collector to receive the bills of 
credit emitted by that State under authority of an act of 
April 1 8, 1786, equally with gold and silver for duties; so 
that if New York bills of credit be received for the imposts, 
principles of equal justice would require the bills of credit 
emitted by any other State to be received in such State in 
payment of duties ; and so nothing but paper wholly inap 
plicable to payments of the foreign debt would be received 
into the Treasury. 

The report concluded with a resolution declaring the said 
law of the State of New York " so essentially variant from 
the system of imposts recommended by Congress on i8th 
April, 1783, that the said act is not and cannot be con 
sidered a compliance with the law." * 

After debating this report and resolution, a substitute 
for the whole was adopted in order to save time in the 
following form : 

" that a Committee be appointed to draft an ordinance to carry 
into effect the system of impost recommended to the several 
States for their adoption on the i8th April, 1783, in conformity 
with the acts of such States as have complied with the said 
recommendation, and to take effect as soon as the State of New 
York shall have passed an act, according to the said system in 
like manner with the other States, and the States of Pennsylvania 
and Delaware shall have repealed the clauses in their respective 

* Journals of Congress, 1786, xi., p. 153. 



124 RUFUS KING. [1786- 

acts, restraining the operation of their grants of the impost, until 
the States shall have granted to Congress the supplementary 
funds and report such further measures as may be necessary to be 
taken thereon." 

In furtherance of the views embodied in the above 
resolution on Friday, August nth, Congress adopted a 
resolution 

" for appointing a committee to confer with the Legislature of 
Pennsylvania in order to explain to them the embarrassed state 
of the public finances, and to recommend to the said State to re 
peal the clause in her act granting the impost, which suspends its 
operation until all the States shall have granted the supple 
mentary funds, so as to enable, on her part, the United States 
to carry the said system into effect as soon as possible." 

Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia voted 
against the resolution, but the others, with the exception of 
Georgia, which was divided, were unanimously for it, and as 
there were seven votes it was carried ; as was also another 
by a unanimous vote (New York only dissenting) recom 
mending to the Governor of New York to convene the 
Legislature of that State, in order to make her law conform 
to the recommendation of Congress. Governor Clinton, in 
reply to this call, expressed his regret that he could not 
comply, looking upon himself as constitutionally disabled 
from such a step, as his authority to convene the Legisla 
ture was limited to " extraordinary occasions" and that this 
could not be regarded as such, as at their previous session 
the Legislature had the identical business before them, and 
had expressed their pleasure in relation to it. Notwith 
standing this letter, Congress took up the report of the 
committee (made by Mr. King) and adopted it and the 
resolutions ; thus reiterating the call upon the Governor of 
New York to convene the Legislature. 

On August I4th, Mr. King and Mr. Monroe were ap 
pointed the committee to confer with the Legislature of 



1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 



Pennsylvania, and, the Legislature then sitting in Phila 
delphia, they proceeded to do so. The Journal of Congress 
reports the result in the few brief words which follow, 
under date of 25th September: 

" The Committee consisting of Mr. King and Mr. Monroe ap 
pointed to confer with the Legislature of Pennsylvania report, 
that in conformity of the act of Congress of the nth Augt., they 
have attended and conferred with the Legislature of Pennsyl 
vania, and on the 2ist inst. received a letter from the Speaker of 
the General Assembly of that State, together with their resolu 
tion of the same day in reference to the resolve of Congress, and 
the communication of the Committee, both of which they laid 
before Congress." 

This, however, was one of the marking incidents in the 
public life of Rufus King, as it exposed him to an ordeal, 
which both severely tried and proved him. The dignity and 
the novelty of the occasion, as well as the deep importance 
to the United States of success for the very existence of 
the Confederacy seemed to be staked at that moment upon 
the ability of Congress to raise revenue to meet its engage 
ments and provide for the general defence and welfare 
caused him to prepare himself with great care and diligence ; 
and for the first time in his life, and the last, departing from 
his accustomed cause, he committed to writing the speech 
he proposed to address to the Legislature and learned it by 
heart. His previous habit always was, and so after this 
experiment it continued to be to the close of his public 
career, to study minutely and elaborately, and in all points 
of view, any and every question in the discussion of which he 
meant to take part ; to look out authorities and to make 
very copious notes : these were finally reduced to a very 
short brief, or recital of the points in the order in which he 
meant to discuss them, with here and there, perhaps, a 
finished phrase or apposite quotation. All the rest was left 
for the inspiration of the occasion ; and in that way only, 



126 RUFUS KING. [1786- 

one would think, can real eloquence, that which fires 
others and catches fire again from the very warmth it 
kindles, be conceived of.* 

In this Pennsylvania mission, however, he essayed to de 
liver a written speech, and as he was the junior of the two 
commissioners, it fell to him to open the business. The 
scene was imposing. The Legislature of Pennsylvania sat 
in Carpenter s Hall, where oft and again the Continental 
Congress in the darkest moments of the war of Indepen 
dence had deliberated and resolved. Many distinguished 
men sat in the Legislature, and the procedure was a novel 
one, and on that account attracted much interest. Mr. King 
had already earned a high reputation for eloquence. He 
began in all due form, but soon, trammelled by the form of 
words he had prepared and learned, he became embarrassed, 
and after vainly struggling for a while to proceed, he turned 
to his colleague, Mr. Monroe, and begging him to take up 
the argument, sat down overwhelmed with confusion. Mr. 
Monroe, of more cool and equable temperament, and without 
any pretension as a speaker, made a calm, sensible, logical 
address. During this Mr. King was collecting himself. 
Rallying his powers and being, as he always was when he 
undertook to speak, master of his subject, he determined to 
dismiss from his mind all thought of the written speech and 
to proceed in his accustomed manner. When Mr. Monroe 
concluded, Mr. King rose and turning his failure into the 
form of a compliment to the " august presence," which had 

* The above account is from a manuscript of Pres. Charles King. 

In a letter of Henry Hill to Washington, ist October, 1786, are these words : 

I lately had the pleasure of hearing Mr. King s harangue to our assembly 
on the subject of the commission with which he and Mr. Monroe were charged 
by Congress. It was truly to the best of my judgment adapted to insure ap 
plause even from an Attic audience." 

I. P. Brissot, Nouveau Voyage, i., 170, says: " M. King, que je vis a ce 
diner (chez Hamilton) passait pour rhomme le plus eloquent des Etats Unis. 
Ce qui me frappa dans lui, c etait sa modestie. II paraissait ignorer ce qu il 
valait." 

Bancroft, Hist, of Constitn., vol. ii., p. 397.

thus overawed and embarrassed one like himself unused to 
public life and public speaking, proceeded to deliver an 
oration, which was memorable among all who heard it, and 
which he himself has often said was possibly the best and 
most effective he ever made. In that day reporting of 
legislative proceedings was little understood, and no trace 
remains of the nature, scope, or topics of the speech.* 

The next Congress assembled in New York on Monday, 
November 6th, Mr. King and Nathan Dane appearing as 
delegates from Massachusetts. Only once or twice was 
there a quorum present before Saturday, 3d February, on 
which day, on motion of Mr. Pinckney, of South Carolina, 

* William Coleman, " Sketch of Rufus King," in Delaplaine s Repository. 

" Monroe and I were sent to the Legislature at Phila. The requisition of 
supplies for the general Treasury were ill complied with, and owing to their 
insufficiency, the numerous Claimants often went empty away ; but such of 
them as belonged to the States, which were the most punctual in paying into 
the Treasury their quotas, complained that strangers were paid, when they 
were dismissed unpaid. In this disorder of the finances, Pennsylvania, which 
had paid her quota more freely than many others, adopted certain regulations, 
according to wh. instead of paying her quota into the general Treasury, she 
assumed to distribute it among her own citizens, holding claims on the general 
Treasury. This assumption increased the financial embarrassment of Con 
gress, and, if followed, would have put an end to all the contributions from the 
other States. 

" To remonstrate against this course of proceeding by Penna. M. and 
myself were deputed to her Legislature. Genl. Mifflin was the Speaker of the 
House, it being before their present Constn., their Legislature consisted only 
of a single body Being first named in the mission, it was in course that I 
should deliver the remonstrance. I had taken a good deal of pains to examine 
and arrange the matter of my discourse, and having acquired some reputation, 
felt unusual Solicitude that my performance should not disappoint any expec 
tations that might have existed. The doors of the Legislature were open and 
the House very full I had scarcely risen from my chair and addressed the 
Speaker, before all my thoughts were scattered and my power to recall them 
wholly gone. Confused and mortified, I had nothing left but to turn to my 
Colleague, who was sitting by me, and to ask him to take my place wh. he did 
and I sat down. Monroe went on and presented the views wh. he entertained 
on the subject. During his Speaking I rallied and recalled my scattered 
thoughts, became composed, and when Monroe finished, I again presented 
myself and went thro my discourse without trepidation and to my own satis 
faction." R. Kings Manuscript Notes.

all the unfinished business of the last Congress was directed 
to be taken up. In compliance with this an ordinance for 
the government of the Northwest Territory, which had been 
read and discussed in the previous Congress, was read a 
second time and debated, Mr. King and Mr. Dane acting 
and voting together. After amendment and order to be 
transcribed for a third reading, it was not reached until July 
1 3th, there having been no quorum from Friday, May nth to 
Friday, July 6th. On July 1 3th the ordinance was read a third 
time and passed, and is the famous life-giving, liberty-securing 
ordinance of 1787, which embodies the prohibition of slavery 
in the Northwest and the various resolutions for education. 
Mr. King, who was present at the preliminary discussions 
of the bill, who, with Mr. Dane, was the only representative 
from Massachusetts in attendance, andVhose early interest 
and attention had been given to the proper disposal and 
government of the western lands, left his place in Congress 
on the i ith of May to proceed to Philadelphia, there to take 
the seat to which he had been elected by Massachusetts in the 
convention which framed the federal constitution. But it 
is obvious from all that has already been said of Mr. King s 
interest in the subject of the public lands, of his introduction 
in March, 1785, of the anti-slavery clause, which almost word 
for word, except the addition of the fugitive-slave clause, is 
embodied in the great ordinance, and from the insertion in 
it of the provisions for the perpetual freedom of the navi 
gable waters and carrying-places between them, of the 
reservations for education, and of the salt springs, that he 
was in close and constant co-operation with his colleague, 
Mr. Dane, who drew and reported the famous ordinance 
and at a favorable moment moved the anti-slavery clause, 
which was carried without objection, and whose name will 
be linked in honor with it as long as freedom shall have a 
votary or slavery a victim.* But it is nevertheless true that

to Rufus King belongs the first practical suggestion for the 
immediate and absolute exclusion of slavery from that 
region, and that to him, too, acting in concurrence with 
that pure and wise man, T. Pickering, belongs a great share 
of the merit for the admirable plan on which that great 
territory was surveyed and for the far-seeing reservation for 
education and the common welfare stipulated therein.

Mr. King s Marriage to Mary Alsop in 1786 Sketch of John Alsop R. King s 
Love for Massachusetts Letters to E. Gerry Desperate Condition of 
the Confederation Opposition to Lawyers Mr. King s Re-election to 
Congress. 

During the years 1785-6, Mr. King, though one of the 
delegates from Massachusetts, had passed almost the whole 
time in New York ; for Congress, then performing both 
executive and legislative functions, was in permanency. 
While thus domiciliated in that city, in consequence of his 
public duties, Mr. King was married on March ^-i , 1786,* to 

*Mrs. Mary A. Patrick, a great niece of John Alsop, in a letter to Mr. 
Charles King of New York, without date, gives the following account of Rufus 
King s marriage : 

"During my mother s visit to her cousin, Maria became engaged to Mr. 
King and married him. The ceremony was performed by Bishop Provoost, 
and Congress being in session in New York and the bridegroom belonging to 
it, many of its members attended it ; among others James Monroe and Elbridge 
Gerry. The youth, beauty and fortune of the bride had made her a great belle 
and her marriage was a serious disappointment to many aspirants. The wed 
ding was very splendid. Six bridesmaids attended on the bride of whom my 
mother was one, and at the supper was produced for the first time wine which 
had been purchased and put aside at the birth of the bride, for this very 
occasion. The pipe containing it had been bricked up in one of the arches in 
the house in William Street, facing the termination of Cedar Street now 
removed and had escaped the scrutiny of the British officers, who made their 
headquarters there. The rest of Mr. Alsop s wine was not so fortunate, but 
fell into the enemy s possession ; as did an iron chest, containing a quantity of 
valuable plate and a set of diamonds which had been given Mrs. Alsop by her 
husband. As there was a pair of pistols in the chest which would explode if 
force was used to open it, the captors took it to England with them. 

" The first time I was in New York, in the spring of 1811, I dined at Mr. 
King s in Park Place, and a bottle being opened to give Judge Benson some

Mary, the only daughter of John Alsop of New York.* His 
marriage was communicated in the following letter to his 
brother-in-law, Dr. Southgate : 

NEW YORK, April 12, 1786. 
MY DEAR FRIEND : 

General politics are so uninteresting to those who are not 
particularly bound to examine their probable effects that I have 
declined writing to you on the subject. My personal concerns 
have been few since my being in Congress, and I therefore have 
not troubled you with any notice of them. This silence has not, 
I hope, been construed into a want of friendship to you or any of 
the family. Indeed I cherish the truest attachment to you all 

cider, it proved to be one of the wine that had been first drunk at Mrs. King s 
marriage. It had been supposed for several years that none remained. Mr. 
King kindly remarked that it came to light very appropriately, as one of the 
Alsop family made her first appearance in the City. 

" The day after the wedding Mr. and Mrs. King, with the bridesmaids and 
groomsmen, went to Jamaica, L. I., for an excursion and were overtaken by a 
deep fall of snow though in April." 

* John Alsop was a native of New York, and a successful merchant. He was 
from the time of the passage of the Stamp Act, a consistent and firm opponent 
to the oppressive laws of the British Government against the colonies, and was 
chairman of the Committee of Correspondence raised in 1774 to agree to meas 
ures of resistance after the passage of the Boston Port Bill. He, with others, 
was unanimously chosen to represent New York City in the first Continental 
Congress, in which he took his seat on September 14, 1774, and concurred with 
the measures adopted by it. Chosen again in 1775, he held a similar patriotic 
course under the instructions of the New York Provincial Congress which had 
been elected. When, however, the question of Independence came before the 
Continental Congress, the New York delegates did not vote for the measure, as 
their instructions looked to peace and harmony and Mr. Alsop, taking um 
brage at the manner in which the New York convention had conveyed their 
adhesion to the Declaration of Independence to the Congress, and, besides, 
unwilling to close the door of reconciliation with Great Britain, as he said, re 
signed his seat in the Congress and retired to Middletown, Conn., until the 
close of the war. He then returned to New York, where he resumed business, 
and was unanimously chosen President of the reorganized Chamber of Com 
merce ; as Mr. J. Austin Stevens, in the Magazine of American History, says, 
" a certain testimony to the esteem in which he was held by his fellows, and 
his undoubted fidelity and attachment to his native land." He continued in 
business and died Nov. 22, 1794.

and am deeply interested in every event which can affect your 
happiness or prosperity. My own, if anything human is certain 
are secured by my late marriage. My wishes never exceeded my 
present felicity. When you know my Mrs. King, you will not 
withhold, what she certainly merits, your genuine friendship and 
sincere affection. She is the only child of Mr. John Alsop, 
long a very respectable and eminent merchant in this city. Mr. 
Alsop declined business in 1775 with a very handsome fortune, 
and served a number of years as a delegate in Congress from 
this State. He is now wholly free from public and private em 
ployments and venerable for his years ; and respected by his 
friends, enjoys the reward of an industrious and virtuous life. 

I pray you to communicate this event to each of our family. 
I am so hurried at this time that I cannot write to Mrs. King * or 
Dr. Porter, f I hope to see you all in June or July. 

Farewell yours affectionately, 

RUFUS KING. 



In consequence of this marriage, Mr. Alsop at this time 
strongly urged Mr. King to fix his residence in New York with 
him. We find, indeed, Mr. E. Gerry under date of April 2, 
1786, writing from Boston to Mr. King: 

" Some have reported that you propose to reside in New York, 
but I have authorized my friends to say, that altho the father of 
your amiable lady proposed this, you would not consent to it,, 
but were to return home in the Fall." 

In the answer to this letter, Mr. King, on April Qth, New 
York, thanking him " for kind congratulations on his mar 
riage," etc., says at the end : 

" I thank you for contradicting the suggestion of my supposed 
design of residing here." 

* Stepmother of R. King. 

f Husband of Pauline, a sister of R. King. 



1 7 86] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 133 

In another letter to Mr. Gerry, June 8th, he writes : 

" With respect to myself, although Dalton writes me, that the 
suggestion has been circulated that I intend quitting Massts. 
and residing here, I am not anxious to combat the falsehood ; I 
see the approaching storm that awaits the federal Government, 
and shall be happier in private than in public life. In either I 
shall continue, affectionately yours, 

"R. KING." 

In this connection the following characteristic letters to 
his friend, E. Gerry, written from New York, interesting not 
only as showing his love for Massachusetts, but also as con 
taining his views as to the desperate condition of the Con 
federation, are given. 

RUFUS KING TO E. GERRY. 

NEW YORK, April 30, 1786. 

DEAR SIR : 

. . . What will our Essex friends say to you when you 
quit them for Middlesex ? I know not how it happens, but so it 
is, that I prefer Massachusetts to any other State, Essex to any 
other County and Newburyport to any other Town. Some part 
of this preference is just and I can account for it as a Philoso 
pher ; but why I should prefer one town to another when their 
situation may be equally pleasing and friends reside in both, I 
know not. 

We go on in Congress as when you left us. Three days since 
October only have nine States been on the Floor. Eight are now 
here, when we shall have nine is a melancholy uncertainty. I pro 
posed a few days since that Congress should resolve, that provided 
on a certain day, sufficiently distant for information to reach all 
the States in season, the States were not so represented as to give 
power to administer the Government, Congress would adjourn 
without day. Something of this kind must be done. It is a mere 
farce to remain here as we have done since last October. For 
eigners know our situation and the friends of free Governments 
through the world must regret it. 

Resolves have been passed upon Resolves and letter after 



134 RUFUS KING. [1786 

letter has been sent to the deficient States, and all without the 
desired effect. We are without money or the prospect of it in the 
Federal Treasury ; and the States, many of them, care so little 
about the Union, that they take no measures to keep a representa 
tion in Congress. The civil list begin to clamour there is not 
money to pay them : they are now unpaid for a longer period than 
since the circulation of Paper Money. The handful of troops 
over the Ohio are mutinous and desert because they are unpaid. 
The money borrowed in Europe is exhausted and this very day 
our Foreign Ministers have it not in their power to receive their 
salaries for their support. 

Where, my dear friend, will the evils consequent to this inat 
tention in the States terminate ? The people of the States do not 
know their dangerous situation ; this torpor and inactivity 
should alarm the Guardians of the People ; but indeed the Legis 
latures seem the least attentive. Pray think of our situation and 
advise me. I can open my heart with freedom to you ; you are 
now at home, and will be concerned in the Government of the 
State. Can there be no means devised whereby Massachusetts 
can yield something to the common Treasury ? Since the organi 
zation of the Board of Treasury, the State has paid nothing. We 
are told of it in Congress we justify by declaring that past exer 
tions have exhausted us ; but that we should revive, when the 
States would accede to such commercial Regulations as would 
place the American Navigation on an equal footing with that of 
Foreigners. 

This is ostensible but poor as we are I hope we could do 
more than we now accomplish indeed the State neither pays 
anything to the federal Treasury, nor supports her Delegates. 
After two or three months notice to Mr. Ivers, I drew upon him 
and he delayed the payment of my bill in such a manner that I 
was compelled to draw on my own funds to replace the money 
received for my Drafts on the Treasury. 

This personal affair is of no other importance than to show that 
everything that concerns the Union or federal affairs is postponed 
for other considerations. / can support myself and freely would 
do it, if I can serve our country. But if a dissolution must come 
and dissolve our Government will unless the several States 
immediately exert themselves in its favor it behoves every one 



1786] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 135 

to withdraw in season to effect, if possible, some sort of personal 
security. I am not prone to imagine evils, which are improbable 
on the other hand, placed in a situation in a high degree respon 
sible, ought I to be silent when my Judgment convinces me that 
the greatest Danger is near ? France has required a ratification of 
the Consular Convention we have not been so represented this 
year as to be able even to consider it. You know my disposition 
and can pity my feelings. Adieu. 

R. KING. 



R. KING TO E. GERRY. 

May 14. 
MY DEAR FRIEND : 

You must know the deranged condition of the confederacy. 
New York has granted the impost to be paid in paper money &amp; 
to be collected by officers amenable to &amp; removable by themselves 
and under regulations formed by their Legislature This grant 
you see is a mere name the consequence is, that Congress not 
having it in their power to put the impost in operation, no money 
will come into the federal Treasury. 

You may be assured that our Barbary negotiations will issue in 
a fruitless attempt for peace instead of 80,000 Dollars, it turns 
out that 200,000 Guineas will be the least sum necessary to ac 
complish this object in a proper mode. Will you tell me where 
the money can be had ? Will the merchants lend it or any part I 
of it? 

I have letters from Mr. Adams by the ships which arrived last 
week from London. The New Foundland Bill is renewed, and 
Mr. Jenkinson, who is of the ministerial party, moved and ob 
tained leave in the Commons to bring in " a Bill vesting in his 
Majesty the regulation of the intercourse between his Dominions 
&amp; the U. S. of America " this procedure demonstrates the senti 
ments of the Ministry to be against any commercial Treaty and 
I look upon the business of Mr. Adams on this subject fully 
concluded. 

An explicit refusal has been given to the demand for the sur 
render of the Posts ; and the refusal grounded on a violation of 
the treaty in America by the laws passed and existing, creating 



136 RUFUS KING. [1786 

" legal impediments to the recovery of the Debts due to the 
British creditors " the particular laws are pointed out ; and it 
pleases me to find that there is no complaint agst. any State in 
New England except Mass., and even that not founded or truly 
stated. I allude to the Resolve suspending a judgment for 
interest &amp;c. &amp;c., which I think justifiable and no violation of the 
Treaty. 

These are facts and observations which do not require my 
comment. I am mortified as a citizen of an enlightened State, by 
the publications in Boston defamatory of an order or class of men 
(lawyers) to which I myself belong. The proceedings of several 
towns in correspondence with these publications, forbode a con 
fusion which virtuous men must deprecate. To what length the 
authors of the measures intend to extend them I am unable to 
say. One inconvenience only will accrue to me in consequence 
of them. I intended to have returned home in June but as the 
Legislature will then be in session, I am doubtful of doing it, lest 
it should be supposed I have in contemplation to canvass for a 
Re-election as a delegate. 

Should I return early and resign my trust to which I have no 
manner of objection, it may be said on the other hand that this 
measure proceeded from a fear, or conviction, that I should not 
be re-elected I am a little embarrassed I assure you as my 
friend, that I shall retire the instant, I discover any of those 
legislative measures, which I think by no means improbable to 
take place the correction of abuses is wise, but an indiscriminate 
attack upon a class of men, prostrating the virtuous citizen with 
the knave, is wholly unworthy the Justice or moderation of Gov 
ernment. I have a remedy in my power. 

Adieu, my dear friend, yours affectionately, 

R. KING. 

R. KING, TO E. GERRY. 

June 1 8. 

I intended by this post to have sent you a copy of the North 
Carolina law granting the Supplementary Funds, but it is very 
voluminous &amp; the copy is not finished. I fear it will come too 
late, as I presume your session will be a short one. Connecticut 



1786] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 137 

and New Jersey have finished their sessions without attending to 
the Confederacy ; the former took into consideration the Requisi 
tion of last year, and refused compliance with it ; the latter in 
their late session did not even treat the subject with the attention 
it received in Connecticut. You, my dear friend, must know our 
situation as fully as I do, who am a daily witness of the humiliat 
ing condition of the Union. You may depend on it, that the 
Treasury now is literally without a penny : by anticipations and 
the collections from Virginia, Maryland and this State, the Board 
of Treasury have made provision for the Dutch interest which fell 
due this month. But there is no prospect of their being able to 
provide for the payments which will be due in January. The 
posts on the Ohio are not well supplied with military stores the 
Secretary at War applied a few days since for 1000 Dollars for 
the transportation of the necessary Ammunition to these Posts 
the Board of Treasury, urgent as the occasion of this application 
is allowed to be, explicitly declared their inability to make this 
pitiful advance. 

What are we to expect ? I wish I could see you for a few 
hours ; it is impolitic to write anything as information which can 
not be clearly proved, and yet you and I have been under the 
fullest conviction of the views and intentions of men, concerning 
which such clear proof did not exist be assured that your 
apprehensions of a certain influence in this State are well 
founded. Nay farther, the influence is not confined to this 
State those men who have hazarded every valuable considera 
tion in the cause of their country, and those who are willing to 
pursue their example, are now held up to the People, as their 
Enemies and not their friends every man who wishes to 
strengthen the federal Government, and confirm the Union, is 
represented as unfriendly to the Liberties of the People. 

These expressions of anxiety for the Liberties of the People, 
come not from those who have lent their Aid in the Day of Ad 
versity, but from those artful and venal miscreants, who withdrew 
themselves from their country s support, and existed her bitterest 
enemies they now successfully gratify their hatred of our Inde 
pendence by scattering Jealousies among the People. 

I am not vain enough to think my country has much interest 
in my services, but inconsiderable as they truly are, they have been 



138 RUFUS KING. [1786 

considered as inconvenient to certain views I have made it a cer 
tainty that a character in this city, which you and I never did, or 
shall confide in, has industriously communicated to a number of 
our fellow citizens, that I was in the interest of New York, and 
opposed to Massachusetts, and that I intended to leave the latter 
and become an Inhabitant of the former. So far as the effect of 
this measure is personal, I ought not to be anxious but concern 
ing the objects wished for, I am, and must be, concerned. 

The election of Delegates will have taken place before this 
reaches you, it will therefore require no apology. 

Yours affectionately, 

R. KING. 

The Legislature of Massachusetts, not doubting for a 
moment that he was still a citizen of that State, re-elected 
him in June to Congress, which fact was thus announced to 
him by his early friend Christopher Gore, from Boston, 25th 
of June, 1786: 

" The choice of delegates is concluded. The members are 
Mr. Gorham, Dr. Holten, Mr. Dane and my friend King. 
Sedgwick was not chosen, the clamor against lawyers was so 
great that they preferred Holten to him." 

Mr. Gore continues: 

" Tender bills, acts against lawyers, or more truly against law, 
now occupy the time of the H. of Reps." 



CHAPTER VIII. 

Appointment of Commissioners to decide the Contest between Massachusetts 
and New York relative to Territory claimed by both R. King among 
the Members Increasing financial Difficulties Interstate commercial 
Questions led to the Meeting at Annapolis This was a Failure, except 
to awaken Attention to serious Embarrassments, by Resolutions and an 
Address Letters from R. King respecting it Gov. Bowdoin s Commu- 
cation to the Massachusetts Legislature R. King s Address to the same 
No Action Shay s Rebellion. 

Almost from the first entrance of Mr. King into Congress 
he had been empowered by the State of Massachusetts, with 
his colleagues, to agree to the appointment of a federal 
court for the sake of determining a very important con 
tested question between Massachusetts and New York, as 
to a large portion of territory claimed by both. The 
Articles of Confederation had provided for such a court, and 
the representatives of both States had deferred the whole 
matter to Congress and judges were actually named, but 
one after another declined to serve. The controversy 
dragged on ; settlements on the disputed lands were mak 
ing ; and in the end both Massachusetts and New York by 
special acts gave full power to their agents to arrange 
among themselves, if they could and as they could, and 
finally decide this difficult controversy. This was a large 
discretion confided to the Commissioners, \vho were, on the 
part of Massachusetts, John Lowell, James Sullivan, The- 
ophilus Parsons, and Rufus King, and on the part of New 
York, James Duane, Robert R. Livingston, Robert Yates, 
John Haring, Melancton Smith, and Egbert Benson. They 
met at Hartford, Connecticut, on November 30, 1786, 

139 



140 RUFUS KING. [1786- 

and after protracted discussion and negotiation concluded 
on December i6th an agreement, which, as being final, under 
the powers conferred upon the commission between the two 
States, was submitted to Congress on October 8, 1787, 
and by them sanctioned, by a resolution revoking the 
commissions of the judges of the federal court previously 
appointed, and discontinuing all proceedings thereon. 

For some reason, however, not now very obvious, Con 
gress would not permit a copy of the agreement entered 
into by the Commissioners for the settlement of the con 
troversy to be filed in the office of the Secretary ; Massachu 
setts, Connecticut, New York, and Pennsylvania voting to 
put this paper on file, New Jersey and all the States south 
of Pennsylvania voting against it. 

Though the delegates from Massachusetts, at the seat of 
government, by not presenting the resolutions of that State 
to the Congress, had shown their conviction that the country 
was not yet ready to decide upon any change in the Articles 
of Confederation, every day s experience was proving its 
weakness and the danger to its very existence, unless some 
means of enabling Congress to enforce its decrees should be 
adopted. The want of an uniform currency, caused by the 
absence of coin, and the issuance by several of the States of 
a paper currency, without substantial basis, the consequent 
embarrassment in commercial transactions, from the uncer 
tain value of this paper, which in some States was made 
legal tender, the general danger of disrespect to the obli 
gations of contracts arising from this cause, the unwill 
ingness, for various reasons, of the States to pay the 
imposts laid upon them, the faithful and punctual payment 
of which would alone enable Congress to meet the foreign 
and domestic obligations imposed upon them, the general 
uneasiness under the restraints of law and other influences, 
were urging forward the crisis in the affairs of the nation. 

On February 15, 1786, a committee of Congress of which 
Mr. King was chairman, with Messrs Pinckney, Kean, 



1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 141 

Monroe, and Pettit as colleagues, to which " several reports 
and documents concerning the system of revenue" were 
committed, reported among other things, that : * 

" In the course of this enquiry, it most clearly appeared, that 
the requisitions of Congress for eight years past have been so 
irregular in their operation, so uncertain in their collection, and 
so evidently unproductive, that a reliance on them in future as a 
source from whence monies are to be drawn to discharge the 
engagements of the confederacy, definite as they are in time and 
amount, would be not less dishonorable to the understandings of 
those who entertain such confidence, than it would be dangerous 
to the welfare and peace of the Union ; the committee are there 
fore seriously impressed with the indispensable obligation that 
Congress are under of representing to the immediate and impar 
tial consideration of the several States the utter impossibility of 
maintaining and preserving the faith of the federal government, 
by temporary requisitions on the States, and the consequent 
necessity of an early and complete accession of all the States to 
the revenue system of the i8th of April, 1783." 

The Report, which is supposed to have been written by 
Mr. King, closes thus: 

" Thus circumstanced, after the most solemn deliberation, and 
under the fullest conviction that the public embarrassments are 
such as above represented, and that they are daily encreasing, 
the Committee are of opinion, that it has become the duty of 
Congress to declare most explicitly, that the crisis has arrived, 
when the people of these United States, by whose will, and for 
whose benefit the federal government was instituted, must decide 
whether they will support their rank as a nation, by maintaining 
the public faith at home and abroad ; or whether, for want of a 
timely exertion in establishing a general revenue, and thereby 
giving strength to the confederacy, they will hazard not only 
the existence of the union, but of those great and invaluable 
privileges for which they have so arduously and so honorably 
contended." 

* Journal of Congress, xi., 36. 



142 RUFUS KING. [1786- 

Decided as were these statements and urgent the appeal, 
the resolutions appended to the report were never called up, 
and no practical measures, though many were discussed, 
were adopted to meet the emergency, beyond a special appeal 
to New Jersey to rescind their refusal to comply with the 
last impost, which was effectual, and resolutions urging upon 
the other States to pay their quotas when New York, Dela 
ware, and Pennsylvania should repeal their restrictive acts. 

Another serious question was forcing itself upon the 
attention of the country. Commercial intercourse between 
the different States had been carried on with serious incon 
venience and under hostile legislation, and, as in the previous 
year the embarrassments of the foreign commerce had led to 
the Massachusetts resolution, so now the Legislature of 
Maryland, in the desire to arrange the interstate commerce 
with Virginia, proposed to that State to invite Commis 
sioners from all the States to meet at some central point and 
endeavor to regulate the commercial questions which were 
troubling them both, in such a manner as to benefit all. 
After much discussion, the Legislature of Virginia, many 
of whose members, Madison in particular, earnestly con 
tended for the adoption of some such measure, adopted 
the suggestion, and towards the end of January, 1786, passed 
resolutions looking to the enlargement of the powers of 
Congress to regulate trade. Commissioners were appointed, 
of whom Madison was one, to invite, through the Governors 
of the States, the selection of Commissioners from each, to 
meet at Annapolis on the first Monday of September next, 
to endeavor to settle these questions. 

To many this appeared to be an opportunity through 
which much good might be done, and several of the States 
appointed Commissioners. When the time of meeting 
arrived, it was found that only five States were represented, 
New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and 
Virginia, though Massachusetts, upon the receipt of the 
invitation from Virginia, appointed representatives, who one 
after another refused to go to the convention ; so that those 



1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 143 

who finally accepted and went forward learned that the 
convention had adjourned while they were on their way to 
Annapolis. 

It would thus appear that the conduct of the Massa 
chusetts deputation in the previous year to ask for a conven 
tion to make alterations in the Articles of Confederation, 
because they felt that such action was premature, was justi 
fied by the immediate result of this movement. Because of 
the present apathy, or, perhaps, rather fear of consequences, 
nothing could be done by the convention ; but the delegates 
assembled were not willing to separate without drawing up 
an earnest report from a committee of which John Dickinson 
was chairman. This report, which was drafted by Hamilton, 
urged upon the other States " to meet at Philadelphia on 
the second Monday of next May to consider the situation 
of the United States, and devise such further provisions as 
should appear necessary to render the Constitution of the 
federal Government adequate to the exigencies, and to re 
port to Congress such an Act, as when agreed on by them 
and confirmed by the Legislatures of every State, would 
provide for the same." 

When this report was received by Congress does not 
appear in the Journal, nor is there any evidence therein 
when the Committee appointed to consider it, which re 
ported on February 21, 1787, received their appointment; 
nor is there any evidence that the matter was discussed in 
Congress (though R. King in his address, loth October, be 
fore the General Court says it was before Congress), 
-except a letter of Mr. Ed. Carrington to Mr. Madison of the 
1 8th December, 1786, * which says : 

" The business of the Convention is well brought forward by 
Virginia, and I hope their act will be generally adopted ; the 
dereliction of Massachusetts is, however, to be apprehended ; the 
delegation of that State prevented the recommendation of the 
measure from Congress, as suggested by the deputations at An-

napolis, and advised its non-adoption in their Legislature. The 
effect of this advice, I have not been informed of, but the natural 
supposition is, that nothing was done, in the late session, and 
there will not be another before the time proposed for the con 
vention of the Deputies. The reasons given by these Gentlemen 
for their opposition are, that the mode of amending the Confedera 
tion is provided by the Act itself Amendments are to originate 
with Congress and be agreed to by the States, and that it would 
derogate from the dignity and weight of that body, to take a 
secondary position in the business. This is an elevated idea 
and, in an efficient sovereignty, would be a wise one, &amp;c." 

A letter from Mr. King to Mr. John Adams in London 
explains his views : 

NEW YORK, October 2, 1786. 
DEAR SIR : 

The convention proposed to have been held at Annapolis in 
the last month on the subject of commerce has terminated with 
out credit or prospect of having done much good. I inclose you. 
the report which they addressed to their constituents. They 
were founded in the opinion that an adjustment of the commer 
cial powers of the several States is intimately connected with 
the other authorities of the Confederacy &amp; of the respective States. 

Whether the States will accede to the proposition of a conven 
tion at Philadelphia in May, is yet uncertain. Congress, I think, 
will not interfere in such a manner as to patronize the project. I 
am fully convinced that your opinion * is a just &amp; political one, 
that Congress can do all a convention can, &amp; certainly with more 
safety to original principles. But we are now separating ; the 
federal year will expire in a few weeks, &amp; little public business will 
receive an examination before the assembling of the next Congress. 
With the highest respect &amp;c, 

RUFUS KING. 

* See letter of J. Adams, London, June 14, 1786. 

" The most alarming circumstance that has happened is the inattention to 
Congress. That seven states only should be represented for so long a time, 
when the affairs of the union were in so embarrassed and dangerous a situation 
js Proof of something so bad that I dare not name it. The proposed conven 
tion, it is to be hoped will do good ; but I know not why Congress could not 
have done as well or better." 



1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 145 

On October 2, 1786,* Governor Bowdoin announced to 
the Legislature of Massachusetts that he had received a 
letter of the I4th September from John Dickinson, Esq., 
chairman of the Commission lately assembled at Annapolis 
for the purpose of revising the commercial regulations of 
the United States, and " accompanied with a copy of their 
Report to the Legislatures of the States, by whom they 
were deputed, and it appears by it they had separated with 
out acting upon the business for which they were ap 
pointed." The Governor then recites the reasons for their 
separation without further action, their earnest conviction 
that something should be done to relieve the embarrassed 
condition of affairs, and their unanimous conviction that the 
good of the United States may be essentially advanced by 
all the States appointing Commissioners to meet in Phila 
delphia, May next." f 

He says also : " A letter from one of our delegates in 
Congress, the honourable Rufus King, dated at Phila. on 
Septr. 1 7th, relative to the same convention, is herewith 
also communicated." This letter does not appear, but prob 
ably suggested his desire to lay before the Legislature the 
views of his colleagues and himself upon the results of the 
convention, for on October ipth, the House voted "that the 
House will attend to such communications as the Hon. R. 
King may leave (sic) before them relative to public affairs 
to-morrow morning"; on which day he appeared and 
addressed them, his remarks being thus reported in the 
Boston Magazine : $ 

" That the report of the commercial convention was before 
Congress doubts had arisen as to the mode of agreeing upon 
commercial regulations. The Confederation was the act of the 
people. No part could be altered without the consent of Congress 
and confirmation of the several Legislatures. Congress ought,

therefore, to make the examination first, because if it was done by 
a convention, no Legislature could have a right to confirm it. Did 
any Legislature sit for such purpose ? No. It must be referred 
to the people ; and then what degree of assent was necessary to 
make it an article of Confederation ? Whereas if it was conducted 
agreeably to the Confederation, no such difficulty would exist. 
Besides if Congress should not agree upon a report of a Conven 
tion, the most fatal consequences might follow. Congress, there 
fore, was the proper body to propose alterations." 

Speaking further, he concluded his remarks with great 
earnestness, respecting the present condition of Massachu 
setts, * and warned of the danger of not combining in the pro 
tection of States against internal difficulties. On Nov. Qth 
Nathan Dane appeared before the General Court, f speaking 
in the same general direction, and enforcing the views of 
Mr. King. The Legislature does not appear at that time, 
to have taken any action on this matter, the Journal not 
containing any evidence of it, and thus the question 
rested. 

In the meantime very serious troubles had occurred in 
many, especially the New England, States, arising from causes 
dating back some years. The people in the interior were dis 
contented, because, in consequence of the commercial restric 
tions, they were unable to pay the taxes imposed upon them, 
by the sale of their crops and by the want of a proper circu 
lating medium ; Massachusetts, among others, refusing to 
issue paper money as many of the other States had done. The 

* Bancroft, History of Constitution, vol. ii., p. 403. A letter of D. Humphreys 
to Washington says : 

" NEW HAVEN, gth Nov., 1786. 

" In Massachusetts the assembly of that State are occupied in removing all 
the real subjects of hardship and complaint. They have likewise passed a 
new riot act and given some indications of spirit in support of Government. 
But still the preparation, and systematic arrangements on the part of the mob, 
do not cease. You will have seen by the speech of Mr. King, before that 
legislature that Congress consider themselves as the guarantors of each State 
government and bound to interfere in its support under certain circumstances." 

f Boston Magazine, 1786, pp. 439-441.

consequent desire to interfere with the integrity of contracts 
and to prevent the levying of and collecting of taxes for the 
fulfilment of the engagements of the State, caused them 
to demand relief from their troubles, at first quietly, and 
then in tumultuous assemblages to overawe the courts and 
to resist their processes, and, finally, in the western counties 
of Massachusetts to defy the authority of the State. The 
local authorities finding themselves unable to quell these 
disturbances, the Governor was called upon to interfere. 
Threats were made by the malcontents that the courts should 
not sit, and to meet this as well as other acts of resistance, 
the Governor had caused a large body of militia to assemble at 
different times to assist the sheriffs to protect the courts, and 
thus checked for the moment the outbreak planned by 
Daniel Shays, but did not stop it. On October 24th, * the 
General Court passed a resolution, expressing high satisfac 
tion in the measures taken by the Governor and communi 
cated to them by message that day, to suppress the 
outrageous proceedings in several counties of the State, and 
their firm resolution to support the constitutional authority 
and at the same time inquire into and redress all grievances ; 
that they will afford his Excellency all the aid which shall 
be incumbent on them, and confiding that he will still con 
tinue, by the powers vested in him, to enforce due obedience 
to the authority of the Governor, and especially to support 
the Supreme Judicial Court to be held in Middlesex in the 
next week. Disaffection and armed resistance continuing-,

notwithstanding the efforts that had been made to put an 
end to them, on February 3, I787,f the Governor addressed

the insurgents, their proceedings, their refusal to desist and 
accept pardon, their clear and unequivocal perseverance in 
opposition, as manifested by their proceedings since respect 
ing the judicial courts in several counties, stopping them by

armed force and compelling even well disposed persons to 
join them etc., and that the Council had unanimously advised 
that vigorous and efficient measures should be taken " to 
protect the courts, aid the civil magistrate, and apprehend 
the disturbers of the public peace." To do this he had 
called forth a respectable body of militia under Genl. 
Lincoln, with orders to carry out the above, and earnestly 
" urged prosecution of the measures for the good name of 
the commonwealth to prevent effusion of blood and the 
spread of insurrection to other commonwealths and even 
danger to the whole confederation," The next day, the 
Legislature approved the action of the Governor. On the 
5th,* however, the Senate of Massachusetts passed a resolu 
tion to request the Governor " to inform Congress of a 
rebellion existing in this commonwealth and of the means 
taken to suppress it, and in case of any unforeseen event, that 
they shall rely on the aid of the United States, agreeably to 
the Confederation." After several conferences this was 
concurred in by the House on the 8th. f 

About this time it became evident that the vigorous 
measures under General Lincoln had broken up the rebellion, 
and it does not appear on the Journal of Congress that the 
resolution was communicated to them, though on March 2d 
the Governor informed the Legislature, that he had written 
to the delegates in Congress, informing them of the rebellion, 
etc. These outbreaks in all the New England States, though 
put down by the States themselves, were sufficiently serious to 
warrant Governor Bowdoin to speak of them, as threatening 
" even danger to the Confederation," and contributed to 
press upon all the want of power in Congress to enforce 
whatever they might decree in case of^serious^rebellion.

GROSVENOR SQUARE, Jan. 22, 1786. 

SIR : 

Yesterday I was honoured with your letters of the 4th and loth 
Deer. The act of Congress respecting the British Consul 
General, is wise, and well guarded. Nevertheless I think that 
we should not be so inattentive to Etiquette, as to omit a 
Proposition for sending a Minister Plenipotentiary. We give up 
a Point, by receiving a Consul in return for a Minister, which, 
although it may appear of little consequence in America, is really 
of some weight among our own People, and of much more in 
Europe. Republicks have in all ages been quite as attentive to 
the respect due to their Ambassadors as crowned Heads. Hol 
land, Venice, and Genoa are at this day more studious of this, 
than any Kings in Europe, whose Dominions are not larger. 

The last publick Entry and audience of Ambassadors, in this 
Country, was insisted on by the Republick of Genoa, at the 
accession of his present Majesty, and I conjecture that the true 
reason, why we have no answer from Venice and Genoa is that 
they think Etiquette required that we should have sent Ministers 
to them, or at least that Congress should have written a letter to 
them, announcing their Independence and desire to live in Amity. 

I see with Pleasure, that the States are advancing towards 
unanimity, in Commercial Regulations. They may depend upon 
it, they have no other Resource, and as they will be obliged to come 

149 



150 RUFUS KING. [1786 

into it, and the sooner the better. The Stocks are mounted up, 
and Mr. Pitt is about adopting a Plan of Dr. Price, for a Sinking 
Fund. This will prove an Illusion, but its Brilliancy will dazzle 
this People. 

Your picture of the Prosperity of our Country, its Agriculture, 
and Fisheries is a charming one. The acts of Mass, for encour 
aging the Whale trade, and the alterations of their Navigation 
Act, I hope will have good effects inclosed are some letters from 
the Marquis de la Fayette, and Mr. Barrett, which I pray you to 
send to some Friend in Boston as I have not time to copy them. 
Surely we need not want a Market for Oil. Will you please to 
present my affectionate Respects to Mr. Hancock, and your other 
colleagues. I am extremely sorry that the Senate of Massachu 
setts had less magnanimity than the House. What Reasons 
they could have against the Return of the Refugees I cannot 
comprehend at home they would be impotent, abroad they are 
mischievous. The News of the vote of the House had apparently 
a happier effect here. In the Vindication of the Principles of 
Right, and of great Interests, we should be as decided as Fate ; 
but angry Passions and especially personal Resentment, we 
should sacrifice like men : great Questions should never be per 
plexed with unnecessary little ones a generous Sailor would 
never puzzle himself to save a Keg of Rum, when he ought to exert 
himself to save the ship, altho a Hingham farmer is reported to 
have once done it. 

Mr. Pitt intends to pay the Tories their losses and dismiss 
them. They will then be obliged to go to Canada, or Nova 
Scotia, unless they can return to the States, which many of them 
desire. Why we should continue them, spightful and trouble 
some, when they might be made quiet and harmless, I don t know. 

I have not received from Mr. Jay, the Commissions you, or Mr. 
Gerry mentioned, as Consul General. I wish that Congress had 
been pleased rather to have appointed Coll. Smith. However, 
when my authority arrives I shall do the best I can I promise 
myself much from your future correspondence, as I have received 
much Pleasure &amp; information from the Past.

" SIR : 

" Yours of the 4th December ult. I have received. It was the 
only one by that conveyance I got from America. The account 
you give of the situation of affairs is particularly pleasing it is 
by federal measures alone, and they must be dignified and decided, 
which can possibly place us in the eyes of Europe in that point 
of view which our Country really merits and which the malice 
and disappointed ambition of this nation has so materially inter 
fered with. We must not permit ourselves to expect any tolerable 
arrangement with this people until we give them most unequivocal 
proofs, that a connection with them is by no means necessary to 
our political existence and that we are fully competent to the 
administration of our own Governments, without leaning on British 
Systems or applying to British Councils. Never did a nation 
since the downfall of the Roman Empire, discover more self- 
sufficiency or intolerable haughtiness of soul than this. It is true 
they are great &amp; have commanded the admiration of the world ; 
who now laugh at their folly which having destroyed the main 
Pillar of that greatness, does not permit itself to recollect, that 
the aspiring mind should always accommodate itself to its par 
ticular circumstances and ability of action. They still continue 
to attempt the great career of national importance and have 
almost persuaded themselves that the Separation of America from 
this country is very immaterial to them.

Nor feel the shaft that trembles in their side ; 
They 11 neigh, until some treaty s dreadful blast

Mr. Adams letter to you and his publick one to Mr. Jay, renders 
my observations unnecessary on this subject ; and his tho

must give every necessary leading Idea. I viewed at a small 
distance the pomp and procession of the King s going to the

House of Lords. It was very magnificent and to him must have 
been distressingly solemn for notwithstanding the immense

chiming of the bells of Westminster Abbey was not as is usual 
interrupted by the shouts of the people. The Nation are at a 
stand and public bodies free from improper influences seldom 
applaud without some sufficient ostensible reason. 

" It is with particular satisfaction I observe the last paragraph of 
Mr. A. s letter to you for his favorable opinion must give satis 
faction to my friends respecting the Station of Consul General 
of this Kingdom. And if his wish can yet be complied with, I 
shall be much flattered I do not know that there are any emolu 
ments attending the station but that you know I do not care for. 
I am not the least covetous of gold nor care I who feeds upon 
my coal, but if it be a sin to covet honor, I am the most offend

and the acquirement of such knowledge as will enable me to

a particular account of his admission and recognition in the

assumed by my having compleat evidence of his being a British

MY DEAR SIR : 

Capt. Freeman late of the American Army will deliver you this 
Letter. His Father was one of those Gentlemen in Canada who 
rendered substantial Service to the Cause of the United States in 
1776, when our Army had been very unfortunate in that Country. 
He supplied some of our wounded and other officers, Prisoners, 
with necessary hard Money after the Paper Bills of Congress had 
entirely lost credit there ; so that it may be truly said of him, They 
were sick and in prison and he came unto them. 

Capt. Freeman, the Son, is going to N. York to solicit a Re 
imbursement in his Father s Behalf ; he requests me to introduce 
him to the Massachusetts Delegates, which I comply with most 
chearfully for his own Sake ; for being himself in Canada, at that 
Juncture when our Affairs appeared gloomy in the View of Per 
sons of less Ardor than he possess d, he there took an active Part

with his native Country and continued in the Army from that time 
till the End of the War. I beg you to make him known, with my 
due Regards to your honble. Colleagues and such other Members 
of Congress as you shall think proper. I am persuaded you will 
aid him in this prosecution of his affairs, so far as his Father s 
Claim shall appear to you to be reasonable. 

I am with unfeigned Esteem &amp; Respect, &amp;c.

R. KING TO J. ADAMS. 

NEW YORK, February i, 1786. 

DEAR SIR : 

Seven States only have been represented in Congress since 
October, of consequence very few questions of national impor 
tance have been under the examination of this Assembly. The 
Meetings of the Legislatures have probably detained many of the 
delegates, but it is expected that ten States will, within a short 
period be represented. There is some ground to expect that 
several of the Southern States will do what is right on the subject 
of the commercial powers of Congress. . . . New York &amp; 
Georgia are delinquent states relative to the revenue system. The 
Legislatures are both in session, and it is greatly to be desired 
that they should comply with the impost plan before they adjourn. 
Maryland will undoubtedly pass an act granting the impost con 
formable to the recommendations of Congress of the i8th of April 
1783. Their not having before passed such an act, does not evi 
dence any disinclination, because it is known to have happened 
from a mistake. 

I shall do myself the honor to write to you by a private hand, 
who leaves this City in a few weeks for London ; the conveyance 
being secure, I can then write with more freedom. Mr. Gerry is 
still here, although not in Congress ; he returns soon to Massa 
chusetts with a most amiable wife whom he has married here.

R. KING TO J. ADAMS. 

NEW YORK, February 3, 1786. 

SIR: 

Mr. Wingrove who some months since arrived here from Eng 
land with a recommendation from you to Mr. Jay, submitted to 
Congress a plan for an American commercial establishment in 
the East Indies. The project was reported to a committee of 
Congress, who were of opinion that the commercial intercourse 
between the United States and India would be more prosperous 
if left unfettered in the hands of private adventurers, than if regu 
lated by any system of a national complexion. This opinion 
received the approbation of Congress and of consequence Mr. 
Wingrove is frustrated in his project of an India Establishment. 

I am extremely sorry that Mr. Wingrove has had an expensive 
voyage without benefit and the more so as he appears to be modest 
&amp; intelligent. He has been well esteemed by several gentlemen 
of Congress to whom he has been presented, and it is with sin 
cerity that on his request I have written the foregoing. 
With great respect &amp;c,

C. GORE TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, February 5, 1786. 
MY DEAR RUFUS : 

Accept my warm acknowledgments for the communications 
you were so obliging as to make me, relative to a commercial 
intercourse between England &amp; America. This is certainly an 
interesting question to both countries. If the inhabitants of the 
two States were fully convinced of the real advantage each might 
be to the other, commercial stipulations, I presume, wou d take 
place perfectly honourable and beneficial to all parties. The 
Minister of England, who, doubtless is fearful of taking decisive 
measures on this subject, unless his countrymen were possess d 
of truer notions of the American trade, may plausibly evade the 
question by objecting to Mr. Adams want of power. 



156 RUFUS KING. [1786 

I feel convinced that the adoption of an alliance, as suggested 
in your favor of Deer. 24th might be highly injurious to Great 
Britain. But is such an alliance feasible ? The last accounts 
from Europe seem to evidence a closer connection between Eng 
land and France than was ever known before, &amp; more liberal 
regulations of commerce than the two Nations ever enjoyed ; and 
still farther to enlarge this commercial system, Mr Eden has gone 
to France. You, at the fountain head of politics very probably 
know the weight of these measures in the great scale, &amp; see them 
by no means oppos d to the intended plan between these States, 
-Spain, France, &amp; the Netherlands. 

We have a report here, my good Friend that you are going as 
Ambassador to the Hague. If promotive of your honour &amp; 
felicity, I sincerely wish it may be true ; that it would be greatly 
honourable to our Country, we are all convinced ; &amp; therefore 
as citizens of America we are anxious to hear it confirm d. . . . 

Your friend Dalton was chosen Speaker of the house of Repre 
sentatives necessary absence from Boston till i3th instant was 
given as an excuse for his non-acceptance of the chair at present. 
This the House construed as a resignation, and the pious Ward, 
of Shrewsbury, was elected Speaker for the remr. of this year &amp; 
has taken the chair accordingly. Constant Freeman, brother of 
James the Revd. &amp; late a Capt in our Artillery, will soon be in New 
York, a solicitor to Congress for payment of certain bills of ex 
change drawn or endors d by his father during the late war for 
Support of prisoners. If consistent with your ideas of propriety 
to assist him in his demand, I am confident you will do it, distinct 
from considerations of his personal worth ; tho in this view you 
may rely on him as a man of honour. . . 

Your sincere friend, 

C. GORE. 

B. LINCOLN TO R. KING. 

HINGHAM, Feby. n, 1786. 

That we are drained of our cash, that our trade is embarrassed 
and our finances deranged are truths which will not be denied. 
The moment, my dear Sir, these questions are asked, what is to 
be done under these circumstances ? How shall our trade be placed 



1786] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 157 

upon a respectable footing ? How shall the interest of each 
State be advanced, that of the United States be promoted and 
their dignity be preserved abroad ? The common answer is 
" Give Congress more power." This answer seems to have satis 
fied the greatest part of the people at a time when every one knew 
that Congress was not supported by the different States in the 
powers with which they are now vested, and when all ought to 
have considered that there was little to be expected from an 
augmentation of their powers, while there appeared such an in 
attention at least, if not an aversion, to execute the recommenda 
tions of Congress consequent on the powers delegated. 

Were the powers of Congress extended, and should that ex 
tension in any degree fall short of a coercive power, and of the 
means, uncontroulable by the United States, of carrying those 
powers into effect, we have little reason to suppose that any 
recommendations, under new and extraordinary powers, would be 
executed with more punctuality than those recommendations 
which have appeared with the strongest proofs of their utility and 
often of their absolute necessity. 

The United States, as they are called, seem to be little more 
than a name. They are not really embarked in the same bottom. 
They do not consider themselves in that light. Different interests 
have pointed them, and are now pointing them, to different courses ; 
hence instead of their giving mutual security by pursuing the same 
point, they really endanger each other by counter movements. 

The great question is now agitating, in the different States, 
whether Congress shall be vested with full and competent powers 
to regulate the trade of the United States. Some determine in 
the affirmative, while others are for limiting those powers. Each 
State which does not grant unconditional powers, makes such 
reservations as its real or imaginary interest points out ; so that,, 
by this mode of proceeding, Congress will probably be so limited, 
as that they will not have it in their power to form any decided 
plan. Besides these reservations made by the different States 
clearly evince their opinion, that general laws will not do equal 
justice to all. 

It is the language of the Massachusetts, and it seems to be her 
firm resolution, that none of her produce shall be exported in 
British bottoms. Why is Massachusetts so sanguine in this

measure ? because it is her interest to be the carriers not only of 
her own produce, but to become so for her neighbours. Her 
exports have been few compared with her imports. The carrying 
trade is therefore an object, as it will greatly aid her means of 
remittance. Massachusetts will from interest be clear in opinion, 
that Congress ought to be vested with powers to regulate the 
trade of the United States, and they will be full in sentiment 
that none of the produce of the United States ought to be carried 
out in British bottoms. 

What probably will be the language of the southern states on 
this point ? They have neither men or vessels to export their 
own produce, nor do they wish to have them, while their 
labourers are more advantageously employed, as they now really 
are, in the cultivation of Wheat, Tobacco, Rice, Indigo, &amp;c ; each 
of these makes a valuable article of exportation ; as also the naval 
Stores, Flour and Iron with which some of those states abound. 
It cannot, therefore, in their present situation be their wish to 
carry their own produce to market. Their interest rather suggests 
to them the importance of increasing the number of purchasers 
at their own market. They have felt the blessings of this policy 
too long, willingly to relinquish it. They will not, in my opinion, 
soon shut their ports against so valuable a purchaser as is the British 
merchant, and especially if the information which I have received is 
true, that the State of Virginia realized the last year two hundred 
thousand pounds by her tobacco only, by finding a market at home, 
more than she would have realized, had she sent it abroad at her 
own risk. Similar advantages have been enjoyed by other states. 

There seems to be a different interest between the states arising 
from the nature of things. We must not wonder they exist, while 
climates have an influence upon our constitutions, for by this 
influence we view things thro very different mediums and de 
termine differently upon the same information. The different 
climates from the State of New Hampshire to Georgia, yield 
different productions, which being thrown into the lap of com 
merce, become the basis on which the trade of the several states 
respectively must rest. From these causes fountains are formed 
from which streams are constantly issuing of such different and 
discordant qualities that they may not be united without produ 
cing: violent fermentations. Did the United States extend from 



1786] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 159 

East to West, instead of their extending, as they now do, from 
North to South, their union would, probably, be much more 
permanent, and they would be easier governed by the same Legis 
lative body than in their present situation. Their interests, views 
and manners would be, as are the productions of the earth, under 
the same parallel of Lat. nearly the same. 

We are told that such is the nature of the climate in the 
Southern States, that the necessary labor cannot be performed 
there, by white inhabitants, and that to import the blacks from 
Africa is a measure indispensable. While these ideas are enter 
tained by, and influence the actions of, these states, Slavery will 
be continued, and they remain, in a degree, feeble and defense 
less. We might hence suppose, that policy would suggest to 
them the propriety of their uniting firmly with the Northern 
States. But it has had quite a different operation. They seeing 
and feeling their own inability, become jealous of the other 
States. The moment it is proposed to make the Northern carriers 
for the Southern States, they startle at the idea and immediately 
paint in their own minds fleets of ships from the Northern States 
blocking up their ports. They, at least some of them, suppose 
that they have too much to fear from the enterprising spirit of the 
Northern hive, to encourage their marine by making them carriers 
for the other States. They will therefore, in my opinion, oppose 
every measure which will have a tendency to encrease our sea 
men. They may, and probably will, give other reasons for their 
opposition, while their policy will not let them utter the true ones. 

The great inequality of the present representation of the 
United States in Congress, will be a clog on all, and a total bar 
to many measures which should take place. A small proportion 
both of numbers &amp; of the wealth, now govern the whole. This, 
together with an aversion in some states, to settle and discharge 
the debts of the United States, especially the domestic, has 
alarmed many of our citizens, who have been ready to suppose 
that from these causes, the foundation of the present confedera 
tion would be sapped. These things would not have produced 
any great anxiety in my own mind, had they stood alone, &amp; un 
connected with matters and embarrassments, which arise more 
from necessity. Such I consider those evils, which are conse 
quent on the extent of the United States, their different climates, 



l6o RUFUS KING. [1786 

their different productions and the different views of the people 
in consequence thereof. I cannot believe that these States ever 
will, or ever can, be governed, and all enjoy equal advantages, by 
laws which have a general operation. Such laws must exist, or 
we must sacrifice our republican ideas, to a Union of the States. 
Were we under an absolute Monarch, he might find a remedy. 
We shall not soon, I trust, make the sad experiment ; some other 
mode of relief, more consonant to the present temper and genius 
of the people must be provided. 

If the observations I have made are just, the citizens of these 
States are deceiving themselves, in an expectation that any relief 
can, or will, be granted them by Congress, under our present 
system of government. We have not, I think, seen the true causes 
which have brought on the present distracted state of our affairs ; 
consequently we have not pointed our ideas to such measures as 
will give certain relief. As I said in the first part of this letter, 
people in general seem satisfied, that all would be right if Con 
gress were vested with more powers. I cannot think we shall 
essentially avail ourselves, were we to extend the powers of 
Congress to the utmost limits contended fcr by the most sanguine 
on that side of the question, while their doings are only recom 
mendatory in their Nature. Besides, in the discussion of every 
motion, the jarring interests of the different States must be recon 
ciled, or the question, however necessary to the general good, will 
be lost. That our interests do &amp;will clash, are troubles which will 
not be questioned. These are the necessary consequences of our 
great extent, of our difference of climate, Productions, views &amp;c. 
I do not see how we shall surmount the evils under which we now 
labor, and prevent our falling into the utmost confusion, disgrace 
&amp; ruin, but by a division, which might be formed upon such 
principles as would secure our public creditors, and thereby our 
public faith, and our after peace &amp; safety by a firm alliance be 
tween the divisions. 

Thus, my friend, I have freely given you my sentiments on our 
public affairs, your permission being first obtained. I must, as I 
wish for light, remind you of your engagement to remark upon them ; 
and that you would consider these observations as confidential. 
With great esteem &lt;S:c.

JOHN ADAMS TO R. KING. 

GROSVENOR SQUARE, Feb. 14, 1786. 
DEAR SIR : 

I have enclosed to Mr Ramsay an address to the landed, trad 
ing and funded interests of England, which contains some good 
sense, intermixed here and there with a little folly. Mr Ramsay 
will be so good as to let you read it, and in return you may let 
him read the inclosed Principle of the Commutation Act. As 
the Commerce of the United States begins to run to the East 
Indies, every thing which may affect it in that branch will be 
interesting to you. 

The revival of the Newfoundland Act which will I suppose be 
followed by that of the American Intercourse Act, will show you 
that the Ministry persevere in the system adopted at the Peace, 
yet without any decided resolution to avow it for perpetuity or 
any long duration. It is nevertheless too probable that they will 
make it perpetual the next year or the year after, if the proceed 
ings of our States do not discourage them. 

It is agreed on all hands that there is a surplus of revenue. The 
sum is not yet known, and it by no means follows that there will 
be a surplus next year. Several causes have this year co-operated 
to increase the taxes, some of which will not exist another year. 
E. G. The French Controller General, Mr De Calonne, last 
year sent seven hundred and fifty thousand Pounds to England, 
chiefly in gold, to pay for a quantity of Bullion he bought in 
Spain and Portugal to coin in France. This has set many wheels 
in Motion, and by employing many people enabled them to live 
and pay duties. Many sums of money have come too from 
America, which I presume cannot, at least I hope will not be 
sent the next. Yet there are great complaints of the scarcity of 
Money. 

The United States have nothing to do but go on with their 
Navigation Acts, their Bounties and Duties ; if these Measures 
should not induce the British Court to do as we wish, they will 
bring their own reward. It is by a sagacious use of Bounties, 
Drawbacks, Prohibitions and Duties that the Commerce of the 
British Empire has become what it is. They will have the same 
effect upon ours if imitated by us. Why should not Bounties be 



VOL. I. II 



1 62 RUFUS KING. [1786 

given upon Iron manufactured in the United States, and Duties 
laid upon all imported ? There are innumerable other articles 
which might be thus protected by Duties laid upon Importations 
and by Bounties upon the Manufacture. 

If the present Bounty on Oil is not sufficient, I hope it will be 
doubled or tripled, so as decidedly to ruin the British Fishery ; 
since they are for Tryalls of skill a Market may certainly be found 
in France, Spain and Ireland ; but if it could not, I would be for 
increasing the Bounty until we could clearly undersell the Eng 
lish in the City of London ; at the same time some measures 
should be taken to draw home our own whaling Captains and 
and Oarsmen. 

It is the opinion of the Foresighted that Grain will be in demand 
in Europe next summer, because the Crops in Poland not only 
failed the last Harvest, but what is more important, the seed time 
was so wet as to give a melancholy prospect for the next year. 
This I heard from Mr. De Buhaty the Polish Envoy, a few days 
ago. I am sir, with great regard, 

Your humble Servant, 
_______ JOHN ADAMS.

We have nine states in Congress and the only act passed since

. . . Mr. A s (Adams) letters to you render it almost un 
necessary for me to touch on political subjects. You will observe 
that in the proceedings of Parliament on Friday last, the noted 
Charles Jenkinson moved to bring in a Bill for the regulation of 
the intercourse between America &amp; this country, or rather that it 
should for one year be vested in his Majesty and Council by way 
of experiment leave was given accordingly. When this man ap 
pears at the head of a Project, America cannot be at a loss what 
to expect It will require all her fortitude and all her wisdom to 
preserve her temper and dignity for I believe they are deter 
mined on a fair experiment how far passion, prejudice &amp; folly 
can drive this devoted country without raising national resent 
ment. War and revenge is nearest the heart of the King and 
nothing but the inability of the Nation to carry it on keeps him 
from showing his colors. Adieu I am your obliged friend,

BOSTON, March 22, 1786. 
MY DEAR KING : 

. The Assembly are about rising. They have fully com- 
ply d with the Requisition, but have postponed the Supplementary 
Funds till the next session, or in other words, till the next Legis 
lature shall sit. Several Members of the Assembly have called on 
me to know whether it will be agreeable to me to attend the House 
on the subject of the postponement. It is a delicate point to urge a 
grant, after they have declined it. I have therefore determined 
not to take my seat, unless by express desire of the House ; in 
which case I shall give my opinion candidly on the subject. The 
post is going. Adieu. Yours sincerely, 

E. G. 

The Senate are very desirous to grant the Supplementary 
Funds this session, &amp; should it be postponed, I am very sure the 
Measure will be adopted by ye next Legislature.

BOSTON, April 2, 1786. 
MY DEAR KING : 

Last evening I received a letter from you inclosing a letter 
from Mr. Adams &amp; informing me, that " a few days hence would 
give you more Leisure." Those " few days " are now I presume 
past, &amp; therefore at a risque I shall venture to transmit to you 
&amp; your lovely bride my sincerest congratulations and those of 
your Friends Mrs. Gerry &amp; Miss Kitty. The former says you 
was very secret in your Negotiations, which she had full informa 
tion of by the first letter she received after her arrival here ; but 
she shall rely on your visiting her with your lovely girl, as 
soon as you conveniently can after your arrival in Massachusetts. 

Mr. Adams informed me he had inclosed two Arrets of the 
King of France respecting a 5 p cent Duty imposed on all 
foreign Fish imported into his West India Islands, and 10 p. 
cent Bounty on all Fish imported by the subjects of France 
into Spain, Portugal &amp; Italy, These Arrets he thought it would 
be necessary to publish ; but on opening my letter, I did not find 
them, and upon examining the cover I find it was not directed 
by Mr. Adams or sealed with his seal. Will you be so obliging 
as to ascertain to whom he delivered the letter, and thro whose 
hands it has since passed. . . . 

Some have asserted that you proposed to reside in New 
York, but I have authorized my Friends to say, that altho the 
pappa of your amiable Girl proposed this, you would not con 
sent to it, but were to return Home with her in the Fall. . . .

occasion is passed. 

I have but a moment to write to you indeed I have found no 
time to write to a single friend except the present, which I dedi 
cate to friendship &amp; to you ; apologize to any friend who may 
think me inattentive and uncommunicative. I will write to you 
and all my friends, when I am again master of my own Hours. 
Present me most affectionately to your Mrs. Gerry &amp; Miss Kitty. 
My Mary regrets the want of an acquaintance with a Lady who 
merits &amp; possesses my warm esteem &amp; your best affections. We 
shall be better &amp; more intimately acquainted. . . .

NEW YORK, April 9, 1786. 
MY DEAR FRIEND : 

The ceremony is passed and we are entirely happy. It is with 
the most respectful gratitude that we receive the kind congratula 
tions of your letter, and with the utmost sincerity that we hope an 
inviolable friendship between our families. Indeed unless the 
ladies produce unnecessary and extraordinary changes, this friend 
ship must subsist. Mrs. King in return joins me in best respects 
to Mrs. Gerry, and in assurances that among our first attentions 
when we arrive in Massachusetts, will be our early visit to 
Marblehead. 

I have nothing in Politicks to communicate new or unexpected. 
The Indian Treaty at the Miami has succeeded, so far as to have 
made friends of the Shawanese Tribe, and rendered security to 
the survey of the western Lands. Nine States were represented 
five or ten days, but Mr. Livcrmore is now gone &amp; we have only 
eight States and two only from New England. 

The Letter to you from Mr. Adams came under cover to me, 
the seal and Direction I believe are Col. Smith s. The Arrets to 
which you allude Mr. Adams likewise inclosed in a letter to 
me, with information that he had written that he sent them to 
you, but recollecting that they might not have come before 



1 66 RUFUS KING. [1786 

Congress, he requested me, should that be the case, to communi 
cate them, and I considered them as important. Mr. Jay is of the 
same opinion. They will be translated &amp; published. I will see 
that you have copies ; you have well recited their purport. . . . 
I thank you for contradicting the suggestion of my supposed 
Design of residing here. Adieu. 

R. KING. 



R. KING TO E. GERRY. 

April 1 6. 

I will look after the Letter of Mr. Adams relative to 
interest on British Debts and communicate his sentiments by an 
early post Indeed I now well remember the marrow of his Argu 
ment on that subject, which I never thought a good one ; because 
it was the introduction of an artificial municipal principle of Law, 
to govern in a case standing on the broad foundation of national 
Law, and which ought to be determined by the justice of its own 
circumstances. 

Mr. Adams stated to Mr. Pitt that the revolution in America 
was unlike the case of a war between two independent nations ; 
that the war was not only different but that the effects thereof 
were various. 

That the contracts between individuals of two different coun 
tries rest on different laws for their execution, from those which 
are to carry into effect contracts between subjects of one nation 
or government. The former depend on the laws of nations, the 
latter on the municipal laws of the country of which the indi 
viduals are subjects That the condition of war is contemplated 
in the former instance, but not in the latter that although in 
time of war there is a suspension of the Duty to pay the enemy 
Creditor, yet on the restoration of peace the duty returns and 
retrospects to the commencement of the war ; and the principal 
Debt and the interest ought to be paid. But in the case of a 
Division of a nation, by the laws of that country when an entire 
nation, is the Debt recoverable One of the laws of the British 
empire was and is, " that a personal right once suspended is lost 



1786] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. l6/ 

forever " : the war between G. Britain &amp; America suspended the 
several Rights of the individuals of both countries they were 
therefore according to British laws lost or destroyed. But, says 
Mr. Adams, the treaty revived them and took them at the con 
clusion of the Peace in exactly the same situation in which they 
were at the commencement of the war and excluded the period 
of the war. 

This reasoning, as I before remarked, is more artificial than solid 
in my mind. If the rights of the British creditors were extin 
guished by the war, as Mr. Adams contends, then there were not 
in America any British Debtors if so, what power have Congress 
or their ministers to assent to a Treaty which shall subject John 
&amp; James to pay sums of money to subjects of G. Britain and 
exempt Thomas &amp; Harry, who were as much bound to pay as 
John &amp; James ? 

My idea is and uniformly has been, that the exemption of the 
merchants of America from the payment of Interest depends upon 
other and more substantial principles than those alluded to by 
Mr. Adams in his conversation with Mr. Pitt. But, my dear 
friend, nothing has been agreed on between the King s ministers 
and Mr. Adams, and the probability is light that any thing will be 
concluded. Let the question be tried under the Treaty. I am 
sorry our state passed any restraining law on the subject, because 
I think no jury ought or would have given the interest. Excuse 
my hurry I write in the room with three or four chattering girls ; 
I recite opinions incorrectly from my memory, and that memory 
charged with the contents of an elaborate official letter by hearing 
it once only read. I will inquire farther I think I write from 
self-conviction, that I love &amp; esteem you and that I am affection 
ately yours 

R. KING. 

The House of Assembly of New York have agreed to an impost 
but reserve the power of making the laws for its collection 
and render the officers accountable to and removable by them 
selves. This is so great a departure from the system that it 
amounts to a denial of the Impost.

C. GORE TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, April 19, 1786. 

I most sincerely congratulate you, my dear friend, on your late 
connection with Miss Alsop. That in this new engagement you 
may meet with every bliss is my sincere &amp; ardent wish. Will you 
present my affectionate regards to Mrs. King &amp; pray her to enroll 
myself &amp; Mrs. Gore among her friends ; we shall be happy to be 
of the number. Our friend Dawes informs me you intend paying 
us a visit in June. I take it for granted Mrs. King will accompany 
you. While you stay in this town, you will oblige Mrs. G. &amp; self 
by making our house your home. We will endeavour to make 
Mrs. K s time agreeable as possible. This is a favor, my dear 
Rufus, you must permit us to insist on. All that the warmest 
friendship &amp; a sincere desire to please can do to render yours and 
the good lady s visit agreeable you may rely on. ... 

Gov. Bowdoin I believe will be fully reelected as chief magis 
trate ; &amp; Gushing probably his Lieutenant. The politics of this 
Commonwealth seem not to alter. Constant complaints are heard 
of the scarcity of Cash and poverty of trade ; but our trade I pre 
sume will decrease, &amp; being contracted within a narrower sphere 
must produce advantages to those who are concerned. Many who 
retail tape &amp; pins must, as they ought to have done years ago, 
return to labor. I probably misunderstood what you mentioned 
in a former letter relative to a connection between the United 
States and the European Continl. powers ; that such system 
might be adopted would afford me great satisfaction ; as it would 
induce G. B. to treat with us on terms of perfect reciprocity. 
However this may be, frugality and a more circumscribed trade 
are absolutely necessary to our happiness as a people. The funds 
of the continent, I am in hopes, will soon restore a permanent 
basis. New York surely will accede to the impost ; and I feel con 
fident this state will soon grant the supplementary fund. . . .

R. KING TO J. ADAMS. 

NEW YORK, May 2, 1786. 

DEAR SIR : 

Mr. Alsop of this city whom you must recollect as a delegate 
from this state to Congress in 1775 &amp; 1776, whose daughter I 
have lately married, requests me to ask your opinion " whether a 
refugee, whose estate has been confiscated here, &amp; to an amount 
exceeding that of his debts, can by the British laws, or the treaty 
of peace between Great Britain &amp; the United States of America, 
be compelled by process in the British courts, to pay a debt due 
to an American citizen antecedent to the late war ? " The 
determination of this question is of some importance to Mr. 
Alsop, &amp; indeed to many others of our countrymen. 

It has been objected against such recovery that confiscated 
estates of the refugees being by the act of confiscation liable to, 
or by subsequent laws charged with, the payment of their debts, 
in all cases where the confiscated estate equalled the amount of 
the debts of any refugee, thereby the state, to whose use the 
estates confiscated inured, took upon itself to pay the debts and 
the refugee was discharged ; and being discharged by an Ameri 
can law the treaty could not affect them, for no debt was due 
from them. 

How far these objections are founded is submitted to your 
good judgment. If the estate of a refugee escaped confiscation, 



1 7 86] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. I /I 

his American debts must be paid under the treaty. So if the 
confiscated estate is insufficient to pay the whole of his debts, 
the deficiency is in like manner recoverable. How then is it in 
the principal case ? 

Will you have the goodness to examine this question and oblige 
Mr. Alsop &amp; myself with your opinion ? 

With the highest respect I remain &amp;c. 

RUFUS KING. 



R. KING TO J. ADAMS, LONDON. 

Acknowledges the latter s letters of December 23d and 
January 22d. 

"May 4. 

". . . Long before this time, the dispatches from Mr. Jay s 
Office will have convinced you that Congress entertain the same 
sentiments which you possess on the subject of an exchange of 
Ministers between the United States &amp; Great Britain, &amp;c, &amp;c. . . . 
The court of St. James must send a Minister here of your rank 
in consequence of the proposal for that purpose, or Congres. 
must recall their Minister from London. 

" All admit the duties of his legation have been ably discharged, 
but little good is to be expected in the present disposition of the 
British Ministry from a continuation of a minister from our 
Country at close of the war, there was a general disposition to 
be intimately allied with G. B. that disposition has since changed 
&amp; in some parts does not exist. 

" What the effect of the measures, which have caused this change 
will be, the future must decide. They certainly tend to produce 
unanimity in America, which will establish our commerce &amp; 
make our country respectable. The Arrets of France on the 
Cod Fishery tend to the same purpose. America begins to 
learn that she must depend upon herself for prosperity and 
happiness. " 



\J2 RUFUS KING. [1786 

R. KING TO JOHN ADAMS. 

NEW YORK, May 5, 1786. 

SIR : 

It has undoubtedly been said in England, that the act of 
Congress of the i5th of February, relative to the federal revenues, 
is full proof that the United States are in the utmost confusion, 
&amp; that the Union is nearly dissolved. Ignorant as the people of 
England still are of the genius &amp; temper of the citizens of 
America, it will not be extraordinary that such opinions should 
be fondly embraced, when in fact the resolutions to which they 
refer to establish the justice of their conclusions, have produced 
measures the reverse of their expectations, and most salutary in 
favor of our union. If the people are truly informed of their 
situation, they will eventually accede to such measures as will 
best secure their freedom and honor. Rhode Island which had 
continued five years in opposition to the system of a general 
impost upon the terms recommended by Congress, passed an act 
agreeing to the system in consequence of the act of Congress of 
the 1 5th of February. Georgia has likewise made the grant, and 
Maryland has acceded. New York has passed an act upon the 
subject within a few days ; it has not been before Congress, but 
if I have heard it truly recited, it is imperfect. However as 
twelve States have made the grant to the acceptation of Congress, 
I think there can be little doubt, but that the next assembly of 
New York will fully accede to the system, &amp; thereby authorize 
the commencement of a plan of revenue substantial and 
productive. 

That there exists a criminal neglect of several of the states in 
their most important duties to the confederacy cannot be denied, 
I hope a reform will take place. The people generally through 
the confederacy remark that we are at a crisis. Our finances are 
not on that firm basis, which the riches of our country will 
authorize without danger to the liberties of our citizens. Our 
commerce is almost ruined, because jealousies of an unwarrant 
able nature have been disseminated through the more Southern 
States. But there is good reason to expect that our finances will 
be strengthened &amp; made certain, &amp; a proposition has originated 
in Virginia for a convention of delegates in September from the 



1786] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 173 

several states to agree on such commercial regulations as shall 
extend the American navigation &amp; promote the trade of the 
union. The most important states have already appointed dele 
gates for this purpose to assemble in Maryland ; and if anything 
can be concluded from the general reputation of the delegates 
already appointed, there is reason to hope that wisdom will 
govern their deliberations, &amp; that their result will produce an 
union of opinions on the subject of commercial regulations 
through all the states. 

The situation we are in with the Barbary powers is a great dis 
couragement to certain branches of trade. Wheat may be shipped 
from America cheaper than has been the case for many years. 
Produce of all sorts has greatly fallen in its price, but it is difficult 
to persuade our seamen to navigate unarmed vessels on those seas 
where the Barbary corsairs cruise. The consequence is, that even 
our own merchants charter foreign vessels, which are protected 
from the Barbary cruisers, to carry our produce to market. We 
are in anxious expectation of the issue of the Barbary negotia 
tions. Every one wishes the abilities of the country were more 
adequate to an effectual bribery of these powers than they are, &amp; 
my own wish always has been that the small sum dedicated for 
these negotiations had been put into abler hands than those of 
Mr. Lamb ; but I suppose a better character could not be obtained 
by the commissioners when he was authorized. 

The arrets of the French King relative to the Cod fishery, will 
materially affect our Eastern brethren. The difference of 15 
livres the quintal on the West India fish destroys all competition. 
Add this further circumstance concerning the West India trade 
from the Eastern States. You very well know that we took from 
the Islands large quantities of molasses at a very low price and 
distilled it into rum with a handsome profit. Since the war the 
French merchants and planters have gone into the business of 
distilling their molasses ; of consequence they have increased the 
price ; and so considerably as to affect the profit of our distilla 
tion. For all these disadvantages to which our commerce is 
exposed, there is a full remedy in the power of the states ; that 
remedy you have long since discovered &amp; repeatedly recom 
mended. I hope the proper measures will be agreed to ; these 
inconveniences will urge their adoption ; &amp; in this view are far

from agreeable. They will teach America what she has to learn 
that her honor, prosperity, riches &amp; glory must depend upon 
herself. 

I pray God, the day may soon arrive when all our fellow citi 
zens may see this subject in the same light that you do ; when 
this is the case, their natural good sense will dictate the necessary 
measures. 

With great respect &amp;c. 

RUFUS KING. 

R. KING TO E. GERRY. 

NEW YORK, May 6, 1786. 
DEAR GERRY : 

I now enclose you translations of the two arrets concerning the 
Cod Fishery. Fifteen livres the quintal in favor of the French 
Fish introduced into the West Indies must destroy all competi 
tion. Will you inform me what will be the operation of these 
arrets on our Fishery. These Regulations were urged by our 
friend Marbois and will give him peculiar gratification. . . . 

Although I informed you in my last that Eight States only 
were represented and it was quite uncertain when a greater num 
ber would be on the Floor, yet the fact now is, that North Caro 
lina &amp; Delaware have come on, and we number Ten States two 
only from New England and a number of visionary projects 
already introduced and proposed to be adopted by Congress. 
What we shall do, I know not this is certain that I should feel 
much happier were the New England States all represented. 

No arrivals from Europe, consequently no foreign information. 
Nothing domestic has occurred worthy of communication, 
except that the Assembly of New York this day broke up having 
granted the impost to Congress, to be collected by officers of 
their own appointment and accountable to and removable by the 
Legislature the regulations to be of their own making and the 
Duty to be paid in Paper Money, or Specie at the option of the 
persons paying the Duty. This you observe is a total deviation 
from the grants of every other State So we are where we were. 

Yrs. affectionately,

NEW YORK, June 4, 1786. 
MY DEAR FRIEND : 

I have long entertained doubts concerning the line of conduct, 
which Congress ought to pursue relative to the Territory of the 
U. S. Northwest of the Ohio, and am every day more confirmed 
* Furnished by Robt. C. Winthrop, Esq. Original in his possession.

Ij6 RUFUS KING. [1786 

in the opinion that no paper engagements, or stipulations, can be 
formed which will insure a desirable connection between the 
Atlantic States and those which will be erected to the Northwest 
ward of the Apalachian or Alleghany Mountains, provided the 
Mississippi is immediately opened. The pursuits and interests of 
the people on the two sides will be so different, and probably so 
opposite, that an entire separation must eventually ensue. This 
consequence appears to me so obvious, that I very much doubt 
whether the U. S. would ever receive a penny of revenue from 
the Inhabitants who may settle the Western Territory. Should 
there be an uninterrupted use of the Mississippi at this time by 
the citizens of the U. S, I should consider every emigrant to that 
country from the Atlantic States as forever lost to the Confederacy. 
Perhaps I am in error, but when they have no interest in an Union 
inconvenient to them in many points, I can discover no principle, 
which will attach them to such a connexion. 1 know not what 
advantages the Inhabitants of the Western Territory would 
acquire by becoming members of the Confederacy. They will 
want no protection ; their location would sufficiently secure them 
from all foreign hostility ; the exchange of Merchandize, or com 
merce, would not be across the Apalachian Mountains, but wholly 
confined to the Mississippi. If these conjectures are just, in true 
policy ought the U. S. to be very assiduous to encourage their 
citizens to become settlers of the country beyond the Apalachian ? 
The object of Congress appears hitherto to have been a sale of 
this country for the sinking of the domestic debt ; the immediate 
extinguishment of this debt is certainly a very important con 
sideration ; but it has its price. I suppose that a treaty could be 
formed between Spain &amp; the U. S. upon principles of exact reci 
procity, so that the Citizens of the latter might introduce into the 
European &amp; African dominions of the former, all sorts of goods 
&amp; merchandize upon the same terms on which the subjects of 
Spain could introduce the same articles ; and on the other hand, 
that the subjects of Spain might import into any of the U. S. all 
sorts of goods &amp; merchandize, upon the same terms, as the citi 
zens of the U. S would introduce the same. 

I suppose farther, that the Treaty should stipulate that all the 
Masts, Spars, Timber &amp;c. &amp;c. wanted for the national marine of 
Spain should be purchased and paid for in the U. S. with specie, 



1786] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 177 

provided the quality of the materials equalled that of the same 
articles in other countries. I suppose yet farther that the Philip 
pine Islands be opened to the American ships and in consequence 
the gold and silver of Acapulco placed within their reach. Add 
to the foregoing an article, not to relinquish the right to the 
free navigation of the Mississippi, but "stipulating that the U. S. 
should forbear to use the navigation of the Mississippi for 20 or 25 
years." Would not such a treaty be of vast importance to the 
Atlantic States, particularly to the Western division of them ? 
Would not the Fish, Flour and other products of the U. S. acquire 
thereby a manifest superiority in Spain over similar commodities 
of any other country ? Would not the conventional forbearance 
of the use of the Mississippi implicate most strongly the right of 
the U. S. independent of the Convention or Treaty ? If these 
queries are answered in the affirmative, what objection is there on 
the part of the U. S. to conclude such a Treaty ? This question 
brings into view the plan of extinguishing the domestic debt by 
the Sale of the Western Territory, the system whereby it is pro 
posed to govern the people, who shall settle Westward of the 
Apalachian Mountains, within the U. S., and the ability of the 
U. S. at this time to contend with Spain in vindicating their right 
to the free use and navigation of the Mississippi. I am very 
sensible that the popular opinion throughout the U. S. is in favor 
of the free navigation of the Mississippi, and the reasons must be 
strong and important, which could be offered to oppose this 
opinion. I am also pretty well satisfied that the free navigation 
of that River will some day be of vast importance to the inhabi 
tants within the Territories of the U. S.; yet admitting, what will 
not be denied, that Spain will on no condition agree that any 
people, except those of our Nation, shall navigate the Mississippi, 
are the U. S. in a condition to assert their right ? If you answer 
this question as I should, (believing as I do that a war with Spain, 
France, or England would terminate in the loss of the Fisheries, 
and the restriction of boundaries, perhaps by the Kennebeck on 
one part and the Apalachian Mountains on the other) is there any 
substantial objection against an Article in a Treaty with Spain 
relative to the Mississippi such as is alluded to ? It is a consent 
to what we cannot alter, considering other benefits to be obtained. 
It must be wisdom then to consent. 



VOL. I. 12 



RUFUS KING. [1786 



But how will this article affect the sale of the Western Terri 
tory ? The answer which the delegates of Virginia (all of whom 
are probably deeply interested in the Ohio and Kentucky lands) 
would give is, that the value of the country west of the Alle- 
ghany Mountains depends in a high degree upon the opening 
of the Mississippi. Admit the fact ; it is desired that the U. S. 
should under these circumstances open that River to their naviga 
tion. If so the value placed upon these lands which depends 
upon the opening of the Mississippi, is an ideal value, at this 
time. With those therefore who do not wish to involve the U. S. 
in a war against policy and sound reason, this objection is of little 
consequence. The lands perhaps will not produce so much 
under the present circumstances of the Mississippi, as they would 
if the river was open. But to all persons desirous of becoming 
settlers, they will sell for a reasonable price and go a good way in 
extinguishing the domestic debt. But how will such an article 
affect the intercourse between the inhabitants of the Western 
Territory and those of the Atlantic States ? In my judgment, 
very favorably. If the former are cut off for a time from any 
connections, except with the old States, across the mountains, I 
should not despair that a Government might be instituted so con 
necting them with the Atlantic States, as would be highly benefi 
cial to them both &amp; promise a considerable trade. 

My dear friend, after all, these are but speculative opinions, 
and I am very doubtful of them, when a variety of influential 
motives, which seem to promise well for my country, authorizes 
my assent. I alluded to this subject in my last letter to you ; I 
wish for your counsel ; I wish the New England States were here. 
I pray you to read these remarks with candor, and in confidence. 
If I had taken time and care to have expressed my sentiments on 
this subject, I would have requested you to have communicated 
this paper to your friend Gov. Bowdoin, and prayed through you 
his advice. I shall be brought to a decision on this question. 
Congress must determine. If Spain don t conclude a Treaty 
with the U. S., I think they will endeavour to guard against the 
Evils they fear from us, by an intimate connexion with Great 
Britain. I am of a committee now in conference with the Secretary 
of Foreign Affairs on this subject. Spain should form a treaty 
with us, in preference to any other nation, and there is no nation 



1786] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 179 

with whom the U. S. could form more beneficial treaties than 
with Spain and Portugal. Spain will not give up the Mississippi. 
But I will not add, I write in great haste and in full confidence. 
If you are at Boston and can consult Mr. Bowdoin, I should 
thank you to do it. I intended to have written to him relative to 
the Barbary treaties, but have not been able to find time.

Possibly an attempt will be made in the General Court to issue 
Bills of credit. Indeed I am told that this measure will have 
many advocates and that some persons are confident of its suc 
cess. You know the Paper Money of Pennsylvania has been for 
some time in good credit but within a few days it has depre 
ciated from 15 or 20 per cent. This Depreciation has taken 
place since the issuing of Paper in the State of New Jersey.

has emitted paper in such paper as may be current in the State in 
which the Creditor is an Inhabitant. The New Jersey paper will 
certainly depreciate.

The lawless, and probably unjust, conduct of the inhabitants 
of Kentucky towards the Indians bordering on the western side 
of the Ohio has lately occasioned the loss of a number of valu 
able lives on the frontiers of Virginia nothing yet exhibited has 
proved to my mind any association of Tribes against the people 
on this side of the Ohio ; but the murders which have un 
fortunately happened have been perpetrated by a few vagrant 
Indians, who are without a name or tribe. 

The Govr. &amp; delegates of Virginia clamour for war against the 
Indian town and have brought the business before Congress we 
are without nine states and the question cannot be examined. I 
am decidedly against any such war, as I at present understand 
the situation and state of the affair. I suppose you are now at the 
General Court ; Sedgwick joined us a few days since. He re 
quests me to inform you that he had signified to Mr. Bacon &amp; 
some other gentlemen of the House of Representatives that he 
could not serve as a Delegate after November, and therefore 
proposed not to be considered as a Candidate. Since we find 
how the Senate was filled he prays that it may not be considered 
that he has withdrawn himself as a candidate for the next year s 
Delegation, lest it would be supposed that he withdrew from an 
apprehension of a Defeat in the election, grounded on his profes 
sional character. I have discharged my engagement by having 
made the foregoing communication. 

With respect to myself, although Dalton writes me, that the

suggestion has been circulated that I intend quitting Massa., re 
siding here, I am not anxious to combat the falsehood. I see the 
approaching storm that awaits the federal Government, and shall 
be happier in private than in public life. In either I shall con 
tinue affectionately yours,

I am sorry to see any mention made in Mr. Bowdoin s speech of 
the payment over from the Treasurer to the War Office of a sum 
of old emission money to complete the payment of Requisitions 
made antecedent to the Act of Cong, of the 18 of March 1780 
for making the same. If the measure was accomplished, it was 
sufficient ; there existed no necessity for telling all the world of 
it ; we shall hear of it in Congress. 

Another mistake (unfortunate just at this moment) is com 
mitted by the Govr. ; he says that Mass, did not grant to Cong. 
the power to levy the impost ; but agreed to levy it themselves, 
and grant the product now this is a misrepresentation examine 
the Act and you will find that it grants to Congress " the power to 
levy &amp;c " with certain provisos. New York have done just what 
Gov. Bowdoin says Mass, did ; and for that, among other reasons, 
but principally for that Reason, Congress cannot accept their 
grant.

J. ADAMS TO R. KING. 

LONDON, June 14, 1786. 
DEAR SIR : 

Yesterday arrived by the Post, your Favours of the 2, 4 &amp; 5 of 
May. 

Every day will furnish America with fresh Proofs, of the fal 
lacious nature of all her hopes of Prosperity, Grandeur, and 
Glory, from the friendly disposition of foreign Powers. What- 



1 82 RUFUS KING. [1786 



ever assistance she may ever derive from any of them must be 
purchased at a greater Price than it will be worth. Reverence 
thyself is a Precept of private morality, but it is equally applic 
able and equally necessary to States and Individuals. Know 
thyself is another of as much importance to both. Our Country 
is yet more deficient in the latter than in the former. 

Credit has been the Inlet to most of the Luxury &amp; Folly which 
has yet infected our People. He who could devise a method to 
abolish it forever, would deserve a Statue to his Memory. 

Agriculture, Manufactures and Commerce with one another, 
would soon make it flourish. 

The want of Concert &amp; the want of Confidence in each other, 
and the trifling with public Faith, have emboldened our Rivals, 
which are all Europe, and have let loose the Barbarians ; 
and altogether have already not only ruined our Navigation 
and Commerce, but reduced the Price of our Produce. This 
last will be soon felt, and will arouse the Planters &amp; Farmers. 
But it will fall much lower, if our Navigation is not attended 
to ; if we depend upon foreign ships, it will dwindle to almost 
nothing." 

The most alarming Circumstance that has happened is the In 
attention to Congress. That seven States only should be repre 
sented for so long a time, when the affairs of the Union were in 
so embarrassed and dangerous a situation is Proof of something 
so bad that I dare not name it. 

The proposed Convention, it is to be hoped will do good : 
but I know not why Congress could not have done as well or 
better. 

The Barbary Powers will not be appeased for less than two or 
three hundred Thousand Pounds. Congress have such sums to 
pay in Europe in 1787, that I know not how they will obtain 
the money. I Lay on Duties to pay the Interest, and it may easily 
be obtained by Loans, but not otherwise. Mr. Lamb was sent 
by us to Africa, because he was sent by Congress to us. We 
could easily have found better Men. But it will be in vain to 
send any body, until he is provided with money sufficient. We 
must not call it Bribery. We should learn to talk of it, as other 
nations do, as Gratuity, Generosity, Magnificence, Friendship, 
Custom, &amp; all that ; if we fight them, we shall only increase their 



1786] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 183 

demands, and be obliged to pay them as much more as will make 
up all the Damage we do them. 

All Nations are contriving to take advantage of us and make 
Profit &amp; Power out of us, and if Planters &amp; Merchants, North 
and South, do not unite in measures of Defence, we shall 
find ourselves a Prey. The Agriculture of the Country will 
feel the Ruin, when it comes to their turn, as severely as the 
Merchants. 

Immense Quantities of Grain have been sent from England, 
to Bordeaux and Marseilles this Spring. This demand ought to 
have been supplied from America. Why was it not ? Because of 
the difficulty of freight. 

Mr. Jay mentions a letter of the ist of May. This I have not 
received it contains perhaps the Sense of Congress, concerning 
the Exchange of Ministers. I shall punctually obey my orders. 
Untill every Law of the States is repealed, whether respecting 
Debts or Tories, which is inconsistent with the Treaty ; Untill 
the Frontier Posts shall be surrendered to us &amp; the Negroes paid 
for ; untill all the States shall have firmly established a System of 
National Revenue, and taken a decided Resolution in favor of 
their own Navigation by a peace with the Barbary Powers, as well 
as giving a clear encouragement to their own ships beyond all 
others, my situation here will be so unpleasant, that I shall con 
stantly wish to be at home. 

To be obliged to embark with my Family in any miserable 
Merchant Ship or accidental Packet, in the dead of Winter, 
would be very disagreeable ; but if orders should arrive so that I 
could embark in Season in the Fall, or if they should be delayed 
till Spring, they would relieve me from a heavy Load. 

The poor Prisoners at Algiers, the old Debtors in all the 
States, the Suitors for Vessels captured after the Armistice, all 
the Merchants in America, and all the Farmers, are now, or will 
soon be looking to me for Relief from their distresses, when I 
I know I can do them no service, and all their hopes must 
depend upon the Measures taken by Congress and their own 
Legislatures. 

I see that Pains are taken in the American Newspapers to 
hold up to the People hopes and expectations of a change of 
Counsels here ; nothing can be more impolitic, fallacious and 



1 84 RUFUS KING. [1786 

abusive. The eyes of the People ought to be undeceived and 
opened upon their true situation and real danger. 

My affectionate Respects to Mr. Alsop, and to your Lady if 
you please. With great Esteem, Your most obedient humble 
Servant, 

JOHN ADAMS. 



J. ADAMS TO R. KING. 

LONDON, June 14, 1786. 

DEAR SIR : 

I had heard some time ago, of your marriage with the amiable 
Daughter of my old Friend Mr. Alsop, as well as that of Mr. 
Gerry, and of both with the more pleasure, probably as a good 
Work of the same kind for connecting Massachusetts and New 
York in the Bands of Love was going on here. Last Sunday 
under the Right Reverend Sanction of the Archbishop of Canter 
bury and the Bishop of St. Asaph were married Mr. Smith and 
Miss Adams. It will be unnatural if federal Purposes are not 
answered by all these Intermarriages. 

In answer to Mr. Alsop s Question, I have no difficulty in 
answering, that by Law and Treaty, a Refugee ought to be com- 
pellable by Process in the British Courts to pay a debt due to an 
American Citizen, antecedent to the late war, and this without 
Regard to or Enquiry concerning his Estate or his other Debts 
in America. A great Cry and Uproar nevertheless would no 
doubt in such case be excited, and the Courts would probably 
suspend and prolong the Process. There will never be an end 
of Questions and Chicane, until the States repeal all the Laws 
which impede the Recovery of old Debts in America. 

I perceive that according to the Ideas of some, I am sent here 
to make a new Treaty of Peace, the old one not being agreeable 
to some Gentlemen who were in debt before the War. This I 
shall never be able to do. The Treaty as it was was too generally 
condemned here as too beneficial to us, and the least mention of 
it sets too great Multitudes in a flame for Ministers to touch it. 
The ablest Minister this Nation has living, and the Man of the 
most Influence fell a Sacrifice to it, and it became immediately an 



1786] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 185 

object of so much Delicacy, that the utmost exertions of your 
Ministers, as Mr. Jay and Dr. Franklin very well know, could not 
obtain in nine months the alteration of a word of it in the defini 
tive Treaty. It is not likely then that the present young Minister 
will venture on so hazardous a step. 

The affair of Interest generally I suppose depended upon the 
Usage and the Understanding of the Parties. But neither 
Custom nor the Understanding of the Parties ever comprehended 
the Case that has happened. It never was supposed that England 
would throw us out of their Protection, and make it not only 
criminal but impossible to trade with her subjects and pay their 
Demands. And therefore a Jury I think will not give the Interest, 
during the War. 

But a Jury is the only Tribunal to which an appeal may be 
made, consistently with the Treaty. 

We shall talk forever in vain, My Friend, about the Dignity 
of our Country, and Federal Systems, if the Feelings of our 
Countrymen are not more sensibly affected at the sound of those 
Sacred Words, " Public Faith." If the Faith of the Nation can 
not be depended on, like the Laws of Nature it will never be 
respected nor confided in at home nor abroad. If the People 
cannot be convinced of the indispensable Importance and Neces 
sity of this Principle, all must be given up to the Guidance of 
Chance and Accident, factious rage, insidious selfishness and 
delirious enthusiasm. 

With much Esteem, Dear Sir, I have the Honour to be, Your 
most obedient and most humble servant, 

JOHN ADAMS.

on the part of the American Ministers to obtain a relaxation of 
this Regulation, and permission to import into that Kingdom the

" The letters from Mr. A. &amp; Mr. F. of Apl. 23 are most explicit 
that nothing is to be expected from the disposition of the Court 
of London. The language there is, why should we form a com 
mercial Treaty, when we at present pocket all the advantages of 
the American Commerce without a Treaty?"

What effects will flow from the Grant of the supplementary 
Funds for Massachusetts at present is doubtful indeed the value 
of the domestic Debt becomes more and more uncertain. The 
Advocates for a payment of this Debt upon what they call prin 
ciples of Justice as applied to the purchasers or speculators are 
not confined to Massachusetts. The officers of the late Army 
have most of them sold their certificates, and are now clamorous 
against their redemption except at a depreciated amount. 

Mr. Osgood is decided in his Opinion, that the best mode of 
conducting this Business, will be an apportionment of the whole 
Domestic Debt upon the States or in other words for Congress to 
make a requisition for the whole Principal of the Domestic Debt, 
&amp; leave it to the States to arrange the payment with their citizens 
as they may please. 

Adieu. Yours, 

R. KING. 

I have inquired of Mr. Thompson if he could give any informa 
tion relative to the failure of letters &amp;c he says that a letter from 
him covering one to Mrs. Gerry from her Brother in the East 
Indies has miscarried. I cannot account for it unless the failure 
is in the Post Office. Seymour has always delivered the letters 
from you and I believe has been faithful. The letters from Mr. 
Thompson I have always covered and sent them safe to the P.

of the propriety of the proposed measure with as much justice as 
you who are on the spot, and know the temper of the People. 

But I had concluded the distance of the Day of the next meet

The paper money of Rhode Island will have destroyed itself

R. KING TO J. ADAMS IN LONDON. 

NEW YORK, October 3d, 1786. 
DEAR SIR : 

You will undoubtedly hear much of the tumultuous &amp; irregular 
conduct of a considerably numerous class of people in the western 
counties of Massachusetts. The same temper which appears to 
have collected these illegal assemblies in Massachusetts, has shown 
itself in New Hampshire, but Gen. Sullivan, who is now President 
of that state, by very proper &amp; decisive measures has put an end 
to these unjustifiable proceedings in that country. Perhaps in 
Massachusetts, considering the prostrate condition of our com 
merce, the government have pressed the subject of taxes, of the 
direct kind^ beyond what prudence would authorize. The amount 
of them laid on the citizens of that state in one form or another, 
and for the purposes of the union, the state, and the counties &amp; 
towns, including the support of the clergy &amp; the town schools, 
in the course of the year 1786, will not be less than the sum of 
one million and a half of dollars. The whole of this sum, except 
ing about $250,000 or $300,000, which are raised by imposts or 
excises, must be raised from the people by an immediate and direct 
apportionment upon the polls and estates of the inhabitants. Per 
haps this apportionment may be nearly equal to one third part of 
the rents, or incomes of the estates of all the inhabitants. 

The operation of these heavy taxes, in connexion with the pres 
sure of the creditors upon their debtors for their private demands 
has occasioned an opposition to the judicial courts in the counties 
of Middlesex, Bristol, Worcester, Hampshire &amp; Berkshire ; and 
the opposition has been so considerable, that in some of these 
counties, the lower court has been obliged to adjourn without doing 



1786] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 191 

any business. The General Court are now sitting, and without 
doubt they will pursue such measures as shall redress all the real 
grievances of the people, and establish the honor &amp; energy of 
our government. 

You will see this business greatly magnified and tories may 
rejoice, but all will be well. 

With sincere respect &amp;c., 

RUFUS KING. 

R. KING TO E. GERRY. 

NEW YORK, Oct. igth, 1786. 
DEAR GERRY : 

I mentioned to you my apprehension of a very dangerous and 
extensive Indian war. On my return here I found my fears but 
too well founded ; Georgia &amp; Virginia are in arms. The protec 
tion of the citizens of the states bordering on the Ohio is required 
of Congress. You know that we have entertained well founded 
expectations of discharging a large portion of the federal domestic 
Debt by the sales of the Western Lands ; the Indians now appear 
to have united to oppose the survey and settlement of that coun 
try. This combination is most unjust since we have fairly and 
bona fide extinguished their claims. The monies expended in 
Treaties with, and presents to, these very Indians, since the year 
1775, will exceed a hundred thousand specie Dollars. This is too 
much to lose. To do ourselves justice and protect the frontiers 
together with the surveys of the Indian cessions, Congress this 
day resolved to augment the federal troops to a legionary corps 
to consist of two thousand men : the cavalry amounting to one 
hundred and twenty men are quotaed on Maryland &amp; Virginia, the 
infantry &amp; artillery are quotaed upon the four Eastern States, 
viz : New Hampshire 260 

Massa. 660 

R. Island 120 

Connt. 180 

1 220. 

The troops now in service are from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, 
New York and Connecticut. When these men were raised, our 
Legislature not being called on for any part of them, passed an 



RUFUS KING. [1786 



instruction to their Delegates, that in case any more men should 
be required, the Legislature would choose to furnish their quota. 
We therefore met the wishes of Congress in agreeing that our 
quota of the troops now required should stand so large a propor 
tion of the whole number. The act is not quite completed ; I 
hope it will be forwarded on Saturday or Monday. But you must 
impress upon the minds of our monied friends the indispensable 
necessity of a loan of monies upon an engagement of Congress of a 
reimbursement from existing requisition, or some other funds. 

R. KING. 



R. KING to J. ADAMS. 

NEW YORK, November i, 1786. 
DEAR SIR : 

I do myself the honor of introducing to your civilities Dr. Pro 
vost, chaplain to Congress &amp; rector of the Episcopal Church in 
this city. The Dr. goes to England for consecration as a Bishop. 
His very amiable private character, his exemplary conduct in his 
profession, &amp; his firm attachment to the freedom &amp; happiness of 
mankind have very justly endeared him to his friends and country 
men. 

It would afford me the highest honor &amp; pleasure, if this letter 
should prove a motive of the kindest attentions from you &amp; your 
good family in his favor. In addition to the pleasure you must 
receive from an acquaintance with this most excellent man, you 
will thereby acquire the most certain information relative to the 
present and past condition of our country.

R. KING TO E. GERRY. 

NEW YORK, Nov. 5th, 1786. 
MY DEAR FRIEND : 

We are encouraged in our Hopes &amp; Wishes for the Safety and 
honor of the commonwealth by the Papers &amp; Letters which the 
last Post brought us. Persevere and you will establish the 
authority of Government. While I reverence the principles of 



1786] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 193 

Justice, and earnestly desire that the Constitution and Laws may 
be superior to all opposition, I feel compassion for those igno 
rant and misguided men, who have thoughtlessly joined in 
measures unauthorized by their sober Reflection. You have sup 
posed that no men of consideration have been united with the 
leaders of the Insurgents. It has been taken for granted that no 
external council or aid has been, or would be, afforded them. 

But be assured, that neither you nor I comprehend the combi 
nation, which these insurgents may in possible Events be able to 
form. Let them shew their condition &amp; numbers, and advance a 
little farther in open resistance of the Government, and a scene 
will then present itself of far more importance than has yet been 
conjectured. 

There will not be wanting leaders of name and consideration 
to conduct them. We all have our preferences and aversions, 
and perhaps in general they are both alike unfounded. I con 
fess, however, that with the single exception of one French 
nobleman, I have always been more willing to confide in the 
citizens of our Country, novel as their employments have been, 
than in the most plausible, or experienced, Foreigners who have 
been among us. Although in some instances we may have 
received benefits from Foreigners in the public service, yet I have 
rejoiced when the obligation has been discharged and they have 
quitted America. 

Some Adventurers yet remain ; they have their Rendezvous 
and their Leader.* Concerning his merits and pretensions, even 
you &amp; I my Friend, have held different opinions. I know that 
he was a Soldier of Fortune and a mercenary in Europe ; and 
notwithstanding his affected Philanthropy and artificial Gen 
tleness, I hold his character the same in America : the only dif 
ference is this ; in Europe he received little money, and less 
Flattery. In America, the Sovereign of it, having added bounty 
to the exact Justice and possessed him of real monies exceeding 
in amount the life aggregate of the Revenues of a prince of the 
German Empire, he has, from this circumstance of preference and 
from the adulation of sycophants, been buoyed up to the pre-

posterous Belief, that his military Talents are superior to those of 
any Soldier in America. " Alieni appetens, sui profusus " was 
the character of the man who plotted the destruction of Rome ; 
the same Dispositions and the like desperate Fortune mark 
the man who openly justifies the Conduct of the Insurgents, 
and who will head them, if their cause prospers. I inclose you 
his performance of the ist instant, under the signature of 
" JBellisartus" These opinions are his hourly conversation. Fare 
well Remember that the times are critical and that I write in

"ANECDOTE OF THE BARON DE STEUBEN. 

" Previously to the Departure of Baron de Steuben from Paris 
to America the Comte de Maurepas, who was then of the ad 
ministration of Versailles, informed the Baron that the situation 
of America rendered that country a proper theatre for men of 
military Genius &amp; Talents, that they would receive Honor and 
acquire Glory that the courts of Madrid &amp; Versailles would 
unite in giving countenance to such characters wh. shd. serve in 
America &amp;c. &amp;c. In consequence of this information the Baron 
came to America. He considered himself as under the patronage 
of the French Court, conferred with the Chevalier de Luzerne 
while minister from Versailles in America induced that minister 
to write to some of the French Ministry after the Death of 
Maurepas, representing his Expectations &amp; Dependence on their 
patronage. After the conclusion of the American War, altho 
the Baron reed, the full emoluments of an American Officer who 
served through the whole contest, the Baron addressed a memorial 
to the Comte de Vergennes, or some other minister of the King 
of France, stating the conversation which passed between Comte 
de Maurepas &amp; him, his reliance upon the assurances of that 
minister, his conduct in consequence, &amp;c, &amp;c, and claiming a 
recompense such as a command in the French Army, or a 
Government placing his services on a footing with Rocham-

beau s. The memorial was not answered, or if answered, it was 
unsatisfactory. Hence the Baron is rancorous against France." 
This anecdote was related to me by Genl. Knox on the 23d 
Dec. 1786. The Genl. added that the Baron himself gave him 
the information which forms the substance of the anecdote.

". . . The legislature easily and readily complied with the 
requisition of Congress for 660 men and the only difficulty will 
be, in obtaining money for the enlistment. You well know the 
poverty of Mass. Treasury &amp; the little confidence placed in 
Govt. by men of property but, even these inconveniences may 
be remedied, if the Govt. will only show a disposition to be 
honest, &amp; the general good becomes the object of a few, who 
might be leading men, in the house of Representatives. But a 
tender law, an act of suspending all legal processes, are not only 
winked at, but even supported by some political wise-acres, who 
wish and are weak enough to think, by sacrificing private con 
tracts, they may support public debts. They have gone further

this occasion offer d their opinion that such acts wou d be con 
formable to the treaty of peace with Great Britain. However the

opposers against all invasions of our constitutional rights. Shays 
has order d the people to be in readiness to defend their persons 
and property agt. the oppressive Acts of the Genl. Court ; but 
this notwithstanding, &amp; altho his orders are in writing, a stupid 
languor or disgraceful fear possesses the minds and marks the 
doings of the house of representatives. They dare not accede to 
the address to the people, the outlines of which you see in the 
public prints. Perhaps they may do better, and I hope in God 
they will. We really had a respectable militia at Cambridge con

CAMBRIDGE, 29 Novr., 1786. 
MY DEAR FRIEND : 

I am favoured with yours of the ipth, &amp; yesterday the Legis 
lature voted to comply with the Requisition. Some however of 
the country members laugh and say the Indian war is only a 
political one to obtain a standing Army. 

I have lately received information which I wish you would 
communicate to Mr. Jay, Mr. Osgood &amp; such other (the fewer 
the better) of our confidential Friends as you may think proper 
to mature a plan for fully investigating the matter. It is this, 
that there has been lately &amp; is soon to be again, at Vermont a 
meeting of a number of persons for the purpose of reuniting the 
American States to the Government of Great Britain. The 
Gentleman, who communicated this to me, has been heretofore 
attached to the British Government, and was apply d to by a 
person in the secret of the mal-contents ; but having a large 
property in our Funds is deeply interested in supporting the 
Government. He would not mention the name of his Friend in 
the secret, but says he was not at the meeting and gave Informa 
tion that Colonel F tch of W ndh m in Connecticut was at 
the meeting. This man was notoriously opposed to the Revolu 
tion and has great influence ; and by keeping a spy on him, per

official Information, that money was necessary for secret services, 
&amp; to hint the matter obscurely, he could procure Emissaries to 
blow up the plot. I will endeavour to get further information 
from my Informant ; but he says he will not discover his Friend, 
let the Consequence be as it will. 

The Superior Court are to meet at this place the 3ist, &amp; this

Rebellion was at an end Letters from Col. Smith and J. Adams From 
R. King and others on the Affairs of the Country. 

The Congress, which should have assembled in November, 
1786, was without a quorum until February 2, 1787, when a 
chairman was elected, but no business of any moment was 
transacted before the igth of that month. It cannot be 
doubted, however, that the momentous question of the in 
creasing and inherent weakness of the Confederation com 
manded the attention and received the earnest thoughts of 
those who were called upon to meet the emergency. The 
grand committee of one from each State, which had been 
appointed (when, does not clearly appear), of which Mr. 
Dane was chairman, must have diligently canvassed the 
opinions of their colleagues and of the representatives from 
the different States, of whom Mr. Madison was one and held 
a prominent position. General Hamilton, too, the advocate 
of a strong government, and who had drafted the address of 
the Annapolis Convention, was on hand to enforce his views, 
and without doubt had great influence in changing, it may 
be, the convictions of others. Public opinion in Massachu 
setts must also have become more decided in favor of action 
in reference to strengthening the powers of the Confedera- 

199

tion, an influence felt by her Representatives in Congress, 
though the latter acted before the determination of the 
General Court reached them, as we shall see farther on. 

It cannot be doubted that Mr. King, who was then living 
in New York, though a delegate to the Congress from Mas 
sachusetts, was aware of the appointment, on February 18, 
1787, of the committee of the House of Representatives, on 
motion of Mr. Gerry, calling upon the Governor to send to 
them his message of October 2, 1786, and the letter of the 
convention at Annapolis, and of the sentiments of its members 
and the probable outcome of their deliberations. He had 
viewed with distrust and disapprobation the plan suggested 
by the report of the Annapolis Convention, because he con 
sidered that measures of relief should come from Congress, 
as the Articles of Confederation required, and it is said that 
through his opposition the Congress, which expired in No 
vember, 1786, had allowed the appeal made in the address 
to remain unacted upon. 

That his anxiety as to the consequences of the pending 
measure was not removed, the following letter to Mr. Gerry * 
will show : 

N. Y., Jany. 7, 1787. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

Congress is not yet organized, and it is uncertain when it will 
be ; the anxiety and dissatisfaction still continues, which has for 
some time existed, concerning the government of these States. 
God only knows what will prove the issue. It is most certain 
that things will not long continue in their present condition, if 
foreseeing the dangers which hang over us, we do not unite in 
measures calculated to establish public happiness ; I am confident 
that no man will be able to bear up against calamitous events, 
which will otherwise force themselves into existence. 

You have seen the Virginia law for the appointment of dele 
gates to a Convention in Philadelphia in May ; Gen. Washington, 
Mr. Wythe, Randolph, Madison and others are appointed for this 
convention. Pennsylvania has appointed Mifflin, the two Morris, 
* Austin, Life of Gerry, vol. ii., p. 3. 



1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 2OI 

Fitzsimmons and three others on the part of that State ; Hamilton, 
who is a member of the assembly of this State, will exert himself 
to induce them to send members ; Jay and others are opposed to 
the measure, not alone because it is unauthorized, but from an 
opinion that the result will prove inefficacious. 

General Washington will not attend, although there will be at 
the same time and place a general meeting of deputies from all 
the State Societies of the Cincinnati. If Massachusetts should 
send deputies for God s sake be careful who are the men ; the 
times are becoming critical : a movement of this nature ought to 
be carefully observed by every member of the Community. 

I beg you to be assured of the constant friendship of 

Yours sincerely, 

RUFUS KING. 

Again he writes to Mr. Gerry * : 

NEW YORK, Feb. n, 1787. 
MY DEAR FRIEND : 

I congratulate you on the favourable situation of the govern 
ment in the western counties ; Lincoln has undoubtedly answered 
the most sanguine expectations of his friends, and indeed, I con 
fess, has accomplished by the aid of warrants, what I did not 
apprehend could be effected in that cautious manner of pro 
ceeding. 

The declaration of the existence of a rebellion will do great 
honour to the government, constitution and Massachusetts. I can 
already mark good consequences in the opinions, which it author 
izes relative to our vigour and spirit. I feel myself a much more 
important man than I was in the humility of a few days past. 

I hope the most extensive and minute attention will now be 
paid to the eradicating of every seed of insurgency : remember 
however that punishment to be efficacious should not be exten 
sive ; a few and those of the most consequence should be the 
victims of law. Do you attend the Legislature ? How will they 
stand on the plan of a convention at Philadelphia ? For a num 
ber of reasons, although my sentiments are the same as to the 
legality of this measure, I think we ought not to oppose, but to co- 
* Austin s Life of Gerry, vol. ii., p. 7. 



202 RUFUS KING. [1787 

incide with this project. Let the appointment be numerous, and 
if possible let the men have a good knowledge of the constitutions 
and various interests of the several states, and of the good and bad 
qualities of the confederation. 

Events are hurrying to a crisis ; prudent and sagacious men 
should be ready to seize the most favourable circumstances to 
establish a more permanent and vigorous government. I hope 
you will be at leisure to attend the convention. Madison is here. 
I presume he will be preparing himself for the convention ; you 
know he is a delegate from Virginia ; he professes great expecta 
tion as to the good effects of the measure. 

Farewell, 

R. KING. 

The following letter to Mr. Gerry, of February 18, 1787, 
shows the state of his mind, and prepares us for his action a 
few days later : 

" All the States south of this have appointed to the convention* 
but the commissions, or authorities seem to be different. I say 
have appointed ; Five of them have appointed, and the other un 
doubtedly will appoint. 

" I will not venture a conjecture relative to the policy of this 
measure in Mass. The thing is so problematical, that I confess 
I am at some loss. I am rather inclined to the measure from an 
Idea of prudence, or for the purpose of watching, than from an 
expectation that much Good will come from it," 

Changes in the views of public men had certainly taken 
place, and the opinions of the delegates to Congress, as in 
succession they reached New York, showed that the States 
they represented were more disposed to adopt positive 
measures to give to Congress larger powers. Mr. King, 
therefore, could not fail, through his intercourse with the 
delegates and others, and with his usual clearsightedness, to 
see the drift of opinion and prepare to act accordingly. He 
must have conferred with his colleague, Mr. Dane, when the 
latter was preparing his report of the grand Committee. It

has also been said that General Hamilton observed to a 
friend, " I have revolutionized his [King s] mind." How 
ever this may be, the fact is evident the crisis had arrived, 
and, taking advantage of what seemed to be the present 
opinions, he introduced the resolution giving Congress the 
initiative in calling the convention for the following May, 
which was carried unanimously, and authorizing the conven 
tion " to revise the articles of confederation," reporting their 
action to Congress and the Legislatures, subject to their 
ratification and adoption, so as " to render the federal con 
stitution adequate to the exigencies of the government and 
the preservation of the union," thus giving an authoritative 
sanction to the action proposed. 

The proceedings of Congress in reference to this matter 
are here given : 

" As before stated a grand Committee * of one from each State 
of which Mr. Dane was chairman reported to Congress on Feby. 
2ist, 1787, a resolution,! that Congress having had under con 
sideration the letter of John Dickinson Esq. chairman of the 
Commissioners assembled at Annapolis during the last year, also 
the proceedings of the said Commissioners and intirely coinciding 
with them, as to the inefficiency of the federal government, and 
the necessity of devising such farther provisions as shall render 
the same adequate to the exigencies of the Union, do strongly 
recommend to the different Legislatures to send forward delegates 
to meet the proposed Convention on the 2d Monday in May next, 
in the City of Phila. " 

The delegates from New York laid before the Congress 
instructions they had received, and asked the postponement 
of the consideration of the report to take up a proposition 
they offered, recommending the assembling of a convention 
of representatives from the several States, etc. (not mention 
ing the "proposed convention"). This being negatived, 

* There is no record when this committee was appointed. 
f Mr. Bancroft says by a majority of one in the committee. The report is 
found in the Journal of Congress, 1787, p. 15. 



2O4 RUFUS KING. [1787 

the delegates from Massachusetts moved to propose the 
further consideration of the report, in order to take into 
consideration a motion which they read in place ; this being 
agreed to, the motion of the delegates from Massachusetts 
was taken up, and, being amended, was agreed to as follows : 

"Whereas there is provision in the articles of confederation 
and perpetual union, for making alterations therein, by the assent 
of Congress, and of the Legislatures of the several States ; and 
whereas experience hath evinced, that there are defects in the 
present confederation, as a mean to remedy which, several of the 
States, and particularly New York, by express instructions to their 
delegates in Congress, have suggested a convention for the pur 
poses expressed in the following resolution ; and such convention 
appearing to be the most probable mean of establishing in these 
States a firm national Government, 

" Resolved that in the opinion of Congress, it is expedient, that 
on the second Monday in May next, a convention of delegates, 
who shall have been appointed by the several states, be held in 
Philadelphia, for the sole and express purpose of revising the 
articles of confederation, and reporting to Congress and the 
several legislatures, such alterations and provisions therein, as 
shall when agreed to in Congress, and confirmed by the States, 
render the federal Constitution adequate to the exigencies of 
government, and the preservation of the Union." 

Thus was authority given for the assembling of the great 
convention, which resulted so differently from what was then 
anticipated, and which gave us a Constitution that made 
this country a nation. 

As we have spoken of the action of the Legislature of 
Massachusetts beginning on February 8, 1787, it is right to 
present here the details of it. 

In the Journal of the House of Representatives of Massa 
chusetts, 1787, February 8th, p. 396, we find this entry: 

" Mr. Gerry was charged with a message to request the Hon. 
Senate to send down the Govr s Message of 26. Oct. last, and the 



1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 2O5 

letter of the Convention held at Annapolis accompanying ; which 
were brought down accordingly. Read &amp; thereupon ordered 
that Mr. Gerry, Mr. Gorham, Mr. Davis, Mr. Fisher, Mr. Kilham 
with such as the Hon. Senate may join, be a committee to consider 
the same &amp; report." 



On February iQth Governor Bowdoin sent a message to 
the Legislature, stating that he had received two letters from 
Governor Randolph, of Virginia, of the 1st and 6th of Octo 
ber, informing him that the Legislature had passed an act 
to appoint delegates to the convention proposed to be held 
in Philadelphia on the 2d of May next, to revise the federal 
Constitution ; and " by the last Post," one from Governor 
Caswell, of North Carolina, enclosing an act of the Legisla 
ture appointing deputies ; " the two Governors warmly 
recommend co-operation on the part of this State." 

With this the Governor sends the commissioners report 
and his message of the 2d of October upon the subject. 

On February 22d, before they had information of the 
action of Congress on the 2ist, the committee on the pro 
ceedings at Annapolis made their report, which was sent to 
the Senate for concurrence, and on the same day the Senate 
" ordered that the choice of delegates to meet in convention 
at Phila., agreeably to a resolve of this day, originate in 
either house to be sent to the other for concurrence." On 
the next, after some discussion as to the mode of choice, the 
two Houses concurred. 

On March 2d* the Governor informed the Legislature that 
he had written to the delegates in Congress informing of 
the rebellion, and requesting Congress to take steps to 
secure the arsenal at Springfield, that State troops might be 
employed elsewhere ; and had an answer that the Secretary 
of War had ordered troops from Connecticut to protect 
Springfield, and that " he had authority to direct those 
raised in Massachusetts to take part at the same place, and 
that he should direct them so to do, as soon as Mass, made 

* Journal of the House of Representatives of Massachusetts, 1787, p. 468. 



206 RUFUS KING. [1787 

such provision on the credit of the Union, as will enable 
him to effect the measure." 

He also informs them that he has received a resolution of 
Congress of February 2 1st, expressing an opinion that it is 
expedient to hold a convention of delegates from the several 
States at Philadelphia " for the sole &amp; express purpose of 
revising the articles of confederation," etc., etc. 

The Senate and House met on March 3d, and chose the 
Honorables Francis Dana, Elbridge Gerry, Nathaniel Gor- 
ham, Rufus King, and Caleb Strong as delegates to the 
convention.* 

Governor Bowdoin, in his message to the Legislature of 
Massachusetts, of March 2d, had stated that he had com 
municated to the delegates in Congress the existence of the 
rebellion in that State, and calling upon that body to take 
steps to secure the arsenal at Springfield. In connection 
with this, it appears that on February 19, 1787, a committee, 
of which Mr. Pinckney was chairman and Messrs. Madison, 
King, Johnson, and Bingham were members, reported that 
the present circumstances of the United States made it 
prudent to postpone the giving of orders to suspend future 
enlistment of troops. Mr. Pinckney moved to amend this 
by directing the Secretary of War to suspend future enlist 
ments, because of the embarrassed condition of the finances 
of Congress and other reasons, supporting the same with a 
speech, " arguing that he had reason to suppose the insur 
rection in Massachusetts, the real though not ostensible f 
object of this measure, to be already crushed." \ 

Mr. King made a moving appeal to the feelings of Con 
gress, reminding them that the real object in voting the 
troops was to countenance the exertions of the govern-

ment of Massachusetts*; that the silent co-operation of 
these military preparations under the orders of Congress 
had had a great and double effect in animating the govern 
ment and awing the insurgents ; that he hoped the great 
success of the former had given a deadly blow to the 
disturbances, yet that it would be premature, whilst a doubt 
could exist as to the critical fact, to withdraw the co-operat 
ing influence of the federal measures. He particularly and 
pathetically entreated Congress to consider that it was in 
agitation, and probably could be determined by the Legis 
lature of Massachusetts, not only to bring to due punish 
ment the more active and leading offenders, but to disarm 
and disfranchise, for a limited time, the great body of 
them ; that for the policy of this measure he would not 
undertake to vouch, being sensible that there were great 
and illustrious examples against it ; that his confidence, 
however, in the prudence of that government, would not 
permit him to call their determinations into question ; that 
what the effect of those rigors might be, it was impossible 
to foresee. He dwelt much on the sympathy which they 
probably would excite in behalf of the stigmatized party ; 
scarce a man was without a father, a brother, a friend in the 
mass of the people; adding that as a caution against con 
tingencies it was the purpose of the State to raise and 
station a small military force in the most suspected districts, 
and that forty thousand pounds, to be drawn from their 
import on trade, had been appropriated accordingly ; that 
under these circumstances a new crisis, more solemn than 
the late one, might be brought on, and therefore to stop the 
federal enlistments, and thereby withdraw the aid which had 
been held out, would give the greatest alarm imaginable to 
the government and its friends, as it would look like a dis 
approbation and desertion of them ; and if viewed in that 
light by the disaffected, might rekindle the insurrection.

He took notice of the possibility to which every State in 
the Union was exposed of being visited with similar calami 
ties ; in which event they would all be suing for support in 
the same strain now used by the delegates of Massachusetts ; 
that the indulgence now requested in behalf of that State 
might be granted without the least inconvenience to the 
United States, as their enlistments, without any counter 
manding orders, would not go on whilst those of the State 
were in competition ; it being natural for men to prefer the 
latter service, in which they would stay at home, and be 
sure of their pay, to the former, in which they might, with 
little prospect of it, be sent to the Ohio to fight the Indians. 
He concluded with the most earnest entreaties, and the 
fullest confidence, that Congress would not at so critical a 
moment, and without any necessity whatever, agree to the 
motion, assuring them that in three or four weeks, possibly 
in less time, he might himself be a friend to it, and would 
promote it. 

Mr. Madison, in view of the yet existing condition of 
affairs in Massachusetts, and of the consideration due to 
the wishes of that State as judged of by what is said by her 
representatives, advised the suspension of any action at 
present, and Mr. Pinckney s motion fell. 

On the 2Qth March Mr. King stated that the state of 
things in Massachusetts was at present such that no opposi 
tion would now be made, and a committee was appointed 
to report a measure for stopping enlistments.

" DEAR SIR : 

"... A convention is in contemplation, and I am glad to 
find your name among those of its intended members. To me 
the policy of such a convention appears questionable ; their 
authority is to be derived from acts of the State Legislatures. 
Are the State Legislatures authorized, either by themselves or 
others, to alter constitutions ? I think not ; . . . perhaps it

is intended that this convention shall not ordain but only 
recommend ; if so there is danger that their recommendations 
will produce endless discussions, perhaps jealousies and party 
heats. 

" Would it not be better for Congress plainly and in strong 
terms to declare that the present Federal Government is inade 
quate to the purposes for which it was instituted, . . . but 
that in their opinion it would be expedient for the people of the 
States without delay to appoint State Conventions (in the way 
they choose their general assemblies) with the sole and express 
power of appointing deputies to a general Convention, who, or 
the majority of whom, should take into consideration the Articles 
of the Confederation, and make such alterations &amp;c. . . . No 
alterations in the government should I think be made, nor if

the last peaceable mode of essaying the practicability of the 
present form, without a greater lapse of time than the exigency 
of our affairs will admit. In strict propriety, a Convention so 
holden may not be legal ; Congress, however, may give a colour 
ing by recommendation which would fit it more to the taste, 
without proceeding to a definition of its powers : this, however 
constitutionally it might be done, would not in my opinion be 
expedient ; for delicacy on the one hand, and jealousy on the 
other, would produce a mere nihil. . . .

COL. W. SMITH, LONDON, TO R. KING. 

" January 25. 

"... I wish to consider every man in public service as my 
friend &amp; Brother, engaged in the service of, and anxious for, 
the honor and prosperity of our Country, and as such to be free 
in communication and candid in construction. We have an 
immense theatre before us, and a greater spur to virtuous 
action and dignified establishment than any people who have 
preceded us. We have the example of ages to profit by, and pos 
terity will not excuse us, if we cramp them with partial establish 
ments and confined systems. The disturbances in Massachusetts 
have given me great pain ; but I still hope that they will not pro 
ceed to extremities, but that the good sense of the People at large, 
will revolt at the absurdities of their factious leaders and not slight 
the blessings of liberty, which are within their grasp and secured 
by past exertions. 

" Your observations on the Commotions gave us great hopes, that 
they would soon be banished &amp; we are sorry to hear they still 
exist in the smallest degree. I cannot help laying a great deal of 
it at the door of the cabinet of this Kingdom. Their restrictions 
on our Commerce, their encroachments on our territory, &amp; the 
detention of the posts contrary to treaty are the foundations of 
the partial inconveniences which we at present experience ; but

must, I think, finally operate to their particular disadvantage, 
more especially, if France pursues the enlarged system she at 
present seems attached to. The Assembly of Notables is to sit at 
Versailles on the 29th inst., &amp; many People promise themselves 
great good from the meetings; the ostensible objects are to 
lessen the burthens of the people, to introduce a Provincial ad 
ministration in the finances of the kingdom, to alienate some 
Church &amp; Royal lands, and to enlarge the Commerce of the 
Kingdom, by freeing it from those restraints under which it 
has laboured for several centuries ; &amp; of course to lessen the 
abilities of the Farmers General to monopolize &amp; oppress. 

" If the King adheres to these points, and does not, as in the 
reign of Louis the i3th, make use of the Assembly as a sanction 
of farther oppression, he will immortalize his name, take rank 
of every European Nation &amp; in a few years rival England as 
much in Manufactures &amp; Commerce as she now excels her in the 
depth &amp; wisdom of her politics. Should this be the case, our 
Country will be benefitted but ought to be doubly on her guard 
against the fetters which European policy, has been a longtime 
preparing to put on her. If we can free ourselves from the tor 
ture of internal Commotion, and make respectable domestic 
arrangements, we may smile at the arts of France and despise the 
malice of Britain. 

" I observe in a speech which you made to the General Court of 
Massachusetts, you say that Congress have not yet made any 
arrangements relative to interest during the war, you will find in 
a letter which I addressed to Mr. Jay from Bath on the 3rd inst. 
something on the subject, viz : the Gentleman, who signed the 
treaty, had not an Idea that the Article on the subject was cal 
culated or intended to embrace it this he assured me in a con

communicating it confident if thus explained, it would ease 
many minds in the Southern, Middle, &amp; Eastern districts. You

my marriage,* and be assured that I am not only happy in it, but 
happy to have it in my power to return the congratulations. It

Mr. Adams solicits in his letter to Congress of the 24th inst. It 
is needless for me to say I should esteem myself much com 
plimented by it. Do let me put your friendship to the stretch on

NEW YORK, gth February, 1787. 

DEAR SIR : 

By Captain Boudinot, who sailed in January, I wrote to Col. 
Smith informing him particularly of the situation of our public 
affairs. Since that time Congress has been organized, &amp; General 
St. Clair of Pennsylvania placed in the seat of President. Nine 
States have not yet been represented, &amp; of consequence few 
measures of importance have even been debated in this assembly. 
Your communication of the favorable disposition of Portugal, &amp; 
particularly the directions of that court to the commander of a 
small Portuguese Squadron to extend their protection to the ships 
of our country against the Barbary Corsairs, have induced Con 
gress to write a letter to the Queen, acknowledging their gratitude 
on this occasion, which letter is, or will be, transmitted to you 
with directions that Col. Smith should repair to Portugal and 
deliver the same at Lisbon. I hoped when I wrote Col. Smith by 
Captain Boudinot, that my next to either of you would have been 
explicit concerning the insurgency in Massachusetts. I enclose 
for your information a letter from a Mr. Dwight, a man of educa 
tion &amp; talents who is an inhabitant of Springfield, which I have 
received by the last post. The letter may be relied on, and is

the latest information we are in possession of. I send the original 
not having time to copy. . . . 

With invariable respect, &amp;c. 

RUFUS KING. 

R. KING TO J. ADAMS. 

NEW YORK, 10 February, 1787. 
DEAR SIR : 

Letters are this moment received from Genl. Lincoln giving 
the pleasing intelligence that he dispersed the party under Shays 
on the morning of the 5th Instant. The insurgents had marched 
on the 4th from Pelham to Petersham, distant thirty miles, with 
about fifteen hundred men. Genl. Lincoln moved after them at 
8 o clock on the same evening, and came on them by surprise at 9 
o clock the next morning ; they fled in all directions : one hun 
dred and fifty were made prisoners. Shays escaped into New 
Hempshire &amp; his men are wholly dispersed. 

Genl. Lincoln marched on the 6th with a respectable force into 
the county of Berkshire where it is said there is a body of insur 
gents. The dissolution of the assemblage under Shays will prob 
ably discourage his partizans in Berkshire. The leaders, I think, 
will be easily taken, unless they fly. 

What will give you much satisfaction is the declaration made 
by the Legislature that rebellion exists in the Commonwealth. 
You know the energy and authority of the supreme executive in 
consequence of this declaration. The General Court met on 
Saturday the 3d instant, received the address of the Governor, 
which I inclose, &amp; on Monday the 4th (5th) approved the meas 
ures which he had adopted, declared that a rebellion existed in 
the Commonwealth, and requested him to adopt the most vigor 
ous measures for the suppression thereof. ... i/ 

Your obedient servant, 

RUFUS KING. 



JAMES SULLIVAN, BOSTON, TO R. KING. 

Feby. 25. 

One letter by each post is too much, but I wish you to read this. 

The Senate on Friday last sent down a resolve that the choice 

of delegates to the proposed Convention might be originated in 



214 RUFUS KING. [1787 



either house, and be concurred in by the other. The House of 
R. non-concurred. The point is yet in litigation five are to be 
chosen : who they will be is very uncertain. Dana and Gerry 
are on near all the lists, you are on many, Higginson &amp; Lowell on 
some, Gorham on some : he objects to all Lawyers, others object 
to members of Congress ; the merchants say it is all a matter of 
Commerce, and merchants are the men. I have the honor to be 
mentioned, but I shall not be chosen and should not go, if I was. 
The choice will be this week. 

The G. C. sitting today the danger the state is in claims truly 
time for exertion. The more they do the more the danger 
encreases. The business of to-day is to determine whether the 
Sup. J. Court shall go up to Berkshire to string up some of the 
Rebels in the rear of the army. This measure G. L. presses 
vehemently, but the judges do not love to go. By letters last 
night from the General who has 300 men with him, the Rebels 
are in York State at Black Creek and White Creek about 300 
strong, threatening blood and slaughter on the friends to Govern 
ment in Berke. as soon as the forces shall be withdrawn. The 
people in the State are exceedingly soured. Boston has its usual 
prudence. Every countryman who comes in and offers to apolo 
gize for his son or Brother deluded, is railed at and called a Rebel. 

The General Court goes on with remarkable and astonishing 
unanimity, as there is no opposition it would be a wonder if the 
Constitution was strictly adhered to and yet the critical situation 
of the Commonwealth requires circumspection in order that good 
men may not be made enemies to Government : the powers of 
Government are so united in the metropolis that (it) is dangerous 
even to be silent ; a man is accused of rebellion if he does not 
loudly approve every measure as prudent, necessary, wise and 
Constitutional. God knows where all will lead ; I have no ma 
terials to calculate from ; have little to do with politics &amp; mind 
my own business. 

You may depend upon my taking the same care of your fees as 
of my own : our report is in the hand of a Committee. Oliver 
Phelps, I hear, opposes it as giving N. Y. land they had no right 
to, but I believe it is generally approved. There is no money in 
the Treasury. Root drew on Lowell and I for ^23 : we are as 
yet unable to procure it. 



1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 21 5 

The people think the disqualifying Act &amp;c. to be measures to 
keep in office those who are now in ; the effect will be known in 
the Spring. 

Farewell &amp; believe me to be your sincere Friend, 

JAMES SULLIVAN. 



R. KING TO E. GERRY. 

Feby 18. 

I am extremely pleased with the proceedings of the General 
Court ; they will procure them Honor wherever they are known. 
be assured the late Exertions of the Commonwealth are viewed 
in a very respectable light. I have some doubt about the policy 
of your Bill disqualifying certain Descriptions of Citizens : 
However I am not so competent a Judge as they are who have 
decided in favor of the measure. I hope it will effect the ob 
jects, and operate in the manner expected. We have heard 
nothing from Lincoln since he went into Berkshire. If Patter 
son s conduct is well understood, he is extremely reprehensible, 
and I hope will meet his due reward. 

We have nine States represented, and if I can form an opinion 
from so short an acquaintance with this new Assembly, I should 
not lament if their year was nearer its expiration than it is. I 
promise myself no good from their continuing together. I fear 
Pennsylvania &amp; Jersey will be entirely under a Southern In 
fluence if so, I can conceive of no mischief to public Credit, 
in the settlement of accounts, and in the just claim of the States, 
which may not be apprehended. 

All the States south of this have appointed to the Convention, 
but the commissions, or authorities, seem to be different. I say, 
have appointed. Five of them have appointed, and the other 
three undoubtedly will appoint. 

I will not venture a conjecture relative to the policy of the 
measure in Mass. ; the thing is so" problematical, that I confess I 
am at some loss. I am rather inclined to the measure from an 
Idea of prudence, or for the purpose of watching, than from an 
expectation that much Good will flow from it. 

Farewell, 

R. KING.

of this business, and its importance. The agents must attend to 
it. Wilson is here for this with other business. I have not the

done. 

" Two letters from Osgood to you came to hand the day you 
left us. I knew the character, and supposing, as in fact was the 
case, that they might be on the subject of his appointment, I 
opened them, found his objections to the extract of the bonds 
and procured an explanatory Resolve, that places the business in 
the train that corresponds with my own opinion. I inclosed the 
Resolve to Mr. Osgood last post, &amp; hope it will be satisfactory. 
The situation of the Treasury requires his immediate attendance, 
provided he accepts. . . . The General Court I suppose has 
risen before this day. I hope they have done what was necessary 
relative to the letter of the Delegates, and also touching the object 
of a Western cession. New York have added our little friend, 
Mrs. Laurence s husband and two other gentlemen, who I am 
told are in the stile of Judge Platt, to their Delegation in Con

R. KING TO E. GERRY. 

" March. 25. 

" My opinion relative to our friend in the Treasury Board was 
well founded, there is no possibility of a vacancy there, &amp; at 
present I see nothing sufficiently valuable to mention to you. 
Congress have it in contemplation, or more accurately speaking, 
many Gentlemen appear to be impressed with the propriety of a 
project to establish a board with very extensive powers finally to 
settle the accounts between the States. Should the States unite 
in this measure, the characters will necessarily be of the first rank 
&amp; consequence ; and I am confident that you would be thought 
of, provided you could be obtained. 

" Some time since Congress determined to erect a Board, but as 
the powers did not exceed those which the late commissioners 
possessed, the plan has been objected to, and is now under con 
sideration with a view of establishing something, which will be 
more decisive and expeditious. I am persuaded that on this, and 
every other subject, in which you can have any interest, you will 
not doubt the sincerity of my disposition to unite with your 
wishes, and to exert myself for their accomplishment. I there 
fore intreat you to suggest to me any Ideas which you may enter 
tain on this subject, at the same time assuring you, that you can do 
it with all the confidence of the most inviolable Friendship. . . . 

" You informed me some time since of the unfortunate situation 
of Mr. Dana, pray tell me, is he in a way of a complete recovery? 
I think the misfortune is not only a severe private one, but a real 
and important cause of public concern. Will Mr. Strong attend 
the Convention ; if Mr. Dana does not, who will be appointed in 
his place ? How goes Electioneering ? Hancock has written a 
letter to Knox informing him that he shall be here shortly and 
requests him to procure him Lodgings. What is the meaning of 
this movement ?"

My fears relative to the administration of our dear Massachu

R. KING TO TH. PARSONS. 

April 8. 
DR. SIR : 

I intended to have requested at an earlier day that you would 
not connect me in the purchase of the land lottery tickets as we 
proposed when at Hartford. If you have not already purchased, 
I desire that you would omit it. I wish it was in my power to 
say that the affairs of the Union bore a more favorable appear 
ance than when I saw you last ; but the contrary is the fact. 
What the Convention may do at Philadelphia is very doubtful. 
There are many well disposed men from the southern states, 
who will attend the Convention ; but the projects are so various, 
and all so short of the best, that my fears are by no means in 
ferior to my Hopes on this subject. 

With the highest respect and most sincere Esteem I am Dr. 

Sir your obt. &amp; very h.ble serv. 

RUFUS KING. 

R. KING TO E. GERRY. 

April 9. 

Congress this day resolved to disband all the Troops raised in 
pursuance of the resolutions of October last, except two com 
panies of Artillery to be formed from the Recruits of Massachu 
setts &amp; marched to Springfield for the protection of the federal 
magazine at that Place. 

I have entertained many doubts relative to the policy of this 
measure considering the situation of Massachusetts and the con 
dition of the confederacy. Our State voted agt. the measure, 
but we were almost singular. 

I am extremely mortified with the Disappointments which this 
arrangement will produce with the worthy Gentlemen who have 
laid aside other concerns and engaged as Officers in this corps. 

Farewell, 
R. KING. 

R. KING TO E. GERRY. 

{Confidential?) 

N. YORK, nth Apl., 1787. 
MY DR. SIR : 

I informed you some time since that the injurious Influence 
of 1783 would be again experienced by the present Congress. It 



1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 2 19 

appears to me most evidently that every State south of this is 
decidedly under this influence. Rhode Island at present repre 
sented by Genl. Varnum &amp; a Mr. Arnold will desert that wise 
policy which has been so often and so successfully opposed to 
political vice and Degeneracy, and will unite in measures foreign 
to the true Interests of the Union &amp; nearly allied to corruption. 

A question was yesterday moved to adjourn Congress on the 
last Friday of this month to meet at Philadelphia on the first 
Monday in June. Six States south of this are represented I 
moved to strike out the place of meeting and called the yeas and 
nays on the words standing ; to my astonishment Rhode Island 
voted that they shd. stand, and the six States south of this joined 
in the vote of Rhode Island. From this vote it was clear that 
there were seven States in favor of adjourning to Philadelphia. 
We postponed the Question in right of Massachusetts until this 
Day, and successfully employed the interim in detaching for 
the present one of the R. Island Delegates from his Vote of 
yesterday. 

The subject was therefore farther postponed by order of the 
house ; I fear Rhode Island will yet vote for this pernicious 
measure, or that on the arrival of Maryland it will be carried. 
We have a public Letter from Mr. Adams soliciting leave to 
come home ; I think he will return in the Spring of 1788, when 
his Commission will expire. In a private Letter to the Dele 
gates of Mass., he desires them to promote his recall, as he de 
clares he will return at the expiration of his Commission. 

Farewell, 

R. KING. 



CHAPTER XII. 

Letters to R. King during the Convention in May 1787, from Mr. Dane, 
Genl. Knox, I. Sullivan, T, Sedgwick, C. Gore, expressing their Views 
as to the Outcome of the Convention. 

N. DANE, N. Y. TO R. KING (PROBL. PHILA.). 

May 31. 
DEAR SIR : 

I had the pleasure of receiving yours of the 27th inst. two days 
since. I shall be happy in conveying to you any information I 
may obtain deserving your attention. Since Mr. Gorham went 
from this place, I have heard nothing of considerable importance. 
I yesterday received a letter from our friend Tho. Dwight, who 
sends his respects to you : he seems to have many apprehensions 
yet respecting the mischief the rebels may do, and fears as to the 
measures the General Court n^iy adopt. He mentions that 
General Lincoln passed thro Springfield the 26th inst. on his 
way from Berkshire to Boston ; and that he informed Mr. 
Dwight that the rebels in Vermont had lately taken up a Doctr. 
Pomroy of Warwick in the County of Hampshire, and another 
person, whom they detain as prisoners and are determined to 
execute if executions take place on the part of the Government, 
&amp;c. There are only five States represented in Congress I hear 
that Clark is chosen a member of the Convention if so, I think 
we cannot expect N. Jersey, at present, to attend Congress very 
steadily. I have heard nothing of Dr. Holten I have therefore 
suggested to the Governor that I shall conceive it proper for me, 
in a few days to return to Massa. &amp;c. unless I hear of Dr. Holten s 
recovering his health, and that he will probably soon attend Con 
gress. I need not mention to you how disagreeable this apa- 

220 



1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 221 

thetic mode of doing business in Congress is ; it seems to me 
to make the Government appear more feeble than it even is, &amp; to 
have pernicious effect on the public mind &amp; feelings. 

If I return to Massa. I will inform you and make any arrange 
ments you may think proper about keeping up the Delegation. 
If I go I shall not probably be in Boston till after the Delegates 
may be appointed. 

With sincere esteem &amp; respect your friend &amp; hum. servt. 

N. DANE. 



COL. WADSWORTH TO R. KING, PHILA. 

HARTFORD, June 3, 1787. 
DEAR SIR : 

Yours of the 24th ulto. came to hand after our delegates had 
set out. I am satisfied with the appointment except Sherman, 
who, I am told, is disposed to patch up the old scheme of Govern 
ment. This was not my opinion of him, when we chose him : 
he is as cunning as the Devil, and if you attack him, you ought 
to know him well ; he is not easily managed, but if he suspects 
you are trying to take him in, you may as well catch an Eel by 
the tail. Our Genl. Assembly will finish this week without mak 
ing Paper Money or tender Act. Our unfederal party will lose 
ground. I am persuaded a good Government is wished for by 
the majority of our House of Assembly but whether the people 
at large will be prepared to receive such an one as you &amp; I wish, 
is uncertain : but I hope the Convention will be united in some 
thing that is not so totally unfit for our purposes, as the present 
system, for I consider that at an end. 

I am very sincerely your most obed. H. Servt. 

JERE. WADSWORTH. 

H. KNOX TO R. KING. 

NEW YORK, 8 June, 1787. 

I thank you my dear Sir for your favor of the 3d inst. I am 
happy that you have so many States as eleven. There is a 
probability I think of the attendance of New Hampshire and also 
of Rhode Island in some mode or other, that is of the minority 



222 RUFUS KING. [1787 

or majority. I have heard that General Varnum has been chosen 
by the minority, in consequence of a meeting of that party 
in the respective towns. But that it was probable the legislature 
which was to have met this week would make a choice. 

You will hear that the legislature of Massachusetts have met 
and declared the choice of the Governor and also chosen 
Gushing for Lieutenant. He and Mr. Gorham s names were 
sent up to the Senate. Notwithstanding the number of votes for 
Lincoln, Genl. Warren manoeuvred in such a manner that his 
name was not returned to the Senate by the house. The Senate 
chose Honestus a Senator, instead of Dawes whose name was on 
the same list. They will show some bad signs in the first instance 
but perhaps they may change. But their conduct is unimpor 
tant excepting to exhibit strongly the effects of a headstrong 
democracy. It is the Convention to whom the thinking part of 
the Community are looking up for a good form. God grant that 
they may not be disappointed. 

I have been detained here longer than I expected by various 
circumstances, but I shall set out on Sunday and shall probably 
be in Philadelphia with Mrs. Knox on Tuesday. Mrs. Hamilton 
is to be of our party. 

I am, my dear Sir, your most obedient humble servt. 

H. KNOX. 



JAMES SULLIVAN TO R. KING. 

June I4th. 
DEAR KING : 

We live in a day, when one year of life is worth many in dull 
common times, to say nothing about the Convention of an 
Empire to give features to a nation &amp;c, we have a world of 
curiosity in our own Commonwealth. Labouring parties, different 
views &amp; jarring Interests make up the sum of our politicks. Some 
characters render themselves the wonder of all who have the 
powers of wondering at anything in these times. 

At Concord in May our Brother P, who loves G. B, and hates 
his successor, made up a party and raised a plan for the then G. 
to leave the unhappy convicts for the treason in the hands of 
Gov. H.; this was done, as he said, to throw the odium of their 



1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 22$ 

execution on H. The arguments used by the G. to the C. were 
that reprieves had been usual and that by the 2d. of June the 
operations of divine Grace might fit them for Launching. They 
now petition and say the work is partly done, but either thro 
the tardiness or for some other cause they want three weeks 
more. P. says unless they are now executed speedily the Com 
monwealth is undone. Brother Sedgwick says the State must 
fall by their fall or fall by their liberation. Yet he petitioned 
and wrote with Bacon and others to the late G. in their favour, 
and absolutely declares in his letters and petitions that it will be 
for the public good to Pardon them, that is Wilcox and Austen. 
The Supreme Executive have not yet considered the matter, but 
my private opinion is that all the Convicts will be paraded at the 
Gallows, and Macullock &amp; Austen pardoned, the others reprieved 
for the present. The General Court last evening passed an Act 
to indemnify all the unconvicted insurgents excepting nine and 
ordered 800 troops. Should this measure reclaim all but these 
nine, these may be pardoned, otherwise they may suffer. 

I believe that the Government will (be) supported, but all 
appears to me in vain unless you make the United States a 
nation. Your account against the state I have petitioned on 
with my own. The disqualifying Act is repealed. Several 
other Acts of the like nature will probably be laid aside. A 
motion was made and obtained last evening to remove the Legis 
lature from Boston ; whether the Senate will concur &amp; if they 
should where they will go to, I know not. Should our clemency 
be again despised will the State of New York give us leave to go 
into military operations there ? For we can no longer act on the 
defensive. 

I am, Dear Sir, 

JAMES SULLIVAN. 

THEODORE SEDGWICK TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, i8th June, 1787. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

I have had the pleasure to receive your favor of the roth. I 
am happy to be informed that the characters composing the con 
vention give us a prospect of deriving advantage from their 



224 RUFUS KING. [1787 

deliberations. Much is to be done. Every man of observation 
is convinced that the end of government security cannot be 
attained by the exercise of principles founded on democratic 
equality. A war is now actually levied on the virtue, property 
and distinctions in the community, and however there may be an 
appearance of a temporary cessation of hostilities, yet the flame 
will again and again break out. Our present general court con 
tains the extremes of every description of character, whether of 
abilities, virtue, honor or firmness on the one hand, or of stu 
pidity, vice, meanness or flexibility on the other. C. Jarvis is at 
the head of the latter force, and will conduct it so long as he 
supposes it for his interest. He wishes to discredit the adminis 
tration of last year, to pay court to the present, and to make 
his election sure as a delegate. At the same time he mani 
festly wants the daring fortitude to lead a desperate faction, 
and he wants the talents necessary to render him dangerous. He 
possesses the qualities of a handsomely decorated balloon, light, 
airy, ascending and beautiful, but continually varying his course 
whenever a steady opposition attacks him. 

On Thursday last week a motion was made for leave to bring 
in a bill to repeal the suspension of the H. Co.; it was carried by 
4 voices on Friday on the question to assign a time for a second 
reading of the bill, the affirmative was carried by the Speaker s 
vote. This was a very happy circumstance, for he considered 
himself as shrouded by the chair from public observation. On 
Saturday the bill, by a general consent, was consigned to oblivion. 

You have seen our resolves for raising a force, also for a pardon. 
This was the best and all that could be done under our circum 
stances. We shall I hope be able to prevent tender acts &amp; paper 
money. Could we fund the public debt, which is in our power, 
giving security to the creditor and alleviating the burdens of 
direct taxation, we might prevent the vessel in which we are at 
present embarked from going down until another was provided 
by the convention &amp; into which we might step from the wreck. 
I am happy you are pleased with the character of Mr. Strong. 
He is indeed a very able, sensible, good man. . . 

Yr. affectionate friend, 

THEODORE SEDGWICK.

N. DANE, N. Y., TO R. KING. 

June igth. 
DEAR SIR : 

I fully agree to the propriety of the Convention order restrain 
ing its members from communicating its doings, tho I feel a 
strong desire and curiosity to know how it proceeds. I think the 
public never ought to see anything but the final report of the 
Convention the digested result only, of their deliberations and 
enquiries. 

Whether the plans of the Southern, Eastern or Middle States 
succeed, never, in my opinion, ought to be known. A few re 
flections on the subject lead me to doubt whether one of your 
members, Mr. P., who two or three days since came to this city, 
fully understood the true meaning, full and just extent of the 
order not to communicate &amp;c. 

I have received no information from Massa. of any importance 
lately. I believe the new legislature, as yet, has done but very 
little business. They put good men in general into the Senate, 
and from this circumstance my expectations were a little raised 
but in filling up the three vacancies made in the Council by 
Phillips, Tufts, &amp; Dwight s declining, the legislature by appoint 
ing Hutchinson, Peter Penniman &amp; John Frost to those vacancies 
certainly gave no evidence of good politics and views. Penniman 
&amp; Frost I am not acquainted with, but H. I know is an unwearied 
advocate for paper money, tender laws, &amp;c., &amp;c. ; had he been 
of the Legislature many might think it policy to put him into the 
Council, but he was elected from among the people at large, and 
after the members too had had time to know men and parties, in 
some measure. My friends, I find, agree that there is a good 
Senate, but they all seem to be doubtful on which side a majority 
of the House in numbers may be. By the inclosed paper you 
will see that Govr. Hancock the 5th inst., proposed to the Legise. 
to continue in the service of the State 800 men. The Senate 
immediately adopted the measure, 20 agt. 6. The House had it 
under consideration for several days &amp; it seems wished to make 
it a part of a conciliatory plan. What are the contents of this 
conciliatory plan I do not know nor do I think that the true 
sentiments of the House can at all be collected from their unani- 

VOL. I 15. 



226 RUFUS KING. [1787 

mous adoption of the Jarvis s motion in the inclosed paper this 
motion appears to me to be a mighty general unmeaning some 
thing. I suppose no party denies such general truths, and posi 
tions. I have not heard a word from Dr. Holten himself I re 
ceived letters from several of the members of the Legislature 
dated about the first of this month, all of which informed me that 
he proposed in two or three days, from that time, to set out for 
New York ; that he was then well and in the Legislature. 

I have written to him on the subject of his attending &amp;c., and 
may expect an answer by the next post. Was he present I 
suppose we should have a Congress but members now present 
talk of going away immediately &amp; I think there is no great proba 
bility of Congress doing any business worth a naming till August 
or September. 

No person was chosen President by the people in New Hamp 
shire. Langdon had about 3000 votes and Sullivan about 2800, 
Livermore about 500. I have not heard which of them the Gen 
eral Court appointed.

N. DANE, N. Y., TO R. KING. PHILA. 

July 5th, 1787. 

. . . We yesterday formed a Congress of seven States and 
elected Grayson chairman. To-day we had no Congress owing 
to the inattention of two or three members. We expect Connecti 
cut and Pennsylvania here in a few days. 

We have various letters touching the hostile conduct of the 
Indians as usual. 

I am very sorry to hear you say that it is uncertain what will 
be the result of the Convention, because I infer there must be a 
great diversity of sentiments among the members. The Con 
vention must do something its meeting has all those effects which 
we and those who did not fully discern the propriety of the 
measure apprehended. You know the general opinion is, that 
our Federal Constitution must be mended ; and if the Convention 
do not agree at least in some amendments, a universal despair of

our keeping together, will take place. It seems to be agreed 
here that the Virginia plan was admitted to come upon the floor 
of investigation by way of experiment and with a few yieldings 
on this point &amp; that it keeps its ground at present. The contents 
of this plan was known to some, I believe, before the Convention 
met. Perhaps the public mind will be prepared in a few years 
to receive this new system. However I leave the whole to the 
wisdom of the Convention &amp; remain Yours sincerely, 

N. DANE. 

P. S. Several concerns make it highly important to me to make 
a short visit to Massa. some time this month or early in the next.

"N. Y., isth July, 1787. 

" I am happy the Convention continue together without agitating 
the idea of adjournment. If their attempts should prove inade 
quate to effect capital alterations, yet experience will be gained, 
which may serve important purposes on another occasion. 

" The conduct of France in establishing provincial assemblies is 
seized with great eagerness by the advocates of the State systems, 
as a reserve against any alterations. But they do not bring into 
view the strong consent of the royal authority supported by 
200,000 soldiers. 

" The State systems are the accursed thing which will prevent 
our being a nation. The democracy might be managed, nay, 
it would remedy itself after being sufficiently fermented ; but the 
vile State governments are sources of pollution, which will con 
taminate the American name for ages machines that must pro 
duce ill, but cannot produce good ; smite them in the name of God 
and the people.

unanimity a system of government for the western territory."

CHAPTER XIII. 

Constitutional Convention of May 1787 Rufus King a Member from Massa 
chusetts The Part taken by him in the Debates Notes kept by him of 
those Debates Confirmatory of those taken by Mr. Madison Mr. King 
a Member of the Committee on Style. 

Mr. King, as has been stated, was appointed by the Legis 
lature of Massachusetts one of the deputies to the Con 
vention to assemble on May 14, 1787, at Philadelphia, under 
the resolutions of Congress, to revise the Articles of the 
Confederation, and, leaving his seat in Congress for the 
time being, repaired to that city. Virginia and Pennsylvania 
were alone represented on that day, and they, with others 
who joined them, adjourned from day to day until the 25th, 
when, a quorum of seven States being present, they pro 
ceeded to organize by the choice of George Washington 
as president. Rufus King was present, but could take no 
part in the proceedings until the 28th, when, other members 
of the Massachusetts delegation arriving, his State was 
represented. 

In the following account of the proceedings of the con 
vention, the object is not to give in full the discussions as 
they took place, but to present the views of Mr. King upon 
the different questions as they arose, and thus to show the 
apparent influence of his opinions in determining the result. 
It is not to claim for him any more merit than is justly his 
due, or to detract from that of others, but simply to follow 
him in the debates as reported by Mr. Madison and Mr. 
Yates, and in the reports as preserved in his own notes,* 

* See Appendix, No. I. 
229 



230 RUFUS KING. [1787 

and allow him thus to speak for himself. It may be said, 
however, that though, as estimated by Mr. Bancroft, he was 
"the most eloquent orator " in that body, he was not always 
successful in carrying his point, any more than were Mr. 
Wilson " the most learned civilian," or Mr. Madison " the 
most careful statesman," who, on June 22d, advocated, in 
the words of Mr. Madison, " that form of government which 
will most approximate the states to the condition of 
counties." * 

In the discussion of the rules for the government of the con 
vention Mr. King " objected to one of them authorizing any 
member to call for the yeas and nays, and have them entered on 
the minutes. He urged that, as the acts of the convention were 
not to bind the constituents, it was unnecessary to exhibit this 
evidence of the voter ; and improper, as changes of opinion 
would be frequent in the course of the business, and fill the min 
utes with contradictions. ! 

Col. Mason, in seconding the objection, gave additional reasons 
against the rule, and it was stricken out nem. con. 

The wisdom of this decision was manifested throughout the 
proceedings. It insured entire secrecy, which was most scrupu 
lously observed by all the members, and prevented the inter 
ference of those outside of the convention. 

On the 29th, Gov. Randolph introduced in a series of resolu 
tions what is known as the Virginia plan, prefacing it with 
remarks on the defects of the existing Confederation, and the 
dangers resulting from them, and laying down the remedy in a 
government to be established, which had for its basis the 
republican principles. 

These resolutions were taken up the next day in committee of 
the whole, and the debate began. The second resolution, "that 
the rights of suffrage in the national legislature ought to be 
proportioned to the quotas of contribution, or to the number of 
free inhabitants, as the one or the other may seem best in differ- 
ent ones," was warmly discussed. Mr. Madison moved to strike 

* Bancroft s Hist, of the Const., vol. i., p. 58. It is here proper to say that 
the editor is greatly indebted to Mr. Bancroft s able summary of the debates. 
f Elliot s Debates, vol. v., p. 124. 



1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 



out the words, " or to the number of free inhabitants," as they 
diverted attention from the general question of a change in the 
principle of representation. On this Mr. King observed " that 
the quotas of contribution, which would alone remain as the 
measure of representation, would not answer ; because, waiving 
every other view of the matter, the revenue might hereafter be so 
collected by the general government that the sums respectively 
drawn from the states would not appear, and would besides be 
continually varying." * 

After some further discussion, Mr. Madison, seconded by Mr. 
Gouverneur Morris, moved " that the equality of suffrage estab 
lished by the Articles of Confederation ought not to prevail in 
the National Legislature, and that an equitable ratio ought to be 
substituted," which would then have been agreed to had not Mr. 
Read, of Delaware, moved to postpone action, stating that her 
deputies could not assent to any change of the rule of suffrage, 
and, in case one was fixed, would be obliged to retire. The 
motion was then postponed. 

In considering the fourth resolution as to the mode of the 
election of the members of the second branch of the Legislature, 
it having been proposed as an amendment that the second 
branch should be chosen by the Legislatures, Mr. King " re 
minded the committee that the choice of the second branch, as 
proposed (by Mr. Spaight), viz., by the state Legislatures, would 
be impracticable, unless it was to be very numerous, or the idea of 
proportion among the states was to be disregarded. According to 
this idea, there must be eighty or a hundred members to en 
title Delaware to a choice of one of them." The motion was 
withdrawn.! 

In considering the question of a council of revision, which Mr. 
Randolph had moved should be composed of the national ex 
ecutive and a convenient number of the national judiciary, 
Mr. Gerry objected, that the nature of their office disqualified 
them from discussing the political questions ; in which opinion he 
was seconded by R. King. " The judges ought to be able to ex 
pound the law as it should come before them, free from the bias

of having participated in its formation." " He is therefore in 
clined to give the executive a complete negative" \ The motion 
was postponed. 

June 5th. Upon the resolution 15 "That the amendment 
which shall be offered to the Confederation ought, at a proper 
time or times after the approbation of Congress, to be submitted 
to an assembly or assembling of representatives recommended by 
the several Legislatures to be expressly chosen by the people, to 
consider and decide thereon," Mr. Madison urged its adoption 
and Mr. King " supposes that as the people have tacitly agreed 
to a federal government, therefore the legislature, in every State, 
has a right to confirm any alterations or amendments in it ; a 
convention in each state to approve of a new government, he sup 
poses, however, the most eligible." \ 

As reported by Mr. Madison : He " supposed that the last 
article of the confederation rendered the legislature competent 
to the ratification. The people of the Southern states, where the 
Federal Articles had been ratified by the legislatures only, had 
since, impliedly, given their sanction to it. He thought, notwith 
standing, that there might be policy in vaiying the mode. A con 
vention being a single House, the adoption may more easily be 
carried through it, than through the legislatures, where there are 
several branches. The legislatures also, being to lose power, 
will be more likely to raise objections. The people having already 
parted with the necessary powers, it is immaterial to them by 
which government they are possessed, provided they be well em 
ployed." The resolution was postponed. 

On the question of giving the national Legislature power to in 
stitute inferior tribunals, Mr. King remarked : " As to the com 
parative expense, that the establishment of inferior tribunals 
would cost infinitely less than the appeals that would be prevented 
by them." || 

Mr. King, when the question of uniting the judiciary with the 
executive in a revision of the laws was again up, said : " If the

unity of the executive was preferred for the sake of responsibility, 
the policy of it is as applicable to the revisionary as to the execu 
tive power." * The proposition was defeated. 

The clause concerning the rule of suffrage in the national Leg 
islature being again under debate, Mr. King, as reported by Mr. 
Yates, " observed that it would be better first to establish a prin 
ciple (that is to say) whether we will depart from federal grounds 
in forming a national government " ; and therefore to bring this 
point to view, he moved as a previous question that the sense of 
the committee be taken on the following proposition : " That the 
right of suffrage in the first branch of the Legislature ought not 
to be according to the rule established in the Articles of the Con 
federation, but according to some equitable ratio of representa 
tion." 

He objected as before to the suggestion that "the actual con 
tribution of the states should be rule of representation &amp; suf 
frage," for the reason " that it was uncertain what mode might be 
used in levying a national revenue, but it was probable imposts 
would be one source of it. If the actual contributions were 
to be the rule, the non-importing states, as Connecticut &amp; New 
Jersey, would be in a bad situation, indeed. It might so happen 
that they would have no representation. This situation of partic 
ular states had always been one powerful argument in favor of the 
fivefler cent, imposts." The motion was carried in the affirmative. 
On motion of Mr. Wilson, seconded by Mr. Pinckney, there was 
added to the resolution " in proportion to the whole number of 
white &amp; other free inhabitants, and three fifths of all other per 
sons, except Indians, not paying taxes." Mr. Gerry remarked : 
" If property is to be the rule of representation, as the blacks are 
in the South, why should not cattle and horses of the north be 
represented ? " 

On the 1 3th of June the resolutions passed were reported as a 
whole to the convention, and on the i5th Mr. Paterson, of New 
Jersey, presented a plan for the alteration of the Articles of Con 
federation, which was referred to the Committee of the Whole. 

The postponement of these resolutions, after some discussion, 

* Elliot s Debates, v., 165. 
f Ib., v., p. 178. 



234 RUFUS KING. [1787 

during which General Hamilton in a speech offered another plan, 
was carried, and on a motion of Mr. King " that the committee 
rise and report that the Jersey plan is not admissible, and report 
the first plan,"* it was set aside, and Mr. Randolph s plan, as 
amended, was reported to the convention. 

On the first resolution, " that a national government ought to 
be established, consisting of a supreme legislative, executive, and 
judiciary," Mr. Wilson said : " I am for a national government, 
though the idea of federal is, in my view, the same. With me it 
is not a desirable object to annihilate the state governments, &amp;c., 
&amp;c." f In answer to this, see R. King s speech in his report of 
the proceedings of the convention, Appendix, I. 

On the next day, 2oth, this article was, on motion of Mr. Ells 
worth, unanimously amended to read " the government of the 
United States." Mr. Pinckney having moved (2ist) to amend 
the proposition for the election of the members of the first branch 
of the Legislature, as the several State Legislatures shall direct, 
Mr. King among others made opposition. He said J : " The 
magistrates of the states will ever pursue schemes of their own ; 
and this, on the proposed motion, will pervade the national 
government ; and we know the state governments will be ever 
hostile to the general government." Madison reports : Mr. 
King spoke in the same direction as Mr. Wilson (that Legislatures 
have an official sentiment opposed to that of the general govern 
ment and perhaps to that of the people). He supposed the 
Legislatures would constantly choose men subservient to their 
own views, as contrasted to the general interest ; and that they 
might even devise modes of election that would be subversive 
of the end in view. He remarked several instances in which 
the views of a State might be at variance with those of the general 
government ; and mentioned particularly a competition between 
the national and State debts for the most certain and productive 
funds." The resolution was rejected and election by the people 
was carried. On the proposition that the members of the Legis 
latures should " receive fixed stipends out of the national treas- 

* Ell. Deb., Yates, v. f 425.

ury," it was suggested that these should be paid out of the 
State treasuries, a course which Mr. King disapproved of.* " He 
urged the danger of creating a dependence on the States by 
leaving to them the payment of the members of the national 
legislature. He supposed it would be best to be explicit as to 
the compensation to be allowed. A reserve on that point, or a 
reference to the national legislature of the question, would excite 
greater opposition than any sum that would be actually necessary 
or proper." 

On the clause declaring ineligibility to office of members of 
the first branch during the term of membership, etc., Mr. King, 
following Mr. Gorham, who wished the words "for one year 
after its expiration " stricken out, said : " It is impossible to carry 
the system of seclusion so far ; and in this instance we refine too 
much by going to Utopian lengths. It is a mere cobweb. "f 
" We are refining too much. Such a restriction on the mem 
bers would discourage merit ; it would also give a pretext to the 
executive for bad appointments, as he might always plead this as 
a bar to the choice he wished to have made " J ; and still further, 
on the 23d : " The intimate association of offices will produce 
a vigorous support to your government. To check it would 
produce no good consequences. Suppose connections are formed. 
Do they not all tend to strengthen the government under which 
they are formed ? Let therefore preferment be open to all 
men. We refine otherwise too much ; nor is it possible we can 
eradicate the evil." 

Madison says || : " Mr. King remarked that we were refining 
too much in this business ; and the idea of preventing intrigue 
and solicitation of offices was chimerical. You say that no 
member shall himself be eligible to any office ? Will this restrain 
him from availing himself of the means which would gain appoint 
ments for himself, to gain them for his son or brother, or any 
other object of his partiality ? We were losing, therefore, the 
advantages on one side, without avoiding the evils on the other."

236 RUFUS KING. [1787 

On the 29th June, after the resumption of the discussion as to 
the right of suffrage in the first branch of the Legislature, the 
views of members seemed so radically to differ, that there was 
danger of the convention breaking up without having accom 
plished the purpose of its meeting. Dr. Franklin then suggested 
that they had omitted an humble application to the Father of 
Lights, to bring order out of the confusion a suggestion which 
was without result, as no action was taken. Dr. Franklin notes * : 
" The Convention, except three or four persons, thought prayers 
unnecessary." 

Dr. Johnson said "that in one branch the people ought to be 
represented, in the other, the States." f 

On the question of an equal vote of each State in the second 
branch Mr. King said (June 3oth) : " That the simple question 
was, whether each state should have an equal vote in the second 
branch ; that it must be apparent to those gentlemen who liked 
neither the motion for its equality, nor the report as it stood, 
that the report was as susceptible of melioration as the motion : 
that a reform would be nugatory and nominal only, if we should 
make another Congress of the proposed Senate ; that if the 
adherence to an equality of votes was fixed and unalterable, 
there could not be less obstinacy on the other side ; and that 
we were in fact cut asunder already and that it was in vain 
to shut our eyes against it ; that he was, however, filled with 
astonishment, that if we were convinced that every man in 
America was secured in all his rights, we should be ready to 
sacrifice this substantial good to the phantom of State sover 
eignty ; that his feelings were more harrowed and his fears 
more agitated for his country than he could express ; that he 
conceived this to be the last opportunity of providing for its 
liberty and happiness ; that he could not therefore but repeat his 
amazement, that when a just government, founded on a fair 
representation of \h.e people of America, was within our reach, we 
should renounce the blessing, from an attachment to the ideal 
freedom and importance of States ; that should this wonder 
ful illusion continue to prevail, his mind was prepared for 

* Spark s ed., v., 153. 
f Ib., Mad., v., 255. 



1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE, 237 

every event, rather than sit down under a government, founded 
on a vicious principle of representation, and which must be 
as short-lived as it would be unjust. He might prevail on 
himself to accede to some such expedient as had been hinted by 
Mr. Wilson (the smaller states to be allowed one and the others 
in proportion) : but he never could listen to an equality of votes, 
as proposed in the motion." 

Mr. Dayton in answer to Mr. King, said : " When assertion is 
given for proof and terror substituted for argument, he pre 
sumed they would have no effect, however eloquently spoken. 
It should have been shown that the evils we have experienced 
have proceeded from the equality now objected to ; and that the 
seeds of dissolution for the State governments are not sown in 
the general government." 

Mr. Bedford " contended, that there was no middle way be 
tween a perfect consolidation and a confederacy of the States. 
The first is out of the question ; and in the latter they must con 
tinue, if not perfectly, yet equally sovereign. . . . The little 
states are willing to observe their engagements, but will meet 
the large ones on no ground but that of the confederation. We 
have been told with a dictatorial air, that this is the last moment 
for a fair trial in favor of a good government. It will be the last, 
indeed, if the propositions reported from the committee go forth 
to the people. He was under no apprehension. The large states 
dare not dissolve the Confederation. If they do, the small ones 
will find some foreign ally, of more honor than good faith, who 
will take them by the hand and do them justice. He did not 
mean by this to intimidate or alarm. It was a natural conse 
quence that ought to be avoided by enlarging the federal powers, 
not annihilating the federal system," etc. 

Mr. Ellsworth " Under a national government, he should par 
ticipate in the national security, as remarked by Mr. King ; but 
that was all. What he wanted was domestic happiness. The 
national government could not descend to the local objects on 
which this depended. It could only embrace objects of a general 
nature. He turned his eyes, therefore, for the preservation of 
his rights to the state governments. From these alone he could 
derive the greatest happiness he expected in this life. His 



238 RUFUS KING. [1787 

happiness depends on their existence, as much as a new-born 
infant on its mother for nourishment. If this reasoning was not 
satisfactory, he had nothing to add that could be so." 

Mr. King " was for preserving the states in a subordinate degree, 
and as far as they could be necessary for the purposes, stated by 
Mr. Ellsworth. He did not think a full answer had been given 
to those who apprehended a dangerous encroachment on their 
jurisdiction. Expedients might be devised, as he conceived, that 
would give them all the security the nature of things would admit 
of. In the establishment of societies, the constitution was to 
the legislature, what the laws were to individuals. As the funda 
mental rights of individuals are secured by express provision in 
the state constitutions, why may not a like security be provided 
for the rights of states in the national constitution. The articles 
of union between England and Scotland furnish an example of 
such a provision, in favor of sundry rights of Scotland. When 
that union was in agitation, the same language of apprehension 
which has been heard from the smaller states was in the mouth 
of the Scotch patriots. The articles, however, have not been 
violated, and the Scotch have found an increase of prosperity 
and happiness. He was aware that this would be called a paper 
security. He thought it a sufficient answer to say, that if the funda 
mental articles of compact are not sufficient defence against physi 
cal power, neither will they be any safety against it, if there be no 
compact. He could not sit down without taking some notice of the 
language of the honorable gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Bedford). 
It was not he that had uttered a dictatorial language. This intem 
perance had marked the honorable gentleman himself. It was 
not he, who with a vehemence unprecedented in that House, had 
declared himself ready to turn his hopes from our common coun 
try, and court the protection of some foreign land. This, too, 
was the language of the honorable member himself. He was 
grieved that such a thought had entered his heart. He was more 
grieved that such an expression had dropped from his lips. The 
gentleman could only excuse it to himself on the score of passion. 
For himself, whatever might be his distress, he would never court 
relief from a foreign power." * 

* Ell. Deb., Mad., v., 266-9. 



1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 239 

The body, being equally divided in the vote upon this question^ 
seemed to have come to a standstill. Gen. Pinckney moved the 
appointment of a committee of one from each State to report 
some compromise ; a proposition on which Mr. Sherman said : 
" We are now at a full stop ; and nobody he supposed meant that 
we should break up without doing something. A committee 
he thought most likely to hit on some expedient." Mr. Gerry 
said : " The world at large expect something from us. If we do 
nothing, it appears to me we must have war and confusion ; for 
the old Confederation would be at an end. Let us see if no 
concession can be made." * The committee was appointed, with 
Mr. Gerry as chairman, who reported, on the 5th of July, resolu 
tions as to the constitution of the first branch, giving one mem 
ber to every forty thousand inhabitants, and restricting to it the 
originating of bills for the raising and appropriating money with 
out power of alteration or amendment by the second branch, 
and that each State shall have an equal vote in the second branch, 
a report which Mr. Gerry said, " was agreed upon merely in order 
that some ground of accommodation might be proposed." 

The discussion was first as to the rule of representation in the 
first house. Many objections were made that numbers and not 
property also were represented. Upon this Mr. King said, f 
that he " wished the clause (as to one member for every forty 
thousand inhabitants) to be committed (as proposed by Mr. 
Gouverneur Morris) chiefly in order to detach it from the report, 
with which it had no connection. He thought also that the ratio 
of representation proposed could not be safely fixed, since in a 
century and a half our computed increase of population would 
carry the number of representatives to an enormous excess ; that 
the number of inhabitants was not the proper index of ability 
and wealth ; that property was the primary object of society and 
that, in fixing a ratio, this ought not to be excluded from the 
estimate. With regard to new states, he observed, that there 
was something peculiar in the business, which had not been 
noticed. The United States were now admitted to be proprietors 
of the country northwest of the Ohio. Congress, by one of their 

*E11. Deb., Yates, v., 477. 
f/., Mad., v., 280. 



240 RUFUS KING. [1787 

ordinances, have impoliticly laid it out into ten states, and have 
made it a fundamental article of compact with those who may be 
come settlers, that as soon as the number in any one state shall 
equal that of the smallest of the thirteen original states, it may 
claim admission into the union. Delaware does not contain, it is 
computed, more than thirty-five thousand souls ; and, for obvious 
reasons, will not increase much for a considerable time. It is 
possible, then, that, if this plan be persisted in by Congress, ten 
new votes may be added, without a greater addition of inhabi 
tants than are represented by the single vote of Pennsylvania. 
The plan as respects one of the states is irrevocable, the sale 
of lands having commenced, the purchasers and settlers will 
immediately become entitled to all the privileges of the compact." 

The committee was appointed Mr. Morris, chairman ; Gerry, 
Randolph, Rutledge, King. This committee made a report fix 
ing the number of representatives from each State, and providing 
that the Legislature shall have power to augment the number 
from time to time, or regulate the number in new States " upon 
the principles of their wealth and number." In the discussion 
of this distribution, Mr. King * said " he had always expected that 
as the Southern states are the richest, they would not league 
themselves with the Northern, unless some respect were paid to 
their superior wealth. If the latter expect those preferential 
distinctions in commerce, and other advantages which they will 
derive from the connection, they must not expect to receive them 
without allowing some advantages in return. Eleven out of 
thirteen of the states had agreed to consider slaves in the 
apportionment of taxation, and taxation &amp; representation ought 
to go together." 

The paragraph was committed to a grand committee of one 
from each State, Mr. King being chairman. A report was made 
next day, loth July, fixing the whole number at sixty-five, and 
apportioning them. A debate arose as to the apparently large 
number (3) given to New Hampshire, in which Mr. King said : 

" New Hampshire has probably more than 120,000 inhabitants 
and has an extensive country, of tolerable fertility. Its inhabi 
tants may therefore be expected to increase fast. He remarked 
that the four Eastern states, having 800,000 souls, have one third 

* Ell. Debates, Mad., v., 290. 



1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 241 

fewer representatives than the four Southern States, having not 
more than 700,000 souls, rating the blacks as five for three. The 
eastern people will advert to these circumstances, and be dissatis 
fied. He believed them to be very desirous of uniting with their 
southern brethren, but did not think it prudent to rely so far on 
that disposition as to subject them to any gross inequality. He 
was fully convinced that the question concerning a difference of 
interests did not lie where it had hitherto been discussed, be 
tween the great and small states ; but between the southern and 
eastern. For this reason he had been ready to yield something 
in the proportion of representation for the security of the south 
ern. No principle would justify the giving them a majority. 
They were brought as near an equality as was possible. He was 
not averse to giving them a still greater security, but did not see 
how it could be done." 

The reduction of the number of representatives from New 
Hampshire was not carried. 

Mr. Williamson having proposed that a census should be taken 
every year of the free white inhabitants and three-fifths of all 
others, to regulate the representation, the question was largely 
discussed, and the first clause as to the free white inhabitants was 
adopted. On that in reference to three-fifths of the negroes, 
Mr. King,* being much opposed to fixing numbers as the rule 
of representation, was particularly so on account of the blacks. 
He thought the admission of them along with whites at all would 
excite great discontents among the States having no slaves. He 
had never said, as to any particular point, that he would in no 
event acquiesce in and support it ; but he would say that, if in 
any case such a declaration was to be made by him, it would be 
in this. He remarked that, in the temporary allotment of repre 
sentatives made by the committee, the Southern States had re 
ceived more than the number of their white and three-fifths of 
their " black inhabitants entitled them to." f After some further 
discussion, the convention refused to agree to this. 

* Ell. Deb., Mad., v., 300. 

f Thus from the first opportunity which offered, Mr. King renewed the op 
position to the power and extension of slavery, which he had endeavored to 
check by his amendment to the ordinance of 1785, for its immediate exclusion 
from the northwest territory. 
VOL. r 16 



242 RUFUS KING. 



Mr. Randolph subsequently moved that a census shall be 
taken, etc., etc., of all the " inhabitants " (rating the blacks at three- 
fifths of their number), and the representation should be regu 
lated thereby, and Mr. Wilson proposing to amend " that direct 
taxation should be apportioned accordingly," Mr. King said* : 
" Although this amendment varies the aspect somewhat, he had 
still two powerful objections against tying down the legislature 
to the rule of members first, that they were at this time an un 
certain index of the relative wealth of the states ; secondly, if 
they were a just index at this time, it cannot be supposed always 
to continue so. He was far from wishing to retain any unjust 
advantage whatever in one part of the republic. If justice was 
not the basis of the connection, it could not be of long duration. 
He must be shortsighted indeed who does not foresee that when 
ever the Southern states shall be more numerous than the North 
ern, they can &amp; will hold a language that will awe them into 
justice. If they threaten to separate now in case injury shall be 
done to them, will their threats be less urgent or effectual when 
force shall back their demands ? Even in the intervening period 
there will be no point of time at which they will not be able to 
say, Do us justice or we will separate. He urged the necessity 
of placing confidence, to a certain degree in every government ; 
and did not conceive that the present confidence, as to a peri 
odical readjustment of representation, exceeded that degree." 

Mr. L. Martin had said " that he had rather there should be 
two confederacies than one founded on any other principle than 
an equality of states," and Mr. Gerry favored a reconsideration 
of the report in reference to the money bills and equality of ratio 
in the second branch, " not with a view to destroy the equality 
of votes, but of providing that the states should vote per capita, 
which would prevent the delays and inconveniences that had 
been experienced in Congress, and would give a national aspect 
and spirit to the management of business." He " approved of 
the clause relating to money bills. It was of great consequence. 
It was the corner-stone of the accommodation." 

Mr. Pinckney then " moved that instead of an equality of votes, 
a proportionate representation should be adopted, making the 

* Elliot s Debates, Mad., v., 304. 



1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 243 

whole number in the second branch thirty-six," to which Mr. 
Gerry said he should like the motion, but could see no hope of 
success. On this Mr. King said * : " It was always with regret 
that he differed from his colleagues, but it was his duty to differ 
from Mr. Gerry on this occasion. He considered the proposed 
government as substantially and formally a general and national 
government over the people of America. There never will be a 
case in which it will act as a federal government on the states, 
and not on individual citizens. And is it not a clear principle 
that, in a free government, those who are to be the objects of a 
government ought to influence the operations of it ? What 
reason can be assigned why the same rule of representation 
should not prevail in the second as in the first branch ? He 
could conceive of none. On the contrary, every view of the 
subject that presented itself seemed to require it. Two objec 
tions had been raised against it, drawn, first from the terms of the 
existing compact, secondly, from a supposed danger to the 
smaller states. As to the first objection, he thought it inapplica 
ble. According to the existing Confederation, the rule by which 
the public burden is to be apportioned is fixed, and must be pur 
sued. In the proposed government it cannot be fixed, because 
indirect taxation is to be substituted. The legislature, therefore, 
will have full discretion to impose taxes in such modes and pro 
portions as they may judge expedient. As to the second objec 
tion, he thought it of as little weight. The general government 
can never wish to intrude on the State governments. There could 
be no temptation. None had been pointed out. In order to 
prevent the interference of measures which seemed most likely 
to happen, he would have no objection to throw all the state 
debts into the federal debt, making one aggregate debt of about 
$70,000,000, and leaving it to be discharged by the general gov 
ernment, f According to the idea of securing the state govern- 

* Elliot s Debates, v., 312. 

f We see here the first suggestion of the advisability of the general govern 
ment assuming the state debts ; the necessity and expediency of which action, it 
was afterwards suggested by Mr. Rutledge (Elliot s Debates, p. 441), and sup 
ported by Mr. King, was a matter of much consequence and worthy of considera 
tion by a committee. Under Mr. Rutledge s motion a committee was formed, 
but the matter was passed by. It was not until many years afterwards, as will 
be seen, that the government assumed these debts. 



244 RUFUS KING. [1787 

ments there ought to be three distinct legislative branches. The 
second was admitted to be necessary, and was actually meant to 
check the first branch to give more wisdom, system and stability 
to the government ; and ought clearly, as it was to operate upon 
the people, to be proportioned to them. For the third purpose, 
of securing the states, there ought then to be a third branch, rep 
resenting the states as such, and guarding by equal votes their 
rights and dignities. He would not pretend to be as thoroughly 
acquainted with his immediate constituents as his colleagues ; 
but it was his firm belief that Massachusetts would never be pre 
vailed on to yield to an equality of votes. In New York (he was 
sorry to be obliged to say anything relative to that state in the 
absence of its representatives, * but the occasion required it) in 
New York he had seen that the most powerful argument used by 
the considerate opponents to the grant of the impost to Congress,, 
was pointed against the vicious constitution of Congress, with 
regard to representation and suffrage. He was sure that no gov 
ernment would last that was not founded on just principles. He 
preferred the doing of nothing to an allowance of an equal vote 
to all states. It would be better to submit to a little more confusion 
and convulsion than to submit to such an evil. It was difficult 
to say what the views of different gentlemen might be. Per 
haps there might be some who thought no government co-exten 
sive with the United States could be established with a hope of 
its answering the purpose. Perhaps there might be other fixed 
opinions incompatible with the object we are pursuing. If there 
were he thought it but candid that gentlemen should speak out, 
that we might understand one another."! 

In these sentiments he was joined by Mr. Madison and Mr. 
Wilson giving their reasons against an equality of votes and Mr. 
Pinckney s motion was lost. The next day, the whole report, 
including the equality of votes and the clause relating to money 
bills, passed, 5 for, 4 against ; Mass, divided Gerry and Strong

powers of the Legislature showing the convention equally divided, 
Mr. Randolph stated that, in view of the vote in the morning 
(involving equality of suffrage in the second branch), the business 
was extremely embarrassed, and that as it was probable that a final 
decision would not be reached with a bare majority on either side, 
he would move an adjournment that " the large states might con 
sider the steps to be taken, in the present solemn crisis of the 
business ; and that the small states might also deliberate on the 
means of conciliation." This after some discussion was adopted. 

A conference was held without coming to any conclusion on 
the subject of the equality of votes, unless, as Mr. Madison says, 
to satisfy the smaller States that they had nothing to apprehend 
from a union of the larger in any plan against equality. The 
powers of the Legislature, especially in its relation to the States, 
were the subject of earnest debate, as were also the mode of 
electing the Executive and the judges of the courts, and the se 
curing to the States a republican constitution, the last resulting in 
a resolution by Mr. Wilson, " that a republican form of govern 
ment shall be guarantied to each state ; and that each state shall 
be protected against foreign and domestic violence." It does 
not appear from the record that Mr. King took part in the debate. 
But when the proposition was again made that the executive 
should "be ineligible a second time," Mr. King said* he did not 
like ineligibility. He thought " there was great force in the re 
mark of Mr. Sherman, that he who had proved himself most fit 
for an office ought not to be excluded by the Constitution from 
holding it. He would therefore prefer any other reasonable plan 
that could be substituted. He was much disposed to think, that 
in such cases the people at large would choose wisely. There 
was indeed some difficulty arising from the improbability of a 
general concurrence of the people in favor of any one man. On 
the whole, he was of opinion that an appointment by electors 
chosen by the people would be liable to fewer objections." f 

A resolution was offered and carried that the Executive should 
be chosen by electors, and the question whether or not the Execu-

vision which still remains in the Constitution

tive shall be impeachable while in office, drew from Mr. King,* 
the expression of "his apprehensions that an extreme caution in 
favor of liberty might enervate the government we were forming. 
He wished the House to recur to the primitive axiom, that the 
three great departments of government should be separate and 
independent ; that the executive and judiciary should be so as 
well as the legislative that the executive should be so equally 
with the judiciary. Would this be so if the executive should be 
impeachable? It had been said that the judiciary would be im 
peachable. But it should have been remembered, at the same 
time, that the judiciary hold their places not for a limited time, 
but during good behavior. It is necessary, that a form should 
be established for trying misbehavior. Was the executive to hold 
his place during good behavior ? The executive was to hold his 
place for a limited time, like the members of the legislature. 
Like them, particularly the Senate, whose members would con 
tinue in appointment the same term of six years (as then pro 
posed), he would periodically be tried for his behavior by his 
electors, who would continue or discontinue him in trust accord 
ing to the manner in which he had discharged it. Like them, 
therefore, he ought to be subject to no intermediate trial, by 
impeachment. He ought not to be impeachable unless he held 
his office during good behavior a tenure which would be most 
agreeable to him, provided an independent and effectual form 
could be devised. But under no circumstances ought he to be 
impeachable by the legislature. This would be destructive of his 
independence and of the principles of the Constitution. He 
relied on the vigor of the executive, as a great security for the 
public liberties." 

Dr. Franklin, in opposition, mentioned the case of the Prince 
of Orange during the late war, in that, as was supposed, he pre 
vented the carrying out arrangements between France and Holland. 
Had he been impeachable, if guilty, he would have been " pun 
ished ; if innocent, restored to confidence." 

Mr. King remarked, " that the case of the stadtholder was not 
applicable. He held his place for life, and was not periodically 
elected. In the former case, impeachments are proper to secure 

* Elliot s Debates, p. 344. 



1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 247 

good behavior ; in the latter, the periodical responsibility to 
electors being an equivalent security." 

The question was decided against him 8 to 2 (Massachusetts and 
South Carolina). 

On the resolution (xixth) as to the mode of referring the new 
Constitution for ratification, Mr. Ellsworth moved that it be 
referred to the Legislatures of the States, and urged this plan. Mr. 
King said* "he thought with Mr. Ellsworth that the legislatures 
had a competent authority, the acquiescence of the people of 
America in the Confederation being equivalent to a formal ratifi 
cation by the people. He thought with Mr. Ellsworth, also that the 
plea of necessity was as valid in the one case as the other. At the 
same time he preferred a reference to the authority of the people, 
expressly delegated to conventions, as the most certain means of 
obviating all disputes and doubts concerning the legitimacy of 
the new constitution, as well as the most likely means of drawing 
forth the business men in the states to decide it. He remarked 
that among other objections made in the State of New York to 
granting powers to Congress, one had been, that such powers as 
would operate within the states could not be reconciled to the 
constitution, and therefore were not grantable by the legislative 
authority. He considered it as of some consequence, also, to get 
rid of the scruples which some members of the state legislatures 
might derive from their oaths to support and maintain the exist 
ing constitutions." In this view Mr. Madison concurred. This 
resolution was rejected and one to refer it to assemblies chosen 
by the people was adopted. 

It was decided also to give each State two members in the 
Senate to vote/^r capita, Maryland alone dissenting, f 

On July 24th, the proposition, coming up again, that the Execu 
tive should be ineligible for a second time, Mr. Gerry said " the 
longer his term, the more will his dependence be diminished. It 
will be better, then, for him to continue ten, fifteen, or even twenty 
years and be ineligible afterwards." 

Mr. King was for making him re-eligible. This is too great an 
advantage to be given up, for the small effect it will have on his 

* Elliot s Debates, vol. v., p. 355. 
f Ib., vol. v., p. 357. 



248 RUFUS KING. [1787 

dependence, if impeachments are to lie. He considered these as 
rendering the tenure during pleasure." 

Mr. Martin moved the appointment for ten years. Mr. Gerry 
suggested fifteen Mr. King, twenty years. " This is the medium 
life of princes."* 

Mr. Wilson, to get out of the difficulty, which he thought sprang 
from the mode of election, suggested that he be elected for six 
years by a small number of electors, chosen by lot, of the national 
legislature, to which Mr. King said f : " The lot might fall on a 
majority from the same state, which would insure the election of a 
man from that state. We ought to be governed by reason, not by 
chance ; as nobody seemed to be satisfied he wished the matter 
to be postponed," which was unanimously agreed to. 

Mr. Gerry had moved that a committee should be appointed to 
prepare a constitution in conformity with the views of the con 
vention, except as to the Executive, to consist of five members. 
This was adopted, and Mess. Rutledge, Randolph, Gorham, Ells 
worth, and Wilson were appointed. On August 6th this commit 
tee reported a constitution to the convention, which began to be 
discussed next day, the first proposition being that the Legisla 
ture should meet every year. 

" Mr. King \ could not think there would be a necessity for a 
meeting every year. A great vice in our system was that of legis 
lating too much. The most numerous objects of legislation be 
long to the states. Those of the national legislature were but 
few. The chief of them were commerce and revenue. When 
these should be once settled, alterations would be rarely neces 
sary, and easily made." This, however, was passed and the day 
for meeting fixed as proposed by the article. 

On the provision in Art. IV., Sec. 3., relative to changes in the 
proportion of numbers in the different States, that the Legislature 
should " regulate the number of representatives by the number 
of inhabitants, according to the provisions hereinafter made" etc., 
Mr. Williamson moved to insert instead of the words under- 

* Mr. Madison says : " This might possibly be meant as a caricature of the 
previous motions in order to defeat the object of them."

scored, according to the rule hereafter to be provided for direct taxa 
tion" which was agreed to. Mr. King * " wished to know what 
influence the vote just passed was to have on the succeeding part 
of the report, concerning the admission of slaves into the rule of 
representation. He could not reconcile his mind to the article, if 
it was to prevent objections to the latter part, f The admission 
of slaves was a most grating circumstance to his mind, and he 
believed would be so to a great part of the people of America. 
He had not made a strenuous opposition to it heretofore, because 
he had hoped that this concession would have produced a readi 
ness, which had not been manifested, to strengthen the general 
government, and to mark a full confidence in it. The report 
under consideration had, by the tenor of it, put an end to all 
those hopes. In two great points the hands of the legislature 
were absolutely tied. The importation of slaves could not be 
prohibited. Exports could not be taxed. Is this reasonable ? 
What are the great objects of the general system ? First, defence 
against foreign invasion ; secondly, against internal sedition. 
Shall all the states, then, be bound to defend each, and shall each 
be at liberty to introduce a weakness which will render defence 
more difficult ? Shall one part of the United States be bound to 
defend another part, and that other part be at liberty, not only 
to increase its own danger, but to withhold the compensation for 
the burden ? If slaves are to be imported, shall not the exports 
produced by their labor supply a revenue to enable the general 
government to defend their masters ? There was so much in 
equality and unreasonableness in all this, that the people of the 
Northern states could never be reconciled to it. No candid man 
could undertake to justify it to them. He had hoped that some 
accommodation would have taken place on this subject ; that, at 
least, a time would have been limited for the importation of 
slaves. He never could agree to let them be imported without 
limitation, and then be represented in the national legislature. 
Indeed he could so little persuade himself of the rectitude of 
such a practice, that he was not sure he could assent to it under 
any circumstance. At all events, either slaves should not be 

* Elliot s Debates, p. 391. 
f Art. VII., Sec. 3, p. 379. 



250 RUFUS KING. [1787 

represented, or exports should be taxable." * Mr. Gouverneur 
Morris sustained with great earnestness and vigor these views, 
but the vote, even of Massachusetts, was against them, and the 
section was adopted with Mr. Williamson s amendment. 

Mr. King does not appear to have taken any part in the debate 
on the adoption of the different sections until f the question arose 
as to allowing the provisions of the Legislatures regulating the 
election of Senators to be at any time altered by the Legislature 
of the United States, some contending that the States should be 
relied on in such cases. Mr. King, after Mr. Madison, said : 
" If this power be not given to the national legislature, their right 
of judging of the returns of their members may be frustrated. 
No probability has been suggested of its being abused by them. 
Although this scheme of erecting the general government on the 
authority of the state legislatures has been fatal to the federal 
establishment, it would seem as if many gentlemen still foster the 
dangerous idea." J The motion to change was lost. 

Mr. King called attention to the Art. VI, Sec. 8, and stated 
that " as it stood it authorized the two Houses to adjourn to a new 
place. He thought this inconvenient. The mutability of place 
had dishonored the federal government, and would require as 
strong a cure as we could devise. He thought a law, at least, 
should be made necessary to a removal of the seat of govern 
ment." Mr. Madison viewed the subject in the same light, and 
the section was modified so as to meet these suggestions. 

The next point on which Mr. King seems to have joined in 
the debate was on Mr. Rutledge s motion to appoint || a grand 
committee to consider the necessity and expediency of the United 
States assuming all the state debts ; a motion seconded by Mr. 

* Here again Mr. King expresses in emphatic language his strong aversion 
to the importation of slaves, considering it unjust to the Northern States un 
less " the products of their labor should be taxed to supply a revenue to enable 
the general government to defend their masters." Besides, "he never could 
agree to let them be imported without limitation and then be represented in 
the Legislature."

King, who had some time before * stated his willingness that this 
should be done. He said " he thought the matter of more con 
sequence than Mr. Ellsworth seemed to do ; and that it was 
worthy of commitment. Besides the considerations of justice 
and policy, which had been mentioned, it might be remarked 
that the state creditors, an active and formidable party, would 
otherwise be opposed to a plan which transferred to the Union 
the best resources of the states, without transferring the state 
debts at the same time. The state creditors had generally been 
the strongest foes to the impost plan. The state debts were 
probably of greater amount than the federal. He would not say 
that it was practicable to consolidate the debts, but he thought it 
would be prudent to have the subject considered by a committee." 
It was agreed to, and Mr. King was the member from Mas 
sachusetts, with Mr. Langdon as chairman. 

The article in reference to treason drew out an earnest debate, 
in the course of which Mr. King observed, f " that the contro 
versy relating to treason might be of less magnitude than was sup 
posed, as the legislature might punish capitally under other names 
than treason." J He moved to give the United States sole power 
to declare the punishment of treason, saying : " This amendment 
results from the vote defining treason generally by striking out 
against the United States/ which excludes any treason against 
particular states. These, however, may punish offences, as high 
misdemeanors." When this was rejected, he said : " No line can 
be drawn between levying war and adhering to the enemy against 
the United States and against an individual state. Treason 
against the latter must be so against the former." These views 
were sustained by many others and the article was adopted leav 
ing out the words in the original draft "or, any of them." 

Mr. L. Martin moved to alter Art. VII., Sec. 4, " so as to allow a 
prohibition or tax on the importation of slaves." In the discus 
sion Gen. Pinckney, S. C., and Mr. Baldwin, Ga., said that if the 
clause was altered so as to prohibit the importation of slaves, their 
States could not join the Union ; and Mr. Williamson of N. C.

252 RUFUS KING. [1787 

thought the Southern States could not be members, if the clause 
should be rejected. Mr. King " thought the subject should be 
considered in a political light only. If two states will not agree 
to the Constitution, as stated on one side, he could affirm with 
equal belief on the other, that great and equal opposition would 
be experienced from the other states. He remarked on the 
exemption of slaves from duty whilst every other import was 
subjected to it, as an inequality that could not fail to strike the 
sagacity of the northern and middle states." 

This subject as well as that relating to a navigation act, was 
committed to a grand committee Mr. Langdon, chairman, Mr. 
King from Mass., and others ; on the 24th Aug. * Mr. Livingston 
reported a clause to the effect that the Legislature should not have 
power to prohibit the importation of slaves before 1800 but that 
a tax might be laid on their importation. The time was after 
wards changed to 1808, and the tax was laid at $10 a head. Mr. 
Sherman objected to a tax, as acknowledging men to be prop 
erty ; but Mr. King and Mr. Langdon considered this as the price 
of the first part, which Gen. Pinckney admitted to be so. f 

The section that no navigation act should be passed without 
the assent of two thirds of members present in " each House," in 
the report was stricken out. This was a compromise between the 
eastern states to save their interests and the southern, to hedge in 
slavery, and the committee sustained the report. 

On the article relative to the ratification of the constitution, 
after various motions as to the number of States to assent, Mr. 
King moved to add to Article XXI. the words " between the 
said states," so as to confine the operation of the government to 
the states ratifying it, which was carried. Mr. G. Morris pro 
posed that the word u convention " should be stricken out, 
leaving the States to pursue their own modes of ratification. To 
this Mr. King said " that striking out convention as the requi 
site mode, was equivalent to giving up the business altogether. 
Conventions alone, which will avoid all the obstacles from the 
complicated formations of the legislatures, will succeed, and if

1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 253 

not positively required by the plan, its enemies will oppose that 
mode." * The motion was lost and the number of nine assenting 
States being required the article was passed. 

On the 3ist of August the parts of the constitution which had 
been postponed, and reports which had not been acted on, were 
referred to a committee from each State chosen by ballot. Mr. King 
was one of the members chosen. The committee reported in part 
next day, and on the 3d on the question of the ineligibility of mem 
bers of each House " to any civil office under the authority of the 
United States," Mr. King moved to insert the word " created " 
before the word "during." !&lt; This," he said, "would exclude the 
members of the first legislature under the Constitution, as most of 
the offices would then be created,"f which was lost by a tie vote, but 
was finally passed as follows " created or the emoluments whereof 
shall have been increased" during the term of their office as 
members. The clause authorizing the legislature to exercise 
authority over places purchased for forts, etc., was modified on Mr. 
King s resolution by inserting after " purchased " " by the consent 
of the legislature of the state." 

On the question \ of the powers of the Executive, " Mr. 
Wilson objected to the mode of appointing (ambassadors) as 
blending a branch of the legislature (the Senate) with the execu 
tive. . . . Responsibility is in a manner destroyed by such an 
agency of the Senate. He would prefer the council proposed by 
Col. Mason, provided its advice should not be made obligatory on 
the President." In opposition Mr. King said " as the idea of a 
council, proposed by Col. Mason, has been supported by Mr. 
Wilson, he would remark, that most of the inconveniencies 
charged on the Senate are incident to a council of advice. He 
differed from those who thought the Senate would sit constantly. 
He did not suppose it was meant that all the minute officers 
were to be appointed by the Senate or any other original source, 
but by the higher officers of the departments to which they belong. 
He was of the opinion also, that the people would be alarmed at an 
unnecessary creation of a new corps, which must increase the

254 RUFUS KING. [1787 

expense as well as the influence of the government." The 
question was passed uniting the Senate with the President in mak 
ing the appointment of ambassadors, etc. 

On the 8th of September a committee was appointed by ballot 
to revise the style of and arrange the articles which had been 
agreed to by the House, viz., Mess. Johnson, Hamilton, Gouver- 
neur Morris, Madison, and King,* which committee was after 
wards directed to prepare an address to the people to accompany 
the present Constitution when sent to Congress on Sept. 10. On 
a question as to the restoration in the XXIId Article of the clause 
" for the approbation of Congress " proposed by Mr. Gerry and 
seconded by Mr. Hamilton, Mr. King f thought " it would be 
more respectful to Congress to submit the plan generally to them, 
than in such form as expressly and necessarily to require their 
approbation or disapprobation. The assent of nine States he 
considered as sufficient ; and that it was more proper to make 
this a part of the Constitution itself, than to provide for it by a 
supplemental or distinct recommendation." The measure being 
pressed by Mr. Hamilton in another way, Mr. King said: " If Con 
gress can accede to one mode they can to another. If the appro 
bation of Congress be made necessary and they should not 
approve, the state legislatures will not propose the plan to con 
ventions ; or if the states themselves are to provide that nine 
states shall suffice to establish the system, that provision will be 
omitted, everything will go into confusion, and all our labor be 
lost." 

These amendments were then lost and " the approbation of 
Congress " was not restored. The final action of the convention 
before its adoption of the Constitution as reported, was a motion 
offered by Mr. Gorham, seconded by Mr. King and Mr. Carroll, 
to change the number of inhabitants necessary to elect a represen 
tative from 40,000 to 30,000 which would tend to remove many 
objections. The president of the convention, before putting the 
question, said that he had looked upon the provision as it stood 
as exceptionable, and late as it was to offer amendments, it 
would give him much satisfaction to see it adopted, which it then

was unanimously, and the convention agreed to the Constitution, 
which had been enrolled in order to be signed, all the States 
answering ay. 

Several members, Messrs. Randolph, Mason, and Gerry, refused 
to sign the Constitution and gave their reasons for not appending 
their signatures. Before proceeding to sign, " Mr. King suggested 
that the Journals of the Convention should be either destroyed, or 
deposited in the custody of the President. He thought if suffered 
to be made public, a bad use would be made of them by those who 
would wish to prevent the adoption of the constitution." Mr. 
Wilson preferred the second course, which was adopted, with the 
adverse vote of Maryland only and it was resolved, " that no 
copies should be allowed to the members, and that he (the Presi 
dent) retain the Journal &amp; other papers, subject to the order of 
Congress, if ever formed under the Constitution." * 

* Mr. King, as will be seen in Appendix No. I, kept rough notes of the 
proceedings of the convention. These are now published for the first time.

I shall be fully agreed on appointing Major Sergeant Secretary

Western Country from the Eastern States, among which, I think, 
some proper characters for Judges will be found. I am but very 
little acquainted with Major Turner, but I can in this and on 
other occasions place confidence in your opinion. I think it is 
probable that no settlements will be made in that country this 
fall, and therefore congress will for some time delay the appoint 
ment of Officers &amp; in the mean time several gentlemen may be 
presented for the vacant offices, and we may consider the charac 
ters and direct the elections as may appear to be most politic and 
prudent. Much will depend on the directions given to the first 
settlements in my opinion, and as the Eastern States for the sake 
of doing away the temporary governments, &amp;c., established in 
1784 and for establishing some order in that country, gave up as 
much as could reasonably be expected, I think it will be just and 
proper in them to establish, as far as they can consistently, East 
ern politics in it, especially in the state adjoining Pennsylvania. 
You are informed, I presume, of the terms of the Ohio contract. 
All circumstances considered I think they are advantageous to

Dr. Holten left this place last Friday to return to Massachu 
setts, which broke up Congress. I wished him very much to have 
postponed his journey, but we could not prevail upon him to do 
it. Indeed he was too unwell a man to be here and attend to 
business ; I imagine it will be with great difficulty that he can 
reach home. I am very sorry he was obliged to leave Congress 
not only as it leaves the State unrepresented but as it has deprived 
me of an agreeable Colleague. The Dr. you know is not a man 
able to do a great deal of business, but he is a polite agreeable 
man, and a man of sound good politics. We shall probably have 
a Congress to-morrow and I believe for the first time not one 
New England State upon the floor. I wish you would inform me 
as soon as you conveniently can, what prospect there is of our 
States being represented and when. It depends entirely on your 
or Mr. Gorham s taking a seat in Congress. There is no prospect 
of Dr. Holten s returning. If neither of you can attend for 4 or 

5 weeks to come, I think it will be best forme in the intermediate 
time to make a short visit to Mass., as my private concerns now 
make it almost absolutely necessary I should. I am now the only 
member in Congress from the 4 Eastern States. There are now

manner the affairs of our legation at the Court of London shall 
be conducted after his return, the requisition, &amp;c. &amp;c., which we 
never ought to leave entirely to the Southern &amp; Middle States. 
It is evidently the object of several gentlemen to put the affairs 
of our Legation at London into the hands of Mr. Jefferson. This 
is a thing we can by no means agree to. As to other foreign 
matters we have pretty well despatched them for the present. 
Instructions are gone to Mr. Jefferson respecting the Consulate &amp; 
to Mr. Adams respecting the infractions of the treaty as reported

DEAR SIR : 

I wrote to you some days since to request you to inform me 
when there was a prospect of your finishing, as I intended to be 
with you, for certain reasons, before the conclusion. 

It is whispered here that some late changes in your scheme 
have taken place which give it a higher tone. Is this the case ? 

I leave town today to attend a circuit in a neighbouring County, 
from which I shall return the last of the week ; and shall be glad

1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 2 59 

JAMES SULLIVAN TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, Sept. 23, 1787. 
DEAR KING : 

Your engagement in so important a body as the Convention 
has prevented my continuing a correspondence in which I have 
so much pleasure. I have this day seen the Report of the Con 
vention, and cannot express the heartfelt satisfaction I have from 
it. I am more than pleased, having only one doubt, which is 
whether the object of the Judicial power is well defined. I wish 
you to attend to this, for I consider it the mainspring of the whole 
machinery. 

Our people expect so much happiness from the doings of the 
Convention that they stand ready to adopt anything which may 
be offered ; but this is as I think so very unexceptionable that I 
flatter myself it will meet with no opposition in this State. Some 
persons indeed who lie to support party prejudices have charged 
upon others a combination to oppose everything federal. If this 
scandal has reached you, you may consider it as without founda 
tion and disregard it. Our parties here, or rather the opposers of 
the present Government, are so inveterate that lies come from 
places where they were not expected from. But our Government 
is in peace &amp; I believe will remain so. 

Yr. hble. servt., 

JAMES SULLIVAN. 

JAMES SULLIVAN TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, 28th Sept., 1787. 
DEAR KING : 

I wrote you the last post my sentiments in general on the 
report of the Convention, and now have yours of the 2Oth, wherein 
you request my free and candid opinion upon it. I do by no 
means retract what you will have before this reaches you in my 
other letter. I consider it to be of the highest importance to have 
a federal government and should this not be adopted, I should 
despair of having one excepting it arises from the chance of war. 
There are several things in the report that upon the stinted view 
I have of the subject, I should wish to be altered or explained. 
In the eighth article Congress are empowered to " Lay and collect 



260 RUFUS KING. [1787 

taxes." It is not here ascertained what is here meant by taxes : if 
what we call dry taxes, a tax on polls &amp; estates by a census, I do 
not see how it can be carried into execution. Congress can 
never appoint Collectors, assessors, &amp;c. ; besides there would be 
great confusion between the doings of their officers and those of 
particular States. Had the provision been that Congress should 
apportion such taxes as should be necessary to the common 
defence (over and above the revenue) on the several States, and 
provision had been made to coerce a compliance, it would have 
been in my opinion better. 

In the judicial power the court is to have authority to try all 
causes between a State and citizen of another State, and between 
citizens of different States ; and one Supreme Court to be over the 
United States. This appears to me in the first instance to lay 
the particular States under very great inconveniences. A debtor, 
defective collector, trespasser, &amp;c., may fly from one State to 
another, and thereby involve the State he has fled from, or tres 
passed against, in a very great cost and trouble, evade a trial 
according to the law which governed the contract when made, or 
the Lands or Chattels trespassed upon, and great delay, fraud or 
injustice may be the consequence. In the other case, can it be 
right that every contract or note of hand between citizens of dif 
ferent States in this wide commercial country shall be tried in the 
Judical of the Congress ? 

These objections have weight in my mind ; I. shall not mention 
them to any one here, because I believe they must have been 
agreed to on an equivalent given which I do not see. Besides I 
hear no objection to it here yet. I came from Wyport to-day : 
the people are much in favour of it, but what turn it may take, 
when the objections of the gentlemen, who did not sign it, are 
known, I cannot say. 

With purest friendship, yr. most obt. Servt., 

JAMES SULLIVAN. 

IRA (JUDGE) DANA TO R. KING. 

Oct. 13, 1787. 
DEAR SIR : 

I was honoured on the 7th inst. with your very obliging favour 
of the 2nd enclosing the Act of Congress mentioned in it. I feel 



1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 261 

myself much indebted to your attention and friendship in getting 
this business finally settled after the many official embarrassments 
which had so long delayed it. My health, tho not yet confirmed, 
is still much mended. I never had more occasion to lament the 
want of it, as it alone prevented my attending the grand Conven 
tion, where I should have had the satisfaction of participating with 
you and others in the happiness of proping up a fallen Empire if 
not of establishing it on the strongest foundation. May your 
labours not be rendered abortive by the wickedness or folly of 
any of our Citizens. 

Your much obliged friend, 

IRA DANA. 



C. GORE, BOSTON, TO R. KING. 

October 7, 1787. 

The federal plan is well esteemed and as far as 
can be deduced from present appearances, the adoption will be 
easy. It is cause of speculation that our friend Mr. Gerry did 
not sanction the plan with his name. ... In November you 
will be at home in my house and I pray you that Mrs. King come 

also. . . . 

I am affectionately yours, 

C. GORE. 

R. KING TO JOHN ADAMS. 

BOSTON, October 27th, 1787. 
DEAR SIR : 

I intended to have written to you previously to my departure 
from New York. Mr. Jay has undoubtedly transmitted to you 
the late Acts of Congress permitting your return to America after 
the expiration of your commission to the English Court, &amp; giving 
you the unequivocal thanks of the United States for the diligent, 
faithful, &amp; able discharge of your various public duties since 
your residence in Europe. No minister of Congress having 
before received such testimony of the public approbation, you 
will naturally suppose the truth, that the partizans of those 
ministers who have returned without any marks of public favor 
were not entirely satisfied with the ample vote of thanks in the 
present instance. This distinction in my judgment constitutes the 



262 RUFUS KING. [1787 

principal value of the vote, since it proves that the measure was 
not of course, but the effect of singular merit. 

Your last loan in Holland was approved &amp; ratified, &amp; as on 
your return you will probably take leave of the Hague as well as 
at London, Congress judged it proper that your delegation to 
the former should terminate with your commission to the latter. 
There did not seem to be a disposition in Congress to appoint a 
successor to either of these Courts at present ; Mr. Jefferson s com 
mission is renewed for Versailles, &amp; I intend writing to Col. Smith 
by this opportunity in reply to his last letter relative to the 
London Legation. 

Some difficulties have heretofore taken place in an allowance 
to Mr. Dana for a private Secretary while at St. Petersburg. I 
was very happy in effecting the customary allowance to Mr. Dana 
on this point previously to my leaving Congress, &amp; the more so as 
it will ease you of an expense incurred for your Son while in 
Russia. 

Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, &amp; Connecticut have called con 
ventions in their respective states to consider the report of the 
late general conventions. These are the only states whose Legis 
latures have been in session since the publication of the report. 
With the highest respect I have the honor to be, c., 

RUFUS KING. 

C. GORE TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, Dec. 9, 1787. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

I received with great pleasure your information from Hart 
ford, tho you made a very great mistake in mentioning the 
numbers pro &amp; con the new plan. You say 50 against &amp; 19 in 
favor the proposed form in the Convention of Pennsylvania. I 
construed directly the reverse of this &amp; so communicated the 
information. This town, as you perceive by the papers has 
elected many are disappointed, &amp; some, such as Breck, Treat 
Paine, Sullivan, are extremely mortified. The list, as it is, was 
the effect of a junction of the North &amp; South caucuses a thing 
often before attempted, but never, till this hour, with success. 
This list was strenuously opposed by Dr. Jarvis, Honestus Adams, 
Coltson, Joseph Shed, &amp; Morton Brailsford, certain real and pre- 



1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 263 

tended leaders of the town the end of the opposition was to 
erase my name from the list &amp; to attain it they severally exerted 
all their abilities. Falsehoods of every kind were loudly declared, 
and the lowest &amp; meanest acts of deception made use of to effect 
their purposes. This being the case, and I being the only one they 
opposed, I feel as honourably elected as any one of the delegates. 
I really exerted myself to obtain an election of Sullivan, but to no 
purpose, even to the end he had but 3 votes, Treat Paine none. 

Most of those whose elections we know of are favorably inclined 
to adopt the Constitution but, it is said, the delegates from the 
County of Worcester will generally oppose the plan. Adam 
Wheeler, late A.D.C to Shays, is elected to represent the town of 
Hubbardston. . . . Your own observations on the Constitu 
tion and answers to Mason s &amp; Gerry s objections will much 
oblige me. You certainly will be here the first week of January. 

. . . I sincerely &amp; ardently wish for you, . . because of 
the benefits the Commonwealth of M. may reap from your pres 
ence in the Convention. . . . 

Your friend, 

C. GORE. 



N. GORHAM TO R. KING. 

CHARLESTOWN, Dec. 12, 1787. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

No consideration as applying to this world, or I had allmost 
said the next, can be an inducement to you to stay at N. York 
after the first of Jany. You can have no idea how much depends 
on your presence. The Elections in this part of the Country 
have generally been favourable : but a black cloud will come 
down from the three Western Counties. The choice was to have 
been made at Cambridge on Monday last, but the constable never 
returned the warrant, and though they sent three messengers 
after him to Boston, he was not to be found till i o clock at night. 
So the Meeting was lost and a new one was summoned for next 
Monday. Gerry wou d not have been chosen. I cannot tell how 
the people may change by the next meeting. On the whole I 
think the prospect has mended since you left us, and looks rather 



264 RUFUS KING. [ J 7 8 7 

encouraging than otherways. Bristol County which was supposed 
to be wrong, is by a great majority right. . . . 

Yours, 

N. GORHAM. 

The Town of Boston committed a great mistake by notchusing 
Sullivan. 

JERE. WADSWORTH TO R. KING. 

HARTFORD, Dec. 16, 1787. 
DEAR SIR : 

I last night reed, your favor, with the pleasing news of Dela 
ware s ratification of ye New Constitution. I know Mercer well 
and am glad he is ineligible for more reasons than one. I 
have not yet heard who are elected in Hampshire and Berkshire, 
except at N. Hampton, where they are on the side of ye. Con 
stitution. Berkshire are turning about. Sedgwick &amp; Bacon 
debated the subject publickly, when Bacon declared himself con 
vinced. Sedgwick asked him to give him a written certificate, 
which he did and Sedgwick is using it to advantage. This I have 
from such authority that I can t doubt it. A Pamphlet is circu 
lating here Observations &amp;c, signed ye. Federal Farmer written 
with art &amp;, tho by no means unanswerable, it is calculated to do 
much harm. It came from New York under cover to Wronghead 
&amp; Mitchel and to all others supposed to be against the Constitu 
tion. You will wonder to hear Mitchel named you remember 
he was against the Convention ; but he is right now ; as far as 
his popular itch will let him be he will vote right. Notwithstand 
ing all the volumes sent in here from New York and circulated 
with industry, we shall have a large majority. . . 
Yours sincerely, 

______ JERE. WADSWORTH. 

C. GORE TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, Dec. 23, 1787. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

. . . I sincerely wish, as is my duty, to be inform d on the 
momentous question soon to be agitated. We are too much in 
terested in its determination to neglect anything that may further 
the adoption of the plan proposed. Among those who are 



1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 26$ 

elected and are avowedly opposed to the form, none have yet 
appeared of abilities except Nat. Barrell from Old York, Symmes, 
a young lawyer from Andover, and Bishop, unless S. Adams be 
consider d as its enemy ; wh. I believe to be the case. Those 
who are in favor of the Constitution feared the consequences 
of opposing S. A. s election. They suppos d he wou d, in such 
mortification, openly declare against it and endeavour to make 
proselytes. Whereas an election by his townsmen, under an idea 
that he was really its advocate, might damp his opposition, for he 
is too old not to know his dependence is more on the people, 
than theirs on him. Further it was said that his arguments cou d 
be opposed, with greater probability of success, while he was a 
member, than if he was absent, suggesting objections to small 
circles of the delegates, and that the rumour of this opposition 
wou d weigh more than any objections he could raise in Conven 
tion. You will perceive by a list I have enclosed Thatcher and 
which I have desired him to send, how many of those known to 
be elected are in opposition ; in my marking, I may have mis 
taken some, but not many. The possibility is that a bare majority 
may be in its favor on the first meeting. Our endeavour must be 
to make the majority respectable in numbers. Judge Dana &amp; 
Col. Dana were elected at Camb., J. Winthrop had 10 votes, Mr. 
Gerry 2 or 3. I have not heard that this latter gentleman enters 
the list as an opponent. I rather think he has not yet wrote or 
said much on the subject. It is said Winthrop writes under 
Agrippa. These pieces gain him no credit. Dane is silent on 
the subject, and, I believe, mortified that all those he respects in 
this quarter differ from him on this great question ; and this cir 
cumstance induces him to hold his peace. It was impossible to 
elect Sullivan in this town : I interested myself warmly in his 
favor, but the people will not confide in him, and he may from 
this neglect be oppos d. Pray bring with you his letters in reply 
to yours, wh. obviated his objections to the Constitution : it can 
do no hurt and may answer a good purpose. Let me know the 
reasons of Congress having a right to order the time &amp; place &amp;c. 
of election of Representatives &amp; their reason for laying excises 
and direct taxes, and what can be done with State debts. . . . 

Your friend, 

C. GORE.

N. GORHAM TO R. KING. 

CHARLESTOWN, Dec. 29, 1787. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

Let me intreat you, as you regard the Interest of your Country 
&amp; your own reputation to be here by the time the Convention 
opens you can have no idea of the necessity of it. 

The Business will labour very much and People who do not 
wish you or the cause well, say that you are an alien, a stranger 
who will not trouble yourself about the matter. The opposition 
from the Western Counties will be numerous and violent ; the 
utmost candor and prudence will be wanted to guide and abate 
it. You know some of our Friends are not good Steersmen. Most 
of the Eastern members are wrong ; nobody can deal with them 
so well as you. Mr. Adams will [not be right &amp; Dr. Jarvis I am 
concerned about. Pray persuade Mrs. King to consent ; you 
never can have a greater call. 

Yours, 

N. GORHAM. 



C. GORE TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, Dec. 30, 1787. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

The elections which have come to my knowledge since the list 
enclosed Thatcher are favorable. Oliver Phelps, who has been 
much written to on the new Constitution by Mr. Osgood of the 
Treasury Board, wrote a friend of mine the last week, that the 
people of his quarter viz. Berkshire, seeing the elections in this 
part of the State, had been convinc d that opposition to the pro 
posed system would be futile that he had resigned his seat in 
the Convention, not intending to assume an active part in the 
opposition ; that he really thought a majority of the delegates of 
Berkshire would be in favor of the Constitution. His refusing to 
become a member of the Convention is compleat evidence of his 
being satisfied that opposition wou d be unsuccessful &amp; unpopu 
lar. S. Adarns is out full against it. There is ev ry reason to 
conclude him the author of Helvidius Priscus in Adams &amp; Nourse 



1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 26? 

of last Thursday. It is said Jarvis is in favor, but states objec 
tions. Mr. Bowdoin has invited the delegates of this town to 
dine with him on Thursday next and proposes in his billet that 
the new Constitution shou d be the subject of conversation in the 
afternoon and evening. On this I waited upon him &amp; suggested 
tho no evil cou d arise from conversing on the principles of the 
proposed plan &amp; hearing and obviating objections, yet it certainly 
wou d be imprudent in those who are for its adoption to state any 
particular mode of conduct whereby our wishes might be gratified 
in its adoption. This wou d be to expose ourselves to A., &amp; pos 
sibly others, and inform them how they might best counteract 
our intentions this he agreed with me. I have been fearful that 
the measure of our being together originated with A., and that it 
was done with a view of seeing what strength he can muster. But 
this is suspicion. Bowdoin is firm in favor of the thing. Hancock 
is sick &amp; immovable in his limbs ; however he will clearly be 
elected President. Being forewarned, I think we shall not be 
entrapped by the craft of A. Stilman is a warm supporter of the 
plan, &amp; will do us service. If possible, be with us. You can do 
great good. This I hope will find you on the road for Boston. 
Gerry s letter has done harm but he is now silent. . . . 

Your friend,

CHAPTER XV.* 

WHO FRAMED THE ORDINANCE OF 8/ ? 

Letter of Charles King to the New York Tribune The Ordinance of 1787 
Claims to western Territories demanded Settlement Plan for a tem 
porary Government of the North Western Territory adopted 23d of April, 
1784 Mr. Jefferson s Agency relative to Slavery in that Territory Pro 
posed Ordinance of 1785 Mr. King proposed that Slavery should be for 
ever prohibited in the N. W. Territory The Proposition not acted on 
Ordinance passed Ordinance of 1787 Contained a Provision for Educa 
tion, for free Navigation and Use of Rivers and Portages, and for Free 
dom from Slavery This was introduced by Nathan Dane His Letter to 
R. King, then at the Constitutional Convention, announcing the Fact. 

To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK " TRIBUNE " 
(HORACE GREELEY.) 

SIR : 

The ordinance of 87 and its history are naturally enough, 
after the atrocious wrong of the Kansas-Nebraska law, objects of 
renewed discussion. 

I ask, therefore, space in your columns for a paper on this sub 
ject, prepared by me, in no controversial spirit, nearly two years 
ago as part of a work upon which I am engaged on The Life 
and Correspondence of RUFUS KING and of which the aim is to 
give a true history, from original letters in my possession and 
from the Journals of Congress, of this ordinance, to indicate the 

* This chapter was written by President Charles King, as part of the work 
which he had determined to write, but never accomplished. It is given with 
his letter to the New York Tribune in which it was published, showing how at 
that time the power of slavery operated upon some of the publishers of leading 
magazines. 

268 



1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 269 

share in its preparation that belonged to my father, without seek 
ing to depreciate the glorious labors of others in the same great 
work. 

The chapter was sent, soon after its completion, to one of the 
leading monthlies, with a request that, as the topic of Slavery was 
then much agitated, it might be published. After being retained 
several months it was returned to me with the excuse for not pub 
lishing it, that the extract concerning Slavery, embodied in one of 
Timothy Pickering s letters, written in 1785, smacked too much 
of " Abolition " to make it expedient for the publisher to insert 
the paper. 

It is perhaps not the least humiliating evidence of the corrupt 
ing influence of Slavery over public sentiment, that even in this 
City, the fear of pecuniary loss forbids the publishing of a dis 
passionate historical essay, concerning a most interesting public 
transaction, supported by original contemporaneous correspond 
ence and the Journals of Congress and assailing nobody. 

I am aware that I make a very unusual demand upon your 
space in making room for so long a communication as that en 
closed ; but it is perhaps timely and certainly is true and you I 
know are not afraid of Truth anywhere. 

I am truly your friend, 

CHAS. KING. 

COLUMBIA COLLEGE, January 31, 1855. 



The remarkable character, and more remarkable influence 
of this celebrated ordinance, will justify, even in the biog 
raphy of an individual, a thorough and somewhat extended 
narrative of its origin, progress, and final adoption ; all the 
more, too, when the individual, whose life we are commem 
orating, was largely concerned in breathing into this charter 
of freedom its vital breath. 

The general character of this ordinance must be assumed 
to be familiar more or less to all who are in any reasonable 
degree versed in the history of their country. Yet it may 
well be doubted whether any considerable number, even of 
the public men of the day, are aware of the many claims to 



270 RUFUS KING. [1787 

the gratitude of all time, which that ordinance in its numer 
ous and divers, but all-beneficent provisions, presents. The 
common and almost exclusive merit assigned to that wise and 
almost provident organic law portions of which have the 
form and duration of a permanent contract is supposed to 
rest in that clause which, by prohibiting slavery within the 
wide region embraced in its provision, stamped it as free 
forever as far as human legislation can work such a result. 
Great, very great, unspeakable, indeed, in importance is this 
provision ; but there are others for the first time set forth 
in this ordinance and recognized as duties of government 
towards its citizens, which are fit to stand side by side with 
the charter of freedom. Our purpose, therefore, is to enter 
into a somewhat minute detail of the various enactments of 
the ordinance, and as nearly as possible to assign to individ 
uals and to States the due share of each in framing and 
completing the perfect whole. 

One of the greatest topics of controversy and disagree 
ment between the States, both during the Revolutionary 
War, and subsequent to the peace, was the unequal distri 
bution of the immense territory nominally included within 
some of the States, but which, by the peace of 83 falling 
to the United States as the general spoil won from the 
common enemy by the common blood and treasure of all 
the States, might virtually be regarded as belonging to the 
people of all the States. 

But not such was the interpretation of those States within 
whose real and imaginary limits, or under whose jurisdiction 
or tutelage, these territories vast, wild, and of conjectural 
extent, were supposed to lie. Massachusetts, Connecticut, 
New York, Virginia, the Carolinas each laid claim to 
immense domains, sometimes to the same domains while 
the States whose limits were so defined by Royal Charter, 
as to make impossible such claim on their part, insisted that 
all must be a common stock. For a long time after partial 
adoption, the Articles of Confederation were rendered inop 
erative by the refusal of several States to come in unless 



1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 2/1 

this land question was either reserved for future settlement, 
or settled on the principle of joint ownership by all the 
States. Referring to a distinct chapter for an elucidation 
of the difficulties occasioned by those conflicting views and 
claims, and their final and harmonious settlement,* allusion 
is here made to the subject simply as introductory to a nar 
rative of the circumstances under which the ordinance of 
87 was prepared and finally adopted. 

On the 23d of April, 1784, a plan for the temporary 
government of the Western Territory was adopted by the 
unanimous votes of all the States present : New Hampshire, 
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New 
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and North Caro 
lina. South Carolina, by her two delegates, Messrs. Read 
and Beresford, voted No. It is in the form of resolutions, 
and in these words : 

Resolved, That so much of the territory ceded or to be ceded 
by individual States to the United States as is already purchased 
or shall be purchased of the Indian inhabitants and offered for 
sale by Congress, shall be divided into distinct States in the fol 
lowing manner as nearly as such cession will admit ; that is to 
say by parallels of latitude, so that each State shall comprehend 
from north to south two degrees of latitude beginning to count 
from the completion of 45 degrees north of the Equator, and by 
meridians of longitude one of which shall pass through the low 
est point of the Rapids of Ohio, and the other through the Western 
Cape of the mouth of the Great Kanaway ; but the territory east 
ward of this last meridian, between the Ohio, Lake Erie, and 
Pennsylvania, shall be one State, whatsoever may be its compre 
hension of latitude. That which may be beyond the completion 
of the 45th degree between the said meridians shall make part of 
the State adjoining it on the south, and that part of the Ohio 
which is between the said meridian, coinciding nearly with the 
parallel of 39, shall be substituted so far in lieu of that parallel 
as a boundary line. 

That the settlers on any territory so purchased and offered for

2/2 RUFUS KING. [1787 

sale shall, either on their own petition, or on the order of Con 
gress, receive authority from them, with appointments of time 
and place, for their free males of full age within the limits of their 
State, to meet together for the purpose of establishing a temporary 
government to adopt the Constitution and laws of any one of the 
original States ; so that such laws, nevertheless, shall be subjected 
to alteration by their ordinary Legislature ; and to erect, subject 
to like alteration, counties, townships, or other divisions for the 
election of members of their Legislature. 

That when any such State shall have acquired 20,000 free in 
habitants, on giving due proof thereof to Congress, they shall 
receive authority, with appointment of time and place, to call a 
Convention of Representatives to establish a permanent Constitu 
tion and Government for themselves. Provided that both the 
temporary and permanent Government be established on these 
principles as their basis. 

First : That they shall forever remain a part of this Confed 
eracy of the United States of America. 

Second : That they shall be subject to the articles of Con 
federation in all those cases in which the original States shall be 
so subject ; and to all the acts and ordinances of the United 
States in Congress assembled, conformable thereto. 

Third . That they shall in no case interfere with the primary 
disposal of the soil by the United States in Congress assembled, 
nor with the ordinances and regulations, which Congress may 
find necessary for securing the title in such soil to bona fide 
purchasers. 

Fourth : That they shall be subject to pay a part of the 
federal debt contracted, or to be contracted, apportioned on them 
by Congress according to the same common rule and measure by 
which apportionment thereof shall be made on the other States. 

Fifth : That no tax shall be imposed on lands the property of 
the United States. 

Sixth : That their respective Governments shall be republican. 

Seventh : That the lands of non-resident proprietors shall in no 
case be taxed higher than those of residents within any new 
State before the admission thereof by a vote of its delegates in 
Congress. That whenever any of the said States shall have of free 
inhabitants as many as shall then be in anyone the least numerous 



1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 273 

of the thirteen original States, such State shall be admitted by 
its delegates into the Congress of the United States on an 
equal footing with the original States, provided the consent 
of so many States in Congress is first obtained as may at 
that time be competent to such admission. And in order to 
adapt the said Articles of Confederation to the state of Congress, 
when the members shall be thus increased, it shall be proposed to 
the Legislatures of the States originally parties thereto to require 
the assent of two thirds of the United States in Congress assem 
bled in all cases wherein, by the said articles, the assent of nine 
is now required which being agreed to by them, shall be bind 
ing on the new States. Until such admission by their delegates 
to Congress, any of the said States, after the establishment of their 
temporary government, shall have authority to keep a member in 
Congress, with a right of debating but not of voting. 

That measures not inconsistent with the principles of the Con 
federation, and necessary for the preservation of peace and good 
order among the settlers in any of the new States, until they shall 
assume a temporary government, as aforesaid, may from time to 
time be taken by the United States in Congress assembled. 

That the preceding articles shall be formed into a charter of 
compact ; shall be duly executed by the President of the United 
States in Congress assembled, under his hand and the seal of the 
United States ; shall be promulgated and shall stand as the funda 
mental constitution between the thirteen original States, and each 
of the several States now newly described, unalterable from and 
after the sale of any part of the territory of such State, pursuant 
to this resolve, but by the joint consent of the United States in 
Congress assembled and of the particular State within which such 
alteration is proposed to be made. 

The original draft of this plan of government was made 
by a committee consisting of Mr. Jefferson of Virginia, Mr. 
Chase of Maryland, and Mr. Howell, of Rhode Island. That 
draft contained this remarkable paragraph, numbered 5 in 
the articles, to be in the nature of a compact, " that 
after the year 1800 of the Christian Era, there shall be 
neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, in any of the said 
States, otherwise than in punishment of crimes wherein the 

VOL. I. 18 



274 RUFUS KING. [1787 

party shall have been convicted to have been personally 
guilty." On the iQth of April, Congress having the report 
of the committee under consideration, Mr. Spaight of 
North Carolina, and seconded by Mr. Read of South Carolina, 
moved to strike out this paragraph. Under the Confed 
eration, a majority of the thirteen States seven was 
requisite to the success of any motion, and the mode of 
putting the question was in this wise, " Shall the words 
moved to be stricken out stand ? " 

The yeas and nays on Mr. Spaight s motion being de 
manded by Mr. Howell, one of the committee, they resulted 
as follows : New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, 
Rhode Island, New York, and Pennsylvania YEA. Mary 
land, Virginia, and South Carolina NAY. New Jersey had 
but one representative present, Mr. Dick, and he voted yea, 
but the Articles of Confederation required the presence of 
at least two delegates from a State to entitle it to a vote. 
So New Jersey, from the non-attendance of her other dele 
gates, lost the opportunity of recording her voice in favor of 
prospective freedom. North Carolina was divided, Mr. 
Williamson (well known afterward, and honorably remem 
bered in the city of New York, as Dr. Hugh Williamson) 
voting yea. It is to be recorded also, to the credit of Mr. 
Jefferson, the framer of the paragraph, that he voted yea, 
but was overborne by his colleagues present, Mr. Hardy 
and Mr. Mercer ; and thus Virginia was in the negative. 

The result presenting but six affirmative votes, the words 
did not stand, but were stricken out. It is impossible not 
to be struck with these two facts in this important proceed 
ing first, that if the question had been stated, as in all 
legislative bodies such questions are now stated, " shall the 
words objected to be now stricken out?" the motion must 
have failed, as only three States were in favor of it ; and 
secondly, that although the effort to retain the paragraph, 
was unsuccessful, the vote by States was two to one (6 to 3) 
in its favor, with one State divided and one without voice ; 
and more significant yet, that counted per capita, the votes 



1 787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 2/5 

for retaining the clause were 15, against it, 7, or more than 
two to one. 

The plan thus emasculated, and after being otherwise 
altered, was, as has been already stated, adopted by Con 
gress on the 23d of April, 1784. The original report, in the 
handwriting apparently of Mr. Jefferson, is now in the 
archives of the State Department, as well as the printed 
copy of the report as it was finally adopted. A careful 
comparison of these shows certain alterations in the draft 
by Mr. Jefferson, of which the chief consist : first, in striking 
out, as stated above, the clause prohibiting slavery, that 
which forbade any one holding an hereditary title to be 
come a citizen, and that giving names to the future States; 
and secondly, in adding to the fundamental articles of com 
pact, that the new States should in no case interfere with 
the primary disposal of the soil by the United States, that no 
tax should be imposed on lands, the property of the United 
States, and that the lands of non-residents should never be 
taxed higher than the lands of residents. With these ex 
ceptions, the plan adopted by Congress was the same, 
and for the most part in the words of the one submitted by 
Mr. Jefferson. Fourteen days after its passage, Mr. Jeffer 
son, on May 7, 1784, was appointed Minister to France, and 
vacated his seat in Congress. To that seat he never re 
turned, nor indeed to the United States, until after the 
adoption of the new Constitution in 1789. This, therefore, 
seems the whole of Mr. Jefferson s connection with the 
ordinances for the government of the Western Territory, 
and is the sole basis upon which the credit is claimed for 
him of being the author of the Ordinance of 87, which 
was originated, discussed, matured, adopted, and promul 
gated while he was in France, and without, so far as appears, 
any consultation on any side with him. 

The plan of government adopted in April 84 remained 
the law of the lane! until superseded and repealed by the 
Ordinance of 87 ; in the interim, however, much attention 
and care were bestowed by Congress on plans for the regula- 



2/6 RUFUS KING. [1787 

tion, surveying, and disposing of the vast territories ceded by 
New York, Virginia, and other States to the United States. 
All these had more or less bearing on the final Ordinance of 
87, for the government of this territory, and gave it some 
of its most valuable and characteristic features. Mr. King 
took an early, active, and very influential part in all these 
discussions, as more fully appears in the chapter devoted to 
the special topic of the public lands of the United States* 
It is, however, essential to the narrative now in hand to 
state that on the 4th of March, 85, an ordinance for ascer 
taining the mode of locating and disposing of the lands in 
the Western Territory was read a first time in Congress. 
On the i6th of the same month, a motion was made by Mr. 
King, seconded by Mr. Ellery of Rhode Island, that the fol 
lowing proposition be committed, " that there shall be neither 
slavery nor involuntary servitude in any of the States de 
scribed by the resolve of Congress of the 23d of April, 1784, 
otherwise than in punishment of crime, whereof the party 
shall have been personally guilty, and that this regulation 
shall be an article of compact and remain a fundamental 
principle of the Constitution between the thirteen original 
States and each of the States described in the said resolve 
of the 23d of April, 1784." 

The motion to commit prevailed New Hampshire, 
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New 
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, voting aye ; Virginia, North 
Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, voting no. Georgia, 
however, had only one representative present, and her vote 
was therefore lost, and Delaware was unrepresented wholly. 
Every member from the States in the affirmative voted aye, 
except Mr. McHenry of Maryland, whose vote was over 
borne by those of his two colleagues, Mr. J. Henry and Mr. 
Hindman, and every member from the States in the nega 
tive voted nay, except Mr. Grayson of Virginia, whose 
vote was overborne by that of his two colleagues, Mr. 
Hardy and Mr. Lee. 

* This chapter was never written. ED. 



1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 2/7 

Of the motion thus committed, the Journals of Congress, 
most imperfectly kept, give no subsequent account, nor does 
any contemporary authority which I have been able to 
consult. 

On the same day, however (the i6th of March), the ordi 
nance read the first time on the 4th of March came up on 
its second reading, and, after debate, was referred to a grand 
committee of one from each State. This committee, com 
posed of Mr. Long (N. H), Mr. King (Mass.), Mr. Howell 
(R. L), Mr. Johnson (Conn.), Mr. R. R. Livingston (N. Y.), 
Mr. Stewart (N. J.), Mr. Gardiner (Perm.), Mr. J. Henry 
(Md.), Mr. Grayson (Va.), Mr. Williamson (N. C), Mr. Ball 
(S. C.), Mr. Houston (Ga.), reported, on the i/j-th April, in 
the shape of another ordinance, which was then read a first 
time. The consideration of it was resumed on the 2Oth, 
and it continued to be a subject of debate and amendment 
from that day until the 2oth of May, when it was finally 
adopted. Mr. King took a very active part in all these de 
bates, as the Journals show, but the ordinance being " one for 
ascertaining the mode of disposing of the public lands in 
the Western Territory," and not for their government, Mr. 
King would seem to have been restrained by its character 
and objects from pressing the introduction into it of his 
anti-slavery clause committed on the i6th March. 

The next effort, in the order of time, to establish a gov 
ernment for the Territories, is thus noticed in the Journal 
of Friday, 22d of September, 1786. " Congress proceeded 
in the consideration of an ordinance for the government of 
the Western Territory, reported by Mr. Johnson, Mr. 
Pinckney, Mr. Smith, Mr. Dane, and Mr. Henry." The pre 
vious reference to the appointment of this committee, ap 
pears in the Journal. The House debated the report that 
day and again on the 4th of October, after which nothing 
further concerning it is recorded in the Journals, and the 
Congress expired by the proper limitation on Saturday, 4th 
of November. On Monday, the 6th of November, the new 
Congress met, but without forming a quorum, and none was 



278 RUFUS KING. [1787 

formed till Wednesday, i/th January, 1787. Mr. Gorham, 
Mr. King, Mr. Dane were in attendance from Massachusetts. 
The House failed to elect a President on that day, and no 
quorum was obtained again until Friday, 2d February, when 
Gen. St. Clair was chosen President. By an annual resolu 
tion the unfinished business of the old Congress was con 
tinued in the new Congress, and accordingly in the Journal 
of Wednesday, gth May, 1787, we find this entry: "Con 
gress proceeded in the second reading of the ordinance for 
the government of the Western Territory." It was debated 
that day, Mr. King and Mr. Dane being both present and 
voting, and was ordered to be transcribed and to be read a 
third time next day. It was, however, postponed on that 
day, and no more is heard of it. From Friday the nth of 
May to Friday the 6th of July no quorum could be had, 
and of course no business was done in Congress. Again 
from Friday 6th to Wednesday July nth the House was 
left without a quorum. On that day (nth July) we find 
this entry in the Journal : " The committee, consisting of Mr. 
Carrington, Mr. Dane, Mr. R. H. Lee, Mr. Kean, and Mr. 
Smith, to whom was referred the report of a committee 
touching the temporary government of the Western Terri 
tories, reported an ordinance for the government of the 
territory of the United States northwest of the River Ohio, 
which was read a first time and ordered to a second reading 
next day/ There is no previous notice in the Journal of 
the reference of this subject to a committee, but it seems 
reasonable to assume that the report thus referred was that 
which had been under debate on the Qth of May, and the 
ordinance accompanying which was there ordered to be 
transcribed for a third reading next day ; however that be, 
the ordinance was read a first time on the nth, was read a 
second time on the I2th, and on the I3th was adopted by 
the unanimous vote of all the States present, eight in num 
ber, viz., Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, 
Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and of 
every member save Mr. Yates of New York, and, so far as 



1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 279 

appears from the Journal, without any debate or attempt to 
amend or change it, and this was the famous Ordinance of 
87, the great charter of freedom for the great Northwestern 
Territory, now composing, with additions since obtained 
from the Indians, six free States. 

This ordinance for the government of the territory of the 
United States northwest of the River Ohio, after prescrib 
ing with minuteness the method of obtaining and transmit 
ting land, of appointing magistrates, establishing laws, etc., 
etc., sets forth the following articles of compact, with this 
recital: 

And for extending the fundamental principles of civil and re 
ligious liberty, which from the basis whereon these republics, 
their laws and constitutions are erected, to fix and establish these 
principles as the basis of all laws, constitutions, and governments 
which forever hereafter shall be formed in that Territory ; to 
provide also for the establishment of States and permanent gov 
ernments therein, and for their admission to a share in the federal 
councils on an equal footing with the original States at as early 
periods as may be consistent with the general interest : 

It is hereby ordained and declared by the authority aforesaid that 
the following articles shall be considered as articles of compact 
between the original States and the people and States in said Ter 
ritory, and forever remain unalterable, unless by common consent, 
to wit : 

ARTICLE I. No person demeaning himself in a peaceable and 
orderly manner shall ever be molested on account of his mode 
of worship or religious sentiments in the said Territory. 

ART. II. The inhabitants of the said Territory shall always 
be entitled to the benefit of the writ of habeas corpus and of trial 
by jury of a proportionate representation of the people in the 
Legislature, and of judicial proceedings according to the course 
of the common law ; all persons shall be bailable, unless for capi 
tal offences where the proof shall be evident, or the presumption 
great. All fines shall be moderate and no cruel nor unusual pun 
ishment shall be inflicted. No man shall be deprived of his liberty 
or property but by the judgment of his peers, or the law of the 
land ; and should the public exigencies make it necessary for the 



280 RUFUS KING. [1787 

common preservation to take any one s property, or to demand 
his particular services, full compensation shall be made for the 
same. And in the just preservation of rights and property, it is 
understood and declared that no law ought ever to be made or 
have force in that Territory, that shall in any manner interfere 
with or affect private contracts or engagements, bona fide, and 
without fraud previously formed. 

ART. III. Religion, morality, and knowledge being necessary 
to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and 
the means of education shall forever be encouraged ; the utmost 
good faith shall forever be observed towards the Indians ; their 
lands and property shall never be taken from them without their 
consent, and in their property rights and liberty they never shall 
be invaded nor disturbed, unless in just and lawful war author 
ized by Congress ; but laws founded in justice and humanity shall 
from time to time be made for preventing wrong being done them 
and for preserving peace and friendship with them. 

ART. IV. The said Territory with the States that may be 
formed therein shall forever remain a part of this Confederacy 
of the United States of America, subject to the articles of Con 
federation, and such alterations therein as may be constitutionally 
made, and to all the acts and ordinances of the United States in 
Congress assembled conformable thereto. The inhabitants and 
settlers in the said Territory shall be subject to pay a part of the 
federal debts contracted, or to be contracted, and a proportional 
part of the expenses of government, to be apportioned on them 
by Congress, according to the same common rule and measure 
by which apportionments thereof shall be made on the other 
States ; and the taxes for paying their proportion shall be laid 
and levied by the authority of the Legislatures of the District, or 
Districts, or new States, as in the original States, within the time 
agreed upon by the United States in Congress assembled. The 
Legislatures of those Districts or new States shall never interfere 
with the primary disposal of the soil by the United States in Con 
gress assembled, nor with any regulations Congress may find 
necessary for securing the title in such soil to the bona-fide pur 
chasers. No tax shall be imposed on lands the property of the 
United States, and in no case shall non-resident proprietors be 
taxed higher than residents. The navigable waters leading into 



1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 28 1 

the Mississippi and the St. Lawrence, and the carrying places be 
tween the same, shall be common highways and forever free as 
well to the inhabitants of the said Territory, as to the citizens of 
the United States and those of any other State that may be 
admitted into the Confederacy, without any tax, duty or impost 
therefor. 

ART. V. There shall be formed in said Territory not less than 
three nor more than five States, and the boundaries of the States, 
as soon as Virginia shall alter her act of cession, and consent to 
the same, shall become fixed and established as follows, to wit : 
The Western State in the said Territory shall be bounded by the 
Mississippi, the Ohio, and the Wabash Rivers, a direct line drawn 
from the Wabash and Fort Vincents due north to the territorial 
line between the United States and Canada, and by the said terri 
torial line to the Lake of the Woods and Mississippi. The Mid 
dle State shall be bounded by the said direct line ; the Wabash 
from Fort Vincents to the Ohio, by a direct line drawn due north 
from the mouth of the Great Miami to the said territorial line, 
and by the said territorial line. The Eastern State shall be 
bounded by the last mentioned direct line, the Ohio, Pennsyl 
vania, and the said territorial line ; provided, however, and it is 
further understood and declared that the boundaries of these 
three States shall be subject so far to be altered, that if Congress 
shall hereafter find it expedient, they shall have authority to form 
one or two States in the part of the said Territory which lies north 
of an east and west line drawn through the southerly bend or ex 
treme of Lake Michigan ; and whenever any of the said States 
shall have 60,000 free inhabitants therein, such State shall be 
admitted by its delegates into the Congress of the United States, 
on an equal footing in all respects whatever with the original 
States, and shall be at liberty to form a permanent Constitution 
and State Government, provided the Constitution and Govern 
ment so to be formed shall be republican and in conformity to 
the general principles contained in these Articles, and so far as it 
can be consistent with the general interests of the Confederacy. 
Such admission shall be allowed at an earlier period, and when 
there may be a less number of free inhabitants in a State than 
60,000. 

ART. VI. There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary ser- 



282 RUFUS KING. [1787 

vitude in the said Territory, otherwise than in the punishment of 
crime, and whereof the party shall have been duly convicted ; 
provided always that any person escaping into the same, from 
whom labor or service is lawfully claimed in any one of the origi 
nal States, such fugitives may be lawfully reclaimed and conveyed 
to the person claiming his or her labor or service as aforesaid. 

Be it ordained by the authority aforesaid, That the resolutions of 
the 23d April, 1784, relative to the subject of this ordinance 
be, and the same are hereby repealed and declared null and 
void. 

Mr. King, though a member of the Congress which passed 
this ordinance, was not present at the time, having left his 
seat in Congress on the last day of May, when a quorum was 
had (the nth), and proceeded to take his place as a mem 
ber of the convention for forming the Constitution of the 
United States, which was to assemble in Philadelphia on the 
following Monday, I4th May. But the debate on this ordi 
nance would seem to have taken place before it was recom 
mitted to Mr. Carrington s committee, of which Mr. Dane 
was a member ; for, after the report of it back again by this 
Committee, no debate was had the ordinance had its three 
separate readings on three successive days ; of course, there 
fore, all the details and all the principles had been settled 
before, and during previous discussion. Mr. Jefferson, for 
whom the chief merit of this ordinance is claimed, was not 
( .in the House nor in the country during this discussion ; and 
; a comparison of his resolutions of April, 84, given above, 
I with the ordinance of " 87," will show how much more 
copious, comprehensive, and far-reaching are the wise and 
beneficent provisions in the latter. 

Of many of these provisions a large share may be claimed 
as the suggestion, or the work of Mr. King, and especially 
the great and desirable one rendering the soil forever in 
capable of slavery. As this is the great distinction of the 
ordinance, it shall be examined thoroughly. The proviso 
prepared by Mr. Jefferson in 1784, and voted for by him 



1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 283 

throughout and against the voice of his colleagues, was in 
these words: " That after the year 1800 of the Christian 
era, there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude 
in any of the said States otherwise than in punishment of 
crimes whereof the party shall have been convicted to have 
been personally guilty." This proviso, one of those which 
were to be fundamental articles of compact, unchangeable 
except by the consent of both parties, was, as has already 
been stated, struck out on the I9th of April, the residue of 
the ordinance being adopted on the 23d. Mr. Jefferson, a 
few days afterwards, vacated his seat in Congress, and Mr. 
King as yet had not sat there at all. His first appearance 
in Congress was in December, 1784. In the course of the 
ensuing spring, the bill for ascertaining the best mode of 
locating and disposing of the western lands became a sub 
ject of discussion, and warmly enlisted Mr. King s attention 
and interest, as expressed both by the record of the Journal, 
and more strikingly by the correspondence (of which the 
originals are in my hand) with Elbridge Gerry, Timothy 
Pickering, and other leading men of the day. It is foreign 
to the purpose of this discussion to enter into the general 
scope of this correspondence, and it is only referred to now 
to bring out of it the proof of how early and how earnestly 
Mr. King s attention was turned to the duty of preventing 
the spread of slavery. 

Under date of March 8, 1785, Timothy Pickering thus 
writes to Mr. King, then attending Congress, in New York : 

" Yesterday I was favored with a letter from Mr. Gerry, inclos 
ing the draft of ordinance, for ascertaining the mode of locating 
and disposing of lands in the Western Territory, and desiring me 
to communicate to you such thoughts on the subject as may be 
judged to have a beneficial tendency." 

Mr. Pickering goes on to suggest, at considerable length, 
and with thorough knowledge, various provisions which 
should be embodied in such a law, and closed his letter with 



284 RUFUS KING. [1787 

this reference to Mr. Jefferson s resolution of April, 1784, 
and especially to the proviso of freedom : 

" There is an article in the report of the Committee on which 
that act was made which I am extremely sorry to see was re 
jected. The Committee proposed that after the year 1800 there 
should be no slavery in the new States. I hardly have patience 
to write on a subject in which what is right is so obvious and 
just, and what is wrong is so derogatory to Americans, above all 
men so inhuman, so iniquitous in itself." 

In a still longer letter written on the evening of the same 
day, 8th March, 1785 (the two letters filling eleven pages of 
foolscap paper), Mr. Pickering thus reverts to the topic of 
slavery : 

" In looking over the act of Congress of April 23, 1784 (Mr. 
Jefferson s) and the present report of an ordinance relative to 
these lands, I observe no provision is made for ministers of the 
gospel, nor even for schools or academies. The latter might 
have been brought into view ; though after the admission of 
slavery, it was right to say nothing of Christianity. Yet so glar 
ing an inconsistency would not have occasioned much surprise. 
It is easy to be inconsistent. Congress once made this important 
declaration * that all men are created equal, that they are endowed 
by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these 
are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and these truths 
were held to be self-evident. These great truths were echoed 
through the United States ; nevertheless a proposition for pre 
venting the violation of these truths, in a country yet unsettled, 
and from which such violence might easily have been excluded, 
did not obtain. What pretense (argument there could be none) 
could be offered for its rejection ? I should indeed have objected 
to the period proposed (the year 1800) for the exclusion of 
Slavery ; for the admission of it for a day or an hour ought to 
have been forbidden. It will be infinitely easier to prevent the 
evil at first, than to eradicate it or check it at any future time. 
How would Congress wish these new States to be settled ? By 
slaves or by freemen ? Take any period, say fifty years will 
these States in that time have more acres of improved lands by 



1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 285 

the admission than by the exclusion of slaves ? In respect to 
population or improvement compare Pennsylvania with Mary 
land and Virginia, particularly the latter ; the conclusion is 
obvious. But why do I expostulate with you who already see 
all the reasons on this subject in points of view more striking 
than I can place them ? Forgive me if my solicitude to prevent 
the greatest of evils has rendered me prolix. To suffer the con 
tinuance of slaves, till they can be gradually emancipated, in 
States already overrun with them, may be pardonable because 
unavoidable without hazarding greater evil ; but to introduce 
them into countries where none now exist, countries which have 
been talked of, which we have boasted of, as asylums for the 
oppressed of the earth, can never be forgiven. For God s sake, 
then, let one more effort be made to prevent so terrible a calam 
ity. The fundamental Constitutions of these States are yet liable 
to alteration, and this is probably the only time when the evil can 
certainly be prevented." 

This earnest, honest, and impassioned appeal from one 
who was still wearing the uniform of a soldier of freedom, 
who through the trials and perils of the revolutionary war had 
nobly done his part fell not upon an unwilling heart, for 
it was within a week of the date of Mr. Pickering s letter, 
that on the i6th of March, Mr. King introduced his proviso 
of freedom, differing essentially from that of Mr. Jefferson 
in that it was of immediate and not prospective application, 
that it forbade then and forever the existence of slavery in 
all the regions embraced in the law of 1784, whereas Mr. 
Jefferson was for planting it there, and after fifteen years of 
growth, then eradicating it. Mr. King thought with Mr. 
Pickering, that the admission of slaves (slavery) for a day 
or for an hour into a region before exempt from it, was not to 
be endured. 

On the 1 5th of April the day after the grand committee 
of which Mr. King was a member, reported to Congress the 
ordinance locating and disposing of the public lands, which 
became a law on the 2Oth May following Mr. King thu.v 
acknowledges Mr. Pickering s letter : 



286 RUFUS KING. [1787 

" NEW YORK, April 15, 1785. 

" The best return in my power to make you for your ingen 
ious communications on the mode of disposing of the Western 
Territory is to inclose for your examination, the form of an 
ordinance reported to Congress on the subject. . . . / like 
wise inclose the report on a motion for the exclusion of Slavery from 
the new States. Your ideas on this subject are so just that it 
would be be impossible to differ from them." 

Of the report on the exclusion of slavery here mentioned 
no trace is to be found. It must refer, one would suppose, 
to the resolution submitted by Mr. King himself on the 
i6th of March, and committed on that day, but no allusion 
in the Journal, nor any other than thus casually in Mr. 
King s letter to Mr. Pickering, has been found. 

But it is certain that Mr. King did not abate of his zeal 
on the subject, and when in November, 85, Nathan Dane 
became one of his colleagues from Massachusetts, and a new 
ordinance for governing the Western Territory came under 
the consideration of Congress, as has already been related, 
in September, 86, and in varying shapes occupied its atten 
tion at times through the residue of that year and through 
the year 1787, until its final adoption in July of the last 
year, it is on the records of the Journal that Mr. King took 
constant and earnest part in its discussion. If then, in the 
ordinance as finally adopted, shall be found embodied specific 
propositions made by Mr. King and by him only and if it 
shall appear, as now I am about to make it appear, that the 
authorship of the ordinance was Mr. Dane s, and not Mr. 
Jefferson s, as has been so long claimed, and recently with 
emphatic and confident argument by Governor Coles, form 
erly of Illinois the deduction would seem legitimate and 
conclusive that Mr. Dane, acting with his colleague, had 
accepted and embodied his suggestions in this ordinance. 

Let the chief of these suggestions be briefly set forth : 

First, and most important, is that prohibiting Slavery. 
Mr. Jefferson s proviso was prospective ; that of Mr. King s 



I7 8y] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 287 

immediate ; the proviso of the ordinance of 87 was immediate, 
and in the identical words offered by Mr. King, the i6th 
March, 1785, except that his proviso reached to all the ter 
ritory embraced in Mr. Jefferson s resolutions of April, 84, 
while that of the ordinance was restricted (necessarily per 
haps) to the precise territory which that ordinance was 
framed to govern. In other respects, the language is iden 
tical, changing only the words, " shall have been personally 
guilty," as used by Mr. King, to " shall have been duly con 
victed," in the ordinance. Mr. Dane nowhere appears on 
the record to have made any motion himself in Congress, on 
the subject of slavery, and, therefore, finding that of Mr. 
King in the Journals, and having it urged upon his attention 
doubtless by Mr. King himself he adopted it as his own. 

Art. III. of the fundamental articles, thus stipulates : 
" Religion, morality, and knowledge being necessary to 
good government and the happiness of mankind, schools 
and the means of education shall forever be encouraged." 

Of this there is nothing in the Jefferson resolution of 
April, 84, but the extracts given from Mr. Pickering s letters 
and the Journals of Congress, during 85-86, when the land 
ordinances were under discussion, show how perseveringly 
and to a certain extent successfully Mr. King labored to ob 
tain, for the purposes of education and of religion, reserved 
townships in every range. 

And last, and hardly perhaps second in importance to the 
first the proviso of freedom ; of a kin, indeed, with it, is 
that proviso, incalculable in its value as a bond of union- 
incalculable in its value to commercial intercourse and to 
good neighborhood, which stipulates " that the navigable 
waters leading into the Mississippi and the St. Lawrence, 
and the carrying places between the same, shall be common 
highways and forever free, as well to the inhabitants of the 
said Territory as to the citizens of the United States, and 
those of any other States that may be admitted into the 
Confederacy, without any tax, impost, or duty therefor." 

This in the first instance was due to the far-reaching and 



288 RUFUS KING. [1787 

statesmanlike suggestions of Timothy Pickering, and was 
introduced in Congress by the joint agency of Virginia and 
Massachusetts States which then stood, as during the war 
they had stood, shoulder to shoulder on so many trying oc 
casions. Mr. Pickering, in a letter to Rufus King of the 8th 
of March, 85, discussing the ordinance then under the con 
sideration of Congress, for regulating the Western Territory, 
thus sagaciously writes : 

" Water communication in that country will always be in 
the highest degree interesting to the inhabitants. It seems 
very necessary to secure the freedom of navigating these to 
all the inhabitants of the States. I hope we shall have no 
Scheldts in this country." 

So wise a suggestion was not lost upon his correspondent, 
and, accordingly, on the I2th of March, 1786, while the or 
dinance " for ascertaining the mode of locating and dispos 
ing of the public lands in the Western Territory " was under 
consideration, Mr. Grayson of Virginia, who, as the Jour 
nals show, acted very frequently with Mr. King, and who 
separated from his colleagues and voted aye on Mr. King s 
anti-slavery proviso on the i6th of March of the same year, less 
than two months before moved this resolution, which was 
seconded by Mr. King and adopted : " Resolved, that the 
navigable waters, leading into the Mississippi and the St. 
Lawrence and the carrying places between the same be, and 
are hereby declared to be, common highways and to be for 
ever free as well to the inhabitants of the said Territory as 
to the citizens of the United States and those of any other 
States that may be admitted into the Confederacy, and with 
out any tax, duty, or impost therefor." 

This resolution, without the change of a letter, is embod 
ied in the Ordinance of 87 ; and thus we see that the two 
important provisos the one against slavery extension, and 
the other for the inviolable freedom to all American citi 
zens, in all time and exempt from all impost or taxation, of 
the great navigable waters of the Union, designed by God 
himself as the highways of nations originally proposed or

promoted by Mr. King, were taken by Mr. Dane from the 
records of Congress, and introduced into his immortal ordi 
nance. 

And now for the conclusive proof that this ordinance 
was his prepared and drafted by him, and accepted unani 
mously by Congress, almost without alteration. This proof 
is in the letter, of which the annexed is a full, literal, and 
exact copy from the original in my hands. * 

NEW YORK, July 16, 1787. 
To the Hon. Rufus King, Esq., Philadelphia. 

DEAR SIR I am obliged to you for yours of the nth inst ; with 
pleasure I communicate to you what we are doing in Congress, 
not so much from a consciousness that what we do is well done, 
as from a desire that you may be acquainted with our proceed 
ings. We have been much engaged in business for ten or twelve 
days, for a part of which we have had eight States. There seems 
to be a disposition to do business and the arrival of R. H. Lee is 
of considerable importance. I think his character serves, at least 
in some degree, to check the effects of the feeble habits and lax 
mode of thinking of some of his countrymen. We have been 
employed about several objects the principal of which have 
been the government inclosed f and the Ohio purchase ; the 
former you will see is completed and the latter will probably be 
completed tomorrow. We tried one day to patch up | M . . . s 
p. system of W. Government started new ideas and " committed 
the whole to Carrington, Dane, R. H. Lee, Smith and Kean. We 
met several times, and at last agreed on some principles at least 
Lee, Smith and myself. We found ourselves rather pressed. 
The Ohio company appeared to purchase a large tract of federal 
lands about six or seven millions of acres and we wanted to 
abolish the old system and get a better one for the government of 
the country, and we finally found it necessary to adopt the best 
system we could get. All agreed finally to the inclosed plan ex-

cept A. Yates. He appeared in this case, as in most others, not 
to understand the subject at all. I think the number of free in 
habitants, 60,000, which are requisite for the admission of a new 
State into the Confederacy, is too small ; but, having divided the 
whole Territory into three States, this number appears to me to be 
less important. Each State in the common course of things must 
become important soon after it shall have that number of inhabi 
tants. The Eastern State of the three will probably be the first, 
and more important than the rest, and will no doubt be settled 
chiefly by Eastern people ; and there is, I think, full an equal 
chance of its adopting Eastern politics. When I drew the ordi 
nance (which passed, a few words excepted, as I originally formed 
it) I had no idea the States would agree to the sixth article, prohib 
iting slavery, as only Massachusetts of the Eastern States was 
present, and therefore omitted it in the draft ; but finding the 
House favorably disposed on this subject, after we had completed 
the other parts, I moved the article, which was agreed to with 
out opposition. We are in a fairway to fix the terms of our Ohio 
sale, &amp;c. We have been upon it three days steadily. The mag 
nitude of the purchase makes us very cautious about the terms of 
it and the security necessary to insure the performance of it. 

We have directed the Board to examine and report on 
Holkar s affair. 

Massachusetts Legislature was prorogued on the yth inst., 
having continued the Tender Act, as it is called, to January, 
1788 ; and having passed no other act of importance, except what 
I presume you have seen respecting the raising of troops and the 
power of the Governor to pursue the rebels.* You ask me how 
I like my new colleagues. Sedgewick, you know, we all esteem ; 
but I fear he will not make his attendance an object. Thacher 
I am not acquainted with. I do not know whether Mr. Otis, at 
his period of life, and under his misfortunes, will enter with vigor 
into Federal politics. I wish his accounts with the Union had 
been settled, &amp;c. 

Nothing more worth particular notice. 

Your affectionate friend, 

N. DANE.

P. S. States present, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, 
Delaware, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. 
Brother Holten is rather an invalid ; is not able to take an 
active part in business, but I think supports pretty good Eastern 
politics. 

This letter, now for the first time made public, was writ 
ten, it will be seen, three days only after the passing of the 
famous ordinance, before there was any controversy about 
it, and without consciousness, so far as the modest tenor of 
the whole letter can witness, of the priceless value of the 
act thus perfected. The course of the preparation, discus 
sion, and final adoption of the ordinance is related with 
entire simplicity. No doubt, therefore, can now be enter 
tained that Mr. Dane did frame the ordinance throughout ; 
that it was he who directed the mode of presenting it to the 
House and carrying it through all its stages. 

Mr. Carrington of Virginia, named first on the committee, 
and, therefore, by usage its chairman, did not, as appears by 
this letter, agree with the majority of the committee, and, 
therefore probably declined to report the ordinance, devolv 
ing that duty on Mr. Dane, who stood next on the list, and 
who was in the majority. This explains what heretofore 
has not been understood, how Mr. Dane, the second on the 
committee, came to be its reporter ; and the almost literal 
accuracy is hereby established of the account given by 
Daniel Webster, in his oration against Hayne, on the Foot 
resolutions, in the U. S. Senate, in 18 , that this ordinance 
41 was drawn by Nathan Dane, and adopted by Congress 
without the slightest alteration." " A few words excepted," 
says Mr. Dane, " and the ordinance passed as I originally 
formed it." 

Having thus established the conclusiveness of the claim of 
authorship of the Ordinance of 87 for Nathan Dane, and 
shown that to Rufus King, and indirectly to Timothy Pick 
ering, belongs the suggestion of the provisos contained in 
it against slavery and for aids to religion and knowledge,

and for assuring forever the common use, without charge, of 
the great national highways of the Mississippi, the St. Law 
rence, and their tributaries and their carrying-places, to all 
citizens of the United States ; and having, at the same time, 
by spreading in extenso, before the readers of this chapter, 
both the resolution of Mr. Jefferson, of April, 84, and the 
Ordinance of 87, put it within their reach to compare 
these instruments, and thus ascertain how much of one is 
borrowed from, or is suggested by, the other, it may 
be said in conclusion that, in endeavoring to assign to each 
of the prominent actors in this great scene his due merit 
and responsibility, no desire has been felt, nor, it is hoped, 
manifested, even unconsciously, of magnifying any one at 
the expense of others. Enough of enduring reputation for 
each and all must forever honor the names of Dane and 
Jefferson, of Pickering and King, for the part taken by each 
in the long, laborious, and eventful struggle, which had so 
glorious a consummation in the ordinance consecrating for 
ever, by one imprescriptible and unchangeable muniment, 
the very heart of our land to Freedom, Knowledge, and 
Union. 



CHAPTER XVI. 

The federal Constitution of 1787 Received by Congress Ordered to be trans 
mitted to the State Legislatures Massachusetts Convention assembled 
January, 1788 Rufus King a Member His Course and Speeches in it 
Favored biennial Elections Objected to Property Qualification Repre 
sentation and Taxation go together Approves of the Provisions relative 
to the Senate and to the Powers of Congress Amendments Speech on 
the Adoption of the Constitution. 

The new Constitution adopted by the Convention was 
reported to Congress on September 28, 1787, and on the 
same day it was unanimously resolved*: "That the said 
report, with the resolution and letter f accompanying the 
same, be transmitted to the several legislatures in order to 
be submitted to a Convention of Delegates chosen in each 
state by the people thereof, in conformity with the resolves 
of the Convention made and provided in that case." 

To the Convention ordered in Massachusetts, Mr. King 
was elected by the people of Newburyport, who had origi 
nally sent him to the General Court of Massachusetts, from 
which he had been transferred to Congress in 1784. They 
justly thought that he who was one of its framers, though 
at that time they knew not how largely he had been instru 
mental in making it, would best interpret the new Constitu 
tion, set forth its merits, and advocate its adoption. The 
Convention was to assemble early in January of the next 
year, and although he fully intended to take part in its 
deliberations, domestic questions in New York made him

hesitate to set out on his journey and separate himself from 
his wife. The correspondence will show the reasons for his 
delay in reporting himself in Boston, though in the end he 
reached there in good time ; and, as will be seen by the 
abstract of his remarks during the discussion, gave an earn 
est and able advocacy of the Constitution, which, after a 
long and obstinate opposition, was finally adopted by the 
Convention. 

It is intended to give here the speeches of Mr. King, as 
reported in the proceedings of the Massachusetts Conven 
tion in the second volume of Elliot s Debates, and thus to 
show how far he was, with the able friends who supported 
him, instrumental in bringing about the adoption of the new 
Constitution by the State of Massachusetts. 

On the first day of assembling we find the following reso 
lution adopted * : 

On motion of the Hon. Mr. Adams, Fbta/That the Convention 
will attend morning prayers daily and that the gentlemen of the 
clergy, of every denomination, be requested to officiate in turn." 

The first question which produced discussion was as to 
the expediency of holding biennial elections of representa 
tives in Congress. This was the subject of extended re 
marks by Mr. King, which are here given, f 

The Convention would do well to lay aside the terms annual 
or biennial, and consider the subject as it could be supported by 
principles. Much had been said of the instruction to be derived 
from history on this point ; he said he presumed to doubt whether 
this was the case. From the continent of Europe he believed 
that we could receive no instruction. Their Parliaments, after 
the overthrow of the Roman Empire, were not constructed upon 
the principle of a representation of the people. The conqueror 
of a given district of country was, by the feudal system, the 
prince or king of the people within his conquered territories. 
When he wished the advice of any persons, he summoned usually 

* Elliot s Debates, vol. ii., 2. 
f Elliot s Debates, vol. ii., p. 18. 



1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 2g$ 

a number of his principal officers, or the barons of his kingdom 
to give him their counsel ; but the people, or, as they were de- 
gradingly called, the vassals, were never consulted. This cer 
tainly cannot be considered as a representation of the people. 
This mode of assembling a parliament probably obtained in the 
early stages of the English history ; but those who have written 
upon this subject agree that their information is very imperfect, 
relative to the origin of the English Parliament ; they are not 
certain who composed the Parliament, how long they held their 
office, or concerning what points they were consulted. 

Nothing clear upon this subject appears before the i2th cen 
tury. Magna Charta is the foundation of the imperfect repre 
sentation of England. Improvements have since been made in 
favor of more equal and certain representation of the people ; 
but it is still imperfect and insecure. Perhaps the people of 
America are the first who, by the social compact, ever obtained 
a right to a full and fair representation, in making the laws of 
their country. 

If, then, history can afford little or no instruction on the sub 
ject, the Convention must determine the question upon its own 
principles. It seems proper that the representative should be in 
office time enough to acquire that information which is necessary 
to form a right judgment ; but that the time should not be so 
long as to remove from his mind the powerful check upon his 
conduct, that arises from the frequency of elections, whereby the 
people are enabled to remove an unfaithful representative, or to 
continue a faithful one. If the question is examined by this 
standard, perhaps it will appear that an election for two years is 
short enough for a representative in Congress. If one year is 
necessary for a representative to be useful in the State Legisla 
ture, where the objects of his deliberations are local, and within 
his constant observation, two years do not appear too long, where 
the objects of deliberation are not confined to one State, but 
extend to thirteen States ; where the complicated interests of 
United America are mingled with those of foreign nations ; and 
where the great duties of national sovereignty will require his 
constant attention. When the representatives of the colony of 
Massachusetts were first chosen, the country was not settled 
more than twenty miles from Boston ; they then held their offices 



296 RUFUS KING. [1787 

for one year. The immigrants from Massachusetts, who settled 
on Connecticut River, appointed the representatives to meet in 
the General Court of that colony for only six months. Massa- 
chussetts although her settlements have extended over almost the 
whole territory, has continued to depute representatives for only 
one year and Connecticut for only six months ; but as in each of 
those colonies, when under the British government, the duties of 
the representatives were merely local, the great duties of sover 
eignty being vested in their King, so since the Revolution, their 
duties have continued local, many of the authorities of sovereignty 
being vested in Congress. It is now proposed to increase 
the powers of Congress ; this will increase the duties of the 
representatives and they must have a reasonable time to obtain the 
information necessary to a right discharge of their office. 

It has been said that our ancestors never relinquished the idea 
of annual elections ; this is an error. In 1643 the Colonies of 
Plymouth, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Haven united 
in a confederacy, which continued about forty years ; each 
colony sent two commissioners as their representatives, and by 
the articles they were to be annually elected. About the year 
1650, the General Court of Massachusetts instructed their com 
missioners to propose that the elections, instead of being annual, 
should be only once in three years. The alteration did not take 
place, but the anecdote proves that our ancestors have not had a 
uniform predilection for annual elections. 

He concluded by observing that, on a candid examination of 
this question, he presumed that the Constitution would not be 
objected to on account of the biennial election of the House of 
Representatives. 

It was urged farther on that some qualification of property in a 
representative should have been adopted. 

Mr. King said * : That gentlemen had made it a question why 
a qualification of property in a representative is omitted, and that 
they thought the provision of such a qualification necessary. He 
thought otherwise ; he never knew that property was an index to 
abilities. We often see men, who, though destitute of property, 
are superior in knowledge and rectitude. The men who have 
most injured the country have most commonly been rich men. 
* Elliot s Debates, ii., 35. 



1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 297 

Such a qualification was proposed in Convention, but by the 
delegates of Massachusetts it was contested that it should not 
obtain. He observed that there was no such qualification by the 
confederation. In reply to General Thompson s question, why 
disqualification by age was not added, he said that it would not 
extend to all parts of the continent alike. Life, in a great meas 
ure, depends on climate. What in the Southern States would be 
accounted long life, would be but the meridian in the northern ; 
what here is the time of ripened judgment is old age there. There 
fore the want of such a disqualification cannot be made an objec 
tion to the Constitution. 

When the paragraph relating to representation and taxa 
tion was read, Mr. King said * : 

There has been much misconception of this section. It is a 
principle of this Constitution that representation and taxation 
should go hand in hand. This paragraph states that by the num 
ber of free persons, including those bound to service for a term 
of years, and, excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other 
persons (these persons are the slaves^] by these are representation 
and taxation to be apportioned. And this rule was adopted, be 
cause it was the language of all America. According to the Con 
federation, ratified in 1781, the sums for the general welfare and 
defence, should be apportioned according to the surveyed lands, 
and improvements thereon, in the several States : but that it hath 
never been in the power of Congress to follow that rule, the re 
turns from the several states being so very imperfect. 

In answer to a question by Mr. Widgery, if a boy of six 
years of age was to be considered as a free person, Mr. King 
said : 

All persons born free were to be considered as freemen ; and to 
make the idea of taxation by numbers more intelligible, said t\\a.tfive 
negro children of South Carolina are to pay as much tax as the three 
Governors of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. 

The construction of the Senate being under discussion, 
Mr. King said f : 

* Elliot s Debates, ii., 36. 
f Elliot s Debates, ii., 47. 



RUFUS KING. [1787 



As the Senate preserved the equality of the states, their ap 
pointment is equal. To the objection to this branch, that it is 
chosen for too long a period, he observed if the principle of class 
ing them is considered, although it appears long, it will not be 
found so long as it appears. One class is to serve two years* 
another four years and another six years ; the average therefore is 
four years. The senators will have a powerful check in those men 
who wish their seats, who will watch their whole conduct in the 
general government, and will give the alarm in case of mis 
behavior. And the state legislatures, if they find their delegates 
erring, can and will instruct them. Will not this be a check ? 
When they hear the voice of the people solemnly dictating to them 
their duty, they will be bold men indeed to act contrary to it. 
These will not be instructions sent them in a private letter, which 
can be put in their pockets ; they will be public instructions, 
which all the country will see, and they will be hardy men indeed 
to violate them.* The powers to control the Senate are as great 
as ever were enjoyed in any government ; and the members, 
therefore, will be found not to be chosen for too long a time. 
They are to assist the executive in the designation and appoint 
ment of officers ; and they ought to have time to mature their 
judgment. If for a shorter period, how can they be acquainted 
with the rights and interests of nations, so as to form advanta 
geous treaties ? To understand these rights is the business of 
education. Their business being naturally different and more 
extensive than the other branch, they ought to have different 
qualifications ; and their duration is not too long for a right dis 
charge of their duty. 

A discussion arose as to whether it was wise to give Con 
gress the power of regulating the election of its own mem 
bers, and Dr. Taylor, of Douglass,f " wished to ask the 
gentleman from Newburyport (Mr. King), whether the two 
branches of Congress could not agree to play into each 

* It will be seen that Mr. King had no doubt of the right possessed by the 
Legislatures of the States, to instruct their representatives in the Senate of the 
United States, and of the obligation on the part of these Senators to obey their 
instructions. ED.

1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 299 

other s hands ; and by making the qualifications of electors 
;ioo by their power of regulating elections, fix the matter 
of elections so as to keep themselves in." 

Hon. Mr. King rose to pursue the inquiry why the "place 
and manner " of holding elections were omitted in the 
section under debate. He said : 

It was to be observed that in the Constitution of Massachusetts 
and other states the manner and place of elections were provided 
for ; the manner was by ballot, and the places towns ; for, said 
he, we happened to settle originally in townships. But it was 
different in the Southern States ; he would mention an instance. 
In Virginia there are but fifteen or twenty towns, and seventy or 
eighty counties ; therefore no rule could be adopted to apply to 
the whole. If it was practicable, he said, it would be necessary 
to have a district the fixed place ; but this is liable to exceptions ; 
as a district that may now be fully settled, may in time be 
scarcely inhabited ; and the back country, now scarcely inhabited, 
may be fully settled. Suppose this State thrown into eight 
districts, and a member apportioned to each ; if the numbers 
increase, the representatives and districts will be increased. The 
matter, therefore, must be left subject to the regulation of the 
state legislature, or the general government. Suppose the state 
legislature, the circumstances will be the same. It is truly said, 
that our representatives are but a part of the Union ; that they 
may be subject to the control of the rest ; but our representatives 
make a ninth part of the whole ; and if any authority is vested in 
Congress, it must be in our favor. But to the subject. In Con 
necticut they do not choose by numbers, but by corporations. 
Hartford, one of the largest towns, sends no more delegates than 
one of their smaller corporations, each town sending two, except 
latterly, when a town was divided. The same rule is about to be 
adopted in Rhode Island. The inequality of such representation, 
where every corporation would have an equal right to send an 
equal number of representatives, was apparent. In the Southern 
States the inequality is greater. By the Constitution of South 
Carolina, the city of Charleston has a right to send thirty repre 
sentatives to the General Assembly ; the whole number of which 
amounts to two hundred. The back parts of Carolina have in- 



30O RUFUS KING. [1787 

creased greatly since the adoption of their constitution, and have 
frequently attempted an alteration of this unequal mode of repre 
sentation ; but the members from Charleston, having the balance 
so much in their favor, will not consent to an alteration ; and we 
see that the delegates from Carolina in Congress have always been 
chosen by the delegates of that city. The representatives, there 
fore, from that state will not be chosen by the people, but will be 
the representatives of a faction of that state. If the general gov 
ernment cannot control in this case, how are the people secure ? 
The idea of the honorable gentleman from Douglass, said he, 
transcends my understanding ; for the power of control given by 
this section extends to the manner of election, not the qualifications 
of the electors. The qualifications are age and residence, and 
none can be preferable. 

The powers of Congress being before the convention, Mr. 
King said * : 

Mr. President it is painful for me to obtrude my sentiments 
on the Convention so frequently. However, Sir, I console myself 
with the idea that my motives are as good as those of more able 
gentlemen, who have remained silent. Sir, this is a very import 
ant clause, and of the highest consequence to the future fortune 
of the people of America. It is not my intention to go into any 
elaborate discussion of the subject. I shall only offer those con 
siderations which have influenced my mind in favor of the article, 
in the hope that it may tend to reconcile gentlemen to it. It 
shall not be with a view of exhibiting any particular knowledge of 
mine ; for such is not my intention. Hitherto we have considered 
the construction of the general government. We now come, Sir, 
to the consideration of the powers with which the government 
shall be clothed. The introduction to the Constitution is in these 
words : We, the people, &amp;c. The language of the Confederation is, 
We, the States, &amp;c. The latter is a mere federal government of 
states. Those, therefore, that assemble under it, have no power 
to make laws to apply to the individuals of the states confeder 
ated ; and the attempts to make laws for collective societies 
necessarily leave a discretion to comply with them or not. In no

1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 30 1 

instance has there been so frequent deviation from first princi 
ples, as in the neglect or refusal to comply with the requisitions 
of general governments for the collection of moneys. 

In the ancient governments this has been the principal defect. 
In the United Provinces of the Netherlands, it has been conspicu 
ously so. A celebrated political writer I mean John Dewitt, 
formerly pensioner of Holland said that in the Confederacy of 
1570, though the articles were declared equally binding on the 
several provinces, yet any one had it in its power to comply with 
the requisition of the generality or not ; and some provinces, tak 
ing advantage of this discretionary power, never paid anything. 
During forty years of war with Spain, the province of Holland 
paid fifty-eight parts of a hundred of all the expenses thereof. Two 
or three of the provinces never so much as passed a resolution to 
pay anything : and Dewitt says two of them paid not a single 
guilder. What was the consequence ? In one instance, Holland 
compelled a neighboring province to comply with the requisitions, 
by marching a force into it. This was a great instance of usur 
pation, made in the time of war. The Prince of Orange, and the 
generality, found that they could not continue war in this man 
ner. What was to be done? They were obliged to resort to the 
expedient of doubling the ordinary requisitions on the states. 
Some of the provinces were prevailed upon to grant those requi 
sitions fully, in order to induce Holland to do the same. She, 
seeing the other states appearing thus forward, not only granted 
the requisitions, but paid them. The others did not. Thus was 
a single province obliged to bear almost the whole burden of the 
w*ar, and, one hundred years after, the accounts of this war were un 
settled. What was the reason ? Holland had but one voice in the 
States-General That voice was feeble when opposed by the rest. 

This fact is true. The history of our own country is a melan 
choly proof of a similar truth. Massachusetts has paid, while 
other states have been delinquent. How was the war carried on 
with paper money ? Requisitions on the states for that money 
were made. Who paid them ? Massachusetts and a few others. 
A requisition of 29,000,000 of dollars were quotaed on Massachu 
setts, and it was paid. This state has paid in her proportion of 
the old money. How comes it, then, that gentlemen have any of 
this money by them ? Because the other states have shamefully 



302 RUFUS KING. [1787 

neglected to pay their quotas. Do you ask for redress ? you are 
scoffed at. The next requisition was for 11,000,000 of dollars, 
6,000,000 of which was to be paid in facilities, the rest in silver 
money, for discharging the interest of the national debt. If the 
legislatures found a difficulty in paying the hard money, why did 
they not pay the paper? But 1,200,000 dollars have been paid, 
and six states have not paid a farthing of it. 

Two states have not paid a single farthing from the moment 
they signed the Confederation to this day, if my documents are 
to be depended on, and they are open to the inspection of all. 

Now, Sir, what faith is to be put in requisitions on the States 
for moneys to pay our domestic creditors and discharge our 
foreign debts for moneys lent us in the day of difficulty and dis 
tress ? Sir, experience proves, as well as anything can be proved, 
that no dependence can be placed on such requisitions. What 
method, then, can be devised to compel delinquent states to pay 
their quotas ? Sir, I know of none. Laws to be effective, there 
fore, must not be laid on states, but upon individuals. Sir, it has 
been objected to the proposed Constitution, that the power is too 
great, and by this Constitution is to be sacred. But if the want 
of power is the defect in the old Confederation, there is a fitness and 
propriety in adopting what is here proposed. Congress now have 
power to call for what moneys and in what proportion they please ; 
but they have no authority to compel a compliance therewith. It 
is an objection in some men s minds, that Congress should possess 
the power of the purse and the sword. But, Sir, I would ask 
whether any government can exist, or give security to the people, 
which is not possessed of this power. The first revenue will be 
raised from the impost, to which there is no objection, the next 
from the excise ; and, if these are not sufficient, direct taxes must 
be laid. To conclude, Sir, if we mean to support an efficient 
federal government, which under the old Confederation, can never 
be the case, the proposed Constitution is, in my opinion, the only 
one that can be substituted. 

The fifth article, providing for amendments to the Con 
stitution, was the subject of the following remarks by Mr 
King*: 

* Elliot s Debates, ii., 116 



1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 303 

He believed gentlemen had not, in their objections to the 
Constitution, recollected that this article was a part of it ; for 
many of the arguments of gentlemen were founded on the idea 
of future amendments being impracticable. He observed on the 
superior excellence of the proposed Constitution in this particular, 
and called upon gentlemen to produce an instance, in any other 
national constitution where the people had so fair an opportunity 
to correct any abuse which might take place in the future admin 
istration of the government under it. 

Notes of a speech in the convention of Massachusetts 
on the adoption of the Constitution in Rufus King s hand 
writing : 

The provision in the report of the Convention authorizes one 
Rep. for every 30,000 Inhabitants, ascertained as is there proposed. 
From the best materials that have been collected, the United 
States at this Time contain 3 mils, of Inhab. comprehending all 
the free Inhabitants and f only of the Slaves. This number 
wd give 100 Rep. ; it is sure that the first house will consist of 
only 65 members ; but the Congress must cause the number of 
Inhab. to be taken within three yrs, and may do it within one. 
If the present numbers will give 100 Reps., and the Opinion is 
well founded, which we take to be the case, that the people of 
America double in 25 yrs., then in 25 yrs. the number of Reps, 
may be 200, in 50 years 400, in 75 years 800, and in one century 
1600. It is true that the Rept. does not make it necessary that 
the members shall be thus increased, in a direct proportion ; but it 
cannot be more numerous. This indeed appears to us a sufficient 
provision to produce such a Repn. of the people in the house of 
Reps, as will completely and safely accomplish the objects of 
their appointment. " That the people have no security for the 
right of election," the 2nd objection, is in our judgment as destitute 
of foundation as the first. Mr. Gerry * admits the right of elec- 

* Mr. Gerry, who had refused to sign the Constitution, and had not been 
chosen a member of the Massachusetts convention, was by a vote of that body 
asked to be present during its deliberations, and to address it, showing his ob 
jections to the instrument under consideration. He did so, and Mr. King s 
remarks, as will be seen, are in part in answer to what he said. ED. 



304 RUFUS KING. [1787 

tion to be well deposited ; he agrees that only the Electors of 
Representatives to the most numerous Br. of the State Legislature 
ought to be Electors of Representatives to the federal Govt., and 
then asserts that the exercise of this Right, vested by the Rept. 
in the Electors, is not secured. We are at a loss to know how 
Mr. Gerry would support this assertion, or where the Report is 
defective on this point. The time, place, and manner of electing 
Representatives must in the first instance be prescribed by the 
State Legislatures, but the Congress may make or alter the regula 
tions on the subject : possibly Mr. Gerry may ground his objec 
tion upon this authority s being vested in Congress. We wish to 
submit our remarks on this clause to your candid consideration. 
We agree and have always contended that the people ought 
always to enjoy the exclusive right of appointing their Reps, but 
we also hold it an important principle, that as it is of consequence 
to the Freedom of the people that they should possess the right 
of Election, so it is essential to the preservation and existence of 
the Government, that the people should be bound to exercise it. 
For this reason in the Constitution of Massachussets not only the 
persons are clearly designated and their qualifications ascertained, 
who may vote for Representatives, but the Genl. Court have a 
right to compel the Electors to exercise their right of Election 
and thereby to preserve the Government from Dissolution. 

If the time, place and manner of Electing Representatives to 
the General Court was left entirely to the several Towns in the 
commonwealth, and if the constitution gave no power to the Genl. 
Court to require and compel the towns to elect Representatives, 
there wd. be a manifest defect in the Constitution, which, 
agreeably to the Course of human affairs, might in a short period 
subvert the Government. Town after Town from disaffection or 
other motives might refuse to elect Representatives ; counties 
and larger districts might combine against sending members to 
the General Court, and in this silent manner the Govt. might be 
wholly destroyed. If these remarks are just, as applying to this 
State and prove the propriety of vesting, as the Constitution has 
done, a power in the Genl. Court to compel the Electors to 
exercise their right of Election, they are equally just in Relation 
to Congress, and equally prove the propriety of vesting in that 
assembly a power to compel the Electors of the federal Represen- 



1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 305 

tatives to exercise their rights, and for that purpose, if necessary, 
to make Regulations concerning the time, place and manner of 
electing members of the H. of Reps. 

It may be said that the State Legislatures are more capable of 
regulating this Subject than the Congress ; that Congress may fix 
improper places, inconvenient Times, and a manner of electing 
contrary to the usual practice of the several States. It is not a 
very probable supposition that a law of this nature shd. be 
enacted by Congress : but let the supposition be ever so probable, 
as applied to Congress, it is thirteen times more probable that some 
one of the States may make these inconvenient Regulations as 
that Congress should enact them. Congress will be interested to 
preserve the United States entire and to prevent a dismember 
ment. The individual States may some of them grow rich and 
powerful ; and, as the great members of the antient Confederacies 
have heretofore done, they may be desirous of becoming wholly 
independent of the Union, and therefore may either omit to form 
any Regulations or Laws concerning the Time, place and manner 
of electing federal Rep. or they may fix on improper places, 
inconvenient Times, &amp; a manner of electing wholly disagreeable 
to the people. Should either of these cases take place, and no 
power be vested in Congress to revise their Laws, or to provide 
other Regulations, the Union might be dismembered and dis 
solved without a constitutional power to prevent it. But this re- 
visionary power being vested in Congress, the States will make 
wise and prudent regulations on the subject of Elections ; they 
will do all that is necessary to keep up a Representation of the 
People, because they know that in case of omission the Congress 
will make the necessary provision for this Object. (R. Island 
was required by Cong, (and refused) to send delegates.) 

" Some of the powers of the Legis. are ambiguous and others 
indefinite and dangerous." This clause contains an imputation 
so very general that no reply in detail can be attempted without 
commenting on every sentence wh. forms the Grant of powers to 
Congress. Most of the sentences are transcribed from the 
present Confederation, and we can only observe that it was the 
intention and honest desire of the Convention to use those ex 
pressions that were most easy to be understood and least 
equivocal in their meaning ; and we flatter ourselves they have 



306 RUFUS KING. [1787 

not been entirely disappointed.* We believe that the powers are 
closely denned, the expressions as free from ambiguity as the 
Convention could form them, and we never could have assented 
to the Report, had we supposed the Danger Mr. G. predicts. 

The Executive is blended with and will have an undue 
influence over the Legislature The same objection might be 
made agt. the constitution of this State : the executive (and) 
legislative powers are connected in the same manner by our 
constitution as they are said by Mr. G. to be blended in the 
Rept. of the Convention. When the Govr. objects to a Bill it 
cannot become a law unless f of both branches afterwards concur 
in enacting it ; the same must be done by the Congress provided 
the president objects, but as experience has not proved that one 
Executive has an undue influence over the Legislature, we cannot 
think the objection well founded. 

" The Judicial Department will be oppressive." A concise 
examination of the Report on this subject may refute this unsup 
ported objection. The president with consent of the Senate will 
appoint the Judges. The Governor with advice of Council 
appoints the Judges of this State. The Senate are in this 
instance in the nature of a Council to the President ; and if we 
have no reason to complain of the manner in wh. the Judges in 
this Commonwealth are appointed, from the great similarity in 
the two cases there seems to be no ground of complaint agt. the 
manner of appointing the federal Judges. The Judicial Depart 
ment is divided into a Supreme and inferior Courts. In a few 
enumerated instances the Supreme Court have original and final 
Jurisdiction : in all the other cases which fall within the federal 
Judicial, the Supreme Court may or may not have appellate Juris 
diction as Congress shall direct : for the appellate Jurisdiction of 
the Supreme Court is subject to such exceptions and regulations 
as Congress may think proper to establish ; or in other words 
Congress may determine what causes shall be finally tried in the 
inferior courts, and in what causes appeals shall be allowed to 
the Supreme Court. But it may be said that in a trifling contro 
versy between a citizen of M. and N. H., or between the U. S. 
and a citizen of any individual State, or in any of the cases where 
the Supreme Court have not original Jurisdiction, that either of the 
* Mr. King was one of the Committee on the Revision of Style. 



1787] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 307 

parties may carry the case by appeal from the inferior Court 
before the Supreme Court, and that the place of their session 
may be at one extreme of the Union, and thereby the Department 
may become highly oppressive. The same objection may be 
raised against the Judicial Department, as established in our 
constitution : because the General Court may erect a Supreme 
Court &amp; Courts of common pleas &amp; Justices Courts, it may be 
objected that in a small cause cognizable by a Justice of the 
peace of the County of Lincoln between an inhabitant of Cumber 
land and an inhabitant of Lincoln, or in an excise or impost 
cause between an Inhabitant of Lincoln &amp; the Commonwealth, 
that either of the parties may appeal from the court of the 
Justice to the S. C., and that their sessions may be fixed by the 
G. Court in Berkshire, another extreme of the State, &amp; thus the 
State Judicial may become oppressive. We again repeat a 
remark made on a former occasion, that as experience has not 
shewn this oppression of the Judicial under the constitution of 
the State, and as the General Court have from time to time 
made such laws as have prevented such oppression, we cannot 
but suppose that the members of the federal Government will 
be actuated by motives equally pure, and that they will enact 
laws in like manner tending to the ease and happiness of the 
people. 

Distinction between the power to make a law &amp; the law when 
made. Treaties of &amp;c may be formed by the President with ad 
vice of f of a Quorum of Senate. The clause as it stands in 
the Report is two 3d. of the Senators present. The Senate have 
power over their own members and can compel their attendance ; 
if the Senators are all present, then no Treaty can be formed 
without the consent of nine States or eighteen Senators, and of 
the President. Under the present confederation, Treaties of the 
highest importance can be formed by the Delegates of nine 
States, without the concurrence of any other person ; so that if 
the Senators attend the Duties of their office and they may be 
compelled instead of its being more easy as Mr. G. suggests to 
form Treaties, it in fact may be much more difficult than under 
the present Confederation, and in our judgment the public secu 
rity will not only be increased, but the objects of Treaties will far 
more probably be obtained by the powers of forming them being 



308 RUFUS KING. [1787 

vested in the President &amp; | of the present Senators, than by their 
remaining, as is provided in the present Confedn. 

The Report requires the joint consent of both branches of 
Congress together with ye concurrence of the Presidt. to declare 
war. This is preferable to vesting that power in the President 
and Senate ; and, as war is not to be desired, and always a great 
calamity, by increasing the Checks, the measure will be difficult 
but as peace is forever to be desired, and can be alone obtained 
by Treaty it seemed preferable to trust it with the President &amp; 
Senate. 

When the constitution vests in the Legislature full power and 
authority to make and ordain all manner of wholesome &amp; reason 
able orders, laws, statutes, ordinances, directions &amp; instructions, 
as is the case with the Constn. of this State (Cap. i. Art. i. Seen. 
4), a Declaration or Bill of Rights seems proper : but when the 
powers vested are explicitly denned both as to quantity and the 
manner of their exercise, a Decn. or Bill of Rights is certainly 
unnecessary and improper.

LONDON, January ist. 

DEAR SIR : 

I have received your friendly Letter of the 27th of Oct. ulto. 
from Boston, and must acknowledge myself much obliged by this 
particular mark of your friendship and attention you very justly 
conclude what my feelings have been &amp; still are relative to the 
Conduct of this Court towards our Country. The King and his 
cabinet at the present day, would not be able to justify them 
selves to the nation at large, had they wisdom &amp; spirit enough 
left, to ask for an explanation ; and confident I am, that unless 
they speedily alter their modus agendi, posterity will have just 
cause to loath their memory. But the nation have surrendered 
themselves to Royal Guidance, and will never recollect their situa 
tion untill the Career of administration shall have pressed them 
to the very brink of destruction they are buried in bribery and 
Corruption and laugh Patriotism &amp; public virtue out of Counte 
nance, and as for the King &amp; his cabinet, they would rather 
gratify the envy and spleen of the present moment and risk the 
shocks of fortune, than attempt to submit the direction of their 
conduct to wisdom and Liberality. I cannot recollect a single 

309 



310 RUFUS KING. [1788 

transaction of his reign, but what has tended to an accumulation 
of the misfortunes on his people &amp; seem inclined to hurry them 
on to that crisis, when they will be forced to this decision, whether 
they shall lose their liberty or he his Cro.wn this last act of the 
Parliament previous to the holy days considerably increased 
the standing forces of the Kingdom &amp; they appear to me per 
fectly disposed to give their sanction to everything that the King 
may project &amp; the minister introduce into the House of Com 
mons but they may find sufficient employment for this force, 
before long for I cannot yet consider the political question in 
the Netherlands to be adjusted questions of that kind are not 
so easily settled and France herself is not overburthened with 
that Christian like disposition, which teaches to forget and for 
give there has been a most Curious scene exhibited in Europe 
since September last The young King of Prussia has permitted 
himself to be made the Puppet of the show, but unless my guess 
fails me, he will yet be made to smart severely for his dance, &amp; 
England will feel the end of the rod which is in soak for him. 
The projects tending to this correction would have been in great 
forwardness at the present day was not France kept painfully in 
Check, by threatening internal commotions ; the contest between 
the King &amp; his Parliaments have arisen to a very alarming height 
&amp; the Parliament of Bordeaux have actually returned from Exile 
in contradiction to the express Edicts of the King one of my 
Correspondents in Paris says " I think that in the course of three 
months the royal authority has lost &amp; the rights of the nation 
gained, as much ground by a revolution of public opinion only, 
as England gained in all her civil wars under the Stuarts. I 
rather believe too they will retain the ground, because it is de 
fended by the young &amp; the middle aged, in opposition to the old 
only, the first party increases &amp; the latter diminishes daily from 
the course of nature " however any material point gained by 
either Party which will tend to tranquilize the national affairs, 
will I think finally be productive of hostilities towards this Coun 
try, &amp; when that takes place, America will find herself delicately 
situated, but by no means dangerously, provided our fellow Citi 
zens will establish a respectable fcederal Government. It may 
give you some satisfaction to know our friend Mr. Adams s 
opinion of the Constitution now under consideration, I send you

BOSTON, January 6, 1788. 

MY DEAR SIR : 

Your favor by last night s post has quite damp d my spirits 
your presence is extremely necessary to the well being of that 
object we all have in view however it is unfriendly for me to 
say further on this subject I know your wishes correspond with 
that of your friend, and at the same time that your affections &amp; 
duty forbid your leaving N. York till Mrs K. is better. 

Agreeable to invitation as mentioned in my last all the dele 
gates from this town, din d on Thursday with Mr. B. (The Govr. 
&amp; Jn Winthrop excepted), the former is confined to his bed with 
the gout. In the afternoon &amp; evening the Constitution was the 
subject of conversation till 10 o clock Mr Adams was open &amp; 
decided agt. it. That such a Govt. coud not pervade the United 
States that internal taxes ought not to be given to the Union 
that the representation was inadequate that a Govt. might be 
formd. from this but this woud never answer and ought not to 
be adopted, but on Condition of such amendments as woud 
totally destroy it these objections were supported by such argu 
ments &amp; such only as appear in the pieces of Brutus &amp; federal 
farmer to close all, he told me on our parting that people said 
they coud not find out the sentiments of Mr Adams it was 
strange, for he had always been as explicit as he then was, and to 
Mr King he stated every objection then made the next day 
when these observations came to be publicly mentioned many 
appeared who declare that Mr A. told them no one did or should 
know his sentiments on the subject it is reported that, Mr W. &amp; 
others have said that the tradesmen of the town were opposed to 



312 RUFUS KING. [1788 

the constitution on which they have called a meeting, to be held 
tomorrow night when there is no doubt they will express their 
sentiments as highly favourable to the plan, and their great 
anxiety that it should be adopted this may possibly have effect 
on Mr A, if not it will affect his E who wavers as I am in 
formed, &amp; one other who is greatly influenc d by A &amp; has no 
fixed sentiments if I were not in hopes that this woud not meet 
you at N. York I would enclose you ye resolves the tradesmen 
talk of adopting on this subject however if they are not in 
Wednesday s paper you shall have them from me by that night s 
post. Mr A., unless affected by some such step as these, will be 
indefatigable &amp; constant in all ways &amp; means to defeat the adop 
tion of the proposed frame of Government All agree to elect Mr 
Hancock as prest. and so this step will be taken to conciliate. 
The opponents to the Constitution in the town of Newbury at 
tempted to obtain a town meeting for the purpose of instructing 
their delegates to vote agt. its adoption but they coud not even 
gain a vote to choose a moderator Ipswich in the same attempt 
was equally unsuccessful but it is said the Eastern delegates will 
generally be opposed, because they think, that it will postpone 
their separation woud it not be well for you &amp; Thacher to write 
them on this subject ? Widgery is coming &amp; Judge Rice from 
Pownallborough both are its adversaries on this ground fare 
well. . . . 

Your friend,

DEAR SIR : 

I send you a copy of the Confederation of the New England Col

missioners. As I hope to leave town on Tuesday for Boston, I 
pray you to return me these papers some time tomorrow. You are 
sensible that information from the Southern States relative to the 
proposed Constitution will be of importance to us in Boston while

engaged on that subject. This remark will apologize for the re 
quest, which I take the liberty of making, that you would have 
the goodness to inform me by post of anything interesting on 
that subject which you may obtain during my absence ; on the 
other hand I will inform you of our hopes and fears. 

With great esteem,

R. KING TO JAS. MADISON. 

BOSTON, i6th January, 1787. (88) 

DEAR SIR : 

We may have 360 members in our convention, not more than 
330 have yet taken their seats ; immediately after the settlement 
of elections, the Convention resolved that they would consider and 
freely deliberate on each paragraph without taking a question on 
any of them individually, and that on the question whether they 
would ratify, each member should be at liberty to discuss the plan 
at large. This resolution seems to preclude the idea of amend 
ments, and hitherto the measure has not been suggested. I how 
ever do not from this circumstance conclude that it may not 
hereafter occur. The opponents of the Constitution moved that 
Mr. Gerry should be requested to take a seat in the convention 
to answer such enquiries as the Convention should make concern 
ing facts which happened in the passing of the Constitution. 
Although this seems to be a very irregular proposal, yet consider 
ing the jealousies which prevail with those who made it, (who are 
certainly not the most enlightened part of the Convention) and 
the doubt of the issue had it been made a trial of strength 
several friends of the Constitution united with their opponents 
and the resolution was agreed to, and Mr. Gerry has taken his 
seat. To-morrow we are told certain inquiries are to be moved 
for by the opposition ; and Mr. Gerry, under the idea of stating 
facts, is to state his reasons, &amp;c. They will be opposed and we 
shall on the division be able to form some idea of our relative 
strength. From the men who are in favor of the Constitution 



314 RUFUS KING. [1788 

every reasonable explanation will be given and arguments really 
new, and in my judgment most excellent, have been and will be 
produced in its support. 

But what will be its fate, I confess that I am unable to discern. 
No question ever classed the people of this State in a more ex 
traordinary manner or with more apparent firmness. 
Farewell, yours &amp;c., 

RUFUS KING. 

Madison Papers, Washington. 



R. KING TO JAS. MADISON. 

BOSTON, January 20, 1788. 

DEAR SIR : 

Our Convention proceeds slowly ; an apprehension that the 
liberties of the people are in danger, and a distrust of men 
of property or education have a more powerful effect upon 
the minds of our opponents than any specific objections against 
the Constitution. If the opposition was grounded on any precise 
points, I am persuaded that it might be weakened, if not indi 
rectly overcome. But every attempt to remove their fixed and 
violent jealousy, seems, hitherto, to operate as a confirmation of 
that baneful passion. The opponents affirm to each other that 
they have an unalterable majority on their side. The friends 
doubt the strength of their adversaries, but are not entirely confi 
dent of their own. An event has taken place relative to Mr. 
Gerry, which without great caution may throw us into confusion. 
I informed you by last post on what terms Mr. Gerry took a seat 
in the Convention. Yesterday in the course of debate on the 
Constitution of the Senate, Mr. G., unasked, informed the Con 
vention that he had some information to give the Convention on 
the subject then in discussion. Mr. Dana and a number of the 
most respectable members, remarked upon the impropriety of Mr. 
G. s conduct. Mr. G. rose with a view to justify himself. He 
was immediately prevented by a number of objectors ; this 
brought on an irregular conversation whether Mr. G. should be 
heard the hour of adjournment arrived, and the President ad- 



1788] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 315 

journed the House. Mr. Gerry immediately charged Mr. Dana 
with a design of injuring his reputation by partial information 
and preventing his having an opportunity to communicate impor 
tant truths ; this charge drew a warm reply from Mr. Dana, the 
members collected about them, took sides, as they were for or 
against the Constitution &amp; we were in danger of the utmost con 
fusion however, the Gentlemen separated, and I suppose to-mor 
row morning will renew their discussion before the Convention. 
With esteem &amp; regard I am, 

RUFUS KING.

JOHN HENRY TO RUFUS KING. 

NEW YORK, January 23, 1788. 
SIR: 

I done myself the Honor of waiting on you yesterday, and was 
informed you had left town these twelve days past. I have to 
apologize for not having done it before ; but a severe indisposi 
tion alone prevented me. I take the liberty of reminding you of 
your kind offer to me, and as I have not the smallest doubt of 
such powerful patronage being successfull, should there be no 
Law against Theatrical entertainments in New Hampshire, re 
quest that you will add to the favour by an enquiry (should we be 
so fortunate as to obtain permission) of what size the House in 
Portsmouth is, heretofore used by the Gentlemen of that Town 
as a theatre ; and if the height, breadth and length could be ob 
tained, also at what rent it might be hired per month, quarter, or 
year, it would be highly acceptable. 

You see, my Good Sir, the trouble your politeness and kind at 
tention to us is likely to occasion you. To most persons it would 
be necessary to frame excuse and apology for so great a freedom, 
but conscious that I have the honor of addressing one of the most 
liberal minds of the Western World, I make known my wishes 
without ceremony, or trespassing on your patience by compli 
menting your Generosity : satisfied that to the truly liberal, the 
power of serving a harmless set of people is in itself the most 
certain incentive. 



316 RUFUS KING. [1788 

Should we be happy in our wishes, you may rely on it, your 
recommendation will not be either publicly or privately disgraced, 
that our best and Grateful wishes will be daily offered for our 
Gracious patron, that your kindness will live in our Memorys 
dearly cherished, and that on all occasions we shall be happy to 
acknowledge, and proud to deserve your kind exertion in our 
favour. With the most Grateful Sensations, I have the Honour 
to be, Sir, &amp;c., 

JOHN HENRY. 



R. KING TO J. MADISON. 

BOSTON, January 23, 1788. 

DEAR SIR : 

Our prospects are gloomy, but hope is not entirely extin 
guished. Gerry has not returned to the Convention, and I think 
will not again be invited. We are now thinking of amendments 
to be submitted not as a condition of our assent &amp; Ratification, 
but as the opinion of the Convention, subjoined to their ratifica 
tion. This scheme may gain a few members, but the issue is 
doubtful. 

Farewell, 

R. KING. 



R. KING TO JAMES MADISON. 

BOSTON, January 27, 1788. 

DEAR SIR : 

I hope your information will be confirmed that the tide is again 
turning in favor of the Constitution in Virginia. We make but 
slow progress in our Convention. The friends of the Constitu 
tion, who in addition to their own weight are respectable as they 
represent a very large proportion of the good sense and property 
of this State, have the task not only of answering, but also of 
stating and bringing forward the objections of their opponents. 
The opposition complains that the Lawyers, Judges, Clergymen, 



1788] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 317 

Merchants and men of education are all in favor_of the Constitu 
tion^ and that for that reason they appear to be able to make the 
worse appear the better cause. But say they, if we had men of 
this description on our side, we should alarm the people with the 
imperfections of the Constitution and be able to refute the defence 
set up in its favor. Notwithstanding the superiority of talent in 
favor of the Constitution, yet the same infatuation which prevailed 
not many months since in several Counties of this State, and 
which emboldened them to take arms against the Government, 
seems to have an uncontrollable authority over a numerous part 
of the Convention. These objections are not directed against any 
part of the Constitution, but their opposition seems to arise frnm 
an opinion that is immovable, that some injury is plotted against 
them that the system is the production of the rich and ambi 
tious, that they discover its operations and that the consequence 
will be the establishment of two orders in the Society, one com 
prehending the opulent and great, the other the poor and illiterate. 
The extraordinary Union in favor of the Constitution in this 
State of the Wealthy and sensible part of it, is in confirmation 
of these opinions and every exertion hitherto made to eradicate 
it, has been in vain. 

We have avoided every question, which would have shown the 
division of the House ; of consequence we are not positive of the 
numbers on each side ; by the last calculation we made on our 
side, we were doubtful whether we exceeded them, or they us. 
They however say that they have a majority of eight or twelve 
against. We by no means despair. . . .

R. KING TO JAMES MADISON. 

BOSTON, Wednesday, January 30, 1788. 
DEAR SIR : 

This day for the first time our President, Mr. Hancock, took 
his seat in the Convention, and we shall probably terminate our 
business on Saturday or Tuesday next. I cannot predict the 
issue, but our hopes are increasing. If Mr. Hancock does not 



318 RUFUS KING. [1788 

disappoint our present expectations, our wishes will be gratified ; 
but his character is not entirely free from a portion of caprice. 
This however is confidential. 

Farewell, yours &amp;c.,

R. KING TO J. MADISON. 

BOSTON, Sunday, Feby 3d, 1788. 

DEAR SIR : 

I enclose a newspaper containing the propositions communi 
cated by Mr. Hancock to the Convention on Thursday last. Mr. 
Adams (Mr. Samuel Adams) who contrary to his own sentiments 
has hitherto been silent in the Convention, has given his public 
and explicit approbation of Mr. Hancock s propositions. We 
i flatter ourselves that the weight of these two characters will 
ensure our success, but the event is not absolutely certain. Yes 
terday a Committee was appointed on the motion of a doubtful 
character to consider the propositions submitted by Mr. Han 
cock and to report tomorrow afternoon. We have a majority of 
Federalists on this Committee and flatter ourselves the result will 
be favorable. I have not time to add except that I am with 
esteem, 

Yours, 

R. KING. 

P. S. We shall probably decide on Thursday or Friday next 
when our members will amount to 363. Gerry has kept at Cam 
bridge, and our opponents say nothing of his re-invitation. 

(" Read the above immediately and send it back by the bearer 
who will wait for it. I shall be glad of the newspaper in about 
an hour and a half.") 

Madison Papers, Washington. 

These words appear to have been addressed to Col. H^ftnil- 
ton by Mr. Madison, in sending him the above lettet&gt;ro fead.

R. KING TO GEN. KNOX. 

BOSTON, Feby. i, 1788. 
DEAR GENERAL : 

Hancock has committed himself in our favor and will not 
desert the cause. Saturday s "Centinel " will give you an idea of 
his plan. The Federalists are united in that system ; and, as 
Adams has joined us on this plan, we are encouraged to think our 
success probable. 

Gerry keeps close at Cambridge &amp; his adherents have made no 
motion for his recall. Mr. Hancock s propositions were yesterday 
referred to a Committee from each county : they meet today and 
we hope favorably from their deliberations, a majority being 
Federalists. 

The final question will probably be taken in five or six days. 
You will be astonished, when you see the list of names, that such 
an union of men has taken place on this question. Hancock will 
hereafter receive the universal support of Bowdoin s friends ; and 
we told him, that, if Virginia does not unite^ which is problematical. 
Keis considered as the only fair candidate for President.

MY DR. FRIEND : 

It affords me the most sincere pleasure to inform you that on 
the final Question to ratify the Constitution, we divided 187 for, 
and 1 68 against the Ratification. The Ratification is uncondi 
tional &amp; absolute, but we have recommended certain amend 
ments to the Delegates first appointed under the Government. 
Farewell, and do you likewise.

R. KING TO J. MADISON. 

BOSTON, 6 Feby., 1788. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

I have the satisfaction to inform you that on the final question 
of assenting to and ratifying the Constitution, our Convention 
divided and 187 were in the affirmative and 168 in the negative ; 



320 RUFUS KING. [1788 

the majority, although small, is extremely respectable, and the 
minority are in good temper. They have the magnanimity to 
declare that they will devote their lives and property to support 
the Government ; and I have no doubt but the ratification will 
be very cordially &amp; universally approved through our State. New 
Hampshire will undoubtedly decide in favor of the Constitution. 
Their Convention met today. 

God bless you yours &amp;c.,

R. KING TO THEOPHILUS PARSONS. 

NEW YORK, Feby 20, 1788. 
DEAR SIR : 

By the British Packet which arrived this morning, I have a 
letter from Col. Smith,* inclosing an Extract from the concluding 
letter of Doctr. Adams third vol. on the American Constitutions. 
The Extract is too long to be copied at this time. I subjoin the 
conclusion of it, which will explain the Doctor s opinion concern 
ing the new Constitution. 

Extract of a letter dated Grosvenor Square, Dec. 26. 1787. 

" It is now in our power to bring this work to a conclusion with 
unexpected dignity. In the course of the last summer, two 
authorities have appeared greater than any that have been before 
quoted, in which the principles we have attempted to defend have 
been acknowledged. The first is an Ordinance of Congress of 
the 13. July 1787 for the Government of the Territory of the 
United States North West of the River Ohio. The second is the 
report of the Convention at Philadelphia of the i7th of Septem 
ber 1787. The former confederation of the United States was 
formed upon the model and example of all the Confederacies 
antient and modern, in which the federal Council was only a 
diplomatic body. Even the Lycian, which is thought to have 
been the best, was no more. The magnitude of the Territory, 
the population, the wealth and commerce, and especially the rapid 

* See letter Jany i, 1788. 



1 788] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 321 

Growth of the United States have shown such a government to 
be inadequate to their wants ; and the new system which seems 
admirably calculated to unite their interest and affection and 
bring them to an uniformity of principles and sentiments, is 
equally well combined to unite their wills and forces as a single 
nation. 

" A result of accommodation cannot be supposed to reach the 
ideas of perfection of any one, but the conception of such an idea 
and the deliberate union of so great and various people in such*a 
place, is without all partiality or prejudice, if not the greatest 
exertion of human understanding, the greatest single effort of 
national deliberation that the world has ever seen. That it may 
be improved is not to be doubted, and the provision is made for 
that purpose in the report itself. A people who could conceive 
and can adopt it, we need not fear will be able to amend it, when 
by Experience its inconveniences and imperfections shall be seen 
and felt." 

Col. Smith observes in his letter that Mr. Adams wished no 
concealment of his opinion on this subject ; and I think its pub 
licity may be useful. I am without a frank ; if the Doctor s 
opinion is not worth the postage, you value it much less than I do. 

With sincere esteem &amp; Respect, I am, dear Sir 

Your friend, 

RUFUS KING. 



JOHN LANGDON TO R. KING. 

PORTSMOUTH, Feby. 23, 1788. 



DEAR SIR : 



I am sorry to inform you that our Convention adjourned yes 
terday (to meet again in June next) without completing the im 
portant business of adopting the Constitution. Contrary to the 
expectation of almost ev ry man of reflection at our first meeting, 
a majority appeared against the plan, a great part of whom had 
positive Instructions to vote against it ; however after spending 
ten days in the arguments a number of opponents came to me and 
said they were convinced and should be very unhappy to vote 



VOL. I. 21 



322 RUFUS KING. [1788 

against the Constitution which they (however absurd) must do, 
in case the question was called for. I therefore moved for the 
adjournment which was carried though much opposed by the 
other side. This question determined a majority in favor of 
the Constitution, had it not been for their Instructions. This 
shews the fatality of the times. 

Believe me sincerely yo. mo. obdt. St.

GEORGE WASHINGTON TO R. KING. 

MOUNT VERNON, 29 Feby., 1788. 

SIR : 

I have received the letter with which you were pleased to honor 
me from Boston, and pray you to accept my thanks for, and con 
gratulations on, the important information it contains. 

Happy am I to see the favorable decision of your Convention 
upon the proposed Government ; not only on acct. of its adding 
an important State to the number of those which have already 
accepted it, but because it must be productive of good effects in 
other States, whose determination may have been problematical. 
It will have its weight. 

From my own knowledge, I cannot undertake to say what will 
be the fate of the Constitution in this State. I am altogether in 
debted to Gentlemen who visit me for information respecting the 
disposition of the people towards it, not having gone Six miles be 
yond the limits of my own farms since my return from Philadelphia. 
From these accounts no doubt from the first has been ascertained 
in my mind of the acceptance of it here, notwithstanding the 
indefatigable pains which some very influential characters take to 
oppose it. 

I beg you to present me in respectful terms to Mrs. King, and 
to receive assurances of the esteem and regard with which I have 
the honor to be 

Sir, Yr. Most Obdt. Hble. Ser.

DEAR SIR : 

I am happy to hear you arrived in due season for the stage 
from Hartford. . . . Mr. Lane has convers d with me on the 
Cambridge place ; he will sell, I presume, for ^4000. Tho* he 
did not say he woud he will go in a few days for New London 
&amp; embark thence for S. Carolina. He wishes you to meet him 
with a line at New London if the business cannot be effected 
in this manner, he leaves full power with Lowell to sell at what 
price he (Lowell) shall think proper. Your friends, in this 
quarter, are very anxious to have you among them if possible to 
gratify them &amp; especially myself, pray conclude the bargain, and 
be again a son of Massts. . . . Everything is tranquil &amp; con 
ducive to the happiness of America. 

Your friend,

DEAR KING : 

Your favor of last night s post duly arriv d and Dr. Adams 
letter, which, to say the least, is a great quieter, will be published 
in the paper of to-morrow. Lane will leave a power with Lowell 
to dispose of his Cambridge estate. On this subject, my earnest 
wish is that you shoud agree. Pray meet him with a line from 
New York at New London.

unanimous for him. Adams, Warren &amp; many more will be can 
didates Gorham has interest but cannot succeed efficiently with 
the General Court. His offering himself for a candidate, may 
disturb the tranquillity of the commonwlth, but cannot secure 
him the place. A large meeting of the antifederalists was held 
last week at Dudley in Worcester County &amp; resolved to send 
messengers into every town in the counties of Worcester, Berk- 



324 XUFUS KING. [1788 

shire, Hampshire &amp; Bristol &amp; Middlesex, pointing the inhabitants 
of these places to Gerry &amp; Warren for Govr. and Lt. Govr. They 
will be unremitted and will prevail unless the friends of Gov 
ernment are equally warm, attentive &amp; united. If Gorham 
pursues this object, the emoluments of wh. will now be diminished, 
he may possibly destroy his claim to a continental post of more 
lasting and beneficial avail. I know he has great confidence in 
your opinion &amp; that of Genl. Knox and a line from you &amp; him 
might turn his support to a true and proper point. For the good 
of Massachusetts and our worthy friend Lincoln, I earnestly 
request that you &amp; K. would write immediately &amp; forcibly on this 
business to Mr. G. ; he can disturb the tranquillity of the Com- 
mwlth., he can aid the election of Gerry &amp; Warren or Adams ; he 
may possibly destroy the good he has done in promoting the 
adoption of the fed. Govt. &amp; will certainly damp the ardor of his 
friends &amp; increase the opposition of his enemies to the attainment 
of any great purpose of his own future emolument, by proposing 
himself a candidate for the office of Lt. Govr. By openly with 
drawing his claim, he may and certainly will, in Massachusetts, 
secure to himself the fervent support of all good men in attaining 
the object of his desires. The Govr. accedes to the vacancy 
being supplied by Lincoln ; this is another point which ought to 
be attended to by Mr. G. and his friends. You &amp; Genl. Knox 
can save this man from playing the fool with himself &amp; injuring 
a good cause. I therefore beseech you to be instant and warm in 
your endeavours on this subject. 

Farewell, your friend, 

C. GORE. 



N. GORHAM TO R. KING. 

CHARLESTOWN, April 6, 1788. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

The Legislature have ended the session without doing any mis 
chief. The utmost prudence &amp; moderation was necessary &amp; it 
was exerted. Things were so critically situated that the publica 
tion of the papers would have been injurious ; neither will it now 
be of service, as the people so far as applys immediately to the 



1 7 88] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 325 

federal Government are perfectly quiet. Electioneering at pres 
ent engages the attention but tomorrow you know closes that busi 
ness. Mr. Gerry will have about -jj- part of the votes as Governor. 
For Lt. Govr., I presume there will be no choice by the People. 
I think General Warren will have the greatest number of votes. 
O. Phelps and I have purchased the Western land ; we have 
agreed with the N. York purchasers to consolidate the titles we 
expect to make money by it notwithstanding which if you wish 
to take an eighth or i2oth part you may have it upon terms similar 
to ours. Do sit down and write me all the news &amp; prospects from 
Maryland &amp; Virginia .

SIR : 

Mr. Gorham &amp; myself have at last closed a contract with this 
Commonwealth for their Western Territory, as you will see by 
the inclosed Resolution of the Legislature (passed April i, 1788). 
Mr. Gorham informed me, that you mentioned to him last fall 
that you would like to be interested in those Lands, if this is still 
your wish we shall be happy in admitting you as an associate. We 
propose dividing the purchase into 120 shares. If you may in 
cline to take one or more of those shares please write me or Mr. 
Gorham. 

In haste am Sir your very humble Servant

Our State notes are now at | on ye pound. I do not think they 
will rise above 4. There are about ^1,300,000 in circulation. 
(The contract was to pay in these notes.)

R. KING TO JOHN LANGDON. 

NEW YORK, 16 Apl., 1788. 

DR. SIR : 

I enclose under a Frank which General Knox has given me an 
address to the people of this State which may be of use in New 
Hampshire : if you should judge it a publication of value, I think 
the public Happiness will be advanced by circulating it in your 
State. Be assured that you ought not on any consideration to 
omit every exertion which prudence and virtue will authorise in 
favor of the constitution ; very much will depend on your Deci 
sion. Georgia has ceded upwards of Thirty Millions of acres of 
land lying between the 3ist &amp; 33d degrees of lat. and between 
the Apalachicola and the Mississippi, to the United States, on 
condition that nine or more States ratify the new constitution. 
We have no news from So. or North Carolina the former is said 
to be federal &amp; the latter doubtful. 

The accounts of the Elections from Virginia indicate that the 
parties will be powerful and nearly equal. Our hopes are great 
that Maryland will be right, Luther Martin notwithstanding ; but 
we are not so confident of Maryland as we once were of New 
Hampshire. It is exquisitely problematical what the issue of the 
Business will be in this State both parties are indefatigable and 
each seems confident of success. 

New Hampshire must determine right and preserve our coun 
try.

RUFUS KING.

DR. SIR : 

Maryland has adopted the Constitution on a division of sixty- 
three affirmatives and Eleven Negatives : the Convention sat but 
one week, and that we are told was mostly spent in hearing Mr. 
Mercer and one or two anti-federalists. The Convention meets 



1788] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 327 

in South Carolina on the i2th instant, and we have the highest con 
fidence of their assent. The accounts from Virginia are more 
and more favorable, and it seems agreed by every one that the 
great unanimity of Maryland will have a very favorable effect on 
that State. The Elections were made in this State during the last 
week, but the result is as yet unknown except in this city. Of 
three thousand votes given in this city, it is supposed that not 
more than two hundred were in favor of the antifederal Ticket, 
which was headed by Governor Clinton. Mr. Jay. Mr. Duane, 
Chancellor Livingston, Col. Hamilton, Judge Morris, Judge 
Hobart, Mr. Harrison, Mr. Rosevelt &amp; Mr. Nicholas Low, who 
composed the federal ticket, had the other votes and are elected 
from the information which I have obtained concerning this State, 
I am rather inclined to think they will adopt the Constitution ; I 
hope and believe that New Hampshire will be in better company 
than that of R. Island. I shall be mortified if I am disappointed. 
Mrs. King will accompany me to Boston in about a Fortnight, and 
we do not intend denying ourselves the pleasure of visiting Ports 
mouth, although we shall be disappointed in the Pleasure of seeing 
you there. Concord is a long distance from the metropolis.

humb. Servt. R. KING. 



C. GORE TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, April 9, 1788. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

Your accounts from Virginia and Maryland are very pleasing, 
tho our friend Thacher is confident that Virginia will dissent. 
Our elections for Govr., Lt. Govr. &amp; Senators in the lower coun 
ties discover a decided superiority of Government over its op 
ponents. We shall have six good Senators from Essex &amp; the like 
number from Suffolk. Middlesex probably four good. On a fair 
calculation our Senate will be better than the last year. We can 
say nothing certain as to Lt. Govr., tho it is clear that Warren 
will not be elected by the people. . . . 

Sincerely yours,

mired here. I shall take great care to circulate this and all other 
pieces that will give light on the subject. You may depend every 
exertion shall be made that is Possible to promote the adoption 
of the Constitution ; and I have no doubt notwithstanding our 
late Disappointments and Mortification, we shall finally prevail, 
and thereby make the people happy in spight of their teeth as 
the sayg. is. 

I think affairs to the South look well. Maryland will certainly 
adopt the plan and I have but little doubt of South Carolina. We 
must watch and pray for Virginia and North Carolina. I cannot 
help thinkg. but they 11 both agree to it. New York &amp; New 
Hampshire must agree to the plan, which will Compleat our 
Business. 

The State of Georgia ceding that Territory to the United States 
under Certain Restrictions, will have very good effect. Pray

anxious to hear of your welfare and we affectionately participate 
in this addition to your happiness. 

This State has ratified the federal Constitution by a majority of 
149 to 73. The Anti-federalists had been most mischievously in-

dustrious in prejudicing the minds of our Citizens against the 
Constitution. Pamphlets, speeches &amp; Protests from the dis 
affected in Pennsylvania were circulated throughout the State, 
particularly in the back country ; but notwithstanding all the Arts 
of those who were determined to prevent the adoption of the 
Constitution if they possibly could, it was received and confirmed, 
after being ten days under debate, by the above respectable ma 
jority. Our minority then imitated the candour of the minority 
of your State, and declared that they would exert themselves 
when they returned home in reconciling the minds of their neigh 
bours to the Constitution now adopted by their country. .

R. KING TO JAS. MADISON. [Madison Papers, Washn. 

NEW YORK, May 25, 1788. 
DEAR SIR : 

I leave this city to-morrow for Boston, and shall be extremely 
obliged to you to inform me of the progress and determination 
of your Convention. You can with difficulty conceive the real 
anxiety experienced in Massachusetts concerning your decision. 
There remains no doubt that a very large majority of the people 
of Massachusetts are in favor of the Federal Constitution. The 
late elections for Governor, Lt. Governor, Senators &amp; Representa 
tives incontrovertibly prove it. Mr. Gerry is elected to no office. 
Mr. Warren the Speaker of the last House is not a member of the 
Legislature for this year. Hancock has four fifths of the votes for 
Governor and Gerry, the residue. Mr. Warren who was the Anti- 
federal Candidate for Lt. Governor has about one fifth of the 
Votes. Lincoln has nearly half, but not a majority of the whole 
number. The other votes for Lt. Governor are divided princi 
pally between Mr. Adams and Mr. Gorham. You will recollect 
the manner of electing our Senate ; thirty one of the forty mem 
bers have this year been elected by the people, of which only six 
are antifederal. 



330 RUFUS KING. [1788 

The late Elections in Connecticut have confirmed the decision 
of their Convention ; the leader of the opposition, General James 
Wadsworth (who was for many years a Member of their Council 
and was almost the only man of any sort of Consequence in that 
State who opposed the federal Constitution) has not been re- 
elected to Councillor. The intelligence from New Hampshire is 
favorable and I cherish a rational Expectation that they will 
adopt the Constitution by a handsome majority. Your corre 
spondence with Hamilton and others will furnish you with the 
prospects in this State. Direct your letters (if leisure permits 
your writing) to me at Boston and be assured that I am very re 
spectfully, 

Dr. Sir, your obedt. &amp; very humble Servt., 

RUFUS KING.

RICHMOND, June 4, 1788. 

DEAR SIR : 

I thank you sincerely for your favor previous to your leaving 
N. York. The information you give in it is agreeable and 
useful. 

Our Convention met on Monday. I did not arrive till the even 
ing of that day. Mr. Pendleton had been unanimously put in the 
chair. The debates commenced to-day. The Govr. has declared 
the day of previous amendments past, and thrown himself fully 
into our scale. Mr. L n &amp; H y appeared to take different &amp; 
awkward ground &amp; the federal party are apparently in the best 
spirits. There is reason to believe, nevertheless, that the majority 
will be but small &amp; may possibly be yet defeated. There are 
several perplexing circumstances with which we have to contend, 
and of which the utmost advantage will be taken. A little time 
will enable me to speak in more explicit language. 

Adieu. Yrs. affectly.,

DEAR SIR : 

I wrote you a few days since by way of Portsmouth. I am 
happy in offering you my congratulations on the adoption of the 
Constitution by South Carolina the papers will shew the unani 
mity of their Convention and the candor of their minority. I 
sincerely hope that New Hampshire will be the ninth State, this 
she will be if your Convention decide soon after their meeting. 

Virginia undoubtedly will accede. The opposition is greatly 
weakened, their session will be lengthy, but the constitution will 
be ratified probably in the manner of Massachusetts. The influ 
ence of your decision will be very great in New York. I am 
desired to impress this Idea ; and to request that immediately 
after your ratification you despatch an express with a letter 
addressed to our friend Alexander Hamilton Esq. member of the 
New York Convention at Poughkeepsie Let your express cross 
the country to Springfield in Massachusetts, and deliver the letter

332 RUFUS KING. [1788 

JAS. MADISON, JR., TO R. KING. 

RICHMOND, June 13, 1788. 
DEAR SIR : 

I am tolerably well over the bilious indisposition which con 
fined me at the date of my last. The progress of the Convention 
is extremely slow ; though from the impatience of the members, 
I think the Session will not be long. The issue of it is more 
doubtful than was apprehended when I last wrote. The ostensi 
ble points of opposition are direct taxation, the imperfect repre 
sentation in the H. of Reps, the equality in the Senate, regulation 
of Trade by majority &amp; the Judiciary Depart. The first and last 
are dwelt on most. Besides these the Mississippi, the Indiana 
claim with some other local matters are made a great handle of, 
particularly out of doors where the chief mischief is effected. My 
present idea is that the vote of Kentucky will turn the scale and 
there is perhaps more to fear than to hope from that quarter. 
The members arrived generally under the adverse bias produced 
by a combination of efforts to mislead them. The majority on 
either side will be small and at present the event is ticklish as 
can be conceived. The leaders of the opposition are in corre 
spondence with New York &amp; probably with the minority of 
Marylnd. Oswald was here a day or two on confidential business 
with them and is returned. 

Adieu, yours affectly.

R. KING TO A. HAMILTON.* 

BOSTON, June 12, 1788. 
DEAR SIR : 

I have made an arrangement to forward by express the result 
of the Convention of New Hampshire to Springfield, in this 
State, from which Gen. Knox has engaged a conveyance to you 
at Poughkeepsie. Those who are best informed of the situation 
of the question, in New Hampshire, are positive that the decis 
ion will be such as we wish, and from the particular facts which 

* Works of Hamilton, vol. i., 457. 



1788] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 333 

I have heard, I can entertain no fear of a disappointment from 
that quarter. The accession of New Hampshire will present the 
subject at your Convention in anew, and indeed an extraordinary 
light. I think your opponents, powerful as they may be will be 
greatly perplexed, although they may outnumber you, and a 
small majority of the people of the State may be on their side, 
yet I cannot think they will have the hardiness to negative the 
question. 

You may pronounce, with the utmost confidence, that the decis 
ion of our Convention has proved entirely satisfactory to our peo 
ple. I have made a business of conversing with men from all parts 
of the State, and am completely satisfied that the Constitution is 
highly popular ; that its opponents are now very few, and those 
few hourly diminishing. Be assured that the organization of the 
Government (by nine States is considered as certain) although a 
subject of delicacy, is most earnestly desired, and from conver 
sation of both yeoman and politician, I am persuaded, that the 
people of Massachusetts are sufficiently mature and firm to exe 
cute so far as depends on them, what shall be proper as good 
subjects of the new Government. 

Farewell, yours, etc., 

RUFUS KING. 

Pray mention to Knox that I should have written to him, had 
I not supposed him on his way here. 



JAS. MADISON, JR., TO R. KING. 

RICHMOND, June 15, 1788. 
DEAR SIR : 

No question has yet been taken by which real strength of 
parties in our Convention can be measured. There is not a 
majority of more than three or four on either side. Both sides 
claim it. I think however it rather lies as yet in favor of the 
Constitution. But it is so small as to justify apprehension from 
accidents as well as change of opinion. An unwillingness to risk 
a positive decision on so small a superiority of numbers may also 
operate on some of the cautious and moderate friends of the 



334 RUFUS KING. [1788 

Constitution. The other party evidently wish to procrastinate. 
They may hear from the Convention in N. York, they may work 
on some of the least decided friends of the constitution, they 
may weary out the patience of the House and prepare it for an 
adjournment rather than remain longer at this season from home 
and at a place extremely disagreeable for sundry reasons at this 
time. These reasons enforced by a distrust of their number will 
account for the policy of delay. Previous amendments will either 
be tried or give place to an effort to adjourn, as circumstances 
may point out to the leaders of the opposition. I have been 
much indisposed and continue so in a degree, which scarcely 
allows me to co-operate in the business. This will be an apology 
for not being more full in my communications and will account 
for my unpunctuality in those already made or which may 
follow. 

Adieu yrs. affecty., 

JAS. MADISON, JR. 



N. DANE TO R. KING, BOSTON. 

NEW YORK, June 15, 1788. 

DEAR SIR : 

I enclose to you a letter which was handed to me to forward. 
The principal object of attention and enquiry is the Virginia 
Convention. But I need not add on this subject, as I presume 
the enclosed letter will give you all the information of any im 
portance relative to it, which, at present, can be obtained. The 
members of the convention in this state meet this week. The 
result of their doings I must leave to time to discover. It must 
be an undesirable thing even to have R. I. out of the union, much 
more N. Y. The opposition in the latter state appears to be 
(many of them at least) sensible of this : from this and other cir 
cumstances I can by no means conclude, at present, that N. Y. 
will not keep herself in the Union. 

With the highest esteem &amp; regard, yours, &amp;c., 

N. DANE.

CHARLES PINCKNEY TO R. KING. 

CHARLESTON, June 16, 1788. 
DEAR KING : 

. . I am much pleased to hear that you have a son in, my 
mind one son is worth a dozen daughters. I wish it may soon be 
my fate for you have no doubt heard that I have verified my 
assertion by marrying within eight months after my return a little 
french girl with whom I shall probably one day or another pay a 
visit to New York for she has never been there : but when or how 
remains to be determined as I am too much employed at present 
to be able to spare the time for a mere jaunt of pleasure. 

You have no doubt also heard of our Convention s very hand 
somely adopting the Constitution. I should suppose in the course 
of July Congress will have it in their power to notify the ratifica 
tion of nine States, direct them to proceed to their elections &amp; 
fix a day for their meeting and commencing operations under the 
new system. I trust the States will be attentive to their Elections 
and that after this it will really be an honour to be a member of 
the Legislature. . . . 

Dear sir, yours truly 

CHARLES PINCKNEY. 

I shall be glad to hear from you, mention when you write the 
disposition of New York. We are anxious to hear from Virginia. 
We are to make a council in a day or two &amp; I hope I shall be able 
by that to receive some favorable dispatches. 



H. KNOX TO R. KING. 

NEW YORK, June 19, 1788. 

Yes anxious enough I dare say. But I cannot relieve it. The 
post of to-day brings letters from Virginia to the nth, nothing 
decisive there. Madison was sick on the pth ; whether he was 
out on the nth I do not know. I fear that overwhelming torrent, 
Patrick Henry. I would it were well over and the parchment 
lodged in the Secretary s office. 

The majority of the Antis is so great at Poughkeepsie, that I 
ask no questions. Some person compelled me to hear that Gov. 



336 RUFUS KING. [1788 

Clinton was chosen President on Tuesday, 51 members present. 
My apprehension about Virginia is that they will adjourn, the 
Legislature being to meet on the 23d, will be the pretext. The 
best fruit at present from that quarter is that Mason is angry. 
I am, Dear Sir, your affectionate 

H. KNOX. 

J. LANGDON TO R. KING. 

CONCORD, June 21, 1788. 
DEAR SIR : 

The State of New Hampshire have this moment adopted the 
Federal Constitution, 57 yeas 46 nays. I have sent on the ex 
press to Springfield to Mr. Smith to forward Col. Hamilton s let 
ter to Poukeepsie, which I enclosed him. Excuse haste. 

Believe me yours &amp;c 
JNO. LANGDON. 

CHARLES COTESWORTH PINCKNEY TO R. KING. 

CHARLESTON, June 21, 1788. 
DR. SR. : 

. . . I acquainted you by Mr. Kean that our State had rati 
fied the Constitution. Most of the members who opposed it have 
declared that they will exert themselves in its support, and some 
districts, that were averse to it, are altogether reconciled to its 
adoption. Indeed, if we were allowed to pass Installment and 
Valuation Laws as heretofore, an antifederalist would be a rara 
avis in this State. . . . 

I remain with sincere regard and esteem yours truly 

CHARLES COTESWORTH PINCKNEY. 



JAS. MADISON, JR., TO R. KING. 

RICHMOND, June 22, 1788. 
DEAR SIR : 

We are at length approaching the close of our deliberations on 
the several parts of the Constitution. The Judiciary Department 
has been gone over ; though perhaps it may receive some addi 
tional disquisitions. The attack has apparently been less formid 
able than I had apprehended. Independently of some particular 



1788] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 337 

interests, the objections against it have not been calculated in my 
opinion to make any deep impressions. In the eyes of many this 
part of the plan stands in a less vulnerable point of view than 
had been conceived prior to the examination of it. As soon as 
the remaining articles shall be despatched, some general proposi 
tions will be agitated. The opponents will bring forward a bill 
of rights with sundry other amendments as conditions of ratifica 
tion, &amp; in case of disappointment will probably aim at an 
adjournment. Some apprehend a secession ; but there are too 
many moderate and respectable characters on that side to admit 
such a supposition. It has been judged prudent, nevertheless, to 
maintain so exemplary a fairness on our part, (and even in some 
points to give way to unreasonable pretensions) as will withhold 
every pretext for so rash a step. On the side of the Constitution 
it is in contemplation to preface the ratification with a declaration 
of a few obvious truths which cannot affect the validity of the 
act, and to follow it with a recommendation of a few amendments 
to be pursued in the constitutional mode. This expedient is 
necessary to conciliate some individuals, who are in general well 
affected, but have certain scruples drawn from their own reflex 
ions, or from the temper of their constituents. How the vote will 
stand on the final question, I dare not yet positively decide. Our 
calculations promise us a majority of 3 or 4, possibly of 5 or 6. 
Besides the many chances which may vary a result depending on 
so small a number, it is impossible not to recollect that in so great 
a number of opinions some may be mistaken. I wish you every 
happiness and am, Dear Sir, 

Your obedient Servt., 

JAS. MADISON, JR. 

If Mr. Sherman is in your neighbourhood present my best 
regards to him. 

JAMES MADISON, JR., TO R. KING. 

RICHMOND, June 25, 1788. 
DEAR SIR : 

The final question in our Convention has just been decided in 
the affirmative by 89 ays 79 noes. Recommendatory amend 
ments will attend the act of ratification, but are yet to be settled. 



338 RUFUS KING. [1788 

The business was closed with due decorum &amp; solemnity ; and 
an acquiescence of the minority can not be in the least doubted. 
Some of the leaders as might be imagined have however a keen 
feeling of their disappointment. 

In haste yrs. affectly. 

JAS. MADISON, JR. 



R. KING TO J. MADISON, JR. t Madison Papers, Washn. 

BOSTON, July 20, 1788. 

DEAR SIR : 

I most sincerely congratulate you on the decision of your Con 
vention and am pleased to hear from your colleague Mr. Brown 
that by this time you have returned to New York. I am greatly 
indebted to you for the frequent information of the progress of 
your Convention and should before now have made you my 
acknowledgments, had I not supposed that you was on your way 
to Congress, and that letters addressed tc you in Virginia would 
pass you on your journey. New York must have finished their 
session and we hope the result has been favorable. But should it 
be otherwise, it will be generally understood and believed in this 
quarter, that the rejection arose from selfish and unworthy 
motives, the character of the Constitution will not thereby be in 
jured, the attachment of the people will not be diminished. But 
the sentiments concerning New York which exist in Connecticut 
&amp; New Jersey will prevail in this State &amp; in New Hampshire. We 
are without any accounts or opinion concerning North Carolina. 
You must soon be informed of their determination ; and we hope 
that Congress will not long delay what they have to do towards 
organizing the Government. 

I expect to leave this in six or eight days and promise myself 
the pleasure of seeing you soon after in New York. 

With sincere esteem, I am affectionately yours 

RUFUS KING. 



CHAPTER XVIII. 

Mr. King, though a Delegate from Massachusetts had lived in New York 
Where the Congress sat Massachusetts Friends urge him to reside in 
Cambridge He takes Steps to buy a House Urged to go to Boston, 
before the gen. Court met Non-residence a Bar to his Selection for 
Office Became a Citizen of New York Regret of his Massachusetts 
Friends. 

From the latter part of 1784, Mr. King had been a dele 
gate from Massachusetts to the Congress, and in the per 
formance of his duties as such had passed the greatest part 
of his time in New York, where the Congress, acting both 
as an executive and legislative body, remained in nearly 
permanent session, until it was superseded by the new gov 
ernment after the adoption of the Constitution. He was 
thus always ready to take his place, though the want of a 
quorum, from the negligence of the States to keep their 
representation full, often prevented the transaction of busi 
ness. Occasional visits to Boston to communicate directly 
with the General Court of Massachusetts on questions under 
consideration, but never when the election of delegates was 
pending, were made ; and so faithful, satisfactory, and 
efficient were the services rendered that he was always re- 
elected, and when the deputies of the Constitutional Con 
vention were chosen, he was one of them. His agency in 
shaping the results in that body, of whose call he had not 
been an advocate, was unquestioned and salutary ; and 
although the extent of his services there were not yet fully 
known, he was sent by his old friends of Newburyport to 
take part in the convention assembled in Massachusetts to 
decide upon the adoption of the Constitution. It cannot be 

339 



340 KUFUS KING. [1788- 

doubted that the efforts he made, and the arguments he 
brought forward in its support, were among those which were 
most influential in carrying the measure. 

He might naturally and properly suppose and expect that 
in the distribution of offices under the new government, his 
claims to some consideration would not be forgotten, 
although there is no evidence that he ever presented them 
in any way. But he had in every way and on every occa 
sion, as the correspondence shows, manifested a warm love 
for Massachusetts, and had never expressed a thought of 
forsaking the State. Indeed had thanked his friends for 
denying a charge that he intended to do so, about the time 
of his marriage. 

His marriage had taken place two years before this time, 
and as his wife was the only daughter of a gentleman far 
advanced in age and dependent upon his daughter s care, it 
was suggested that he might make New York his home. 
Still he continued the trusted representative of his State. 
He had given up the practice of law and had devoted himself 
to a public life, for which he had a strong predilection, and 
had carefully prepared himself, and looked forward to the 
rewards of fidelity of service and conscious ability in the new 
government now to be established. 

It is true that he had no actual residence in Massachusetts, 
and therefore, when his former friends, especially in New- 
buryport, proclaimed him an alien to the State, and in con 
sequence an unfit representative of Massachusetts, there was 
some ground for the efforts made to prevent him from 
receiving an appointment which others craved. 

We find on February 13, 1788, a short time after his return 
to New York from the Massachusetts Convention, that his 
life-long friend, Christopher Gore, wrote to him, that a house 
could be bought in Cambridge, and urged him to take steps 
to obtain it, saying : " Your friends in this quarter are very 
anxious to have you among them. If possible, to gratify 
them, especially myself, pray conclude the bargain and be 
come again a son of Massachusetts." 



1789] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 341 

Nothing further appears to have been done at this time to 
indicate his purpose, nor again during a visit which, as the 
correspondence shows, he made to Boston and its vicinity, 
from the loth of May to about the 1st of August. This was 
an eventful period, and he was in constant correspondence 
with the leading members of the conventions in different 
States, urging the adoption of the Constitution and receiv 
ing the gratifying news of the action of the State of New 
Hampshire s acceptance on the 2ist of June, the ninth State 
to adopt that instrument, and thus constitute the new gov 
ernment. The consideration of the circumstances under 
which it was to be put into operation must have been a fre 
quent topic of conversation, but nothing definite appears 
until the following letters called his attention to the wishes 
of his friends. 



C. GORE TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, August 10, 1788. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

I sincerely congratulate you on the adoption of New York ; 
which was the more pleasing as it was unexpected. Your friends 
are very desirous of your being in the admin, of the new Govt. ; 
but are anxious as to your election, unless you are really an 
inhabitant of Massachusetts, previous to the time of electing. 
The federalists are solicitous that you should be actually a resi 
dent in this Commonwealth immediately. They wish for your 
aid &amp; support in administering this Constitution and very pub 
licly say you may choose your district : but are fearful that 
your remaining in N. York will be urged as an objection. Unless 
your coming here is attended with real difficulties, I think the 
good of your Country too loudly demands your removal this 
autumn, to leave a doubt in your mind. The Candidates in this 
County are Jarvis, Otis, Dawes &amp; Heath. I think Dawes the 
most likely to succeed ; and as far as my little influence can 
weigh, it will add to his scale, unless there is a probability of our 
having you for the Representative of Suffolk ; which I think is 
probable if you take your residence in Boston or the vicinity this 
fall. Let me pray you will consider this subject &amp; say to me 



342 RUFUS KING. [1788- 

what are your intentions and when they shall be brought to 
practice. 

Jarvis, Hitchborn &amp; Sullivan, it is said, are busy in attaining 
influence and votes for the former in serious hopes of introducing 
Han. into the first seat of the general Government. Whether this 
is the case I will not undertake to determine, but there are many 
circumstances which evidence a probability of such views in 
them. . . . 

Affectionately your friend, 

C. GORE. 



GENL. KNOX, BOSTON, lyxH AUG. 
DEAR SIR : 

I was mortified on my arrival here to find that you and Mrs. 
King had returned to New York. 

The deep impressions you have made here on the minds of 
men are favorable to any political employment within the power 
of this State. But I learn with chagrin that some persons, 
whose views may be intercepted by your continuance here, have 
been but too successful in disseminating the idea that your 
apparent intentions of making this State your future residence 
were entirely delusive and calculated only for particular purposes. 

You are too well acquainted with human nature to suffer this 
information to have any injurious effect on your mind. My 
object and earnest desire is that you take the earliest measures 
to counteract the poison. You will be the best judge how this is 
to be effected. 

Mr. Gorham s opinion &amp; my own concur that you should 
instantly demonstrate your intentions either by purchasing or 
hiring a house in country or town. Mr. Gorham particularly 
wishes that it might be Lane s in Cambridge. In any event of 
your determination, I am persuaded that you will receive this 
letter with that cordial friendship with which it is written. No 
person knows that I write but Mr. Gorham. 

I neither expect or wish you to reply, as I shall set out for 
Penobscot in a day or two and shall be absent a month. 

With respects to Mrs. King, I am, my dear Sir, 

You sincere &amp; affectionate, 

H. KNOX.

C. GORE TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, August 30, 1788. 

MY DEAR SIR : 

I did not receive your last favor till some posts after it was 
due owing to my absence from town. The subject of it is really 
interesting to me and I have endeavored to see and converse 
with Mr. Gorham on the contents : but he is gone to the West 
ward on his land purchase. Before the receit of your letter we 
did consult on the propriety of your taking some decisive steps 
which shou d evidence to the citizens of Massachusetts that you 
were really an inhabitant of this State. He was then fully of 
opinion that it was not only proper, but absolutely necessary to 
the attainment of our wishes And, I assure you, my friend, the 
more information I attain, &amp; the oftener I reflect on the subject, 
the more I am convinced of the necessity that you shoud fix 
your domicile in this Commonwealth, the sooner the better. 

Parties begin to run high ; it is said the Govr. aims at the 
Presidency &amp; disdains a second seat. How far this is true 
you can determine as well as myself. It is said, and I believe 
with truth that Mr. Adams is desirous of being V. President. 
The candidates for Senators are Bowdoin, Strong, Sedgwick, 
Otis &amp; yourself and Sam Adams. The two first, I presume, 
would not willingly accede to the choice. Otis &amp; Adams are 
not likely to be successful. Clearing up the question of inhabi 
tancy, I think the friends of the Constitution and those who wish 
it to be administered with dignity wou d be anxious to give you 
a decided choice and that their wishes woud be completely 
gratified. 

Lowell declines going for this district and I really believe 
Dawes the most likely candidate ; but this is judging of what 
appears at present, &amp; these appearances may greatly alter in 
future. . . . 

Your friend, 

C. GORE. 

Endorsed by R. King : " Ans. 6. Sep. and requested him 
to purchase for me Cushing s house at 5000 dollars." 



344 RUFUS KING. [1788- 

In accordance with the instructions of Mr. K s letter of 
the 6th of September, Mr. Gore writes to him that he had 
made inquiries about the house, stating that it could be 
bought and that the agent desired he should become the 
owner of it ; closing the letter thus : 

" Where will the first Congress meet ? * Hancock and his 
friends really expect that he will be President." 

On Sept. 25th, Mr. Gore says, after speaking of the 
negotiation about the property: 

" I hope my conduct will meet your approbation. If not too 
inconvenient, I should wish you to be here speedily it is probable 
this and other matters might be accommodated to your satisfac 
tion." 

Questions arose as to the title of the property and as to 
the time of getting possession of it, for Mr. Gushing, the 
occupant was unwilling, and refused, to move out except for 
a considerable sum of money. Mr. Gore wrote, Oct. I2th: 

"The house of John Gushing will be conveyed to me the 
morrow by Deacon Davis. Mr. Gushing must move out, as he 
is engaged to go to Somersworth in New Hampshire. I offered 
him *]Q to move out quietly and he and his wife to quit 
claim to you all their right and title. He thinks you would do 
more for him and though the man has not the least title now to 
the estate, he talks as one who had compleat controul. 

" I am to pay Davis within three weeks, and before that time 
you will certainly be here. The Gen. Court sits the 2pth of this 
month, and I must pray you wou d make one of my family imme 
diately. The sooner the better, and certainly before the coming 
together of the Genl. Court. I am sure all your friends agree 
in the necessity of your coming to this town. . . 

" Sincerely your friend 

" C. GORE. 

* After two months from the beginning of July when Congress was informed 
of the adoption by the ninth state, it was decided that Congress should meet in 
New York.

Oct. 4th, 88. 

MY DEAR FRIEND : 

The appointment to the attorneyship of this district is that 
mark of distinction which gratifies me. I sincerely feel the part 
you have taken in this business, and your congratulations on the 
nomination as fresh instances of your friendship. Mr. Jackson s 
appointment is very pleasing to a numerous class of respectable 
citizens in this State, and I hope will in some measure lessen the 
mortification his friend Lowell feels for himself. 

When I have the pleasure to meet you, I will mention to you 
some anecdotes of your quondam preceptor (Theophilus Parsons) 
indicative of his wishes for the bench, the meanness of his 
attempts to attain the situation, and the weakness of his own 
cunning. But these are too descriptive of the man to appear on 
paper. . . . 

Your friend, 

C. GORE. 



C. GORE TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, Nov. 23d, 1788. 

MY DEAR SIR : 

On Friday the House chose two Senators Mr. Strong and Mr. 
Jarvis. The Senate concurr d the former &amp; negativ d the latter, 
sending to the house Lowell the house negativ d Lowell &amp; 
returned Jarvis, Senate non-concurred Jarvis &amp; returned Orne. 
The house again put up Jarvis Senate non-concurred &amp; sent 
down Dalton. The house chose Dane by a majority of one ; and 
thus the matter rests. Whether the Senate will agree to Dane or 
adhere to their own vote is uncertain. 

The monstrous lies told by your Essex friends pervaded every 
quarter of the house and the envy of these people had much 
greater weight than I coud have suppos d. My dear friend, I 
must pray you not to surfer these things to estrange you from 



346 RUFUS KING. [1788- 

Massachusetts : unless very interesting objects render your resi 
dence in New York necessary, think seriously of returning to the 
State of your nativity. Sedgwick is sore as man can be ; he feels 
&amp; acknowledges to me the error of his conduct. . 

Most sincerely your friend 
C. GORE. 

C. GORE TO R. KING. 

Nov. 26, 1788. 
MY DEAR FRIEND : 

In my last I inform d you that the Senate had sent to the house 
Mr. Dalton as Senator that the House non-concurr d and sent 
up Dane. On Monday morning, notwithstanding the influence of 
Phillips, who exerted himself most warmly for D., the Senate non- 
concurr d and repeated Dalton, and with much trouble owing 
mostly to the Essex members, we carried Dalton, who is now the 
Senator. Soon after your departure, I was convinced that my 
wishes coud not be gratified. The various falsehoods indus 
triously propagated, and appositely turnd to the prejudices of 
those to whom they were applied, so powerfully operated, as to 
leave nothing but defeat in the hazard deeply mortified are the 
partizans of P. and his coadjutors. Dane was exalted as one, 
who, through ev ry opposition of proffered favors, on the one 
side, &amp; cruel persecution on the other, perseveringly pursued the 
defaulters of public money &amp; the domineering aristocrats of our 
dear country as a friend to the Constitution, supported by the 
uniform of Genl. Knox and other firm federalists and a letter 
from Mr. Dane indicative of these sentiments was shown to 
those who wished well to the Constitution. But these things did 
not prevail. Among other things whispered against one of the 
candidates was added that Mr. Dane woud have succeeded in 
his wish of appointing Mr. Jackson a commissioner for settling 
the Continental accounts, had it not been for the influence of 
that gentleman in the election in Congress. This I knew not, 
till after the choice. I enquired of Mr. Otis whether this was in 
any degree founded. He replied, that my mentioning it was the 
first insinuation of the kind he ever heard and that he believed no 
influence coud have securd this gentleman the place of com 
missioner. 



1789] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 347 

Lowell, Dawes &amp; Otis are the predominating candidates for this 
district. I think the choice of one of the first two is most likely, 
and the middle man the most probable tho great exertions will 
be made for all. I say nothing about your future residence of 
this you alone can determine the propriety. Every thing that 
envy can suggest will be brought forward to detract from your 
reputation in this country ; and if you shoud conclude to remain 
in N. York, it will be urged as an argument of duplicity on your 
part. But I wish you, my friend, not to be influenced by any con 
duct of mine in the late politics, to elect this as the place of your 
residence. I say this much because I know it will be urged on 
you as an argument for removing from N. York. My conduct 
and reputation cannot suffer from any insinuations of such vile 
partizans as oppose you while I am present, and I earnestly 
desire that you woud suffer such arguments to have no force on 
your mind, in opposition to your true interests as they shall be 
impartially weighed by yourself. 

Adieu, sincerely your friend, 

C. GORE. 

C. GORE TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, December 14, 1788. 
MY DEAR FRIEND : 

. . . Tomorrow I go to Salem . . . probably I shall 
there see Mr. Jackson, and shall feel peculiar pleasure in stating 
to him part of your letter. Whether this story was immediately 
the fabrication of Parsons, or Dane I cannot tell ; but Parsons 
told it to Mr. Dalton as a truth. I never had a doubt of its false 
hood. The knowing ones of Essex are the people that support 
Dane ; before the adjournment of the Genl. Court they had a 
meeting and agreed to give their influence in favor of De. 

Suffolk will, as you suggest, be much divided. Adams, Otis, 
Ames &amp; Heath &amp; James Bowdoin jr will probably be voted for ; 
and it is probable that at the first meeting no choice will be made ;

C. GORE TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, Deer. 21, 1788. 
MY DEAR FRIEND : 

. . . The election in Suffolk is clearly for Ames. Adams 
has been distanced even in Boston. In the country he had very 
few votes. The people of the County and I believe I may say 
with perfect truth, those who voted for Ames in this town to a 
man had determined to vote for Mr. K., till the warrant for sum 
moning the inhabitants to vote for a representative had issued. 
When it appeared that the selectmen, adopting the unconstitu 
tional restriction of the resolve of the Genl. Court, directed the 
vote to be given for a man who was an inhabitant of the County 
of Suffolk. This very explicit restriction operated so powerfully 
on the timid &amp; uninform d, who were too indolent to read the 
Constitution for themselves, or, if informed, were afraid that an 
opposition to the resolve would be injurious, joined to a much 
larger number, who were afraid that non-residence in one candi 
date would throw many votes in favor of another, who was abhored 
for his antifederalism, obliged the Feds to relinquish their candi 
date and run for Ames, who is strictly federal, an honorable man 
&amp; in the estimation of his friends wants nothing but age and ex 
perience to render him a very able supporter of his country s 
rights. I ought to say in justice to Ames that he was very desir 
ous that Mr. K. shoud be elected in preference to himself ; and 
to this purpose did use all his influence till he was convinc d that 
it would not avail. Mr. Otis very chearfully offered to give up 
his pretensions if the election of Mr. K. cou d thereby be secured. 

In Essex there is no probability of an election Jackson has 
all the votes in Marblehead 99 77 in Beverly Dane 30. 
Goodhue 198 in Salem, Jackson 8, Dane i. I have not heard 
from Newburyport or Haverhill. Andover gave all for Dane. 
The wise men of Essex are at variance ; they say every thing bad 
of P., impute to him corrupt motives and deceitful conduct. At 
Dalton s senatorial honors, they are mortified beyond measure. 
In Middlesex no election probably Groset is the member for 
Worcester, farewell . . . 

Sincerely your friend 

C. GORE. 



1789] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 349 

The letter of Mr. Gore, of November 26th, alludes to a 
visit of Mr. King to Boston in October or November, in 
which he must have learned many circumstances as to the 
probabilities of his being selected for any of the leading 
offices of the new government. It may be certainly assumed 
that the visit was not to put himself forward as a candidate, 
as he never, in his long public career, solicited an appoint 
ment. But he must have learned the strong opposition 
made against him by others, his old friends, and returned to 
New York without having bought a house or established a 
residence. It was not long before he received the intelli 
gence that the offices were all filled and that he was left out. 
From these letters we clearly discern that the facts of his 
marriage in New York, of the increasing years of Mr. Alsop, 
requiring the care of his daughter, and his long absence, as 
a resident, from Massachusetts, giving some ground for the 
charge that he had forsaken the State, and for even former 
friends, with ambitious views of their own, to plot against 
him, were the leading reasons for Mr. King s abandonment 
of Massachusetts, and making his future home in New 
York. To these may be added still another reason, the 
urgency of the friends in New York to whom he had be 
come attached, and who were earnest in their endeavours 
to retain him among them, by holding out to him offers 
of promotion which had been withheld in his native State 
and which he felt was his due, for the devotion to the public 
business and the consciousness of his own powers. There 
is nowhere any specific statement among his papers other 
than has been presented, there being no mention of the 
fact except in the following letters to Mr. Gore, and one, June 
7, 1789, to Dr. Southgate. 



C. GORE TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, January 29, 1789. 
MY DEAR FRIEND : 

I have seen &amp; convers d with Mr. Jackson on the subject of 
Parsons communication to Mr. Dalton. Mr. Jackson begs me to 



350 RUFUS KING. [1788- 

assure you that he has not the least reason to believe this asser 
tion of P. to be true that he has now and always had the greatest 
confidence in your honor and friendship and that it is not in the 
power of P. in the smallest degree to shake that confidence. 

Mr. Sedgwick, of whom I ask d the reason of why he shou d 
express himself in the manner he did respecting your being in this 
town, declares, that he said what passd on this subject to Gen. 
Knox as a mutual friend, who might communicate to you, not his 
sentiments, but the opinion of illiberal men ; and that he had fre 
quently endeavor d to say the same thing to you personally, but 
cou d not bring his mind to state such uncandid observations to a 
friend for whom he entertained so high a respect and this he 
desires me to communicate to you. . . . Your friend

MY DEAR FRIEND : 

. . I sincerely regret that such circumstances arose as to ex 
clude Mass, from your able support in the admin, of this Govern 
ment. Tho out of the Legislature I hope you will not be a 
private citizen. That many considerations shou d lead you to 
prefer residing in New York, while that city is the seat of national 
Government, I can conceive I shou d be personally gratified in a 
high degree to have Boston the place of your residence. I have 
always doubted whether this cou d be for your interest unless you 
were in the Government from this State. If you should go abroad, 
I shall be very solicitous to pass a few weeks with you before you 
go. ... Affectionately your friend

MY DEAR FRIEND : 

I am sorry that such circumstances did not exist as to render 
that place the most eligible to you, which the fates have allotted 
for my residence. While I wish this had been the case, I feel 
that every man ought in such a choice to be guided by reasons 
and circumstances, of which he alone is the proper judge. . . .

R. KING TO DR. SOUTHGATE. 

NEW YORK, 7 June, 1789. 

Contrary to my former intentions I have become an inhabitant 
of this State &amp; have no expectation of again returning to live in 
Massachusetts. Altho the motives of this Determination are 
important and weighty as they respect my interest &amp; that of my 
little family, I however sincerely regret that I am to be so far 
separated from my Relations and friends whose real prosperity &amp; 
happiness must be forever dear to me. 

My eldest son whom we call John Alsop, is more than seven 
teen months old, and begins by his little prattle to be very amus 
ing. Our youngest we intend to name Charles ; he is three 
months old &amp; has at this time the smallpox. They are both 
healthy and if we do not judge too partially, they are promising 
boys. Mrs. King &amp; Mr. Alsop are both in good health, and 
although I do not use as much exercise as I should, I never en 
joyed higher health. My first son you perceive is named for his 
Grandfather : the second is mere fancy. I had some thoughts of 
calling him Richard, but Charles being a favorite name, I pre 
ferred it.

CHAPTER XIX. 

Ratification of the new Constitution by New York Stipulating for Amendments 
Election of U. S. Senators under it Philip Schuyler and Rufus King 
The latter draws the long Term R. King Memorandum, Conversation 
with Gov. Clinton Fenno s Newspaper Madison on Virginia Convention 
C. Pinckney and Choice of Senators in S. Carolina Mr. Gore s on 
Elections in Massachusetts, on Ship-building, Timber, etc., Hamilton, 
Gore, Wetmore on R. King s Election as Senator Gore Appointments 
in Massachusetts And Provision by Congress for Payment of the domestic 
Debt Funding it suggested. 

The ratification of the new Federal Constitution by the 
State of New York had been adopted, after earnest debate 
and the serious opposition of Governor Clinton and his fol 
lowers, but on an implied condition that at the earliest 
moment certain amendments should be proposed to be 
made. Indeed in a circular-letter * from the Convention of 
the State of New York to the Governors of the different 
States, Governor Clinton says " that nothing but the fullest 
confidence of obtaining a revision of them by a general con 
vention, and an invincible reluctance to separating from our 
sister States, could have prevailed upon a sufficient number 
to ratify it, without stipulating for previous amendments." 
And they ask for a convention to be held at some future 
day. Though entertained by some the proposition fell 
through, and the Constitution having been finally adopted 
by more than the required number of States, the Governor 
summoned a meeting of the Legislature to choose officers 
to put the new Constitution into operation. The result of 
the election gave a majority in the Senate to the Federalists, 

* Jay s Corresp., vol. iii., p. 353, N. Y., 1893. 
352 



1789] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 353 

who were earnest supporters of the new Constitution, while 
the Assembly was Anti-Federal, or composed of those who 
had supported Governor Clinton in his opposition. 

In consequence of this, though the State was districted, 
for the election of members to the House of Representa 
tives, and members to the first Congress were chosen, there 
was a radical disagreement as to the mode of electing 
Senators and electors; the Senate claiming that they should 
be chosen by a concurrent vote, which would have given the 
federalists at least one Senator, and the House demanding 
that the choice should be made by joint ballot, which would 
have resulted in the choice of Anti-Federalists. The Legisla 
ture adjourned without coming to a decision, and New York 
was not represented in the first electoral college, or in the 
early period of the first Senate. 

To put an end to this unfortunate position, Governor 
Clinton in the spring of 1789 called a special meeting of the 
Legislature for the 6th of July, for which an election was 
held, which resulted in giving a majority in both Houses to 
the Federalists. Among others chosen to the Assembly 
from the city of New York was Mr. King, who by his 
recent decision to become a resident of New York had be 
come eligible as a member. His federal friends placed him 
in nomination, and he received a vote as large as that given 
to the other federal candidates, native residents of the city.* 

Mr. King took his seat when the Assembly met, and as an 
evidence of the judgment in which he was held, was placed 
upon two important committees : one with Messrs. Watts, 
chairman, and Lewis, to collect and digest the rules of the 
House ; and the other, on the Hth, as one of the commis 
sioners of the House and Senate, with full powers to declare 
the consent of the Legislature, to the erection of a certain 
territory within its jurisdiction into a State viz. Vermont. 

* The N. Y. Democrat and Weekly Register, June 4, announces the election 
of R. King by 1173 votes, with Messrs. G. Verplanck and R. Watts, who 
received each 1176. 

VOL. I. 23 



354 RUFUS KING. [1789 

In consequence of his transfer to the United States Senate 
a few days afterwards, he did not act on either of these 
committees. 

As will be seen by the extract from the Democrat, Messrs. 
Schuyler and King were chosen, after several ballots as to 
the latter,* first Senators from the State of New York, in 
the Senate of the United States, and, as announced by the 
Democrat of the 23d of July, Mr. King arrived that after 
noon from Albany to take his seat, and, in that paper of the 
3Oth, it was announced : " On Saturday last, the Hon. Rufus 
King, Esq., and on Monday, Hon. Philip Schuyler took their 
seats in the Congress of the United States as Senators from 
the district of New York, and on Tuesday on balloting for 
their class in the Senate, Mr. King drew the class which is 
to continue six years, and Mr. Schuyler that of two." 

In connection with this election, the following paper in 
the handwriting of Mr. King will be found an interesting 
document : 

* The detail of the election is thus recorded in the Democrat, July 23, 1789 : 

" July 10, 1789. The Bill for appointing Senators from N. York to the ist 
Congress of the U. S. passed the assembly and Philip Schuyler and James Duane 
were nominated. 

" July 14, 1789. Mr. Sill nominated Philip Schuyler for U. S. Senator. 
Mr. Schoonmaker nominated Rufus King. Mr. Schuyler was nominated 37 to 
19. Mr. Seeman nominated James Duane. Mr. Smith amended and nomi 
nated Rufus King, and Mr. Jones, Ezra L Hommedieu. Mr. Schoonmaker 
moved that Lewis Morris be inserted. The last was rejected. Mr. L Hom 
medieu was rejected 36 to 20 for him Mr. King was rejected 34 to 21 for 
him and James Duane was nominated 34 to 19. 

" July 15, 1789. In Senate. James Duane was rejected 10 to 9. P. Schuy 
ler was elected 13 to 9. Mr. L Hommedieu was nominated and Rufus King 
by Mr. Livingston. The latter was rejected 6 to 12, and L Hommedieu chosen 
II to 7. 

" July 16, 1789. The Senate sent a message to the House that Duane was 
rejected and L Hommedieu was chosen. The House on motion of J. Smith 
refused to concur 43 to 24. Rufus King was then nominated &amp; by amendment, 
Lewis Morris, latter rejected 34 to 12. The question of the nomination of Mr. 
King was then put and carried unanimously. On the same day in the Senate, 
on the question of concurring in the resolution of the assembly, it was agreed 
to, Mr. King being elected by 12 against 8."

" N. YORK, 12 June, 1789. 

" Gov. Clinton called on me yesterday. The servant denied me 
and he left his compliments. To-day I called on him. After 
observing that he had called on me once or twice, and to avoid 
ceremony had not left a card, he remarked that he should have 
called the Legislature to meet on the first of July, but was appre 
hensive that the week might be lost from the celebration of the 
4th of July ; that he did not think that the Legislature wd. have 
occasion to be together more than one week, as their only busi 
ness wd. be the choice of Senators. He remarked that the con 
troversy of last winter on the part of the Feds, was probably 
grounded on a desire for particular men for the office on the 
other hand he suggested the idea of the Antis. having conscien 
tious scruples concerning the manner of the Choice, and that 
they were not united in their men, could they have even regu 
lated the manner of Choice ; that Mr. Lansing wd. not have 
served, and that Melancton Smith had disgusted many of the 
Antifeds. by acceding to the Ratification of the Constitution ; 
that therefore his Choice wd. have been difficult. 

" The Govr. asked who were spoken of as candidates. I ob 
served that I had never conversed with any Member of Assembly 
on the Subject, and knew nothing more than the loose conversa 
tion of unimportant politicians ; that I had heard the names of 
Genl. Schuyler, Judge Gates, Mr. Lansing, Mr. Duane, Judge Morris 
and the Chancellor mentioned, but I knew nothing of the private 
opinion of influential men. The Govr. observed that Mr. Lansing 
wd. not serve if elected, that his prospects were good in his pro 
fession, and that he owed it to a numerous young family not to 
go into public life ; that he thought it an important question 
whether any Gentleman in the State Judiciary ought to take a 
share in the national Legislation ; that this might be confounding 
the judiciary and legislative Departments ; besides that it had 
uniformly been his Opinion that the Offices of Great power shd. 
not all be concentered in a certain party or family association ; 
that their abilities and Wealth already gave them great influence, 
and that the addition of great Offices to the entire exclusion of 
other Characters might endanger the public Liberty ; that he was 
desirous that they shd. be allowed their reasonable share, accord- 



356 RUFUS KING. [1789 

ing to their abilities, and that he wd. pay a proper consideration 
to their property ; but that such Allowance shd. be a distinct 
thing from a monopoly of the public Offices. He observed that 
Mr. Duane had considered it as his right to be appointed a 
Senator ; but that it was not a right of any man. Mr. Duane had 
said in some conference as to the manner of Choice, that he wd. 
not give up his right. A member criticising the expression, Mr. 
D. observed that he meant his right as a Member of the Senate, 
which Body ought to have a negative in the Choice. The Govr. 
added that some persons had thought that there shd. be a mer 
cantile character in the Senate, but that it was difficult to find 
one, in all points suitable ; that he had heard my name men 
tioned, but that I was not a mercantile man. I here observed 
that it had been mentioned to me, but not by any member of the 
assembly. Besides that I was but lately an Inhabitant of the 
State, that many of the old and very respectable Citizens would 
claim it as their right, and that I had no Disposition to enter 
into any Controversy on the subject. 

" The Govr. observed that the novelty of my Inhabitancy could 
be no objection, that I was a Member of the Assembly, and that 
he had ever considered that appointment as sufficient authority 
for him to appoint any person to an Office for which he might in 
his judgment appear capable ; that as to the Expectations of any 
Gentleman that they had a right to the Office, &amp;c, he repeated 
his former Observations with this addition, that formerly there 
were two great Families or Parties, namely Delancys and Living 
stons ; that from their Opposition they kept so constant a watch 
on each other, that neither dared any measure injurious to the 
mass of the people ; that the case was now different, the Delancy 
party was extinct by the Revolution, and all the great and opulent 
families were united in one Confederacy ; that his Politicks were 
to keep a constant eye to the measures of this Combination, and 
he thought the People shd. be on their Guard against their active 
Efforts. He observed that he had not heard my name mentioned 
by any of the Members of the City, but by some Gentlemen from 
the Country. He added that he thought there shd. be an under 
standing among the Members of Assembly previous to the Meet 
ing as to the individuals of their Choice. 

" Concerning the removal of the Legislature to this City, he ob- 



1789] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 357 

served that it had been forced from this place by the indiscretion 
of the city members ; that the Country members were men of 
sound Judgment, but not used to public speaking ; that they 
were ridiculed and their speeches improperly taken and published 
by Childs ; that a remonstrance presented to the Legislature at a 
certain time, he believed it concerned the emission of the paper 
Money, had placed in a ridiculous view some part of a Speech of 
a Mr. Taylor a member from Albany, that from that moment he 
foresaw that Taylor wd. attempt, and succeed in it, to remove the 
Legislature to Albany ; that if the City Members had been pru 
dent and wd. have gratified the Country Members with meeting 
sometimes for a short session (for example) at Poughkeepsie or 
Esopus, they never would have thought of a removal."

BOSTON, 1 8 January, 1789. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

This will be handed you by my friend Mr. John Fenno, who 
has conceiv d a plan, of publishing a newspaper in the city of 
New York, or in such a place as Congress may reside, for the 
purpose of disseminating favorable sentiments of the federal con 
stitution, and its administration. His literary accomplishments 
are very handsome, and from long acquaintance, I am confident 
his honour &amp; fidelity are unquestionable. His talents, as the editor 
of a public paper, are unrivall d in this Commonwealth and the 
cause of truth, and federalism are much indebted to his pen for 
the various and honourable supports, they have receiv d from the 
Centinel. The particular and definite objects of his plan, as well 
as the manner of prosecuting it, he will do himself the honor to 
lay before you from his capacity in this character, and his 
assiduity in business, he is in hopes of obtaining the patronage of 
Congress, and rendering himself worthy of confidence in the 
printing of their journals, and official papers If, in either of 
these objects you can promote his designs, you will aid a sensi- 



358 RUFUS KING. [1789 

ble &amp; deserving man ; who, in my opinion, is capable of perform 
ing essential service in the cause of federalism &amp; good govern 
ment and you will greatly oblige 

Your affectionate friend, 

C. GORE.

N. YORK, Jany. 23d, \ after 8 o c. 
DEAR SIR : 

I have this instant reed, your favr. of the i6th, and have but a 
few moments to thank you for it. I have also just reed, a letter 
from Genl. Washington. It contains nothing very material or 
new. The Genl. thinks that although there is an uncertainty in 
the case, the final decision will prove that a large majority in 
Virga. are in favor of the Constitution. If nine States should 
precede it seems now to be admitted on all hands that Virga. will 
accede. Every post confirms the opinion that the Constn. is re 
gaining its lost ground. It is impossible to express how much 
depends upon the result of the deliberations of your Body. The 
arrival of the French Minister here must have got to Boston 
through the Gazettes. He has been too long on the way to add 
much to former intelligence. It seems still possible that war may 
take place, though the embers are stifled for the moment. A 
Congs. was made for the first time on Monday, &amp; Mr. C. Griffin 
has been placed in the chair. 

Adieu Yours sincerely,

CHARLES PINCKNEY TO RUFUS KING. 

CHARLESTON, January 26, 1789. 
DEAR KING : 

I am much obliged to you for your friendly letter which received 
some days since &amp; for the information it contains respecting our 
new federal system, a system you well know I am much attached 
to not so much I trust from that fondness which men sometimes 
feel for a performance in which they have been concerned, as 
from a conviction of its intrinsic worth &amp; that is now almost our 
only refuge. 



1789] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 359 

I am flattered by your wish that I might be one of the Senators 
of this State in Congress. And I should in all probability have 
been one, had not considerations of a private nature prevented 
me from becoming a candidate. These were the advanced age 
&amp; infirmities of Mr. Laurens &amp; my mother, the latter of whom 
was extremely averse to my leaving Carolina for two or three 
years and a purchase I had made in the city which I wished to 
complete. . . . Indeed the considerations I have stated, ap 
peared when combined to be so forcible that I yielded without 
hesitation to the propriety of remaining some time longer at home 
this being once determined, my two partial friends requested 
me to say that if I was elected, I would accept the appointment 
of Governor as successor to my kinsman. I agreed to this &amp; 
being very generally elected on Monday last, I was qualified. 

Our Senators were on Thursday chosen they are Pierce Butler 
&amp; Ralph Izard Esquire both strong federalists, &amp; will I trust do 
credit to their appointment. Our members are for the other 
Branch. William Smith and Daniel Huger Esquire, federalists. 
Burke &amp; Thomas Sumpter Esquire who opposed the constitution, 
&amp; Doctor Tucker who is with you &amp; whose sentiments I am 
unacquainted with. 

You know I always preferred the election by the legislature, to 
that of the people, &amp; I will now venture to pronounce that the 
mode which you &amp; Madison &amp; some others so thoroughly con 
tended for &amp; ultimately carried is the greatest blot in the consti 
tution of this however more hereafter. 

I take it for granted you will be in the federal legislature. If 
your state knows her interest, &amp; she is not in general blind to it, 
I am sure you will be there. My present office requires my more 
particular attention to political inquiries than any other &amp; as our 
State, if not now the first in Exports stands high in the commer 
cial line, it will become me to be very punctual &amp; exact in re 
ceiving the earliest information of what may be done upon this 
subject by Congress. Be therefore liberal in your favours &amp; write 
me often and fully. . . . Believe me with friendship &amp; sincere 
regard 

Yours Truly, 

CHARLES PINCKNEY.

MY DEAR FRIEND : 

. . . I am perfectly in opinion with you that the disclosure 
of anything relative to Mr. H s (Hancock) conduct during the 
convention is unjust, ungenerous, &amp; highly impolitick. I know 
not the author of those writings signed Saco tho I believe they 
flow from a source the streams of which will ever be fetid and 
corrupt. . . . Dana thinks the Sup. Jud. Crts. of the several

troduce too great jarring of interests in the same judiciary. . . . 

Sincerely your friend 
C. GORE. 

C. GORE TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, April 25, 1789. 

. . . The Boston votes for Senators has deeply mortified the 
friends of Government. If this town shou d be equally wild in 
her choice of representatives, the antifeds. will be warm, &amp;, I fear, 
successful in their exertions to embarrass the Genl. Government. 
I wish our friend Thatcher would talk with more discretion on 
some topics, they are important in the minds of many worthy 
men and I shou d suppose such conduct might lessen his influ 
ence in the Government at least I do not see any good conse 
quence that can flow from running against the prejudice of any 
religious sect. 

It is said Congress are laying very heavy duties on hemp and 
cordage. As an individual I fear whether heavy duties on such 
articles will not injure our shipbuilding, fishery, and carrying 
trade. I have not the means or ability clearly to decide how far 
these duties ought to be carried ; but I think it obvious that the 
duty may be so high as to injure our marine ; and this is too im 
portant an object to be hastily passed over. I have written to 
Ames on the subject, not that I think I cou d throw any great 
light on the business, but lead his attention to an accurate weight 
of the advantages on both sides. . . . 

Adieu, I am sincerely yours 

C. GORE.

BOSTON, April 29, 1789. 

MY DEAR FRIEND : 

. . . Our shipwrights are very anxious that Congress shou d 
promote their business and indeed so many people are main 
tained by this branch of manufacture, and it is so important to 
the union, that too much exertion cannot be made to give it suc 
cess. The exportation of ship timber is increasing, while the 
trees that afford it are diminishing and no new groves are 
planted or sources of this valuable article opening to our view. 

The attention of Congress to this article of exports and recom 
mendation to the several State Legislatures to promote the plant 
ing of the acorn, may be attended with very happy consequences 
to future generations, and the honourable increase of our marine. 
If I am right in these ideas, you can judge, and I am sure will 
promote them. 

Farewell, sincerely and affectionately your friend, 

C. GORE. 



C. GORE TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, June 7, 1789. 

Our elections are settled &amp; generally to my satisfaction. That 
Mr. Hancock is chief Magistrate will at least tend to the peace of 
Massachusetts, as much as though his rival has been successful. 
Mr. Adams has always been for the support of the government, in 
the administration of which he has borne sway. That he shou d 
receive honor and rewards, at the latter day of a life, spent in the 
service of his country, ought not to displease any one. Our good 
friend Genl. Lincoln appears to enjoy good health and spirits 
which I presume are heightened by the prospect of some permanent 
support from the General Government. Our Senate is federal to 
an high degree ; not more than eight bad can be counted these 
can in no instance be a majority therefore evil may be prevented. 
The house has hitherto shewn no disposition to interfere with the 
fed. govt. A motion was made to raise a committee for the purpose 



362 RUFUS KING. [1789 

of considering the expediency of an application to Congress on 
the subject of amendments. I requested the mover to withdraw 
his motion, as it was contrary to the sense of the people that a 
convention shou d be called &amp; this was the only mode in whh. 
the Legislature cou d interfere and Congress had already as 
signed a time for the consideration of this subject. He refus d to 
withdraw, as the object of his motion was only to consider the ex 
pediency of adopting some measure. On which I made some good- 
natured observations, &amp; assured myself that the House had too 
much regard for the time and money of their constituents to spend 
either so wantonly, as considering such questions. The gentn. 
who seconded, withdrew his support and no other appeared to 
promote the idea, &amp; it died. This I considered as a favorable 
symptom &amp; conclusive evidence that no plan has yet been agreed 
on to oppose the govt. We shall adjourn probably the latter end 
of this week. Till the intention of Congress is known relative to 
the assumption of funds, the State cannot, with propriety, make 
any arrangement for the payment of their debts. If the national 
government cou d assume the different state debts, the conse 
quence, I shou d presume would be greatly beneficial to America. 
But if attempted, this must be done speedily that it will tend to a 
consolidation of the union will presently be foreseen &amp; therefore 
objected to by State demagogues. If slowness of progress is evi 
dence of wisdom Congress certainly must be pronounc d a wise 
body, &amp; the revenue system will be perfect. The people of this 
State have been expecting the operation of this system ev ry post ; 
I hope it will not be long before it commences, &amp; that no period 
to its duration will be inserted in the act ; and I do likewise hope 
that it will be appropriated to the payment of foreign &amp; domestic 
debt. In some degree, I think, our national character at stake 
in this business, and that the earliest opportunity ought to be em- 
brac d of evincing to the world an honest disposition a different 
conduct will be readily followed by the several States. 

I am happy to find that you are in the Legislature of New York 
and hope soon to hear of your being in the national govt. When 
do you go ? &amp; how long do you stay in Albany ? . . . 

Most truly your friend 

C. GORE.

A. HAMILTON TO R. KING.* 

ALBANY, July 15, 1789. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

I received your letter by the last Post but one. I immediately 
set about circulating an idea, that it would be injurious to the 
city to have Duane elected, as the probability was some very un 
fit character would be his successor. My object was to have this 
sentiment communicated to our members. But a stop was put to 
my measures by a letter received from Burr, announcing that at 
a general meeting of the Federalists of both houses Schuyler and 
Duane had been determined upon in a manner that precluded 
future attempts. 

I find however by a letter from General Schuyler received this 
day that L Hommedieu and Morris may spoil all. Troupe tells 
me that L Hommedieu is opposed to you. He made our Friend 
Benson believe that he would even relinquish himself for you. 
What does all this mean ? 

Certain matters here, about which we have so often talked, re 
main in statu quo. 

Yrs. sincerely, 

A. HAMILTON. 



C. GORE TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, July 25, 1789. 
MY DEAR FRIEND : 

. . . Albany (in Fenno s gazette) attracted my notice, but 
having before read in our papers that Genl. Schuyler and Mr. 
Duane were chosen Senators, I read that sketch as I generally do 
advertisements ; till I met with a paragraph announcing the ap 
pointment of Rufus King, a Senator for the State of New York. 
To you who know my wish for the best adminn. of the federal 
government and that those who are most capable from their abili 
ties &amp; inclination shou d administer it, I need not express the 
pleasure I receiv d. It was unalloy d it afforded me all the de 
light that any public event cou d produce in my mind. . . . 
Mr. Dalton writes, that Congress is anxious for a recess before

any mode is adopted for payment of the interest or principal of 
the domestic debt. The adoption of some plan for this purpose 
wou d be very favorable to many of the most influential men of 
this Commonwealth, and engage them most warmly to promote 
the operations of this government. If they are left unprotected 
&amp; unprovided for, their exertions, to say the least, will be luke 
warm. 

The present time seems, in the opinion of the wisest and best 
men, in this town, to be the most fortunate for adopting and as 
suming to the Genl. Government the excise. We now feel none 
of the evils of Government or its demands, &amp; setting aside the 
payment of our State debts, we do not (feel) the want of but a 
very small portion of this fund. 

But, from the operations of this government, we sb ld feel suf 
ficient evils to induce those who wish to gain popular favor, to 
clamour against what in future will be called a new assumption ; 
and, to say the least, there is hazard that such clamour may be 
more efficacious than it wou d be at the present time if any ob 
jection is made and of this I do not doubt. . . . 

Affectionately your friend, 

C. GORE. 

W. WETMORE TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, July 29, 1789. 
DEAR SIR : 

Need I make any apology for this letter to you upon a subject 
whh. nearly concerns ye reputation &amp; interest of your friend, or 
need I, like Govrs. Barnard and Hutchinson introduce it with the 
terms secret and confidential ? I think considering the friendship 
subsisting between us that neither of these can be necessary ; 
therefore to the point. Certain gentn. whom I have ever ranked in 
ye list of your and my friends, have been so partial to one whom 
you well know, as to hold him up among ye candidates for the 
place of district Judge for Massts. They say &amp; I believe they 
really think him to be a man of some industry, not remarkably 
deficient in law or other knowledge, not known to be dishonest &amp; 
of undoubted resolution &amp; government principles. Now if you 
shd. fortunately entertain the same opinion of him and think him 



1789] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 365 

as well qualified in other respects, as some candidates for that ap 
pointment, he would request from you, such an attention to his 
interest as an unbiassed conscience &amp; judgment can with pro 
priety render. How far some of his other friends, on account 
perhaps of prior engagements, and how far Genl. Knox, on ac 
count of a family lawsuit will be disposed to forward his interests 
is problematical ; for tho the Genl. knew the character referred to 
very early, &amp; tho he is one of the best tempered men in ye 
world, he may be, as good men often are, in such circumstances 
prejudiced against him. 

Can we now safely congratulate you on your appointment to 
the Senatorship ? I was at Portland when the paper arrived with 
ye names of Schuyler and Duane. Then came the resolve ap 
pointing Schuyler &amp; Coriolanus, and who, says the Egotist, can 
Coriolanus be ? Do you not know Rufus Coriolanus ? It cannot 
be him they would never appoint him ; but they have done it 
already it is impossible ; But when a thing takes place, it is no 
longer impossible. It is mere newspaper intelligence but it is 
Fenno s paper. I am not satisfied with the account ; Ay, that we 
all know. How many faces have gathered blackness. In this 
event ! what chagrin ! what mortification ! what disappointment ! 
I wish you were here &amp; at N. (ewburyport) for a moment to see 
with your own eyes. Your friends rejoice that N. Y. has done 
you that Justice, which the people here were ready to offer but 
were prevented by the vile &amp; secret, but successful, artifices of 
three or four vipers. But enough upon this subject &amp; I will only 
add at present that your good fortune cannot afford more real 
pleasure to any man than to your faithful friend and most obedi 
ent 

W. WETMORE. 

C. GORE TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, August 6, 1789. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

The appointments to the Judicial seats will soon be made. We 
natter ourselves in Massachusetts that one of the Supreme Court 
will be taken from this State. The general expectation is, that 
our friend Lowell will be appointed an associate judge ; and no 



366 KUFUS KING. [1789 

doubt was ever entertain d of this event, till we heard that 
our Chief Justice was in nomination. Shou d the Chief Justice 
be appointed, we shall lose an excellent man, whose talents are 
peculiarly fitted for the place he fills, without rendering any 
great service to the United States ; and a very good man will be 
extremely mortified. 

The Chf. Justice, now 56 years of age, cannot long be an 
active member of the court, and he has new habits and new 
modes of legal decision to acquire. On these grounds I much 
doubt if he wou d be an acquisition to the Union, or at least 
so great an acquisition to the Govt. as Lowell ; but, in addition 
to all the consequences, which will be apparent in your mind, 
to taking him from our State bench, Lowell s situation from such 
neglect of him, will be intolerable. Having held a similar rank 
under the old Confederation, which Commission is superseded 
only by the adoption of the new government, the neglect to 
appoint him to the supreme court will imply a conviction in the 
mind of him who appoints, that he had been tried and found 
wanting. This certainly will be disgraceful to a very good and 
able man. From a regard to the happiness and welfare of this 
State, and a wish that the just expectations of a valuable part of 
the community shou d not be disappointed, and that an honorable 
&amp; good man shou d not be extremely mortified, I request your 
attention &amp; influence in this appointment ; and I am sure, if you 
see no just reason on national grounds for preferring Gushing to 
Lowell, you will endeavour that the latter shall not be dis 
graced. . . . Affectly. yours, 

C. GORE. 



C. GORE TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, August n, 1789. 
MY DEAR FRIEND : 

Our friends are much gratified by the appointments of 
the President, &amp; the good old General (Lincoln ?) seems to have 
renewed his youth and happiness ; the appointment was unex 
pected he understood that the adoption of a general rule would 
render him ineligible. If a marshall is to be appointed for this 



1789] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 367 

district and the office should not be the choice of Mr. Jackson, or 
the pleasure of the President, Genl. Brooks of Medford, is honor 
able, dignified in his manner &amp;, I believe, very capable of per 
forming the duties of the supreme ministerial and executive 
officer of the district ; and I am confident his appointment would 
be very pleasing to the people of this district. If you think as I 
do &amp; can aid his appointment, in my opinion you will promote 
the honour of the United States, and you will render great 
service to a meritorious man. . . . 

Sincerely yours, 

C. GORE. 



C. GORE TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, August 22, 1789. 
MY DEAR FRIEND : 

Accept my unfeigned thanks for your kind &amp; affectionate letter 
of the i6th (in answer to one suggesting his name for the office 
of District Attorney). 

Whom to recommend as district judge I do not know. Sullivan 
is well qualified, in point of capacity but the world says that 
his heart is not true. Parsons, in a superior degree, is qualified 
as a lawyer, but as a man he possesses not one qualification. 
Dana is talk d of &amp; were his health not very uncertain, he 
wou d undoubtedly be a fit man. Tudor &amp; Wetmore are like 
wise candidates, as I am told. You know them as well as I 
do. They are both honest men, and the latter a painstaking 
lawyer, as the phrase is : but if Gushing shou d be appointed an 
associate judge, I do most truly hope that Mr. Lowell will be 
constituted district judge. I have mentioned with freedom these 
gentlemen &amp; tho as a public man, I shou d not be dissatisfied 
with their appointment, I do not know, that either wou d gratify 
my wishes. From different causes applying to these several 
gentlemen, I shou d not ask their friendship ; and they might 
feel this a proper and necessary requisite to the appointment 
of an attorney for the district. The report of the committee 
to the Senate made the atty. for the district to rest on the dis 
trict judge for his appointment, but the act as transmitted from 



368 RUFUS KING. [1789 

Senate to house only declar d that such an officer shou d be 
appointed. I therefore conclude that, if the act passes in its 
present form, the district attorney must be appointed by the 
President. If this appointment can be given to me without injur 
ing the just claims of others &amp; without giving pain, except what 
may arise from envy, I shou d be gratified. ... I write to 
you, my dear friend, with the frankness that I wou d speak to 
you, and with the same freedom that I think. Knowing my 
situation perfectly, as you certainly do, I commit this concern 
cheerfully to the friend of my heart, with this only assurance, 
that whatever may be the disposition of the President, if the 
appointment is with him, I shall be perfectly satisfied ; if with 
the district judge, I have too much pride and independence to 
communicate my wishes to whomever he may be. I am most 
truly your friend 

C. GORE. 

C. GORE TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, Sept. 13, 1789. 

. . . The friends of the federal government regret that so 
much time has been devoted to the subject of a permanent resi 
dence before the government was organized. What causes the 
delay of appointing the executive officers ? We have been in ex 
pectation of hearing the appointments every post the week past, 
and such is the celebrity of Col. Hamilton s name in this part of 
the country that if he is appointed to the office of Secretary of the 
Treasury, it will afford great joy to all. C , the Honesti, &amp; 
John Winthrop are the only cavillers at the doings of Congress 
among us &amp; their influence is not so great as to cause any appre 
hension. 

Farewell, I am affectionately your friend, 

C. GORE. 

C. GORE TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, Sept. 27, 1789. 
MY DEAR FRIEND : 

On my return from the country last evening, where I have been 
the past week, I met your favors 17 &amp; 2oth instant. Lowell &amp; 
Dana s appointments, if the same shou d take place will gratify 



1789] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 369 

not only me but all the friends of the Government in this dis 
trict, &amp; I cannot but hope we shall hear that Jackson is to be the 
Marshal ; he is really poor tho not embarrassed, and we know 
him honorable. For myself I can truly say, that the appointment 
of Tudor will not mortify me. 

C. GORE. 



C. GORE TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, Dec. 3, 1789. 

His Excellency has attained to such a measure of health 
(blessed be God) as again to pay and receive visits. A few days 
previous to &amp; after the arrival of the President in Boston he was 
sick. Be assured that whatever was his disorder, or the cause of it, 
those who are considered as his enemies have treated him with an 
unexpected degree of delicacy. They have been silent and his 
advocates dare not say his conduct was becoming. . . . Reports 
are that the United States will assume the debts of the several 
States. Various motives induce an acquiescence in this project 
but there are not wanting those, who will oppose it in this State 
for the reason that the federalists wish the adoption. 

Such were the measures adopted by our Legislature &amp; the con 
viction that follow d from the arguments then used in favor of 
funding the debt, that I entertain no doubt, if the same char 
acters, in the coming session, exert themselves in favor of the 
plan, it may be carried. Shou d this event take place, the as 
sumption by the national government will be attended with 
difficulties, perhaps considered too trivial by National men. 
Many who favor d the project of funding the debt the last ses 
sion will not promote it the ensuing one, if they can feel any con 
fidence in the assumption by the U. States ; but otherwise they 
are bound in honor to themselves &amp; obligation to the State credi 
tors to pursue the same measures that were proposed the last ses 
sion. Pray give me your sentiments on this subject. 

Yours truly 

C. GORE.

CHAPTER XX. 

Debate in the Senate on the permanent Residence of Congress Several 
Propositions In Pennsylvania On the Susquehanna At Germantown 
Agreement of the Pennsylvania and New York Delegates If that on the 
Susquehanna failed, then the Senate agreed it should be at Germantown. 

Among R. King s papers is this report of a debate on the 
permanent residence of Congress. 

Sept. 22, 1789. 

Butler. I am opposed to this Bill suitable buildings may be 
obtained without public expence ; it is therefore unnecessary to 
borrow a large sum of money for that object. I move to post 
pone the consideration until the next session. 

Grayson. I second the motion from So. Carolina the Bill is 
exceptionable it is problematical what rule shd. be chosen to 
decide this question. Some say population, some wealth, and 
others territory besides the expence is an objection. Virga. has 
by law offered ; 100,000, provided the Congress will reside in 
yt. State. Pensa. ought to do the same. Lands and money shd. 
be offered by the State which solicits the residence. In addition 
to this, we shd. wait till a new census &amp; until No. Carolina &amp; R. 
Island are in union. We are well accommodated here and are 
under no necessity to remove to cabins &amp; a place of general in 
convenience. 

Morris. I presume the postponement will not obtain the ob 
jection from the appropriation of money is not important. I 
think that the 100,000 Dollars will be loaned in Pen., nay the 
State will give the land, and pay to the amount of 100,000 Dol 
lars towards erecting the buildings. I cannot speak with positive- 
ness concerning the Legislature of Pensa., but if they do not, I 
am certain that individuals will do all that is necessary ; and if the 

370 



1789] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 371 

law passes, I doubt not but that the Delegates of Pensa. will come 
forward at the next session with a proposition offering free of ex 
pense to the U. S. a suitable District and monies to a considerable 
amount to erect the buildings for the accommodation of Congress. 
Lee. I concur with my colleague we are well situated here 
&amp; should remain here until we obtain farther information, con 
cerning the proper place for a permanent Residence. 

23d September, 1789. 

Mr. Morris proposed and the Senate agreed to postpone the 
preceding part of the Bill establishing the permanent Residence of 
Cong, in order to take into consideration his motion to strike out 
the proviso which requires the prerequisite of laws passed by 
Maryland &amp; Pennsylvania consenting to the removal of the ob 
structions to the navigation of the Susquehannah. He observed 
that Pennsylvania would not gratify Maryland by consenting to 
open this navigation, until Maryland would gratify Pennsylvania 
by consenting to the opening canal communication between 
Chesapeake &amp; Delaware Bays that the proviso compelled 
Pennsylvania to consent to the opening the navigation as a condi 
tion to have the Federal town, &amp; thereby deprives her of a 
consideration which wd. induce Maryland to agree to the canal 
between the Chesapeake &amp; Delaware besides, he observed that 
Maryland might desire the permanent residence to be fixed on the 
Potomac if so, the proviso requiring the consent of Maryland to 
the opening the navigation of the Susquehannah, she might decline 
giving her consent and thereby defeat the bill. Certain it is that 
many Gentlemen opposed to the Bill voted in favor of the proviso 
in hopes of thereby procuring the rejection of the Bill. 

Mr. Carroll. Maryland has incorporated a company who have 
power to open the navigation of the Susquehannah within the 
State of Maryland. That company has already expended many 
thousands to affect the navigation this remark answers the ob 
jection that Maryland might defeat the bill by withholding her 
consent that the navigation shd. be opened. Maryland has con 
sented and the consent being in nature of a contract cannot be 
revoked. As to the Canal between Ches. &amp; Del., Pennsylva. has 
proposed the subject to Maryland, and Maryld. has appointed 
Comrs. to confer with those of Pennsya. I think that Maryland 



372 RUFUS KING. [1789 

will not object one of the Comrs. has informed me that he has no 
objection, and if there is any objection, I think it must be in 
Delaware, &amp; not in Maryland. I prefer the Potomac to the Sus- 
quehannah, but if the proviso is retained &amp; the Potomac cannot 
be carried, I shall vote for the bill ; if the proviso is lost, I must 
vote against the bill. 

Maclay. Pennsylvania is not disposed to obstruct the naviga 
tion of the Susquehannah ; the business of opening the canal has 
languished; and by a late law passed on the i2th instant by 
Pennsyl. the Susquehannah is declared to be a common highway 
through the State of Pennsyl. and commissioners are appointed 
to remove the obstruction. Pennsyl. therefore, has expressed her 
consent to the opening of the navigation, and the proviso meets 
the opinion of the State as expressed by this law. I know and 
can speak with confidence concerning the navigation of the 
Susqueh. All the supplies for Gen. Sullivan s army passed thro 
my hands Until Harvest or the last of Augt. there is water 
enough the boats pass freely they carry 60 Bll. of flour or 40 
Blls. of Beef. Gen. Clinton drew his boats from the Mohawk to 
the Head of the Susquehannah and descended to the Falls. 

A Treaty being on foot between the Delegates of Penn. and 
those of the Southern States to fix the permanent residence of 
congress on the Potomac, and to make Philadelphia the tempo 
rary residence, the Delegates of the States east of New York met 
Mr. King &amp; Mr. Lawrence on behalf of those of N. Yk. and 
after considerable discussion whether the permanent residence 
ought to be on the Susquehannah or the Delaware, they agreed 
that Mr. King &amp; Mr. Goodhue shd. offer to the Delegates of 
Penn. that they would vote the permanent residence on the east 
bank of the Susquehannah within the State of Pennsylvania pro 
vided the Delegates of Penn. wd. agree to fix the temporary resi 
dence at N. York until the buildings for the permanent shd be 
ready. Mr. K. &amp; Mr. G. met the Penn. Delegates soon after yt. 
meeting and before the subject was mentioned, Mr. Madison came 
in and after conversing with the Delegates of Penn. by themselves 
for some time, the Delegates informed Mr. K. &amp; Mr. G. that they 
were so embarrassed with a connection with the Southern Dele 
gates, that they cd. not confer with us concerning the subject of 
our meeting them. Mr. K. observed to them that he &amp; Mr. G. 



1789! LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 373 

shd. not offer any proposition until they were ascertained from 
the Delegates of Penn. that they were not under any engagements 
upon the subject of the future residence of Congress. 

Mr. K. farther observed that he and Mr. Goodhue were author 
ized to speak on behalf of all the Reps. &amp; Senators except two, 
east of N. Jersey the two gentlemen s opinion, whom they ex- 
cepted, they had not had the opportunity to confer with (Ellsworth 
&amp; Wyngate) &amp; that they would not therefore speak positively 
of their opinion, but that they expected their concurrence with 
their colleagues. Mr. K. added that the Eastern States were now 
united, but that whether they ever wd. be so combined in future 
he could not say. Mr. Morris being present at this meeting after 
conferring with the Delegates of Penn. requested Mr. K. &amp; Mr. 
G. to suspend their business until he shd. confer with them in 
future. 

On the next day Mr. Morris informed Mr. K. that the Dele 
gates &amp; Senators of Penn. agreed to the proposition, which Mr. 
K. &amp; Mr. G. were authorized to offer them. 

In consequence of this agreement the house of reps, passed a 
bill which was carried by the Votes of the eastern states, carrying 
into effect the foregoing arrangement, they also agreed to a clause 
in the bill mortgaging 100,000 Dollars of the impost to defray a 
like sum which the Secretary of the Treasury was directed to 
borrow for the purchase of the land &amp; the erection of the build 
ings. The Bill came to the Senate with a proviso suspending the 
powers thereof until the President of the U. S. shd. be satisfied 
that all legal impediments in the States of Maryland &amp; Penn. 
were removed touching the opening of the navigation of the 
Susquehannah. The Senators of N. Yk requested the Delegates 
of Penn. to inform them ist. Whether they considered the proviso 
as operating against the engagement to fix the permanent seat in 
Maryland, and that of consequence the Senators of N. Yk shd. 
vote to expunge it ? 2nd. Whether if it was not expunged they 
held them bound to vote for the Delaware River ? 3rd. if that 
could not be carried, whether they held them bound finally to 
vote against the Bill ? 

" To the first the Reps, of Penn. answered unanimously in the 
affirmative to the second, they answered 7 Ay and one No. to 
the third four answered Ay and four No. ; and seven out of 



374 RUFUS KING. [1789 

eight were in favor of the Germantown District if the proviso 
could not be expunged. In this stage of the business Mr. Morris, 
a Senator from Pena., offered the Senators from N. Yk, that pro 
vided they wd. vote for the Germantown District, for the per 
manent seat of Cong., the Delegates of Pennsylvania, himself, Mr 
Read and Mr. Basset, Senators from Delaware would engage on 
honor to vote against the removal of Congress from N. Yk prior 
to Jany. 1793. Mr. Read &amp; Mr. Basset both entered into this 
engagement with Mr. K., Mr. Morris &amp; Mess. Fitzsimons, Clymer, 
Scot, the two Muhlenburghs &amp; Wynkoop signed such an engage 
ment on the 23 Sep. 1789,* &amp; Mr Morris engaged verbally to Mr. 
K. to write Mr. Paterson &amp; Mr. Elmer, Senators of New Jersey, 
&amp; Mr. Langdon, Senator of New Hampshire in the same engage 
ment. 

Connected with the Germantown plan was this proviso, " that 
Penn. shd. advance the 100,000 Dollars for purchasing, building, 
&amp;c." This arrangement was laid before the Reps, of N. Yk by 
the Senators of that state, who told the Reps they were not en 
gaged, that they asked their advice ; if they advised for or against 
it, they wd. vote accordingly : that they must take an equal por 
tion of the merit or Demerit of the measure, whichever way they 
decided or advised. The Reps, unanimously, with the exception 
of Genl. Floyd, advised the Senators to vote for the Germantown 
District, provided that the Susquehannah shd. be struck out by 

* The citizens of New York having been at a considerable expence in pre 
paring buildings for the accommodation of Congress, We the subscribers 
severally engage upon our honor that we will not consent to the removal of 
Congress from the City of New York to any other place prior to the month of 
January 1793 that we will use our influence to prevent such removal ; and we 
do hereby enjoin upon our Successors the observance of this Engagement : 
provided that this engagement is to be void unless a law passes during the 
present session to establish the permanent seat of Congress within a district in 
Pennsylvania including the Town of Germantown.

deceived him when I said a few moments since, that I 
had given my votes under a conviction that the permanent 
Residence could not now be established, and with a hope that 
the Bill wd. fail I explain, I did tell that Gentleman that I wd. 
agree to Baltimore as the permanent Residence I voted in con

vote would succeed that having failed, &amp; the Potomack having 
been established, from that moment I hoped the bill would

While many details for the proper management of its duties 
were adopted, the only important general measure presented 
and carried was that for levying duties on goods and manu 
factures from foreign countries as a source of revenue. It 
was not until July 25, 1789, that Mr. King, who had been 
chosen Senator at a special session of the New York Legis 
lature, took his seat in the Senate, and from that time on 
was actively interested in planning and aiding in perfecting 
the system of laws and regulations which were required to 
put in operation and to establish the government on a firm 
foundation. The distribution of business to the several de 
partments which were at that time created, the formation 
of the judicial courts, laws for raising revenue for the sup 
port of the government and for the payment of the debts 
contracted during and since the Revolutionary war, the 
amendments to the Constitution which had been proposed 
by different States at the time of their ratification of it, the 

376 



1790] RUFUS KING. 377 

regulation of intercourse with the Indian tribes, and other 
new questions, called for and received the earnest attention 
of Congress. 

That Mr. King s time, experience, and abilities were 
freely and fully given cannot be doubted, for the Journal of 
the Senate shows that he was on many important commit 
tees, such as those which had in charge commercial questions 
relative to the foreign and the coasting trade, the treaties 
with Indians, the payment of pensions, the compensation of 
the members of Congress, and the safe keeping of the 
records and seal of the United States ; of several of which 
committees he was the chairman. 

There is no way of ascertaining the extent and actual 
character of the work done by him, except by his recorded 
votes. For, unlike the House of Representatives, whose 
proceedings were conducted with open doors, and whose de 
bates are recorded in full, the Senate sat with closed doors, 
and no reports of what took place within are to be found, 
except in the Journal. 

It may be here stated that efforts were made at an early 
date to change this regulation. Year after year, the prop 
osition was voted down Mr. King always voting to make 
the proceedings public until, in the year 1794, when the 
question of Mr. Gallatin s right to a seat in the Senate arose, 
a motion was made and finally passed on February 2Oth, 
by a vote of 19 to 8 (Mr. King in the affirmative), " that 
after the present session of Congress and so soon as gal 
leries shall be provided, the said galleries shall be open every 
morning, so long as the Senate is engaged in their legis 
lative capacity, unless they judge secrecy required," a rule 
which still prevails. 

When the second session of Congress met, on January 
9, 1790, Mr. King was appointed by the Senate chairman of 
the committee to report an answer to the President s speech, 
which had briefly noticed the general good-will of the coun 
try towards the new government, the accesion of North 



378 RUFUS KING. [1790 

Carolina to the Constitution, and the general prosperity, and 
suggested matters which demanded the attention of Con 
gress. The answer, reported by the committee, probably 
written by the chairman, and adopted by the Senate, re 
turned the thanks of the Senate for the speech, adverted to 
the various points presented in it, with a brief statement of 
their satisfaction that the measures of the previous session 
of Congress had met with the approbation of the people, 
and closed with the statement that " our cares and efforts 
should be directed to the welfare of our country ; and we 
have the most perfect dependence upon your co-operating 
with us, on all occasions, in such measures as will insure to 
our fellow-citizens the blessings which they have a right to 
expect from a free, efficient, and equal Government." 

In the distribution of committees, Mr. King was placed 
upon those relating to the regulation of trade, naturaliza 
tion, the terms of office, and the time for choosing electors. 
But, although these and many other questions were satisfac 
torily settled, they were for a time overshadowed by 
two others ; the fixing the place for the permanent seat of 
government ; and the plan for the support of the public 
credit, known as the Funding bill. The House of Repre 
sentatives at the previous session of Congress had called 
upon the Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, 
to report upon the subject, and at an early date this session, 
a report was sent in to the House, referred to a committee, 
and not very long after gave rise to an able and at times a 
heated debate upon the principles on which the finances 
were to be established. 

The plan contemplated funding the foreign and domestic 
debt, with then accrued interest, the assumption of the 
State debts, the borrowing of a sufficient amount of money 
to pay the debts, the setting apart the revenues derived from 
customs and excise for the payment of interest and the final 
redemption of the debts, and for the creation of a national 
bank as the fiscal agent of the government. It is not in 
tended to discuss here the merits of the plan, which in the 



1 790] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 379 

main was finally adopted, limiting the amount to be allotted 
to each State, pledging in addition for the redemption of 
the whole debt the proceeds from the sales of the public 
lands ; and becoming in fact the foundation of the finan 
cial system of the United States, which, with some changes 
has prevailed ever since. 

After an earnest discussion, which aroused a strong feel 
ing and was participated in by the ablest men from every 
quarter of country, the principles upon which the general 
debt and interest were provided for, were adopted, but when 
the proposition relative to the assumption of the State 
debts came up, objections were strongly urged against it, 
and every effort was made to defeat it. Massachusetts, 
Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and South Carolina 
earnestly sought to carry it ; while Virginia, Maryland, 
North Carolina, which had only recently adopted the con 
stitution, and Georgia, with New Hampshire and Rhode 
Island, just admitted to the Union, were strongly opposed 
to it ; Pennsylvania and Delaware were divided, though the 
latter s representative was in favor of it. 

It will be seen in the correspondence presented, that the 
capitalists of Boston had opposed the funding of the debts 
as proposed, chiefly on account of the low rate of interest to 
be paid, but they and others also objected because they 
feared the State importance would be diminished when the 
debt was to be transferred to the general government. The 
representatives from Massachusetts in the House of Repre 
sentatives, however, strongly urged the plan. Virginia and 
Maryland also feared an increased influence of the general 
government, and the former resisted the assumption of the 
State debts because she had reduced hers largely by funding 
her paper money at a large discount and by extensive land 
sales in Kentucky. 

The opposition prevailed and the assumption was de 
feated by a vote of 29 to 31, and though it was brought up 
again several times, no action was taken and the whole 
measure seemed to be lost. 



380 RUFUS KING. [1790 

While this was going on the other question, which had 
been left unsettled in the last Congress, relative to the per 
manent seat of government, was pressed. The nearest ap 
proach then to a determination of this question had been to 
adopt Philadelphia, but it had failed, and the decision was 
thrown over to the present Congress, In the meantime, the 
matter had been carefully canvassed, and jealousies aroused, 
which threatened to make New York the temporary resi 
dence, until the buildings for the new seat of govern 
ment could be made ready for occupation. The following 
account, taken from Hildreth, History of the United States* 
shows clearly and briefly how this was made to help in 
solving the other question of the assumption of the debts 
of the States. 

" The States most interested in having the federal capital on 
the Potomac were Virginia and Maryland, and, as a very rapid 
growth seems to have been generally anticipated for the federal 
city, this interest was particularly strong in that part of these two 
States immediately bordering on the river. It occurred to Rob 
ert Morris and others, strong advocates for the assumption, that, 
if gratified as to the seat of the federal capital, some of the Vir 
ginia and Maryland members might be willing to yield the other 
point, and a change of two or three votes would be sufficient to 
change the majority in the House. Jefferson complains in his 
Ana that, having but lately arrived at New York he had, in fact, 
arrived and entered upon the duties of his office in the midst of 
the slavery debate he was * most ignorantly and innocently made 
to hold the candle to this intrigue, being duped into it, as he 
alleges, by the Secretary of the Treasury, and made a tool of for 
forwarding his schemes, not then sufficiently understood. Ham 
ilton, it seems, appealed to Jefferson for his aid and co-operation 
as a member of the cabinet in calming an excitement and bring 
ing about the settlement of a question which seemed to threaten 
the very existence of the federal government. Jefferson proposed 
to Hamilton to dine with him the next day, on which occasion he 

* Second Series, I., pp. 211, 212. 



1790] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 381 

would invite another friend or two, to see whether it was possi 
ble, by some mutual sacrifices of opinion, to form a compromise 
to save the Union. At this dinner party the subject was dis 
cussed, Jefferson, as he assures us, taking no part but an exhor- 
tatory one ; and finally it was agreed that, for the sake of the 
Union, White and Lee, two of the Virginia members, should 
change their votes on the question of assumption ; but by way of 
anodyne to the excitement which this change might produce, the 
seat of the federal government, after remaining for the next ten 
years at Philadelphia, was to be permanently fixed on the Potomac. 
From their influence with the Eastern and Northern members, 
Hamilton and Morris undertook to carry out that part of the 
bargain. 

" The bill in relation to the seat of government having, in 
accordance, it would seem, with this arrangement, been made to 
correspond to the agreement above recited, was passed by the 
Senate and sent to the House. But, as the secret of the bargain 
of which it formed a part had been communicated to only a few 
of the Northern members, just sufficient to secure its passage, it 
there encountered a very violent opposition. The yeas and nays 
were called upon it no less than thirteen times, and it finally 
passed only by the close vote of thirty two to twenty nine." 

The action of the Senate in bringing about this result is 
given in the memoranda kept by Mr. King here given, 
endorsed : " Memorandum addressed to Strong concerning 
the residence of Congress " : 

" Mr. Carroll * will propose Philadelphia and Potomack for the 
temporary and permanent Residence of Congress. It is not very 
probable that this arrangement will succeed, but to satisfy existing 
engagements between certain Gentlemen it may be necessary to 
try the Question. A motion to adjourn to Philadelphia will suc 
ceed the Defeat of the proposed measure ; and perhaps it may 
have been suggested that the assumption will depend on its suc 
cess : the Virginians may suppose a removal to Philadelphia will 
frustrate the assumption, while on equally fallacious grounds 

* In another paper R. K. says : " Mr. Carrol with Mr. Morris &amp; others." 






382 RUFUS KING. [1790 

some gentlemen may imagine it will favor the accomplishment of 
that Event. 

" The assumption of the State Debts being both politick and 
just, will take place from the weight of those considerations 
which urge its adoption. Every day shows the opposition to be 
weakened &amp; that the original objection to the principle has 
dwindled into a faint resistance of the manner in which it is pro 
posed to be established. 

" The question of Residence may, and perhaps ought to, be 
decided independent of the assumption : but if they must be 
connected, it may deserve examination, whether the assumption 
would not gain more friends by a decision in favor of the tempo 
rary residence at New York and the permanent at Baltimore, 
than by an immediate removal to Philadelphia. Pennsylvania 
might be displeased because this arrangement was preferred to a 
residence in their Capital ; but they would be as little justified in 
carrying their resentment to any improper length, as New York 
would be in another event, in suffering the disappointment of 
their wishes to disturb their Judgment. 

" Excluding the votes of Massachusetts, the two Houses would 
each be nearly divided on the question of Baltimore and New 
York ; the measure can be established, if the votes of Massachu 
setts are in its favor. A large majority in both houses would 
agree in it did not certain engagements between several of the 
States west of the Delaware prevent such agreement. 

"The Dilemma is New York &amp; Baltimore, or Philadelphia if 
one does not succeed, the other will. The Delegates of Massa 
chusetts may conceive it is best to take no part in this question ; 
but in this Dilemma not to agree to New York &amp; Baltimore, is 
embracing Philadelphia ; the idea, therefore, of taking no part, 
from the actual state of things, is taking an effectual part. 

" A removal to Philadelphia does not insure tranquillity on the 
question of permanent Residence the great anxiety entertained 
on that Subject may hereafter agitate the public Councils. Is it 
not best to decide the question ? Can there exist a probability of 
establishing the permanent location East of Baltimore ? if not, 
and the order of the government requires a decision, why refrain 
from making it ? 

" New York will ask nothing, which will promote her interest, 



I70o] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 383 

unless that of the United States is also promoted : but she must 
possess unusual apathy not to feel, and with pretty strong emo 
tions, that a measure which seems calculated to accomplish both, 
should be lost by the votes of those whose interest she anxiously 
desires to advance." 

" 8th June, go. Senate. 

" Mr. Lee moved to postpone the Bill introduced by Majr. 
Butler for the establishment of both permanent &amp; temporary 
residence, to take up a resolution first from the House yt. the 
next Session of Cong. shd. be in Philadelphia. A motion was 
made to postpone the whole subject till tomorrow. The Senate 
being equally divided (Mr. Johnson &amp; Mr. Few being both absent) 
the Vice President voted against ye postponement Mr. Johnson 
&amp; Mr. Few, being notified of the question, attended. Mr. John 
son came with his night cap and wrapped in many Garments, 
attended by Doctrs. Bard &amp; Romaine, and having a Cot with a 
matras in the antechamber to repose on : by general consent the 
resolution was taken up and negatived 13 to n. The report of 
the Committee was afterwards taken up, &amp; the first clause, which 
asserted the propriety of fixing the permanent Residence at this 
time, was negatived by the voice of the Vice President : the 
report being laid aside a motion was made to fill the blank in the 
Bill with Potomack as the permanent Residence. This was nega 
tived, as was also Baltimore and Washington A motion to post 
pone the bill a fortnight, as also another motion to postpone it in 
definitely, were negatived finally Congress adjourned. Previous 
to negativing the Resolution, Mr. Butler said to me that Mr. Schuy- 
ler &amp; myself must vote to fill the Blank in the Bill with Potomack, 
as they cd. not vote against the Resolution. I agreed so to vote, 
and finally voted accordingly." 

" 30. June, 1790. 

"The House some weeks since passed a Resolve to remove 
to Philadelphia at the expiration of the present Session. Be 
fore the Resolve came up in the Senate, Maj. Butler brought 
in a Bill for the establishment of both permanent &amp; temporary 
Residence. Morris &amp; others urged the Resolution when it came 



384 RUFUS KING. [1790 

up. His opponents moved to postpone it until Mr. Few &amp; Govr. 
Johnson, who were sick, would attend. Morris objected that the 
postponement wd. give time for the arrival of the Senators of R. 
Island. Finally Mr. Few &amp; Gov. Johnson being sent for attended : 
and the question of concurrence was negatived Thirteen to Eleven. 
A resolution was the next day past in the House for the adjourn 
ment of Congress at the close of the Session to Baltimore. This 
resolution was by majority of 13 to n of the Senate postponed a 
fortnight. During the interval a Bargain was made between 
Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia to remove at the 
end of the Session to Philadelphia, there to remain for ten years 
and afterwards to remove to, and permanently remain at the 
Potomack. 

" The negative of the Resolution for Phila., and the postpone 
ment of that for Baltimore were effected by the Senators of 
Georgia, So. &amp; No. Carolina, Mr. Paterson &amp; the Senators of N. 
Yk, Con. &amp; Mass. After the postponement of the Baltimore 
Resolution the Senators of R. Island took their seats, and the 
Bill brought forward by Mr. Butler was called up by Mr. Carroll. 
Mr. King proposed to Mr. Henry of Maryland to agree to a tem 
porary Residence at N. Yk and to remove from thence to Balti 
more for the permanent seat. Mr. H. told him the Proposition 
was too late &amp; that he cd. not vote for it. Mr. K. &amp; his friends 
proposed to the six Southern Senators &amp; to those of the States 
of Cont. &amp; Mass, to concur with those of N. Yk in fixing the 
temporary Residence in N. Yk 5 years and the permanent Resid. 
at Baltimore. The six Southern Senators assured Mr. K. they 
wd. concur, if the measure could be carried : Connecticut agreed 
to the measure ; R. Islan,d had no objection. But Massachusetts 
declined. The conduct of Mass, was explained by the Sec y of 
the Treasury, who called on Mr. K (and afterwards held the same 
or similar conversation with Mr. K. &amp; Col. Lawrance) and in 
formed him that, He had made up his mind thus : The funding 
System, including the assumption is the primary national object ; 
all subordinate points which oppose it must be sacrificed ; the 
project of Philadelphia &amp; Potomack is bad, but it will insure the 
funding System and the assumption : agreeing to remain in New 
Yk will defeat it : agreeing to N. Yk &amp; Baltimore will defeat it, 
so that in the present state of things nothing but Philad. or Phila 



1790] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 385 

&amp; Potomack will insure it. Massachusetts therefore will not agree 
to N. Yk &amp; Baltimore because her object is the assumption. Mr. 
K. remonstrated with Mr. Secy on this arrangement and in a 
subsequent conversation told him that great &amp; good schemes 
ought to succeed on yr. own merits and not by intrigue or the 
establishment of bad measures. Mr. K. added that he had been 
influenced by national views, that he wished national &amp; not State 
maxims to prevail ; but that if instead thereof, the reverse was 
to regulate the Government, he must submit and shd. pursue, as 
others found it their interest to do, State or local views. If a 
bargain existed between the Southern States, who wished for the 
seat of Government on the Potomack, Pennsylvania who wished 
Congress in Philada, and the Massachusetts people who were 
anxious for the assumption the measure wd. succeed, not be 
cause Virga. Mard. or the whole of Penn. desired the assump 
tion, nor because Mass, wished the temporary Residence in Phila, 
nor because Mass. Pen. or Del. wished the permanent Residence 
on the Potomack, but because the whole of them wd. not be 
gratified any other way. 

In a subsequent conversation Mr. Sec y informed Mr. K. that 
the measure or combination had been like to fail, from an appre 
hension (Mr. Morris apprehensive) that the assumption wd. not 
prevail.

BOSTON, Jany. 24, 1790. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

The consequences that will flow from an assumption of the 
State Debts by the United States, are not more desir d by the 
latter, than dreaded by this Commonwealth. The Anti-federalists 
think the advantages to be deriv d to the State, from a retention 
of the debt are so great and important, that they stand ready to 
accede to any terms which the creditors may propose. A Com 
mittee consisting of a majority of Antis, have now under consid 
eration a revision of the excise law and the propriety of mortgaging 
this revenue to the creditors. Hitherto this committee has been 
restrained by the crs. themselves, from reporting. I really fear 
whether 4 per cent will satisfy their demands and think it not 
improbable they may endeavor to make terms with the State. 

VOL. I. 25 



386 RUFUS KING. [1790 

If Congress cannot do better for them than pay an interest at 
that rate, the business must be manag d with great address to 
secure the cordial accession, on the part of the creditors of Mas 
sachusetts. Those, who heretofore have been oppos d to making 
a permanent provision for the support of public credit, are now 
very desirous of doing it, that thereby their own importance may 
be increas d, &amp; the national government embarrass d. The 
creditors are numerous and important &amp; are so attach d to prop 
erty that we have reason to fear they would change sides rather 
than lose any share of the blessing a less rate of interest than 
4 per cent you may rest assur d will never be acceded to by nine 
tenths of the creditors in Massachusetts. Consider the great 
holders in this town, Bowdoin, Phillips, Breck, Mason &amp; Moses 
Gill ; and think if they will accede to anything less than 4 per 
cent and if this pill must not be gilded to insure success, 
farewell. I am truly &amp; affectionately

BOSTON, May 6, 1790. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

I have been writing to our mutual friends Dalton &amp; Ames, on 
the subject of attempting a delay to fund that part of the debt 
called Continental, until the State debts shall be assum d. I sup- 



1790] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 387 

pose that these gentlemen think such measures advisable ; but I 
am well convinced that the attainment of their wishes, altho in 
my own opinion truly important, if not indispensably necessary to 
a good system of finance, will not in any degree compensate for a 
delay of funding that part of the debt which is more immediately 
obligatory on the nation. The people were disappointed &amp; de 
jected at the non-assumption ; but all orders of men, in the populous 
towns, are outrageous in their exclamations against Congress for de 
laying to fund the Continental debt. They say their money is taken 
from their pockets &amp; from trade in general to be locked up in the 
closets of the Treasury, or spent by the immediate officers of gov 
ernment. Unless something is speedily done by Congress to 
throw the money from the custom-houses among the people at 
large, I am really afraid that the collection of duties will be as un 
popular, as under the British government. The evils complained 
of are perhaps not real, and very probably not imputed to the 
right causes, but a general belief that delay to fund the debt takes 
so much money out of circulation &amp; that the doing this (funding 
the debt) would revive their trade &amp; business has the same effect 
as if absolutely true. I write these things to you, because I fear 
that some of our friends feel the object of assumption so impor 
tant to Massachusetts as to be in danger of hazarding too much for 
the prospect of attaining it. 

Yours affectionately, 

C. GORE.

The assumption has been again attempted &amp; lost. I sincerely 
hope no other delays attend funding the continental debt. Very 
dangerous consequences are to be apprehended to a future sys 
tem of funding. It is verily true that the doctrine of discrimina 
tion now finds advocates among many, who have heretofore been 
considered as rational men &amp; men of understanding. What 
should you think of Judge Dana, Genl. Hall &amp; some others, 
equally important, advocating such doctrines in the most public 
and unequivocal manner. These things are true, and it is like 
wise true, that a spirit of opposition to the revenue laws has been 
created and is increasing. People say, for what purpose do we 
pay our money into the collector s chest none of it returns ; &amp; 
what can oblige us to visit the Custom House on an arrival ? The 
most substantial men, in point of property and, hitherto, the firm 
est supporters of the present Constitution, in Salem, have pub 
licly express d such sentiments, if not the very words. 

These things, my dear friend, make me truly anxious that some 
men shou d be bound to this government by strong pecuniary ties, 
and which ties are not obvious to the public view. Suppose a 
possible event, the dissolution of the President, wou d not, unless 
some chain of more &amp; stronger links than now binds the Union 
shou d hold us together, the American people cease to exist as a 
nation and let me ask what other chain so binding as that of in 
volving the interests of the men of property in the prosperity of 

the Government. . . .

BOSTON, June 20, 1790. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

I do most sincerely hope that your exertions for the assump 
tion &amp; establishing the permanent residence of Congress may 
meet with success. So many unfortunate quarrels among the 
members of Congress about questions in which few citizens only 



1790] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 389 

are interested, to the neglect of those matters in which all are en 
gaged, have afforded grounds of complaint against the Govern 
ment, without raising any friends to advocate the measure of 
administration. Dalton s election I think probable. The can 
didates are numerous. Jarvis and his party have in vain endeav- 
or d to obtain a choice by joint ballot of the two branches in one 
room. Gorham is a candidate but he declares that he will not 
frustrate any measures, that may be thought conducive to his, 
D. s, success. I wish he wou d take an active part in Dalton s 
favor. This and Strong s influence by letters to his friends would 
insure him an handsome majority. The time is not yet assign d 
for the choice, but a fortnight will probably include the time. 
You may rest assured that no pains will be spared on my part to 
effect this measure ; it is one in the success of which I shou d 
greatly and sincerely rejoice. 

Affectionately yours, 

C. GORE.

MY DEAR SIR : 

My nephew has resided at Cambridge &amp; been a boarder in the 
College for the two last years. His quarter bills have amounted 
to eight pounds this includes boarding, tuition, sizings, &amp; pun 
ishments. I say eight pounds, tho seldom does the sum exceed 
*]. except the last year. His buttery bills amount in the whole 
for the time he has been at the University to ^"20. The expense 
of Cloathing I cannot tell with any degree of accuracy tho not 
more than for young men in the town. I have always allowed 
half a dollar a week for spending money : On particular occa 
sions he has had additional allowances. 

I believe the College is under good regulations, and its liberal 
ity is increasing. The advantages attending your brother s resi 
dence in your own family I shou d think wou d counterbalance 
many others which are unattainable in N. York. I do not know 
the situation of the College in your city. The immediate officers 



390 RUFUS KING. [1790 

of Harvard are well disposed to promote the Knowledge of their 
pupils they are men of science : and the funds of the University 
are increasing, which will enable them to enlarge the means of 
information. 

You will long before this have known the state of our election. 
Dalton was universally opposed in the house, merely because he 
was a Senator. The advocates for the other candidates warmly 
encouraged the prejudices against the present members by in 
veighing against large salaries, compensations &amp; the want of indus 
try in Congress. This unjustifiable conduct had great effect, &amp; 
clear d the way for other candidates of which there were many. 
Cabot will serve &amp; setting aside the mortification to an honorable 
man &amp; the fickleness displayed by the Government in abandon

good. I very much question if any of our delegation attempted 
by a correspondence with their friends, to promote Mr. D s 
re-election. . . .

BOSTON, July n, 1790. 

MY DEAR SIR : 

. . . The success of Philadelphia is truly mortifying to all 
who wish to see base means unsuccessful. I truly regret that 
those whose characters we thought correct shou d bend to such 
measures as are dishonorable for the purpose of gaining any 
object. Mr. Ames observes to me that he can very justly say 
that his hands are free from the guilt of bartering one thing for 
another. 

The appearances are against our national prosperity, and all 
real friends to our country have grown weary with disappoint 
ment : but nothing seems to have happen d more contrary to their 
expectations than the bare 4 per cent as proposed by the Senate. 
That a proposal so undisguised &amp; unjust shou d come from that 
branch of the Legislature was not within our expectation : the 
odds to Massachusetts in point of real property between this and 



1790] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 391 

the Secretary s report will be so great, that I think our members 
ought to hazard every thing rather than accede to such schemes.

MY DEAR SIR : 

The embarrassed situation of Congress and our public affairs is 
truly distressing to all those who love and respect the American 
name. We feel and fret at the delay of great business for such 
paltry objects as where the business of our country shall be done, 
and to me it is truly mortifying that Pennsylvania shou d be grati 
fied when her representatives have behaved so disgracefully. 

I sincerely hope our friend Ames has conducted to the satisfac 
tion of all honourable men. I feel no doubt of the purity of his 
intentions. . . . 

Very sincerely yours, 

C. GORE.

MY DEAR SIR : 

The people of this State own very large quantities of the debt 
of the U. S. and in case of a funding system on principles advan 
tageous to the creditors and honorable to the government wou d 
draw very largely from its revenue. When I reflect on this, 
which is known to and acknowledg d by all our delegates, I am 
really at a loss to conjecture the motives, which have influenc d 
the delegates from Massachusetts in acceding to a reduction of 
the interest. 

I have known that a majority of them have advocated a less 
rate of interest than the proposal of the Secretary. The wisest 
and best men in this quarter of the country have very explicitly 
declared to these gentlemen their abhorrence of such reduction, 
as unjust &amp; dishonorable. . . . 

Affectionately your friend 

C. GORE. 



TRISTRAM DALTON TO R. KING. 

NEWBURYPORT, Septr. 25th, 1790. 
MY DEAR FRIEND : 

I was this week informed in Boston that Mr. Osgood, not in 
clining to remove to Philadelphia, had determined to resign the 
office of Postmaster General, and that Dane was looking after it. 
Should Mr. Osgood give up his place, it appears to me, on a 
sudden reflection, worthy my notice and that the duties of it 
would be as agreeable to my disposition as any I could obtain. 
The salary, it s true, is moderate at 1600 dollars, but it will not 
lessen ; and the advantages Mr. Deblois might exp., by my being 
so near him, might counterbalance it. 

The office not having been created, nor the emoluments in 
creased since my Election I can apprehend no difficulty on 
account of the last clause of the 6th Sectn. in ist Article of the 
Constitution. On this point, however, I will rely upon your better 
judgment. If there can be no objection on this head it would be 



1790] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 393 

fortunate, as almost every other office has been created since I 
have acted as a Senator. If this desired event should take place, 
at the Commencement of the Session, a resignation of my Seat 
would on no account be disagreeable to me the new elected 
Member being, without a doubt, ready to attend, if the Executive 
shd. think proper to appoint him. . . . 

I will thank you for your free advice and opinion, as to the 
importance &amp; suitableness of the plan for me ; the constitutional 
ity of my being appointed. . . . 

Would our friend Hamilton favor my wishes ? You can judge 
I could fill the remainder of the sheet with the most sincere 
regards of my whole family to every branch of yours, their affec 
tions are warm and substantial. 

The subject matter of this letter will remain solely in your &amp; 
Mr. Lear s bosom. 

Your real friend, 

TRISTRAM DALTON. 



C. GORE TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, October 23, 1790. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

. . Ames election in Boston was the highest possible evi 
dence that cou d be produc d in favor of the Government. 
Austin and his friends, with S. Adams, Hancock &amp; Jarvis were 
open, warm, and assiduous in favor of their candidate. Their 
arguments were artfully addressed to the most unguarded parts of 
the mind of a Boston Patriot. Our friend, T. D (alton) &amp; his 
father were uncommonly industrious in the use of all their 
influence to attain votes for the little Judge. If reports are true 
men were hir d &amp; in daily pay of the former to create a favorable 
influence in the country, &amp; personal solicitations were used by 
both. Indeed the most ridiculous and disgraceful stories are told 
of Thomas ; and the event shewed, in a light truly mortifying, the 
little influence &amp; small effects of dishonorable means. Austin 
boasts that he had more votes than Dawes, &amp; the latter confesses 
himself mortified that he was less successful than the former. 
The election was the most honorable testimony to Mr. Ames of 



394 RUFUS KING. [1790 

the approbation of his fellow citizens. Governor Bowdoin will 
die in a short time : his physicians think that he cannot recover. 
Govr. Hancock is a little revived, but he has all the marks of 
approaching dissolution, his face bloated, his legs swelled &amp;c. &amp;c. 
J. Coffin Jones is gone to R. Island to be married to a Miss 
Champney of 19 yrs. John Codman is soon to be married to 
Miss Caty Amory. Thus you see, my friend, our patriots are 
dying &amp; our widowers are marrying young girls to supply the 
vacancies and our architects are raising monuments one on 
Beacon Hill to commemorate all the important acts of the Amer 
ican Revolution at first eminent Patriots are thus to be handed 
down but on experiment, it was too hazardous to state their 
several ranks and a doubt was entertained, if the size of the 
monument would admit of half their names. Farewell. 
I am very affectionately your friend, 

C. GORE. 



CHAPTER XXII. 

Bank of the United States chartered The Admission of Kentucky and Ver 
mont as States Whist-Club Invitation Branches of U. S. Bank in Bos 
ton and in New York Letters from Mr. Gore about the Objections in 
Boston to the Establishment of one there These gradually removed 
The Branch there in successful Operation. 

A part of the plan for establishing the public credit was 
the incorporation of a National Bank as the fiscal agent of 
the government. The necessity for an institution of that 
kind had been felt in managing the business of the Treasury, 
as a consequence of the condition of the currency. This 
consisted at the time of certificates which had been issued 
by the Continental Congress in payment of debts, or by dif 
ferent States for similar purposes, and as they had no other 
basis than the credit of the authorities that issued them, 
they had greatly depreciated in value, and afforded a very 
uncertain medium of circulation. This caused the greatest 
confusion in the monetary affairs of the country, and some 
remedy was required, which seemed to offer itself in the 
establishment of a national institution, which, while con 
tributing to afford facilities for commercial purposes, might 
aid the government in dealing with its creditors, and in 
making loans to it for temporary use. 

The plan had already been used by the charter, under the 
Continental Congress, of the Bank of North America in 
Philadelphia, through which Robert Morris had been able 
to assist the government during his administration of the 
Continental Treasury; Banks were also in existence in Bos 
ton and in New York which had materially helped, by their 

395 



396 RUFUS KING. [i79i- 

loans, the mercantile communities in those cities ; and as it 
was believed that, as they were useful in their limited range, 
an institution whose field was the United States would be 
most beneficial in making an uniform currency based upon 
specie. As yet there was no specie coinage in the United 
States, except of some copper cents, which had been made 
for the government, for there was no mint.* Foreign coins 
were received and paid out at a fixed value. 

Under these circumstances, Hamilton had recommended 
the formation of a national financial institution, and sup 
ported his suggestion by such clear and cogent reasons, that 
a committee of the Senate reported a bill to establish a 
National Bank which embodied his suggestions, and which 
was passed, after some slight amendments, " without a divi 
sion." In the House it met with opposition, the Eastern 
and Northern members advocating it, while the Southern 
members, chiefly from Virginia, objected to it for various 
reasons, Mr. Madison s being its unconstitutionality. f It 
passed, however, by nearly two to one 39 to 20 and the 
President, after careful consideration, signed it. \ 

Without entering upon a detail of its charter, it may be 
mentioned that the capital was ten millions of dollars, eight 
millions of which might be subscribed for by individuals, 
paying one fourth in gold or silver, and three fourths in the 
stock or loans of the United States, while the government 
was to pay in two millions in cash out of the money bor 
rowed to pay its debts, but with the privilege of loans from 
it to the amount of its subscription, reimbursable in ten 
annual payments. 

The shares of the bank were subscribed for within twenty- 

* A bill for the establishment of a mint became a law in April, 1792. 

f When the second Bank of the U. S. was chartered, in 1816, Mr. Madison, 
then President, signed the bill. 

\ Mr. Jefferson, Secretary of State, and Mr. E. Randolph, Attorney-General, 
gave their opinions against the constitutionality of a National Bank. But 
Hamilton s able exposition of the whole question, in answer to the President s 
request, settled his opinion and he signed the bill. 



1792] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 397 

four hours, and although in various quarters some opposition 
had been met with, chiefly because it was supposed that it 
would interfere disadvantageously with the then existing 
banks in other places (for Philadelphia was to be the seat of 
it, and it had power to establish branches elsewhere), the 
advantages accruing from it were soon felt in a sounder 
business condition, in the accommodation received by the 
government in its financial dealings, and in its restraining 
power over the issues of other banks. 

As the business of the country increased, branches were 
placed in other cities ; new local banks sprang up also ; but 
all worked harmoniously together, though the influence of 
the large capital of the National Bank checked their exten 
sion and regulated their operations. 

Of the twenty-five directors chosen to manage its affairs, 
Mr. King was one, and held the office for a few years, leav 
ing the direction, as will be seen, when he was called upon 
as Senator to vote upon certain proposed amendments to 
the charter. 

In his address to the third session of the first Congress, 
the President stated that he had received communications 
relative to the desire of the District of Kentucky to become 
a member of the Union, having complied with the require 
ments of the State of Virginia, and a few days after sent to 
the Senate the documents concerning this application. 
These were referred to a committee, which reported favor 
ably, and brought in a bill, constituting the District of Ken 
tucky a State of the Union, which was adopted without a 
division, and became a law by a similar action of the House 
of Representatives and the signature of the President, on 
January 28, 1791. 

Not long after this the President sent a message to Con 
gress, informing it that the Governor of Vermont had sent 
to him documents which conveyed the consent of the Legis 
latures of New York and Vermont to the admission of the 
latter as a State of the Union, and asking for the consent of 



398 RUFUS KING. 



Congress. This was referred to a committee, of which Mr. 
King was chairman, who reported the next day from the 
committee a bill for the admission of the State of Vermont 
into the Union, which was passed by the Senate on the next 
day, February I2th, without a division, and on the T4th by 
the House of Representatives. 

That Mr. King was an active and influential member dur 
ing this Congress is evident from the records of the Senate, 
where his name appears either as chairman or member of 
many of the important committees especially those rela 
ting to the commercial and financial regulations which were 
fixed at this time, his vote being always in favor of general 
policy suggested and embodied in the reports of the Secre 
tary of the Treasury, with whom his intercourse was of the 
closest character, whose ability he recognized, and in whom 
he had the highest confidence for integrity and patriotism.

MY DEAR SIR : 

. . . My brother Payne will deliver this, His journey to 
New York &amp; Philadelphia is intended to enlarge his acquaintance 
with the commercial characters of those cities. You know his 
worth &amp; I need not say that you will oblige me by promoting his 
views. The most respectable gentlemen of this place have re 
quested him to subscribe for them to the National Bank. You 
may therefore know from him the probable influence of Massa 
chusetts in this corporation. Indeed, the subscribers here are 
generally of opinion that unless there is sufficient weight east 
ward of Philadelphia to balance the influence of that city, they 
had better not be concerned in the Stock. Our people, with very 
few exceptions, will rejoice to co-operate with the citizens of New 
York in any arrangement which shall have for its object such a 
state of the Bank. If on conversing with Payne you shall be of 
opinion that to effect this purpose it is necessary our citizens 
shou d be more deeply interested &amp; will communicate the same, 
I will endeavor that the subscriptions be encreas d. 

The Massachusetts House of representatives has appointed the 
afternoon to determine whether or not this State shall subscribe 
to the Bank. Jarvis and others, who carefully guard our liber 
ties, oppose the measure because they say, in an opposition to the 
national government, which may be necessary to the securing our 
property, independence &amp; Sovereignty, such a connection might 
in a degree allay the fervor of their zeal. The fate of the motion 
is problematical. . . .

certainly some ill sides. There have also been faults in the de 
tail, which are not favourable to complete satisfaction. But what 
shall we do ? T is the lot of everything human to mingle a por 
tion of ill with good. 

The President as you will have seen has returned.* His jour 
ney has done good as regards his own impressions. He is per 
suaded that the dispositions of the Southern people are good ; 
and jthat certain pictures which have been drawn have been 
strongly colored by the imaginations of the Drawers. 

We have just heard from the Westward ; but of no event of 
importance. Things are said to have been in good preparation ; 
the people of Kentucky are wonderfully pleased with the Govern 
ment, and Scot with a Corps of ardent Volunteers, on their route

The post of last evening bro t news that the Bank of New York

banks, will fail if the intentions of New York Bank should 
be successful, the Mass, bank will probably follow the example, 
.and it is not improbable that a connection will, in the ensuing 
winter, be proposed by the Legislature to take place between the 
Government of Mass, and the State Bank. The State Bank of 
Mass, is well disposed to receive its death warrant at the present 
time. The stockholders are very largely interested in the 
National Bank &amp; wou d willingly promote the latter to the 
destruction of the former. But this I fear will not long continue 
their disposition. Some who were shut out from the national 
bank will be very solicitous of reaping the profits heretofore 
experienc d from the State Bnk. The State Legislatures are all 
organiz d bodies &amp; disciplin d to counteract the operations of the 
federal government it is now a war of words only we may have 
to deprecate a different kind of warfare. We well know the State 
Legislatures are liberally dispos d to discern &amp; oppose the power 
&amp; influence of the nation ; but their meanness &amp; parsimony in 
terfere with their views &amp; besides they are without a military 
check. Give them a State Bank to recur to and this great evil 
will be remov d. The State Bank will continue for a long time 
to afford great profits to the proprietors of their stock. The 
State Legislatures will be proud of imitating the conduct of 
Congress in having a bank under their patronage &amp; having a con 
tinuance of this badge of Sovereignty, the emission of money, &amp; 
the interest of the Commonwealth &amp; the Bank will be made to 
combine, that the pride and avarice of these two corporations 
may be gratified. 

I have hastily thrown my thoughts on this subject on paper. I 
wish you to examine them, &amp; whether this continuance of the 
State banks will not be injurious to the growth of national 
politics. The few hints will lead to a course of reflections in 
your own mind and if the event shall be a conviction that there 
is no danger to be apprehended, I shall be happy to learn that 
my fears are groundless ; but I think the present the most favor 
able time for the dissolution of the State banks, &amp; I fear that 
politics &amp; interest will unite to support and prolong their existence. 

Yours,

Your letter of Monday evening * has a good deal tranquillized 
me. I am glad to learn that the Mischiefs from the over rise of 
Script are not likely to be very extensive. 

I observe what you say respecting the quotation of my opinion. 
I was not unaware of the delicacy of giving any and was suf 
ficiently reserved till I perceived the extreme to which Bank 
Script and with it other stock was tending. But when I saw this 
I thought it advisable to speak out. For a bubble connected 
with my operations is of all the enemies I have to fear, in my 
judgment, the most formidable and not only not to promote, but 
as far as depends on me, to counteract delusions, appears to me 
to be the only secure foundation on which to stand. I thought it 
therefore expedient to risk something in contributing to dissolve 
the chain. 

But I find that I have been misquoted. Speaking of sales on 
time at twenty-four shillings for 6 p. ct. &amp;c, I think it probable I 
may have intimated an opinion that they went faster than could 
be supported. But it is untrue that I have given as a Standard 
prices below those of the market as mentioned by you. On the 
contrary, my Standard on pretty mature reflection has been and is 
nearly as follows, 

For Bank Script . 195 
6 per Cents . . . 22 / 

3 per cents ... 12 / 

Deferred now . . . i2/ 8 

I proceed on the idea of 5 pr. Ct. interest taking at the same 
time into calculation the partial redeemability of the 6 p. C. 

I give you my Standard that you may be able if necessary to 
contradict insinuations of an estimation on my part short of that 
Standard for the purpose of depressing the funds.

The directors of the National Bank, will soon elect those who

to Philadelphia, and, we are told, for the express purpose of 
attaining the cashiership for Mr. Jackson. Shou d he be gratified, 
many large &amp; influential stockholders will be disappointed by the 
exclusion of Dalton. The prejudices of the good judge may lead 
him to oppose Jonathan Mason junr. &amp; favor the appointment of 
his friend S. Higginson ; tho the latter is not a stockholder. You 
may be assur d that the popularity of the bank will not be pro 
moted, nor its business increased by an affront to the first or a 
compliment to the last mention d gentleman. Joseph Russell

force to establish a line of posts from the Ohio River to the head waters of the 
Maumee, at which a strong fortification was to be built, extensive enough to 
hold a large garrison to protect the country and overawe the Indians. After a 
laborious march through a wilderness, the troops under him became thoroughly 
disorganized before they reached their destination, and being taken by surprise 
by the Indians, St. Clair being sick, they were utterly routed, and fled, leaving 
everything behind them, though a small body of regular troops endeavored to 
check the disaster. The entire destruction of the force was due to the failure 
of the Indians to follow them. ED.

Judge Lowell &amp; Mr. Sears. Some objected to this &amp; observed 
that the branch president s name was necessary to a completion of 
the bills ; and all appear d to feel the propriety of an early choice. 
On enquiry I found that the gentleman who desir d postpone

wou d be elected president ; who, it was said, at the request of Mr. 
Hamilton withdrew himself from being a candidate for the 
national bank, that he might be an active member in the office of 
discount and deposit, &amp; take due care of the interests of the na

count did not exceed thirty five thousand. It is not probable a 
large sum will be discounted for some weeks to come ; tho many 
think the sum too small &amp; that more might be safely issued. 
There is no question of the solidity of those who apply for credit 
and that more than the amount of our capital might be dis 
counted every week on good names ; but the present ought to be 
an hour of caution, &amp; the possible error of extreme prudence is

of a liberal spirit and a wish to gratify.

I entertain no doubt but the bank of the U. S. will eventually 
secure all the good custom. Its advantages are so many, &amp; so 
exclusively belonging to that corporation that other institutions 
of the like kind cannot do business to a great profit, if the 
national Bank be sufficient for the property and commerce of 
America. In my mind it is desirable that no other institutions, 
under State patronage, shoud exist that they shou d gradually 
decline in their profits and find their advantages in surrendering 
their corporate rights. But be assur d, my friend, that while I 
feel this as a just sentiment, no man wou d more deprecate a dis 
solution, occasion d by their loss of credit, than myself. The 
evils consequent on such an event are too extensive &amp; important 
to my view to be contemplated without real distress. If I did 
not believe that the Bank of the U. S. cou d, with safety, give a 
sufficient medium for all the fair concerns of the country and 
that within a few years, we shou d see the national faith the only 
representation of property, I earnestly wish for a coalition of 
banks in this sentiment I may err; but if in error I can truly 
say it is caused by a love of national &amp; a dread of State politics 
and I shall be obliged to any friend to be convinc d of my 
error &amp; I assure you that I will chearfully avow a different 
opinion, when convinced of the propriety. 

Very affectionately I am my dear friend yours,

CHAPTER XXIII. 

Governor s Election in New York, 1792 Jay and Clinton Candidates Returns 
of Election from Otsego and Tioga Counties rejected by the Canvassers 
Clinton declared elected Troup, King and Hamilton upon the Law and 
political Aspect of the Question Burr in opposition. 

An election of Governor in the State of New York took 
place in 1792, the candidates being Governor Clinton and 
John Jay, the latter having been nominated by " those who 
believed that the interests of the State were endangered by 
the policy and conduct of Governor Clinton/ and that the 
general government should be sustained in its endeavour to 
carry out the principles of the constitution. After the elec 
tion and under the existing law, it was the duty of the 
sheriffs of the different counties, to send the ballots to a 
board of canvassers, appointed by the Legislature of the 
State, who were to examine and count them and declare the 
result. A majority of all the votes cast was returned for 
Mr. Jay ; but the board of canvassers, a majority of whom 
were friends of Mr. Clinton, made a ground of objection to 
the votes of Otsego and Tioga counties, which, if sustained, 
would cause them to be rejected. The case in reference to 
Otsego county is related clearly in a letter of Robert 
Troup to John Jay, May 20, 1792.* 

"In February 1791 A. B. was appointed Sheriff of that county 
to hold his office for one year. A short time before the expira 
tion of his year he wrote to the Council of appointment declining 
a reappointment. About thirty days after the end of his year the 
Council appoint C. D. Sheriff of the County, but the commission

408 



1792] RUFUS KING. 409 

is never delivered to him nor does he in any one instance take 
upon himself the execution of the office. It is said, and I believe 
with truth, that the reason why C. D. did not take upon himself 
the office is that he could not obtain the security required by law. 
In this state of things the old Sheriff continued to act as Sheriff, 
and after the election he received the ballots from the different 
towns, put them into a box as the law directs, and sent them by a 
deputy to the Secretary s office. The votes of one of the towns 
instead of being put into the box were left out of it and sent down 
under a paper cover. The law requires that the votes of every 
town shall be put into the box. 

" Upon this state of facts the Livingstons contend that A. B. 
was not Sheriff at the time of putting the ballots into the box or 
afterwards, and consequently that he had no right to send the box 
to the Secretary s office. They also contend that the votes of one 
town being left out of the b.ox, all the other votes of the County 
must be lost. After there had been a considerable stir in town 
about the Otsego votes, Ned. Livingston, to my very great sur 
prise, waited upon me with a written case in substance as above, 
and asked me if I had any objections to giving an opinion upon 
it. At first I was struck with the indelicacy of the application, 
and of my giving an opinion upon a subject in which my feelings 
were so much concerned. I replied however that he should have 
my opinion, and my reason for making this reply was a conviction 
that their views were corrupt and therefore that it would be right 
in me to counteract them if I could possibly do it. Before Ned 
left me he had the modesty in almost plain terms to tell me that 
I should not meet with any difficulty, he was persuaded, in decid 
ing against the votes, upon both the points raised to me. The 
moment Ned went away I got down and examined the questions 
with the closest attention, and soon satisfied myself from the 
books that A. B. was Sheriff at the time of putting the ballots into 
the box and afterwards, and that he was legally entitled to send 
the box to the Secretary s office.* As to the other question, it 
appeared too absurd to admit of reflection. 

* Life of John Jay, by Wm. Jay. " So little had the propriety of sheriffs, 
in such cases, continuing to act after the expiration of their commissions, been 
questioned, that on an investigation it was found that, since the organization of 



410 RUFUS KING. [1792 



" I was pressed for ray opinion the next morning and I gave it 
to Ned plumply against him upon both points. The opinion 
threw the party into consternation. A Cabinet Council of the 
Governor, the Chancellor, Ned, Brockholst, &amp;c. was immediately 
called. Soon afterwards Brockholst went about like a madman 
vociferating against the legality of the return of the Otsego votes 
and roundly asserting that there was not a Lawyer out of this 
State that would give an opinion that the votes were legally 
returned. . 

" . . . Since my opinion has been a subject of conversation, 
I got King &amp; Benson to come and spend an evening with me that 
we might examine the case. We accordingly examined the law 
together, and they are both clearly with me. So is Mr. Jones, 
Mr. Harrison and Mr. Hoffman. . . . Out of the 12 canvassers 
we have but three friends . . . and the -leaders of the opposite 
canvassers are prepared for anything." 

In a subsequent letter, Mr. Troup says, June loth* : 

" Some days ago the Canvassers referred the question respect 
ing the Otsego votes and some question respecting those of Clin 
ton &amp; Tioga Counties to Burr and King (U. S. Senators) for their 
opinions. This reference was understood by us all as intended 
to cover their villainy in rejecting the votes of Otsego. They 
knew Burr to be decidedly with them, and that would give them 
an opinion to justify their views. Burr and King were conferring 
together for near two days with a view to fairness (?) as Burr 
affected to wish. 

" The quibbles and chicanery he made use of are characteristic 
of the man. They finally departed, and have given opinions 
directly opposite to each other. King s is bottomed upon sound 
legal and political principles ; Burr s is a most pitiful one and will 
damn his reputation as a Lawyer." 

Mrs. Jay writes, June 1 1, 1792 f : 

the government, no less than 70 instances had occurred of sheriffs thus holding 
over, and in one instance a sheriff thus circumstanced had been called in the 
discharge of his office to execute a criminal." i., 288. 

* Jay s Correspondence, iii., p. 427. 

\ Ibid., p. 432. 



1792] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 411 

" Well, my dear Mr. Jay, the Canvassers have taken upon them 
to give the people a Governor of their election, not the one the 
people preferred. . . . People are running in continually to 
vent their vexation. Poor Jacob Morris looks quite disconsolate. 
King says he thinks Clinton as lawfully Governor of Connecticut 
as of New York, but he knows no redress." 

Mr. King s opinion to the Canvassers was in these words : 

" Otsego. It may be inferred, from the constitution and laws 
of the State, that the office of Sheriff is held during the pleasure 
of the Council of Appointment, subject to the limitation contained 
in the 26th section of the constitution. The sheriff may therefore 
hold his office for four years, unless within that period a successor 
shall have been appointed, and shall have entered upon the ex 
ecution of the office. The term of four years from the appoint 
ment of R. R. Smith not having expired, and B. Gilbert not 
having entered upon the execution of the office before the receipt 
and delivery of the votes by R. R. Smith to his deputy, I am of 
opinion that R. R. Smith was the lawful sheriff of Otsego. 

"This opinion is strengthened by what is understood to be the 
practice, namely, that the office of sheriff is frequently held for 
more than, a year under one appointment. 

" R. R. Smith s giving notice to the Council of Appointment of 
his disinclination to be reappointed, or his acting as supervisor, 
cannot in my opinion, be deemed a resignation or surrender of 
his office. 

" Should doubts, however, be entertained whether R. R. Smith 
was lawfully Sheriff when he received and delivered the votes to 
his deputy, the case contains facts which in another view of the 
subject are important. It appears that R. R. Smith was appointed 
sheriff of Otsego on the iyth of February, 1791, and afterwards 
entered upon the execution of his office ; that no other person 
was in the execution of, or claimed the office after the date of his 
appointment, and before the time when he received and delivered 
the votes of the county to his deputy ; that during that interval 
R. R. Smith was sheriff, or the county was without a sheriff ; that 
R. R. Smith, during the election, and when he received and 
delivered the votes to his deputy, continued in the actual exercise 



412 RUFUS KING. [1792 

of the shrievalty, and that under the colour of a regular appoint 
ment. From this statement it may be inferred, that if R. R. 
Smith, when he received and delivered the votes to his deputy, 
was not de jure, he was de facto sheriff of Otsego. 

"Though all the acts of an officer de facto may not be valid, 
and such of them as are merely voluntary and exclusively bene 
ficial to himself are void ; yet such acts as tend to public utility, 
and such as he would be compellable to perform, such as are 
essential to preserve the rights of third persons, and without which 
they might be lost or destroyed, when done by an officer de facto, 
are valid. 

" I am therefore of the opinion, that admitting R. R. Smith when 
he received and delivered the votes to his deputy, was not dejure 
sheriff, yet he was de facto sheriff ; and that his receiving and 
delivering the votes being acts done under colour of authority, 
tending to public utility, and necessary to the carrying into effect 
the rights of suffrage of the citizens of that county, they are and 
ought to be deemed valid ; and consequently the votes of that 
county may lawfully be canvassed." 

The remaining part of this opinion relates to the votes of 
Clinton and Tioga counties, the counting of which was 
objected to on grounds in which Messrs. Burr and King 
virtually agreed, though in reference to the latter, whether 
a deputy of the sheriff may appoint a deputy to perform 
his duties, while admitting that the right is questionable, 
Mr. King says : " The election law is intended to render 
effectual the constitutional right of suffrage ; it should there 
fore be construed liberally, and the means should be in 
subordination to the end." 

Mr. Burr s opinion is as follows in reference to Otsego 
County.* 

" Otsego. The duration of the office of sheriff in England 

having been limited by statute to one year, great inconveniences 

were experienced, as well by suitors as by the public. To remove 

which it was thought necessary to pass an act of Parliament. The 

* Davis s Memoirs of A. Burr, 1836, i., p. 339. 



1792] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 413 

statute of 12 Ed. iv., ch. i, recites at large these inconveniences, 
and authorizes the sheriff to execute writs in the term of St. 
Michael, before the delivery of a writ of discharge, notwithstand 
ing the expiration of the year. The authority given by this 
statute being to execute only certain specified duties, the remedy 
was not complete and another statute * was soon after passed, 
permitting sheriffs to do every act pertaining to the office, during 
the term of St. Michael and St. Hilary, after the expiration of the 
year, if not sooner discharged. The practice in England appears 
to have been conformable to those statutes, though the king did 
pretend to dispense with them by force of the royal prerogative. 
None of the statutes of England or Great Britain con 
tinued to be the laws of this State after the first of May, 1778. So 
that at present there remains no pretence for adopting any other 
than the obvious meaning of the constitution, which limits the 
duration of the office to one year, beyond which the authority to 
hold cannot be derived from the constitution, the appointment, or 
the commission. If inconveniences arise, remedies can be provided 
by laws only, as has in similar cases been done in England, de 
ciding on legal principles ; therefore, the appointment and com 
mission, and with them, the authority of Mr. Smith must be 
deemed to have expired on the iSth of February. 

" Yet there are instances of offices being exercised by persons 
holding under an authority apparently good, but which, on strict 
legal examination, proves defective ; whose acts, nevertheless, are, 
with some limitations, considered as valid. This authority is called 
colourable, and the officer in such cases is said to be an officer de 
facto ; which intends an intermediate state between an exercise 
strictly lawful and one without such colour of right. Mr. Smith 
does not appear to me to have holden the office of sheriff on the 
3d of May under such colour or pretence of right. The term of 
his office had expired, and he had formally expressed his deter 
mination not to accept a reappointment ; after the expiration of 
the year he accepted, and even two days before the receipt of the 
ballots, openly exercised an office incompatible with that of 
sheriff ; and it is to be inferred, from the tenour of the affidavit, 
that he then knew of the appointment of Mr. Gilbert. Mr. Gil- 

* 2, Hawks, 5, 57, Irish Oct. Edit., 2 Mod. 



414 RUFUS KING. [1792 

bert was qualified in season to have discharged the duty, and, for 
aught that is shown, his attendance, if really desired, might have 
been procured still earlier. 

" Upon all the circumstances of this case, I am of opinion : 

" ist. That Mr. Smith was not the Sheriff of Otsego when he 
received and forwarded the ballots. 

" 2d. That the ballots delivered by the deputy of Mr. Smith 
cannot legally be counted. 

k The direction of the law is positive, that the sheriff shall put 
all the enclosures into one box. How far his inattention or mis 
conduct in this particular shall be deemed to vitiate the ballots of 
a county, appears to be left to the judgment of the Canvassers. 
Were the ballots of this county subject to no other exception than 
that stated in the third and fourth questions, I should incline to 
think it one of those cases in which the discretion of the can 
vassers might be safely exercised, and that the ballots contained 
in the boxes might be legally canvassed ; those in the separate 
package do not appear to be subject to such discretionary power ; 
the law does not permit them to be estimated. But the extent to 
which this power might be exercised in cases similar in kind, but 
varying in degree, cannot be precisely defined. Instances may 
doubtless be supposed, in which sound discretion would require 
the whole should be rejected." 

The close of the opinion relates to the cases of Clinton 
and Tioga counties. 

In a letter to Mr. De Lamater (a Federalist), June 15, 
1792,* Mr. Burr says: 

". . . Some questions having arisen among the canvassers 
respecting the returns from Clinton, Otsego and Tioga, they re 
quested the advice of Mr. King and myself. We conferred, and, 
unfortunately differed ; particularly as to the questions upon the 
Otsego return. I therefore proposed that we should decline giving 
any opinion, being for my own part averse to interfere in the 
business. Mr. King, however, determined to give his separate 
opinion, from what motives you may judge. This laid me under 
* Memoirs of Aaron Burr, Davis, i., 358. 



1792] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 415 

the necessity of giving mine also, which I did. ... I earnestly 
wished and sought to be relieved from the necessity of giving my 
opinion, particularly from a knowledge that it would be disagree 
able to you and a few others whom I respect and wish always to 
gratify. But the conduct of Mr. King left me no alternative. I 
was obliged to give an opinion, and I have not yet learned to give 
any other than that which my judgment directs. It would, indeed, 
be the extreme of weakness in me to expect friendship from Mr. 
Clinton.* I have too many reasons to believe that he regards me 
with jealousy and malevolence. Still, this alone ought not to 
have induced me to refuse my advice to the canvassers. Some 
pretend, indeed, but none can believe, that I am prejudiced in 
his favour." 

Four of the canvassers protested in vain against the action 
of the majority, and on January 18, 1793, the House of 
Assembly, by a vote of thirty-five to twenty-two, decided 
that "it did not appear to that House that the majority of 
the Canvassers had been guilty of any mal or corrupt con 
duct in the execution of the trust reposed in them by law ; 
and that as the determination of all questions relating to the 
canvass and estimate of the votes was committed to them, 
it is the sense of this House that the Legislature cannot 
annul or make void any of the determinations of the said 
committee." 

It may well be supposed that there was a very strong feel 
ing of dissatisfaction on the part of the friends of Mr. Jay, 
with the decision of the canvassers, and even a disposition 
to resist by some positive action the carrying it out. The 
following letters from Mr. Hamilton to Mr. King will show 
the state of public feeling, which was, however, finally 
quieted down by the wiser counsels of the leading friends 
of Mr. Jay and by his own ready and entire acquiescence in 
the result, unfair and unjust as it was.

Council of Appointment as Judge of the Supreme Court of the State, which 
nomination was immediately confirmed. Memoirs of Aaron Burr, i., 358.

A. HAMILTON TO R. KING. 

PHILADELPHIA, June 28, 1792. 
MY DEAR KING : 

I have not, as you well may imagine, been inattentive to your 
political squabble. I believe you are right (though I have not ac 
curately examined) but I am not without apprehension that a fer 
ment may be raised which may not be allayed when you wish it. 
T is not to be forgotten that the opposers of Clinton are the real 
friends to order and good Government, and that it will ill become 
them to give an example to the contrary. 

Some folks are talking of Conventions and the Bayonet. But 
the case will justify neither a resort to such principles nor to 
violence. Some Amendments of your election law and possibly 
the impeachment of some of the canvassers who have given proof 
of premeditated partiality will be very well : and it will answer 
good purposes to keep alive within proper bounds the public in 
dignation. But beware of extremes ! 

There appear to be no definite declared objects of the move 
ments on foot which renders them the mere ticklish. What can 
you do ? What do you expect to effect ? 

Yrs. affectly., 

A. HAMILTON.

lowing : 

" I have had no agency in promoting the measures adopted re 
specting the decision of the Canvassers. I have however felt the 
utmost indignation."

"July 25, 1792. 

" MY DEAR SIR : 

" I received lately a letter from you, in which you expressed 
sentiments according with my own, on the present complexion of 
your party politics, as, if a letter of mine to you did not miscarry, 
you will have seen. I wished that Clinton and his party should 
be placed in a just light before the people, and that a spirit of

dissatisfaction, within proper bounds, should be kept alive ; and 
this for national purposes, as well as from a detestation of their 
principles and conduct. 

" But a resort to first principles, in any shape, is decidedly 
against my judgment. I don t think the occasion will, in any 
sense, warrant it. It is not for the friends of good government 
to employ extraordinary expedients, which ought only to be re 
sorted to in cases of great magnitude and urgent necessity. I reject 
as well the idea of a convention as of force. 

" To rejudge the decision of the canvassers by a convention, 
has to me too much the appearance of reversing the sentence of 
a court by a legislative decree. The canvassers had a final au 
thority in all the forms of the Constitution and laws. A question 
arose in the execution of their office, not absolutely free from 
difficulty, which they have decided (I am persuaded wrongly) but 
within the power vested in them. I do not feel it right or ex 
pedient to attempt to reverse the decision, by any means not 
known to the Constitution or laws. The precedent may suit us 
to-day ; to-morrow we may see its abuse. . . ." * 



A. HAMILTON TO R. KING.

The commercial relations between the United States and 
the European countries were very unsettled, while the im 
portance of the nation was increasing. Great Britain had 
sent,* towards the end of 1791, Mr. Hammond as a Minister 
Plenipotentiary to the United States. France, with her 
internal affairs much disturbed, had also a minister, Mr. 
Ternant, with limited powers, while this country was repre 
sented in Paris by Mr. Short, who had there carefully and 
faithfully watched over the affairs of the United States. It 
having been decided that the best interests of the country 
required that representatives of the same rank as those of 
Great Britain should be appointed, the President proposed at 
first the nomination of Mr. T. Pinckney, as Minister Pleni 
potentiary to London, and upon his assurance that he would 
accept, sent in to the Senate with his the name of Gouver 
neur Morris as Minister Plenipotentiary to France, and that 
of Mr. Short as Minister Resident to the Hague. In a let 
ter to Mr. Pinckney, January 17, 1792, f Mr. Jefferson says: 
" Some members of the Senate apprehending they had the 

* Jefferson s Works, iii., p. 329.

right of determining on the expediency of foreign missions, 
as well as on the persons named, took that occasion of bring 
ing forward the discussion of that question, by which the 
nominations were delayed two or three weeks." He also 
says, p. 329, Mr. Morris s " appointment was extremely un 
popular, and so little relished by several of the Senate, that 
^very effort was used to negative it. Those whose personal 
objections to Mr. Morris overruled their deference to the 
President, finding themselves a minority, joined with an 
other small party who are against all foreign appointments, 
and endeavored with them to put down the whole system 
rather than let this article pass. This plan was defeated and 
Mr. Morris passed by a vote of 1 6 against 1 1." 

Mr. Morris, who was at this time in England, wrote to 
Robert Morris, February I5th, acknowledging the honor 
conferred on him by the nomination, and spoke of the mis 
chievous consequences of delay in confirmation, as weaken 
ing the influence of the minister should he be appointed. It 
was not until March 2Oth that he received the information of 
his appointment, which had been sent on January 23d. 

These observations have been made to explain the portion 
of the manuscript account of the debate in the Senate 
which follows, and which gives the reasons that influenced 
the votes of several of the leading members of that body, 
and because in Mr. Morris s letter to Mr. King, he says that 
he was " considerably indebted to you [him] for effecting 
that appointment." *

f Manuscript of Rufus King. 



420 RUFUS KING. [1792 

shall class my remarks under two heads, one having respect to 
Mr. Morris natural capacity, &amp; the other his moral character. 

I ought in the first place to observe, that I bear Mr. Morris 
no ill will 1 have personally known him for several years ; I 
have served with him in Congress, &amp; was with him in the Conven 
tion of 1787. I have never been borne down by his superior 
Talents, nor have I experienced any mortifications from the man 
ner in which he has treated me in debate. I wish him and all 
mankind holy and happy. I allow that he possesses a sprightly 
mind, a ready apprehension, and that he is capable of writing a 
good letter and forming a good Draft. I never have heard that 
he has betrayed a Trust, or that he lacks integrity indeed I have 
not known him in any individually responsible station In the 
State Legislature, in Congress, &amp; in the Convention of 1787, he 
was one of many, and in the orifice of Finance his principal was 
responsible, and nothing for or against him can be inferred from 
these stations. 

With regard to his moral character, I consider him an irreligious 
and profane man he is no hypocrite and never pretended to 
have any religion. He makes religion the subject of ridicule and 
is profane in his conversation. I do not think the public have 
as much security from such men as from godly and honest men 
It is a bad example to promote such characters ; and although 
they may never have betrayed a trust, or exhibited proofs of a 
want of integrity, and although they may be called men of honor 
yet I would not put my trust in them I am unwilling that the 
country should put their Trust in them, and because they have 
not already done wrong, I feel no security that they will not do 
wrong in future. General Arnold was an irreligious and profane 
character he was called a man of honor, but I never had any 
confidence in him, nor did I ever join in promoting him. I re 
member he sued a man at New Haven for saying he had the foul 
disease and it was urged that the Jury should give heavy 
damages, because Arnold was a man of honor and high-minded 
but this same Arnold betrayed his Trust when he had an op 
portunity and would have delivered up the Commander in chief 
&amp; betrayed his country. And the like has happened from other 
such characters ; and I am against their being employed and 
shall therefore vote against Mr. Morris.

GOUVR. MORRIS TO R. KING. 

LONDON, April 6, 1792. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

I have received this day My Credentials to the Court of 
France and am pleased to find that I am considerably indebted 
to you for effecting that appointment. It is true that a Sense of 
Obligation is not generally agreeable, but when a Favor received 
serves to strengthen the Connections we wish to preserve, and 



422 RUFUS KING. [1792 

unite us to the deserving few with whom we wish to live, it never 
fails to excite the most pleasing Emotions. The fortifying 
System has nearly pass d away as a Fashion in the Military 
World, but I observe that it still prevails in political Life ; so 
that the Virtue which scorns to intrench itself in Gravity and 
Form, but comes naked into the Battle, is soon driven off and 
perhaps with Shame. Some respected Citizens are not acquainted 
with the Goddess, and others fear to be seen in her Company, lest 
Suspicion should light on a connection which Suspicion could 
never form. Well, Peace be with them and since it is necessary, 
we will ev n dress ourselves like other Folks, that so Prudery 
may not be scandaliz d, nor Deformity offended. I think if you 
and I should chance to grow old and converse together, it will 
be no small Consolation to reflect that those Measures which 
have rendered our Country great and happy were carried in Spite 
of the Opposition of our Enemies, whom we have pitied without 
Comtempt tho they hated without cause. 

As I have no doubt that you urged my Appointment with a 
View to the public Service, it is incumbent on you to comply with 
my Request to be favor d with your Correspondence. If I have 
not good Information and early Information I can do little or 
nothing. You will easily conceive that a Minister who knows 
not those affairs of his country which are known to many others,, 
is plac d in an awkward Situation : besides there is always a 
kind of Traffic in Articles of Intelligence among the Members of 
the Diplomatic Body, in which Beads and Wampum are some 
times given in Gold to the Satisfaction of both Parties. It hap 
pens also not unfrequently that by knowing good or bad Tidings 
before any one else, we can make the most of the one and obviate 
the worst of the other. For Instance, in poor Sinclair s Defeat, 
it might have been so handed out to the Public as to have look d 
like nothing ; and if a horrible Account had afterwards been 
publish d by our Enemies, most People would not have been at 
the trouble of reading it. On the other Hand, some of those 
Gambling Operations in the Stocks, which, however they may 
prejudice the Fortune, or even Morals of Individuals, are clearly 
demonstrative of the public prosperity, and of the Energy, Au 
thority and Stability of Government these I say may be so 
stated, occasionally as to give a just Idea of our Importance to 



1792] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 423 

those numerous Idlers, whose Pursuit of Knowledge rarely ex 
tends beyond a Newspaper Paragraph, and yet this great Herd 
have more Influence on national Councils than is generally ima 
gined, and especially in France, where everything is talked of and 
hardly anything is understood. Lastly, it may happen that, from 
ignorance of the real state of things, a Minister may give up what 
his Country would wish to retain or pursue what they would not 
acquire. You will tell me perhaps that there is a public Office 
for the Transmission of Intelligence and that it is true, but the 
same object strikes different People in a different way. A Load 
of unexpected Business may distract the attention of that Office, 
or Letters may be lost or long delay d ; in Short, considering the 
Distance and other Circumstances, Accident may often obstruct, 
or Design totally stop that Channel of Communication. But why 
do I enter into Detail ? You will see it All, and more, at a single 
glance. You will see my Solicitude, and you will believe I hope in 
the Sincerity of my Regard. 

I am very truly yours, 

GOUVR. MORRIS. 

C. GORE TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, May 22, 1792. 
MY DEAR FRIEND : X 

The United States owe to France nearly six millions 
of dollars. I have supposed this debt might be purchased of 
France for the like sum of their assignats, which are at a discount 
of forty per cent. The government of this country would not, 
probably, think proper to make the attempt for its own emolu 
ment. The deranged situation of the affairs of that kingdom, &amp; 
their want of money to support the credit of their paper currency, 
render it not improbable that they would be willing to part 
with their demands against America for the amount in their own 
paper. Unless the government of the U. S. chose to avail itself 
of this state of things, a transfer of the debt to other hands could 
not injure America. Under this impression I have thought that 
a company might be form d in this country, who should authorize 
some person to repair to Europe, &amp; there connect himself with 
some able, solid, &amp; prudent people, who might provide funds for 



424 RUFUS KING. [1792 

the payment to France &amp; make engagements with that kingdom 
to transfer the demand to the purchasers on making the payments 
If there is no political objection to the plan, I think the meas 
ures may be so adopted that no other risque need be feared, than 
the loss of a sum necessary to defray the expences of that person 
who may undertake the operation in Europe in case his endeavor 
shou d be unsuccessful. Now, my friend, if you think a thing of 
this kind feasible, safe, and without objections, should you like to 
be concerned in it at present the only persons that have con 
versed on this subject are J Coffin Jones &amp; myself the company 
may be formed of such men &amp; under such regulations as will en 
sure ag t all loss, but a very limited one, and all hazards of im 
proper conduct I will with pleasure meet you in New York or 
elsewhere to make any arrangements on this subject- -if the thing 
should meet your ideas of propriety &amp; advantage. If it is pre 
sumable the government is taking any steps to avail itself of this 
situation, I have no wish to interfere, but if not, I think if an able 
&amp; prudent man can be found to undertake the business in Europe, 
large property may be made &amp; no one injured Let me hear from 
you soon &amp; believe me very sincerely your friend, * 

C. GORE. 

R. KING TO GOUVR. MORRIS. 

ist Sept., 1792. 
SIR: 

I presume you are furnished with our newspapers and with the 
Journals of Congress. From them you will be able to form a 
pretty good opinion of the State of parties here. The Gazette of 
the U. S. published at Philadelphia by Fenno is on our side, and 
the National Gazette, published at the same place by Freneau, a 
clerk in Jefferson s office, is on the other. In this paper every 
measure of the Government is censured, and if you believe the 
accounts it published, the country is generally dissatisfied. The 
contrary, however, is the Truth. We are and have reason to be, 
the happiest people in the world. Our Government is established, 
it performs as much as its friends promised, &amp; its administration 
has evidently advanced the prosperity of our Citizens. 

* Endorsed: " Ansd. that two attempts having already been made, I doubted 
the expediency of a third. R. K., Sunday, May, 1792."

The opposition, that now exists, arises from other principles than 
those which produced an opposition to the Constitution, and pro 
ceeds from the Rivalry, which always has &amp; will prevail in a 
free country. 

The Revenues are abundant and are collected with unexam 
pled fidelity ; the branch called excise will soon be productive. 
The Northern States are satisfied with this Tax and new Distil 
leries are building for the distillation of Corn &amp; Fruit. This Tax 
has been complained of in the back counties of Pennsylvania, 
Virginia &amp; The Carolinas, but as the law is better understood, 
objections are overcome, and, by the mild and steady measures of 
Government, all opposition will soon disappear. Add to this, the 
Tax will work a reform in these Districts, since it will destroy a 
great many small Distilleries and make the business a branch of 
Labor, instead of being, as it hitherto has been, a ruinous employ 
ment pursued by every family. 

The national judiciary without having been much employed, 
has been the means of settling a large proportion of our foreign 
Debts. From the Potomack east, nothing remains to be settled. 
In South Carolina, where immense sums were due, they are doing 
well, and in a few years will be in a very prosperous condi 
tion. Virginia will be the last to do, what her own interest re 
quired her long since to have performed. 

The settlement of our new lands is only equalled by the in 
crease of our population. You hear of companies formed &amp; 
forming in all the States for the improvement of our inland navi 
gation, and thus the most distant lands will become almost as val 
uable as those nearest to our principal markets. Our Commerce 
&amp; navigation continue to increase &amp; what is of still more conse 
quence, the capital employed is in a good degree an American, 
instead of a British one. The sound State of public credit, and 
the Establishment of Banks, have already given aids to commerce, 
and will soon afford assistance to manufactures &amp; agriculture. 
The National Bank has established branches at Boston, New 
York, Baltimore, Richmond &amp; Charleston, and will go on to place 
others in such situations as will best promote their own &amp; the 
public interest. The facilities which this institution gives to 
Trade, and to the collection of the Taxes, is generally acknowl 
edged, and, by establishing a connexion in Holland &amp; London, 



426 RUFUS KING. [792 

(which is in contemplation) it may deal profitably in exchange as 
well as place itself in a situation to avoid the Dangers, to which 
Banks are exposed by the exportation of Coin. 

Though we are preparing a respectable force to oppose the 
Indians, still we have taken every measure to conclude a peace ; 
and, from the character of the Agents engaged in this business, 
there is reason to expect success. At any rate we shall make no 
campaign this year, the season will be spent in disciplining the 
Army, and in efforts to establish Peace. The Frontiers are quiet,, 
and well guarded against incursions. Washington &amp; Adams will 
be rechosen this winter the first without opposition ; whether the 
opponents of Mr. Adams will combine their opposition, I con 
sider as uncertain. Should this be the case Clinton will be their 
man. 

We are in a singular situation respecting our Governor. A 
majority of the votes at the late Election was given to Mr. Jay a 
majority of the Canvassers rejected the votes of three Counties 
under the pretence of a Defect in the Form of the Return &amp; de 
clared Mr. Clinton elected. The minority of the Canvassers pro 
tested, and it is very probable that a majority of the State disap 
prove of the Decision of the Canvassers. The Legislature will 
meet in November, and it will be attempted to procure a Resolve 
for the calling of a convention for the sole purpose of annulling 
the canvassers Decision, and ordering a new election. Mr. 
Clinton qualified, and is in the exercise of the Office. 

Thus, my dear Sir, I comply with the proposal that you made 
me in your letter from London, (Apl. 6th) and give you an out 
line of our situation. I will hereafter do more, by furnishing you 
with those incidents which from time to time may occur, and 
which may serve to explain the views of the persons engaged in 
our public affairs. Our information respecting France comes 
principally through England and is so confused and coloured, 
that we are unable to form a rational opinion of their affairs. 
You are in the best possible situation to obtain, &amp; give exact in 
telligence, and you will do me a favor to gratify me on this sub 
ject. 

With much esteem &amp;c 

RUFUS KING. 



1792] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 427 

The decision of Washington not to decline a re-election 
removed the question of competition for the first office, 
and gave encouragement to those who thought the Vice- 
Presidency within their reach. Mr. Burr was among these, 
and his chances were supposed to be greater in consequence 
of an apparent growing weakness of Governor Clinton in 
New York, as manifested in the last election. Intimations 
of his designs excited serious alarm among the Federalists. 
One of them (R. King) wrote to Hamilton i/th September, 
1792 : " If the enemies of the government are secret and 
united, we shall lose Mr. Adams. Burr is industrious in his 
canvass, and his object is well understood. Dallas informs 
me that he will be supported in Pennsylvania. Should 
Jefferson and his friends unite in the project, the votes for 
Adams may be so reduced that, though more numerous 
than those for any other person, he may decline the office. 
Nothing which has heretofore happened so decisively proves 
the inveteracy of the opposition." * 

In answer to this letter we have the following: 

A. HAMILTON TO R. KING. 

Sept. 23, 1792. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

Though I had had a previous intimation of the possibility of 
such an event, yet the intelligence contained in your letter of the 
1 7th surprised me. Even now I am to be convinced that the 
movement is anything more than a diversion in favour of Mr. 
Clinton. Yet on my part it will not be neglected. My atten 
tion as far as shall be in any degree safe will be directed to every 
State South of New York. I do not go beyond it, because, I 
presume, other influences would be quite as efficacious there as 
mine. 

A good use of it will be made in this State. I wish a letter 
could be written here, stating the plan and Mr. Dallas assertion 
affecting Pennsylvania, which could be made use of without 
reserve. You will know who could write such a letter, and of 
course, to whom it might be addressed. Mr. Lewis would be 
* Life of A. Hamilton, by I. C. Hamilton, v., p. 89, Boston, 1879. 



428 RUFUS KING. [1792 

the most proper person to be written to. This is a matter of im 
portance and, if practicable, no time should be lost. 

I wrote Mr. Jay a long letter, which I fear reached New York 
after he had set out on the Circuit, informing him that I had con 
cluded to advise a proclamation, and my reasons for it, which 
included some material facts not before communicated. I have 
not leisure to repeat. The Proclamation has been signed by the 
President * and sent to Mr. Jefferson for his countersignature. I 
expect it here on Tuesday, and have taken correspondent 
measures. I believe all is prudent &amp; safe. 

Yrs. truly &amp; affect., 

A. HAMILTON. 

In order to provide ample revenue for the new govern 
ment, Congress had passed a law taxing among other things 
the distillation of spirits. This law met with much opposi 
tion, and the collection of the tax was resisted especially in 
North Carolina and Western Pennsylvania. So open and 
undisguised was the resistance in the latter, that the officers 
were not only defied but threatened with personal violence 
should they attempt to collect the tax or even accept the 
office of collector. The leading and intelligent men of that 
section fomented the difficulty, thus covering a political 
desire to embarrass the government, and in August, 1792, at 
a convention of four adjoining counties held at Pittsburg, 
they caused resolutions to be passed denouncing the excise 
law and avowing a determination to prevent its execution. 
The combination thus formed and the open attack upon 
the authority of the government rendered it necessary to 
take some positive steps to restore that authority, one of 
which was the issue of a proclamation by the President, 
warning these disturbers of the public peace to desist from 
their unlawful acts, and directing the magistrates to cause 
the arrest and punishment of those who were breaking the 
law. The advice of the leading supporters of the adminis-

ing revenue on distilled spirits. 



1792] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 429^ 

tration was sought for before this step was taken, and among 
others called upon was Mr. King. 

Mr. Hamilton, Secretary of Treasury, on the 3d September, 
1792, wrote to Mr. Jay, * stating that " the incidents in the West 
ern parts of this State (Pennsylvania) announce so determined 
and persevering a spirit of opposition to law, as in my [his] 
opinion to render a vigorous exertion of the powers of govern 
ment indispensable. . . . There is really, My dear Sir, a 
crisis in the affairs of the Country which demands the most 
mature consideration of its best and wisest friends. I beg you to 
apply your most serious thoughts to it, and favour me as soon as 
possible with the result of your reflexions. Perhaps it will not 
be amiss for you to converse with Mr. King. His judgment is^ 
sound : he has caution and energy. Would a proclamation from 
the President be advisable, stating the criminality of such pro 
ceedings, &amp; warning, &amp;c." 

J. JAY TO A. HAMILTON.! 

"Sept. 8, 1792. 

" I have conferred with Mr. King upon the subject of your 
letter of the 3rd inst. We concur in opinion that neither a proc 
lamation, nor a particular charge by the court to the grand jury 
(a course which had been suggested) would be advisable at 
present. To us it appears more prudent that the business be 
opened by the President s speech at the ensuing session of Con 
gress ; their address will manifest the sense of the House, and 
both together operate more effectually than a proclamation." 

The letter continues with reasons why such a course 
might be more prudent, but says : " If in the meantime such 
outrage should be committed as to force the attention of 
government to its dignity, nothing will remain but to obey 
that necessity in a way that will leave nothing to hazard. "" 

On the 8th of September, however, before the above 
reached him, the Secretary, with the advice of Messrs..

Knox and Randolph, then in Philadelphia, had decided that 
it was advisable to issue a proclamation, and sent to the 
President a draft of the same, which was signed by him on 
September I5th, and attested by the Secretary of State, Mr. 
Jefferson. Notwithstanding this, the resistance to the law 
continued very persistent, and was not finally checked until 
after a vigorous military expedition into the region, the 
arrest of the leaders, and the dispersion of those combined 
together. 

R. KING TO MR. SOUTHGATE (PROBABLY.) 

NEW YORK, Sept. 30, 1792. 
DEAR SIR : 

It may not be amiss to apprize you that great pains will be 
taken to remove our Friend Mr. Adams and among others that 
my Colleague Mr. Burr is very industriously making interest for 
the Office. It is for no good that any support can be given to the 
projet of Mr. Adams degradation ; there are however some even 
among you who would be pleased with the event. I have said 
enough and can readily conceive what must be your feelings on 
this subject. 

One word respecting your interest, I remember that you have 
a cause in the Federal Court that has been delayed for want of 
Judges to form a court. Wilson &amp; Iredell go to the Eastern 
Circuit. I have heard that Wilson casually observed (when here 
on his way to Connecticut where he now is) that he should not go 
further East than Boston ; &amp; that Mr. Iredell only wd. go to New 
Hampshire, Mr. Wilson having it in view to return in order to go 
to Europe this Fall. 

I give you this information that you may take measures when 
Wilson arrives at Boston to induce him to come to Portsmouth. 
By a vessel which brings us very late accounts from Europe, it 
appears that the affairs of France grow worse and are almost des 
perate. On the loth of August the King was suspended &amp; 
confined to take his Trial on the 26th of Sept. The Mob 
attempted on the day of his suspension to break into the Palace 
they were opposed by 700 Swiss Guards, who after killing great 



1792] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 431 

numbers of the Mob, were all massacred by the populace, who 
threw down all the royal Statues, plundered the Palaces and 
effaced every vestige of Royalty. The King and royal Family 
early in the Tumult escaped to the National Assembly. The 
Austrians and Prussians had determined to enter France on the 
1 6th day of August, so that our next information must be very 
interesting. With sincere attachment 

I am, dear Sir, your ob. Sen, 

RUFUS KING. 

R. KING TO J. ADAMS. 

NEW YORK, Sept. 30, 1792. 
DEAR SIR : 

By accounts from England as late as the 23d of August, we 
learn that on the roth of that month the National Assembly sus 
pended the King, removed the Ministry, &amp; took on themselves the 
executive powers. They have since decreed that the primary 
assemblies should meet on the 26th of August, to appoint deputies 
to a national Convention to be convened on the 2oth of Ser^mber 
for the purpose of deciding on the forfeiture of the ci own, &amp; 
prescribing the manner in which the executive powers should in 
future be executed. 

Towards the close of the day on which the King was sus 
pended the mob demanded to repeat the transactions of the 2oth 
June, they were opposed by 700 Swiss who were about the Royal 
family, the mob prevailed having armed themselves with cannon 
from the arsenals, they massacred the Swiss guard, plundered the 
palace, overturned the statues of their former Kings, &amp; effaced 
every vestige of Royalty. The King &amp; royal family, early in the 
tumult, escaped through a garden to the national assembly, from 
whence they were removed by a decree, to the Temple, a building 
detached &amp; surrounded by a wall. The custody of the King &amp; 
royal family is given to Petion, the Mayor of Paris. 

We have no account from the army since this bloody transac 
tion. All accounts concur that the Austrians &amp; Prussians would 
enter into France about the middle of August ; so that our next 
intelligence will be pretty decisive respecting this revolution con 
ducted with so much barbarity &amp; ignorance. 



432 RUFUS KING. 



From the state of the affairs of Poland towards the end of 
July, it is probable that the Poles have been compelled to 
abandon their constitution, &amp; to return under their former 
government. 

England it would seem is not inclined to interfere, since the 
Parliament which stood prorogued to the last of August, has 
been further prorogued (since the affair of Paris) to the last of 
November. 

With great respect, I am &amp;c 

RUFUS KING. 



JOHN ADAMS TO R. KING. 

QUINCY, October n, 1792. 

I am very much obliged, Sir, by your kind Letter of the 3oth of 
Septr. and for the important Intelligence contained in it. 

There is such a complication of Tragedy, Comedy and Farce 
in all the accounts from France, that it is to me to the last degree 
disgusting to attend to them in detail. I read over the accounts 
in general and then endeavour to divert my own attention from 
any very serious, which must be very melancholy, reflections 
upon them. It is most of all astonishing that sensible Men 
should not have foreseen all that has happened. The demolition 
of the Royalty is so natural and necessary an Effect of their Con 
stitution, that it can be of no surprize. It is however matter of 
very sober concern to us, that there should have been in America 
from the beginning so blind, undistinguishing and enthusiastic 
an admiration of every Thing that has been done by that light 
airy and transported People. I pretend not to any very particu 
lar knowledge of Individual Characters, or conflicting Parties in 
France, but the Jealousy in the Duke of Orleans, of the Noailles 
Family is so apparent, that it will account for most that has 
happened. 

Every virtuous and enlightened Citizen will mourn over the 
misfortunes of Poland ; but the qualities necessary to erect and 
support and defend a free Constitution of Government are not 
easily inspired into an old corrupted Nation. 

The People in this Part of our Union are as cool and as easy 
as ever I knew them under any Government : indeed they 



1792] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 433 

appear to be more prosperous and more busy. How they are at 
the Southward I am not very well informed. Our Vessell, 
according to present appearances, is not in immediate danger 
of any Sudden or violent Storms. The late election, I hope will 
not have any dangerous Consequences in your State. If either 
the symptoms of brake-bone fever, not wholly subdued, or any 
Considerations of delicacy, or any other Thing should prevent my 
attendance in Senate at the beginning of the Session I hope to 
be excused. There are commonly two or three months at the 
opening of Congress, when little Business is done, and no im 
portant Question is decided ; so that I flatter myself the Senate 
will appoint a President for a short time and not be too severe 
upon me. This is entre nous. 

With great Esteem, I have the honour to be, dear Sir, 

Your most obt. Servt. 

JOHN ADAMS. 
The honourable RUFUS KING. 



G. MORRIS TO R. KING. 

PARIS, 236 October, 1792. 
DEAR SIR : 

Yours of the first of September reach d me a few Days ago. 
Accept my sincere Thanks for the Information it contains which 
is precious and highly pleasing. I might comment on what you 
say respecting a Print which censures every Measure of Govern 
ment, but you will readily anticipate all which I might say on 
that subject. I cannot give you such desirable Intelligence re 
specting the State of Things here as I might have done if the late 
Revolution had not taken Place, because I find my Intercourse 
of Necessity suspended and untill I have Orders respecting the 
new Government, I am bound to preserve a Neutrality of Con 
duct so that I cannot as heretofore peep behind the Scenes. Add 
to this that there is at present no very certain March anywhere, 
each feeling himself oblig d to deviate according to Circum 
stances from the course which he might wish. I will attempt 
however to give you an Abbreviation of the late Events and in 
my Letters to Mr. Jefferson which may perhaps be communicated 

VOL. I. 28 



434 RUFUS KING. [1792 

to the Senate, and at any Rate from the Gazettes preceding and 
subsequent to the tenth of August you will be able to fill up the 
Outlines of the Sketch. 

The late Revolution has for its remote Cause that Excess in 
the human Temper which drives men always to Extremes, if not 
check d and Control d. For its proximate Cause, it has the Vices 
and Defects of the late Constitution, and particularly that an 
Executive without Power was rendered responsible for Events, 
and that a Legislature composed of a single chamber of Repre 
sentatives was secur d by every Precaution and under no Control 
except some paper Maxims and popular opinion. That the Peo 
ple or rather the Populace, a thing which thank God, is unknown 
in America, flatter d with the Idea that they are omnipotent and 
disappointed from Necessity in the golden Prospects originally 
held out to them, were under no Restraint except such as might 
be imposed by Magistrates of their own Choice. It resulted in 
evitably that the Executive must be in the Power of the Legisla 
ture, and this last at the Mercy of such Men as could influence 
the Mob. By reducing the royal Authority below all reasonable 
measure, the Constitution Makers had created a Moral Impossi 
bility, that the People should believe the King sincere in his 
Acceptance, even if it had been possible that he should without 
Regret have beheld himself reduc d from the first Place allotted 
to man to a State so low as to be exposed to Insult from the low 
est. It was evident then the Constitution could not last and in 
the overturn three things might happen, viz, the Establishment of 
Despotism, the Establishment of a good Constitution, or the In 
stitution of a Democracy. The first under an able and ambitious 
Prince was inevitable. The second was extremely difficult, not 
in itself, but because the Chiefs of different Parties all found 
themselves committed to different Points and opinions. The last 
was only a natural continuation of the Progress of Men s Minds 
in a necessary succession of Ideas from the Bill of Rights. The 
Advocates for Republican Government therefore had an easy 
Task altho both to themselves and others it appeared difficult. 
From the moment that the second Assembly met a Plan was 
form d among several of the Members and others to overturn the 
Constitution they had just sworn to observe and establish a Re 
public. This arose in Part from the Desire of placing themselves 



1792] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 435 

better than they could otherwise do, and in Part from a Convic 
tion that the System could not last and that they would have no 
Share in the Administration under a pure Monarchy. As they 
had a strong Hold upon the lowest Class of People, as the Aris 
tocratic and constitutional Parties were at open war, as these last 
avowed openly their Wish to amend, in other words, to change 
the Constitution, which at the same time they assum d to vener 
ate, it was not a difficult Matter to assault a Monarch who ad 
hered to that Form which he could not be supposed to approve 
and whose Faults became daily more apparent. Add to this that 
the Court was involv d in a Spirit of little paltry Intrigue unworthy 
of Anything above the Rank of Footmen and Chambermaids. 
Every one had his or her little project and every little Project 
had some Abettors. Strong manly Councils frightened the 
weak, alarmed the envious and wounded the enervate mind of 
the lazy and luxurious. Such Counsels therefore (if perchance 
any such appeard) were approved but not adopted, certainly not 
followd. The Palace was always filled with People whose 
Language, whose Conduct and whose Manners were so diametri 
cally opposite to every Thing like Liberty that it was easy to 
persuade the People that the Court meant to destroy the Consti 
tution by observing strictly the Constitution. Some Persons 
avowd this Tactick which from the moment of such Avowal was 
no longer worth a Doit. The King, whose Integrity would never 
listen to any Thing like the Violation of his Oath, had neverthe 
less the Weakness to permit those who openly avowd unconstitu 
tional sentiments to approach his Person and enjoy his Intimacy. 
The Queen was still more imprudent. The Republicans who 
had also their Plan to destroy the Constitution by the Constitu 
tion, founded on the King s personal Integrity their Operation to 
destroy his Reputation for Integrity &amp; hold him out to the World 
as a Traitor to the Nation whom he was sworn to protect. They 
in Consequence seized every occasion to pass popular Decrees 
which were unconstitutional. If the King exercised his Veto, he 
was accused of wishing a Counter-Revolution. If he sanctioned 
the Decree, he was so far lost with those who were injured by 
the Decree ; and of course became daily more and more unpro 
tected. The Success of his Enemies was beyond their own 
Expectation. His Palace was assaulted. He took Refuge with

the Assembly and is now a Prisoner of State with his Family. 
But now the Ideas of Revolt which had been fostered by his over 
throw are grown very troublesome to those who have possessed 
themselves of the Authority. It is not possible to say either to 
the People or to the Sea, so far shalt thou go and no farther ; 
and we shall have I think some sharp Struggles which will make 
many men repent of what they have done, when they find with 
Macbeth that they have been taught bloody Instructions which 
return to plague the Inventor. 

Adieu, my dear Sir, I am truly yours,

C. GORE TO R. KING, PHILA. 

BOSTON, Nov. 14, 1792. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

No doubt can be entertained but the election in Massachusetts 
will be federal. Opposition was made to Ames by the advocates of 
Austin ; and the friends of Government reposed with too great 
Security on the good sense of the voters. It will appear that so 
few votes were scarce ever given on any occasion. In few towns 
more than 20 votes, &amp; in many populous places, not more than 
ten but Ames will be chosen by a large proportion. 

The Electors of Massachusetts will be appointed on Wednes 
day next, and we have no reason to fear an appointment of such 
as will prefer any candidates for the two first offices of Govern 
ment to the present occupants. 

Your friend, 

C. GORE. 



CHAPTER XXV. 

Sympathy in America with the French Revolution M. Genet s Arrival as 
Minister from France His illegal Acts The President s Proclamation 
R. King s Views on the Relations with France favor Neutrality. 

The sad events which the correspondence in the last 
chapter related as having taken place in France at the end 
of the year 1792, resulting in the overthrow of the mon 
archy and the substitution in its place of liberty and the 
French Republic, found a strong sympathetic feeling 
among a large body of the American people. Overlooking 
the unbridled actions of the mob, which burst forth with 
such malignant fury against the established government, and 
seeing only the struggles of the people to escape from the 
condition of oppression which had been brought about by 
the excesses and evil conduct of their rulers, they rejoiced in 
the result and sent forward their warm congratulations to 
those who had thus overthrown the tyrannical government, 
even though it culminated in the execution of the king and 
established mob rule. 

The conduct of England towards us had been so harsh, 
unjust, and unfriendly that many were ready to suggest and 
pursue strong measures against that country in support of 
our rights, so that, on the arrival of M. Genet, early in April, 
1793, as a new ambassador from France, with larger powers 
than had been given to his predecessor, and bringing with 
him the news of the declaration of war by France against 
England, a large body of the citizens of the United States 
were ready to applaud this act. 

437 



438 RUFUS KING. [1793, 

Fresh from the scenes, in which he had taken a large part, 
for the overthrow of the Genevese Republic and its incorpo 
ration with France, M. Genet came with a determined pur 
pose to repeat here the same system which had been used 
abroad, so as to establish the power of France in this coun 
try. Ignoring the general government, not reporting him 
self at Philadelphia, he went directly to^Charleston and "be 
gan there at once a series of movements, granting letters of 
marque to cruisers, and authorizing other hostile measures 
against England, which could have but one result if per 
mitted by the Government of the United States that of 
embroiling us against that country in the war, 

Under these circumstances the conduct of the United 
States Government and its duty towards both nations 
became matters requiring the most serious consideration, 
for while the most friendly feelings existed towards France, 
which had so opportunely and efficiently aided it in acquiring 
its liberty and independence, it was a question how far we 
should allow our sympathies to entangle us in the policy of 
France and in the war with England, in which her emissa 
ries declared we were bound to assist her. 

After an anxious and careful deliberation, the President, 
on the 22d of April, 1793, issued a proclamation of neutral 
ity, warning the citizens of the United States from enga 
ging in contraband trade with either England or France, 
with both of which we were at peace and had commercial 
relations, and thus threw discredit upon and disavowed the 
attempts to force us into hostile relations with England and 
make the country an ally of France. It may here be stated 
that when Congress assembled at the end of the year, the 
issuing of this proclamation received their commendation 
in the following words in the Senate s answer to the Presi 
dent s address : * " We, therefore, contemplate with pleasure 
the proclamation by you issued, and give it our hearty ap 
probation. We deem it a measure well timed and wise,, 
manifesting a watchful solicitude for the welfare of the 

* Annals of Congress, 1794, p. 48. 



1793] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 439 

nation and calculated to promote it." A sentiment which 
the House of Representatives, in their address, unanimously 
endorsed. 

It is hardly necessary to say that Mr. King counselled and 
maintained the wisdom of the President s action, and, as the 
following paper shows, lent the assistance of his pen in pre 
senting the legal aspect of the case, as well as other consid 
erations, which ought to influence the government and the 
people. 

R. KING TO A. HAMILTON. * 

April 24, 1793. 

Averse to any connection with the war beyond what may be 
permitted by the laws of strict neutrality, we are pleased to see 
the Proclamation. I have no precedents with which to compare 
it, but I could have wished to have seen in some part of it the 
word " Neutrality " which every one would have understood and 
felt the force of. 

Having anxiously considered the points respecting which we 
conversed when I was last with you, I hope you are founded in 
your opinion. The change which has happened will not, perhaps, 
justify us in saying " the Treaties are void " and whether we 
may contend in favor of their suspension is a point of delicacy, 
and not quite free from doubt. The authority of the present 
Government is coextensive with their territory, which is free from 
the possession of their antagonists. 

Prudence would seem to require us to move with caution, and 
by delay to insure a safe decision. The mere reception of the 
minister will do us no injury, although I am inclined to believe, 
that in order to avoid being pressed on points we may wish not 
to decide, it will be best to qualify the reception of the minister 
in such a manner as will save our commitment in reference to 
those questions we wish to stand open. 

Our treaty with Holland may be used with advantage. The 
report of Mr. Le Brun to the Convention respecting the perfidy 
of the monarchy towards us, is proof of such a want of good faith 
as poisons the whole treaty. 

* Works of Hamilton, v., p. 553, N. Y., 1857. 



440 RUFUS KING. [i793 

Have you noticed that the i6th Article of the Treaty of Com 
merce between England and France is in the teeth of the 226. 
Article of the Treaty of Commerce between France and us ? On 
the principle that all the articles of a treaty have the force of con 
ditions, the violation of this Article by France would give us the 
power to renounce the whole Treaty. 

Examining our laws respecting the registry of our ships and 
vessels, I was struck with a difficulty which will luckily be in the 
way of our purchasing prizes brought into our ports by any of the 
powers at war. It is worth your attention. As the law stands, I 
do not perceive that any such vessels can be protected by the 
American Flag, even though owned bona fide by American citi 
zens. Of this point, however, I will not be confident. Such 
vessels, beyond doubt, will be liable to pay the foreign tonnage. 

The conduct of England in searching our ships and impressing 
seamen engaged under our flag, is very different in the present 
armament from what it was in the late armament against Spain. 
The masters of our ships which have arrived here from England, 
as also those who have arrived from Ireland, speak with the ap 
pearance of National pride when they mention the hotness of the 
press, and the entire exemption of ships which sail under our flag. 
The circumstance is one from which we may make pretty certain 
inferences. Farewell. I wish I could give assistance to the 
measures and maxims you will pursue. We must not become 
entangled with this mad war. 

Yours &amp;c., 

RUFUS KING. 



In Rufus King s handwriting : 

* " The proclamation of the President of the U. S. cannot fail 
to afford satisfaction to every part of the Union. The public 
opinion seems quite in unison with the determination of the su 
preme executive ; so much so as to even discover anxiety lest from 
any unforseen causes, we may notwithstanding the plain path of 
duty be drawn into the war. It is presumed that we have no 
Treaties, or engagements with any foreign nation, except those 

* This and other following papers were published in the journals of the time. 



1793] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 441 

with which the public are acquainted. The U. S. have entered 
into Treaties of commerce with France, Holland and Prussia, and 
they have a Treaty of Alliance with France. War exists between 
these powers and it behoves us in order to maintain an impartial 
conduct, as well in regard to these nations, as in respect to any 
other powers which are or may be engaged in the war, to ascertain 
our engagements, and seasonably to decide on the conduct we 
ought to pursue. If we are bound by Treaty to perform services 
to some, and to refuse them to other nations, we hold the public 
faith and the national honor, too precious to hesitate to perform 
our engagements. If on the other hand, we are altogether free 
from engagements of preference, the country at large cannot too 
early be informed that such is the case. 

" It is pleasing to reflect on the felicity of our situation, and on 
the prospect of peace and prosperity that we have before us. It 
cannot be for the interest of any of the maritime powers to disturb 
our repose, since our friendship is of importance to all of them. 
If we sought for proofs to satisfy us on this point, we have them in 
the conduct of Great Britain. No one who remembers the em 
barrassments to which our ships were subjected a few years since, 
when that power was arming against Spain, can fail being struck 
with the difference in their present conduct. The press is now 
as hot as at any former time. The American Navigation is exempt 
from search and our Flag receives its due &amp; proper respect in the 
different parts of that dominion. We owe to England and to 
every other power with whom we have no Treaties friendship 
and impartiality to those with whom we have Treaties, we owe 
the same friendship and impartiality, together with whatever else 
we are obliged to afford them. 

"Were we without Treaties, or were the Treaties which we 
have formed free from engagements, which go beyond the mere 
offices of neutrality, there would not be the smallest difficulty in 
our way. Strict impartiality, and a conduct equally friendly to 
all would be the profitable course that we should hold. 

" It may be permitted to make a slight examination of the Trea 
ties of the U. S. in order to ascertain and discover the exceptions 
to this course which they contain. 

" The commercial Treaties with Fr., with Hoi. and with Prussia 
are nearly copies of each other with this difference, that as the 



442 RUFUS KING. [1793 

Treaty with France is the oldest, those with Hoi. and Prussia 
contain articles asserting that nothing in them shall be construed 
to affect certain stipulations contained in the more ancient Treaty 
between us and Fr. So far as regards the modern usage of 
nations, by which Free ships make free goods, all these Treaties 
affirm the principle. With respect to our comml. Treaty with 
Prussia, after admitting the entire reciprocity of its articles, and 
applauding the humane conduct it prescribes in case of war be 
tween the Parties, we need spend little time in considering it, 
since from the small extent of the Prussian navigation, and the 
rarity of their ships in our seas, it is not likely that any embar 
rassments will arise from the Prussian Treaty. 

"The Dutch Treaty is somewhat more important ; their naviga 
tion is extensive, and they possess American Colonies. We have 
been used to see their Flag in our Ports, and our ships visit as 
well their colonies as the Mother Country. Besides they were our 
friends as well as France, during our struggle for independence, 
and the interest that they took in our affairs involved them in 
a losing war with Great Britain. This Treaty contains an engage 
ment on our part to permit their Privateers and ships of war to 
fit and refit in our ports, their prizes to come, remain and depart 
at pleasure, and to refuse the like offices to any power with whom 
they are at war. But in the article there is a saving that this 
permission and refusal shall not operate against our prior engage 
ments in the Treaty with France. 

" The situation of the U. S. is peculiarly interesting at the present 
juncture. It is, however, satisfactory to observe that but one 
opinion will prevail in respect to the course that we ought to pur 
sue. It was a motive at the same time consolatory and influential in 
establishing the independence of the country, that by an entire 
separation from the Powers of Europe, we should be exempt from 
those calamities and unnecessary wars with which the old world 
is so frequently affected. This consideration was rendered still 
more satisfactory by the reflection that our distance would insure 
us from danger, and that a course of neutrality would not only 
extend our commerce and increase our prosperity, but in con 
sequence thereof, would admonish other nations of the folly and 
misfortune of engaging in frequent wars. 

u It is a little difficult to conceive any possible inducement which 



1793] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 443, 

can draw us into the present war in Europe, while the least obser 
vant must have been struck with the advantages of preserving our 
neutrality. In case of war, we must join France against the rest 
of Europe, or with the allies against France. We have no inter 
est depending on the present war, whatever may be our wishes, 
or on which side of the two we may consider the aggression. 

" The allies complain of three things, the opening of the Scheldt, 
the decree of Fraternityship and the aggrandizing or ambitious 
views of the National Assembly. Whatever may be required to 
preserve the balance of Europe, we have little to apprehend from- 
the last consideration, and, as a nation, nothing to wish or appre 
hend in regard to the other two points. We shall not then engage 
on the side of the Allies. For I take it for granted that we shall 
not join any confederacy to regulate the interior affairs of France.. 
But may we not join France against her enemies? Did she not 
assist us against ours ? Our Government being republican, do we 
not feel a sympathy for the cause in which she is embarked ? 
Are we not bound by Treaty to come to her aid in the W. Indies ? 
And have we not entered into stipulations to admit her ships of 
war and Privateers together with their Prizes, to permit their outfit 
and to allow them to victual their armaments, and have we not 
likewise agreed to refuse these benefits to any Power with whom, 
she is at war ? And will not this state of our connexion neces 
sarily involve us in the quarrel ? 

" I propose to make a slight examination of these queries. 

" It will not be denied that we experienced substantial benefits 
from France in the course of our Revolution ; and it would not 
be handsome to attribute the aids we received to motives irrelative 
to our happiness and success ; although it must be evident that 
the dismemberment of the British Empire was an event to which 
France could not have felt an entire indifference : and although 
we have now ascertained what our most enlightened citizens have 
not doubted, that the assistance of France was an affair of specu 
lation and that she has been uniformly and systematically un 
friendly to the growth of our strength and prosperity. 

" Still the benefits were received, and they leave on the public 
mind a sense of favor ; we therefore feel a partiality for France,, 
and notwithstanding the excesses to which they have proceeded, 
the citizens of the U. S., if they cannot justify, are desirous to 



444 RUFUS KING. [l793 

excuse them. In a more settled and less equivocal state of their 
affairs, we may be able to prove our faithful recollection of the 
assistance of their King by a return of those kind offices, and 
that friendly connexion which our esteem of a great nation will 
naturally inspire. 

"With respect to the second enquiry ; By reason of the diver 
sity between the habits, the religion, the language and the infor 
mation of the two countries, the force of our sympathy is in some 
degree weakened. We naturally entertain good wishes for the 
success of a cause, in maintaining which we ourselves have suf 
fered ; but so many circumstances in the progress of the French 
Revolution have occurred, the explanation of which has not been 
given, and some of which were capable of affecting the innocence 
and purity of the Republican character, that it will hardly be 
deemed adviseable to make a love affair of the French Revolu 
tion, or to engage in war from an excess of sensibility and 
sentiment. 

" The third enquiry respects our guaranty of the Possessions 
of France in the West Indies, concerning which it may be ob 
served (independent of the question how far the Treaty is now 
obligatory which will presently be examined) that the Treaty is 
a defensive one, and purposely affirms to have been made for the 
sole object of establishing the independence of the U. S. ; the 
guaranties are general, may be considered as having expired at 
the conclusion of the war, when the object of the Treaty was 
ascertained by the establishment of the American Independence ; it 
may be further said, admitting the Treaty to be still operative, 
as the alliance is defensive, two points must be clearly established 
before the casus foederis occurs. First the war must be a defen 
sive one on the part of France, or at least France must not be the 
aggressor : secondly, if the first point can be established, France 
must be in a condition to make efforts herself to protect her W. 
India possessions, and must have actually called on us to come 
to their assistance. It does not seem probable that France will 
or can take any measures for the effectual protection of her 
Colonies ; her situation, and indeed her system, would seem to 
forbid it ; hence it is not probable that the requisition would be 
made ; and if it was, the enemies of France command the Ocean, 
performance would be impossible on our part. It has been said 



1793] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 445 

that the National Assembly have decreed their consent to the 
independence of their colonies in the W Indies ; the measure 
would be a wise one, and seems to be suggested from the proba 
ble incapacity of the nation to afford a maritime force sufficient 
to protect their colonies, and in any event the casus fcederis will 
not probably occur and there seems therefore but a slight prob 
ability of our being engaged from this circumstance. 

" The fourth point is somewhat delicate Whether the Treaty 
is or is not executed If the Treaty is supposed to be in force, 
we shall be bound to pursue a course, which, with those who do 
not comprehend and weigh the Law of Nations in respect to what 
is and what is not a violation of neutrality, may be deemed a 
departure from the neutral character, // is so clearly our interest 
to maintain. For in common estimation the obligations of neu 
trality forbid us to afford any succour, or refuge, or hospitality to 
one of the Powers at war which we deny to the other, and the 
popular opinion on this point is that our treatment should be 
wholly indifferent and without preference of either Power. This 
sentiment is notwithstanding not altogether correct ; and although 
it is sustained by a species of natural equity, still the Law of 
Nations will clearly authorize a different conduct ; Nations as 
well as individuals are bound by their bargains, and justice 
requires that they should perform them. Two nations enter into 
engagements to afford a neutral succour in case either should be 
engaged in war ; justice and good faith require the performance 
of the engagement, and the enemy of the ally has no right 
to deem such succour to be a breach of strict neutrality. 
This case has frequently happened among the European Powers 
and particularly with the Swiss, and it has never been esteemed 
to be a violation of neutrality, nor a cause of offence to the enemy 
of the ally who has received the succour. So that in case our 
Treaty with France should be considered to be still in force, the 
permitting her Privateers to refit and victual and their prizes to 
be brought in and sold, and the denial of these rights to Great 
Br. and Holland would not be a violation of our neutrality, since 
this course is required by a Treaty entered into before the war 
by France and her present antagonists. 

"JBut, in order to ascertain the force of the Treaties between the 
U. S. and France, it may be permitted to pay some attention to 



446 XUFUS KING, [i793 

the evidence for and against the sincerity and good faith of 
France, in respect to the stipulations which these Treaties contain 
in our favor. He must have paid slight attention to the History 
of Treaties between nations, who does not know that ambition 
and interest have generally prevailed over the force of obligation, 
and that Treaties have been observed, not according to their in 
trinsic meaning and force, but merely as has comported with what 
has been deemed convenient or otherwise to the nations. This 
observation is by no means intended as recommending to the U. 
S. an imitation of the numerous examples of the convenient viola 
tion of Treaties, but with another view. Although the Treaties 
with France were made with good faith on our part, and have been 
honestly observed by us, still if the same good faith did not exist 
on the part of France, and if we have evidence of this want of in 
tegrity in the subsequent conduct of the French monarchy, respect 
ing the stipulations contained in these Treaties, then it will proba 
bly be agreed that the U.S. may or may not adhere to these Treaties 
as they shall prefer. For it is understood to be a principle in the 
Law of Nations that, the articles of a Treaty being conditional, 
"if they are violated by one party even in a single article, the other 
party is at liberty to renounce the Treaty and hold it to be void. 

" Although France would not permit to the U. S. a partnership 
in her right to fish on the Banks of New Foundland, yet by the 
spirit of the Treaty, she ought to have assisted us in ascertaining 
and establishing a participation with Great Britain. But, instead 
of this aid, it is believed that the Court were opposed to our hav 
ing a share in the great fisheries of New Foundland, and that 
measures were not spared to disappoint us in our reasonable 
rights. 

" By the Treaty of Alliance, France relinquished all pretensions 
to the territory which composed the British colonies at the peace 
of 1763, and by the spirit of the alliance she is restrained from 
taking any part which might curtail our reasonable pretensions 
in the subject of Boundary. But it is believed that France gave 
us obstructions on this important point, and that she was desir 
ous to have given the Ohio as frontier and a western line far 
short of the East Bank of the Mississippi as a boundary. 

" By the Treaty of Commerce France was bound to employ her 
offices and interposition in our favor with the Barbary 



1793] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 447 

Powers. But although her consul was well received and of great 
influence at Algiers, it is believed that he by no means assisted 
the expensive efforts made by the U. S. to obtain peace with that 
Regency, and that when the French Ministry have been applied to, 
they have never spoken offensively in reply, but have condescend 
ingly recommended the employment of an order of monks, who 
have devoted themselves (when well paid) to redeem Christian 
captives from the power of the Infidel. 

" By the Treaty of Alliance France was bound to guaranty to 
the U. S. the possession of their entire territory, but the Posts, 
confessedly within that territory, have remained for more than 
nine years out of the possession of the U. S. 

" By the Treaty of commerce France was bound to prohibit the 
Privateers of any foreign power arming, selling, or exchanging 
their Prizes, or victualing, except in a manner sufficient to carry 
them to the next port of their nation, in their ports. But by the 
1 6th Article of the Treaty of Commerce with England, she has 
formed with that nation a stipulation of the same import, without 
excepting the U. S., whereby the stipulation with the U. S., so far 
as respects any controversy with England, is rendered totally void. 

" By the tenor of the Treaties of Com. and Alliance, France was 
bound as a faithful Ally to exert her good offices and friendship 
in favor of the U. S. in increasing the stability of their govern 
ment, extending their commerce and assisting their prosperity. 
But independent of the points above suggested, which, if well 
founded, have been of an opposite tendency, we are now, by the 
report of Mr. Le Brun, the minister of For. Affairs of the present 
Government, informed that by examining the instructions hereto 
fore given by the Ministry of the late King respecting the U. S., 
that at the time when the friendship and good faith of America, 
was unequivocal, Vergennes and Montmorin thought that it was 
not suitable, &amp;c. * 

* " Thus the present Government of France declares the conduct of the mon 
archy to have been such as by the Law of Nations would make the Treaty void ; 
and indeed it appears to be an object with the National Convention to consider 
the Treaties with America, as they have done all other Treaties of their mon 
archy, as void. And this not because they may hold it impolitick to be allied 
with the U.S., but from an opinion that new and more beneficial, and 
perhaps less burthensome connexions may be formed than have heretofore 
subsisted. Influenced by these considerations is it not probable that Mr. 



448 KUFUS A ING. [i793 

" If this want of good faith has vitiated the Treaty and put it 
within the power of the U. S. to renounce the same, what motive 
should restrain us, presuming that the landed as well as the 
commercial interests of the country are united in the opinion that 
neutrality and peace are at this period of inestimable value, and 
that, if we can consistently with public faith and national honor 
keep out of the war, it is peculiarly our duty to do so, by a course 
of impartiality, we shall maintain peace, by an opposite conduct 
we may be forced into the war. 

" It is a subject more important than has occurred since the 
completion of our federal Government, and will not therefore fail 
to produce the most profound reflexion in the mind of the 
supreme Executive. It should not be conceived from any thing 
which has been said, that it is desired to disembarrass ourselves 
with France in order to afford favors to, or to form new ties or 
connexions with other nations. There are few Americans who 
can, or wish to, forget the assistance we received from France, 
and it is presumed that such Treaties may be formed between 
the two nations as may consist with their mutual interests. But 
the wisdom of our Executive will decide how far the present 
moment is suitable for the formation of such alliances. 

u One sentiment, however, on the subject of foreign alliances 
and commercial treaties deserves consideration and is suggested 
by the present state of the nation. The prospect now before us 
manifests the value of our neutrality both in respect to the in 
creased price of our produce, and also the demand for our ships 
hence an admonition to avoid in our foreign alliances and 
treaties all those articles which by affording preferences in war, 
have a direct and certain tendency to destroy our neutrality by 
involving us eventually in war. At present all Europe is likely 
to be engaged in a sharp and bloody war its duration must 
be mere conjecture. 

" If we maintain our neutrality, our farmers will reap a golden 
harvest, and our Flag, while floating on every sea, will enrich our 
merchants and extend and assist in the establishment of our 
national fame and wisdom." 

Genet, who has lately arrived as Minister from that Country, will propose to 
our Government to enter into alliance with France, without regarding the for 
mer Treaties, or even suggesting the propriety of their continuance." 



1793] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 449 

Undeterred by the disavowel of and by the determined 
opposition of the government against his acts, and by the 
orders of the President issued to put a stop to his illegal 
proceedings, defying the processes of the law, the French 
ambassador and his friends sought in every way by publica 
tion and overt acts to inflame the public mind against the 
stand taken by the government, even threatening to appeal 
from the President to the people. The papers, which fol 
low, will tell the history of these attempts which in the 
end resulted in his dismissal by his own government from 
the position he held, and his retirement to private life in the 
United States. 

* " Every nation is bound to respect itself, and it owes it to its 
own dignity to punish offences against its authority, whether com 
mitted by its citizens or by foreigners. Every nation is likewise 
obliged to regard the interests, and to avoid a violation of the 
rights, of other nations ; and in case her citizens or foreigners^ 
inhabiting her territory, make depredations on the property of 
other nations, and infringe their rights, it behoves the nation 
not only to disavow, but to punish such transgressors. These 
principles constitute the elements of the social compact, and their 
observance is not less enjoined by sound morality than by those 
maxims of the law of nations, which regulate the good corre 
spondence, and are so truly calculated to preserve the peace and 
independence, of nations. 

" Conformable to these principles, we have reason to be satis 
fied that the President, after carefully examining the treaties sub 
sisting between the U. S. and foreign nations, decided that we 
are not bound by Treaty to permit any foreign power originally 
to equip and make privateers in our ports and that the laws of 
nations declare such equipments to be repugnant to the obliga 
tions of peace and neutrality. 

"Among the various irregularities which not only offend the 
nation within which they happen, but also furnish their friends 
and neighbours with just ground of complaint, none are less ex 
cusable, and more offensive, than the practice of making war for 

* Rufus King s manuscript. 



450 RUFUS KING. [1793 

the sake of plunder. Indeed it is greatly to be wished that this 
practice was altogether abolished among modern nations. Its 
pernicious effects upon morals, its influence in destroying those 
salutary habits of thinking, which teach us to regard with religious 
abstinence the property of others, and the private and unmerited 
misery into which it frequently plunges families, exemplary for 
their industry and virtue, may be enumerated among the unhappy 
consequences of this doubtful species of warfare. 

" It would be an example worthy of a great and magnanimous 
nation to decree its abolition. This, however, is rather the sub 
ject of virtuous hope, than of reasonable expectation. 

" Being in peace with all the world, it is incumbent on our 
citizens to decline engaging in acts of hostility, and on our 
Government to deny to each of the Powers at war an asylum for 
the purpose of forming military enterprizes by land or water 
against their armies. In opposition to these duties, the Minister 
of France has asserted and insists on a Right derived to France 
from the 22d article of the Treaty, &amp;c., originally to equip priva 
teers in our ports. Our Executive has decided that France has 
no such Right in virtue of the Treaty, and that neither that 
Power, nor any other shall endanger our peace by making such 
equipments within our Jurisdiction. In a former paper the 
grounds of this decision were examined and it was shown to be 
conformable to the only rational meaning of the Treaty, and 
agreeable to the interpretation which France herself had already 
given to the same article. 

" After exposing the claim of France to the Executive and re 
ceiving an answer denying its validity, the only proper course to 
have been taken by the French Minister was totally to have ab 
stained from attempting a practical violation of the decision of the 
Executive, and to have represented the answer to his nation, and 
waited for their farther instructions. This course would have 
proved the regards of the Minister for the mutual interest of the 
two countries, his knowledge of those rules which regulate the 
conduct of forn. Agents, and at the same time have demon 
strated that respect for our Government which is so justly due 
from the Minister of a nation contending for liberty, to the 
Representatives of the freest and happiest nation on Earth. Un 
happily a conduct in all respects different, and in every way 



1793] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 451 

inexcusable has been pursued by the Minister to France. For 
getting that the protection which the Law of Nations confers on 
public ministers, proceeds upon the sentiment that their conduct 
is regulated by those maxims which forbid a violation of the laws 
-of the country where they reside, to which they are deputed, the 
behavior of the minister of France is without precedent and, it is 
believed, will be disavowed by his nation. 

" In defiance of the authority of our laws, in contempt of our 
excellent Constitution which deposits the executive authority of 
the nation in the virtuous hands of the President, and with views 
altogether repugnant to the peace of our Country, he has persisted 
in equipping, and has actually fitted out, commissioned and sent 
to cruize on the high seas several Privateers. The equipment of 
these Privateers, and the raising and arming their several com 
panies within our Jurisdiction, being unauthorized by our 
national authority, which alone could permit the same, must be 
viewed, not only as affrontive to our Government but illegal and 
void. The property which they may seize and bring within our 
territory, must by our laws be considered as illegally taken and 
detained, and the proprietors of consequence entitled to posses 
sion of it. 

" The whole transaction being forcible, the association being 
-composed of armed men, the force actually subsisting and being 
found within our Jurisdiction, the property captured being found 
in the hands of an illegal assembly of armed men ; in short the 
case being public, clear, and flagrant, the power charged with the 
execution of the laws, was bound without delay, with the force of 
the militia to suppress and dissipate such illegal confederacies, 
and to restore to the true owner all property found in their 
possession. 

" The right to interfere for the purpose of suppressing such 
illegal and foreign combinations and to restore the plunder found 
in their hands is derived from those laws which enjoin upon the 
nation a conduct friendly and impartial to all the belligerent 
powers ; the right of interference by the President is founded on 
the nature of his office, charged with the execution of the laws of 
peace and neutrality, and bound to resist all high handed and 
violent invasions of the laws and Jurisdiction of the country by 
foreign nations. 



452 XUFUS KING. [*793 

" The equipment of the Carmagnole was an offence not only 
agt the U. S., since it violated the essential laws of our national 
sovereignty ; but it was also an injury to all the Powers at war 
with France, with whom we are at peace, and being committed 
within our Jurisdiction, we were bound for this twofold reason 
not to suffer the measure to pass unnoticed. So far as the pun 
ishment of the individuals concerned in this offence (and there 
can be no doubt that they are liable to punishment, whether citi 
zens or foreigners) the judiciary authority is alone competent. 
But with regard to the Privateer and her Prizes, the case being 
clear, public and flagrantly illegal, the agency of the Judiciary 
was not requisite, and the executive power might well interpose 
to prevent a repetition of the offence by suppressing the 
Privateer and restoring the vessels captured to their true pro 
prietors. 

" The equipment within our Jurisdiction being illegal, the cap 
tures were also illegal and void, and the magistrates charged with 
the execution of the law, were bound in a case thus evident and 
public to cause summary and expeditious justice to be done to 
individuals by restoring their property taken without authority 
and against law, and to the nation by suppressing an armed Force, 
collected in defiance of its authority. 

" The just ground of executive interference appears then to be 
this ; that an armed force was levied within our country, not only 
without the permission of the nation but in direct violation of its 
laws ; that this Force had violently seized on persons and prop 
erty and brought them within our Jurisdiction, whereby our laws 
such seizure and detention are altogether illegal and void ; that 
from the nature of the transaction a complete remedy to the per 
son injured must be summary, and in order effectually to prevent 
future injuries, the executive power, aided by a competent force 
ought without delay to suppress the military force collected and 
subsisting within our country in defiance of our sovereignty. 

" It is required that a Precedent should be produced which 
will support the transaction. It is a little mortifying to our 
national character to reflect that this requisition shd. be made ; 
since the want of the sanction required, proves that a measure so 
highly disrespectful, as the one resisted by our Executive, has 
perhaps never before been attempted by the emissaries of any 



1 793J LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 453 

foreign nation. It is boldly said by the advocates of France that 
the Americans were permitted by France to fit out and equip 
Privateers in their ports during our revolutionary war. But this 
assertion, so far as it regards the end for which it is made, wants 
proof. Nay, it can be disproved by indubitable authority We 
should distinguish between two friends, one after the commence 
ment of the revolutionary war and before France was engaged, 
the other during the same war, but after France had engaged. 
It is not true that France permitted the Americans originally to 
equip Privateers in her ports, or to arm those which had been 
elsewhere equipped, or even to sell their Prizes there, during the 
first period. Because during this period, the treaty of Utrecht 
was in full force between France and England, and, tho enfor 
cing the law of nations, contained stipulations, by wh. France was 
bound to prevent any force at war with England from arming 
Privateers or selling Prizes in the ports of France. 

" As soon as the war broke out between France and England, 
the Treaty of Utrecht ceased to operate, and the Treaty, eventual 
and defensive, between France and the U. S. commenced its 
operation. By this Treaty France and the U. S. became asso 
ciates in the war and were bound to open their respective ports 
to each other, for all the purposes of the common war. Any one 
who is not informed of this distinction, is referred to the Treaties 
subsisting between France and England in the year 1775, and 
particularly to the manifesto published at Paris in 1779, display 
ing the motives and conduct of his most Ch. Majesty towards 
England. In that document are these words, As a consequence 
of the amicable part thus taken by his Majesty (the Christian 
King) he interdicted the American Privateers from arming in his 
ports, he would neither suffer them to sell their Prizes, nor to 
remain one moment longer in the ports of France than was con 
sistent with the stipulations of the above Treaty (that of Utrecht) : 
his Majesty strictly enjoined his subjects not to purchase such 
prizes, and in case of disobedience, they were threatened with 
confiscation. And afterwards in another State Paper entitled 
observations on, &amp;c., published by the royal authority at Paris we 
have these expressions He (the King) prohibited the American 
Privateers to sell their prizes in France and his subjects to pur 
chase them ; and he did not permit these Privateers to remain in 



454 RUFUS KING. [1795, 

the ports of his Kingdom, but the time prescribed by the Treaty 
of Utrecht, and under the express conditions laid down in this 
Treaty. 

" This last State paper contains in a note an account of the pro 
cedures of France in two instances of irregular conduct of Ameri- 
can Privateers. How far the proceedings of France in these 
instances, where the offence was comparatively trivial, will con 
stitute precedents in support of the measures of our Government, 
will be best determined by those, who candidly examine and com 
pare the different cases."

Statement of Genet s Threat His Denial that Genet had made it to him 
Evidence that Mr. Dallas had reported the Statement Effect of this 
Threat on public Sentiment Statement by R. King. 

A. HAMILTON TO R. KING.* 

PHILADELPHIA, August 13, 1793. 
DEAR SIR : 

The post of today brought me your letter of the loth, but I was 
too much engaged to reply to it by return of post. 

The facts with regard to Mr. Genet s threat, to appeal from the 
President to the People, stand thus. 

On Saturday, the 6th of July, the warden of this port reported to 
Governor Mifflin that the Brig Little Sarah, since called the Petit 
Democrat (an English merchant vessel, mounting from two to four 
guns, taken off our coast by the French frigate, the Ambuscade, and 
brought into this port) had very materially augmented her military 
equipments j having then fourteen iron cannon and six swivels 
mounted j and it being understood that her crew was to consist of one 
hundred and twenty men. 

Governor Mifflin, in consequence of this information, sent Mr. 
Dallas to Mr. Genet, to endeavor to prevail upon him to enter into an 
arrangement for detaining the vessel in port, without the necessity of 
employing for that purpose military force. 

Mr. Dallas reported to Governor Mifflin, that Mr. Genet had 
absolutely refused to do what had been requested of him ; that he had 
been very angry and intemperate ; that he had complained of ill-treat 
ment from the Government, and had declared that " he would appeal 
* Hamilton s Works, vol. v., p. 574. 
455 



456 RUFUS KING. [i793 

from the President to the people " ; mentioned his expectation of the 
arrival of three ships of the line observing that he would know 
how to do justice to his country, or, at least, he had a frigate at 
his command and could easily withdraw himself from this ; said 
that he would not advise an attempt to take possession of the vessel, as 
it would be resisted. 

The refusal was so peremptory, that Governor Mifflin, in con 
sequence of it, ordered out 120 men for the purpose of taking 
possession of the vessel. 

The conversation between Genet and Dallas was, in toto, 
repeated by Governor Mifflin to General Knox the day following, 
and the day after that he confirmed to me the declaration with 
regard to appealing to the people ; owned that something like the 
threat to do justice to his country, by means of the ships of the 
line, was thrown out by Mr. Genet, but showed an unwillingness 
to be explicit on this point, objecting to a more particular disclo 
sure, that it would tend to bring Mr. Dallas into a scrape. 

Mr. Jefferson, on Sunday, went to Mr. Genet, to endeavor to 
prevail upon him to detain the Petit Democrat till the President could 
return and decide the case ; but as Mr. Jefferson afterwards com 
municated, he absolutely refused to give a promise of the kind, saying, 
only, that he would not probably be ready to depart before the succeed 
ing Wednesday, the day of the President s expected return. This, 
however, Mr. Jefferson construed into an intimation that she would 
remain. Mr. Jefferson also informed that Mr. Genet had been 
very unreasonable and intemperate in his conversation (though 
he did not descend to particulars), and that Dallas had likewise 
told him (Mr. Jefferson) that Genet had declared he would appeal 
from the President to the people. 

The Petit Democrat instead of remaining as Mr. Jefferson had 
concluded, fell down to Chester, previous to the Wednesday referred 
to, where she was when the President returned. A letter was writ 
ten to Mr. Genet, by order of the President, informing him that the 
case of the vessel, among others, was under consideration, and desir 
ing that she might be detained until he should come to a decision about 
her ; but this requisition was disregarded. She departed in de 
fiance of it. 

I give you the detail, that you may have the whole subject 
before you ; but I cannot give you leave to make use of it all. 



1793] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 457 

The circumstances of the letter may be omitted. It may be said, 
generally that a requisition was made of Mr. Genet, by order of 
the President, for the detention of the vessel. All that part, 
however, which is scored or underlined, may be freely made up. 
This part is so circumstanced as to take away all scruples of 
personal or political delicacy. T is not so with the rest. It can 
therefore only be confidentially disclosed to persons whose dis 
cretion may be relied on, and whose knowledge of it may be 
useful. 

It is true (as you have heard) that things, if possible still more 
insulting, have since been done by Mr. Genet; but of this, at 
present, no use can be made, no more than of some antecedent 
transactions nearly if not quite as exceptional. The mass would 
confound Mr. Genet and his associates. Perhaps it may not be 
long before a promulgation of it will take place. 

I am of opinion with you that the charge ought to be insisted 
upon. Yours, 

A. HAMILTON. 

P. S. It is to be observed that the equipments of the Petit 
Democrat are, in the strictest sense, an original fitting out. She 
was before a merchant vessel ; here she was converted into a 
vessel commissioned for war, of considerable force. 



A. HAMILTON TO R. KING, ESQ. 
MY DR. SIR : 

It is not yet finally determined that there shall be a publication 
&amp; there has been some difference of opinion on the point. But 
it seems to me the publication of the letter renders it indispensa 
ble that the whole story should be told. Yet when it appears it 
will probably include only what is regularly official ; so that the 
present question may be pursued independently. 

Perhaps you will not think it necessary at first to say to whom 
Dallas reported the conversation. Yet if you deem it essential, 
it may be done, &amp; should it be finally necessary, which is not at 
all probable, General Knox &amp; myself will come forward as 
Witnesses. Yours truly, 

A. HAMILTON.

FOR THE DAILY ADVERTISER. 

Dec. 2, 1793. 

To THE PUBLIC : 

Although well constituted free governments only can give and 
preserve to men the enjoyment of national liberty, yet no govern 
ment can liberate individuals from the impulse and domination 
of their passions. Hence it is that the excesses of these passions so 
frequently produce Parties in all communities, and that personal 
motives are so often found to be masked by patriotic pro 
fessions. 

While the people continue enlightened and watchful, they may 
experience inconveniences from such parties ; but most alarming 
are the mischiefs they cause, whenever they become seduced, 
infected and inflamed by foreign influence. 

The history of mankind has in all ages declared and proved 
that foreign influence is the most subtle and fatal Poison, that 
can be communicated to a nation ; for numerous and melancholy 
are the instances of great and powerful and once happy States, 
who under its operation have either expired in violent convul 
sions, or been reduced to a deplorable state of debility and 
insignificance. 

When at Philadelphia in July last, we frequently heard that 
Mr. Genet, the French Minister, had on a certain occasion said : 
" that he would appeal from the President to the People " an 
appeal by a foreign minister from the President to the People 
appeared to us both a serious and alarming measure ; that a 
foreign minister, finding it impossible to bend the Government to 
his purposes, should turn from it with disdain to the Citizens at 
large, and before them impeach the wisdom or virtue of the ad 
ministration, would be a proceeding unprecedented and unper- 
mitted in every well policed state ; it would be a proceeding 
evidently and necessarily productive of parties, practises and in 
trigues, highly detrimental to the peace and independence of the 
country ; and in a variety of respects offensive to the dignity and 
sovereignty of the nation as well as humiliating and injurious to 
its constituted authorities. 

We left the City well convinced that Mr. Genet had made such 
a declaration. On our return to New York, v, r e found a report 



1793] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 459 

of that declaration had preceded us, and that it had made the 
same impression upon others, that it had made upon us. We 
were asked whether it was true. We answered that it was. To. 
many a declaration so extraordinary did not appear probable, 
and our having asserted it to be true was questioned. We were 
called upon in the public papers to admit or deny, that we had 
made such an assertion. That call merited attention, and we 
thereupon made the following publication : 

FOR THE DIARY. 

MESSRS. PRINTERS : 

Certain late publications render it proper for us to authorize 
you to inform the public, that a report having reached this City 
from Philadelphia that Mr. Genet, the French Minister, said that 
he would appeal to the people from certain decisions of the 
President ; we were asked on our return to that place, whether 
he had made such a declaration ; we answered that he had, and 
we also mentioned it to others, authorising them to say that we 
had so informed them. 

JOHN JAY. 

RUFUS KING. 
NEW YORK, August 12, 1793. 

Of the time, place, occasion and other circumstances relative 
to the transaction, we omitted to give any account ; although we 
found it necessary for the reasons before mentioned, to avow our 
having mentioned that declaration as having really been made ; 
yet we had no desire, or intention to come forward as the prose 
cutors of the French Minister before the tribunal of the Public. 

In common with other free citizens of a sovereign and indepen 
dent nation, we spoke our sentiments ; but we were mindful, that 
to the government and not to us belonged the task of taking such 
measures relative to that Minister, and his conduct, as the interest 
and honor of the nation might require. Nor did we deem it 
necessary to detail and explain the evidence on which we rested 
our assertion ; for while that assertion remained undenied and 
uncontradicted by the Minister, such a step could neither be 
requisite nor proper to anonymous writers on the subject in the 
public papers we paid no attention, nor shall we in future pay 
any. 



460 RUFUS KING. [*793 

On the singular letter written by the Minister to the President, 
and the answer through the Secretary of State, we restrain ourselves 
to this remark, that it only denies his having made such a declara 
tion to the President ; and that it leaves the question whether he 
had made it at all entirely out of sight. It seems that this did 
not escape the discernment of the President ; for he very justly 
observed "that whether the declaration was made to him, or 
others, was perhaps immaterial " to whom the declaration was 
made was a question foreign to the inquiry, the true, and only 
question being whether he had made such a declaration to any 
body. To this question the Minister gave no answer, and thereby 
left the credit of our assertion not only unimpeached, but also 
strengthened by his silence and by his endeavours to elude the 
force of it by his letter to the President. 

He now denies having made such a declaration ; in what light 
this denial is to be viewed, will appear from the following state 
ment of the evidence and circumstances relative to the transac 
tion in question. 

The President having given instruction to the Governors of the 
several States relative to the fitting out of armed vessels in our 
ports, by any of the belligerent powers, on Saturday the 6th of 
July last, the warden of the port of Philadelphia reported to 
Gov. Mifflin, that the Brig Little Sarah, since called the Petit 
Democrat (an English merchant vessel mounting from two to four 
guns, taken off our coast and carried into that port by the French 
Frigate Ambuscade), had materially augmented her military equip 
ments ; having then fourteen iron cannons and six swivels mounted ; 
and it being understood that her crew was to consist (including 
officers, men and boys) of one hundred and twenty. 

Governor Mifflin, in consequence of this information, sent Mr. 
Secretary Dallas to Mr. Genet to endeavour to prevail upon him 
to enter into an arrangement for detaining the vessel in port 
without the necessity of employing military force for that purpose. 

Mr. Dallas reported to Governor Mifflin that Mr. Genet had 
absolutely refused to do what had been requested of him ; that he 
had been angry and intemperate ; that he had complained of 
ill-treatment from the government ; and had declared " that he 
would appeal from the President to the People" ; and that he had 



1793] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 461 

also said that he would not advise an attempt to take possession 
of the vessel, as it would be resisted. 

The refusal was so peremptory that Governor Mifflin, in conse 
quence of it, ordered out one hundred and twenty men for the 
purpose of taking possession of the vessel. Mr. Dallas likewise 
communicated to Mr. Jefferson that Mr. Genet had said " that 
he would appeal from the President to the People." 

On Sunday the seventh of July, Mr. Jefferson went to Mr. 
Genet to endeavour to prevail upon him to detain the Petit 
Democrat till the President (who was then absent) should return 
and decide upon the case ; but he refused to give a promise, saying 
only she would not probably be ready to depart before the suc 
ceeding Wednesday, the day of the President s expected return. 
This was considered by Mr. Jefferson as an intimation that she 
would remain. The Petit Democrat, instead of remaining as Mr. 
Jefferson had expected, fell down to Chester previous to trie- 
Wednesday referred to ; and shortly after sailed out of the 
Delaware. 

For the truth and accuracy of this statement, we refer to Mr. 
Secretary Hamilton and Mr. Secretary Knox, from whom we 
derived the information, on which we relied, respecting the facts 
contained in it. We forbear enlarging this publication by any 
strictures or remarks on the Minister s conduct. We will only say 
that we sincerely wish all the peace, liberty and good government 
to his country ; and that we shall always deprecate and oppose 
the interference of foreign powers or foreign agents in the politics 
and affairs of our own.

We, the subscribers, certify that we did severally communi

ticulars contained in the foregoing statement. That such of them 
as are therein mentioned to have been reported to Governor

each of us as having been received by him from Mr. Dallas. 
That such of them as respect Mr. Jefferson, including the infor-

ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 

H. KNOX. 

* It may be deemed superfluous to add Remarks to the Docu 
ments before the Public, respecting the interview between Mr. 
Genet and Mr. Dallas, but a short address in your paper of Wed 
nesday last, presumed to be from Mr. Dallas, seems intended to 
induce an opinion that neither Mr. Jefferson nor Governor Mifflin 
could affirm the certificate of Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Knox. Such 
an opinion ought not to be entertained ; and it is believed that 
whatever Mr. Dallas statement of the interview in question be 
supposed to prove, it will by no means disprove his former decla 
ration that Mr. Genet had said that he would appeal from the 
President to the People. 

In order that a more correct view may be exhibited of Mr. 
Dallas apostacy, a short history of the Transaction in question 
shall be here given. Mr. Dallas was dispatched by Gov. Mifflin 
to the French Minister to induce him to consent to an arrange 
ment respecting the armed vessel, the little Democrat, which 
would prevent the employment of military force. So far as we 
are acquainted with what passed at this interview, the scene was a 
little turbulent on the part of the Minister, and Mr. Dallas 
returned without effecting the object of his Mission. Mr. Dallas 
made his report to Gov. Mifflin, and accompanied by the Governor 
likewise reported what had passed at the interview between him 
&amp; the French Minister to Mr. Jefferson. Previous to Mr. Dallas 
report to Mr. Jefferson, the latter had himself gone to the French 
Minister for the purpose of making an arrangement with him 
respecting the detention of the little Democrat. At this interview 
it seems a scene took place nearly similar to that which had 
occurred at the interview with Mr. Dallas. 

The circumstances of the interview of Mr. Dallas on Saturday 
evening, and of Mr. Jefferson on Sunday morning, when recited 

* The article to which this statement of R. King s refers must have been 
published before Mr. Dallas s letter of Dec. nth. 



1793] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 463 

by Mr. Dallas and Mr. Jefferson in the presence of each other 
and before Gov. Mifflin, were found to agree in many particulars, 
but to diverge in force ; and thus early, on the day after the 
evening of the interview between Mr. Dallas and the French 
Minister, and immediately after the interview between him and 
Mr. Jefferson, this difference of what passed was noticed and 
remarked, viz that Mr. Genet had said to Mr. D. that he would 
appeal from the Pr. to the People, but that he did not make the 
same declaration at the interview with Mr. Jefferson. 

Mr. Jefferson reduced to writing what had passed at his inter 
view with the Fr. Min. and likewise what Mr. Dallas had reported 
to have occurred in his, noticing virtually that the declaration of 
an appeal to the People was made to Dallas and not to him. This 
official document is dated on the nth of July being the third day 
after the comparison made in the presence of Gov. Mifflin by Mr. 
Jefferson and Mr. Dallas of what had passed at their several inter 
views with the French Minister. That this statement is correct is 
proved by the following extract of Mr. Jefferson s official report 
above referred to, viz * 

Contemporaneous proofs, and more especially such as carry 
with them evidence of critical attention and discrimination, when 
unattended with the sanction of names of authority, merit the 
highest regard : and when placed in opposition to a posterior 
relation of the same transaction even by equally credible characters 
demand superior credit. The above statement by Mr. Jefferson 
is of this character. It is contemporary with the transaction 
which it relates ; it is from an authority of the greatest truth and 
precision ; and moreover instead of a mere distant recollection, is 
part of a report made in the course of official duty and under the 
obligation of an oath. By this document it is proved, as well as 
by Mr. Jefferson s declaration to Mr. H. and Mr. K., that Mr. 
Dallas on the day following the evening of his interview with Mr. 
Genet, did declare to Mr. Jefferson, that the French Minister did 
say that he would appeal &amp;c. Mr. Jefferson s authority from all 

* " On repeating to him (the Governor) and Mr. Dallas what Mr. Genet had 
said, we found that it agreed in many particulars with what he had said to Mr. 
Dallas ; but Mr. Dallas mentioned some things, which he had not said to me, 
and, particularly, his declaration that he would appeal from the President to the 
People." 



464 RUFUS KING. [i793 

those considerations which sway the mind in yielding its assent, 
insured a belief that what he said was true. His official report of 
this declaration must have influenced the mind of the Pr., and 
led him to have given the answer he did to the letter which the 
French Minister addressed to him on this subject. No one doubted 
that the declaration was made. The French Minister first denied 
that he made it to the President, which was never alleged. He 
next in a letter to Gov. Moultrie talked of analising to Congress 
the pretended threat, and by the agency of his partizans adopted 
various measures to extenuate, to qualify, and to explain away the 
otTensiveness of a declaration, which not even diplomatic courage 
was yet prepared to deny. Two months and more had elapsed 
after the declaration in question before Mr. Dallas arrived at Mr. 
Genet s residence in New York During this interval it had be 
come obvious to the Minister that the People of America knew 
too well the value of their Government tamely to witness the 
degradation to which it was exposed. What had passed between 
the French Minister and Mr. Dallas is not revealed, what followed 
their meeting is a matter of public notoriety. The French Min 
ister publishes in the newspapers his letters to the Attorney 
General and Mr. Jefferson in which he affirms the report of his 
having said that &amp;c. Mr. Dallas in due time backs the Minister 
by his solemn declaration that Mr. Genet never told him &amp;c. 

On the 7th of July, being the day following the evening of the 
interview between the French Minister and Mr. Dallas the latter 
in an official report informed Mr. Jefferson that the French Min 
ister had said, that, &amp;c with care and criticism. Mr. Jefferson 
soon after reduced to writing Mr. Dallas report in which Mr. 
Jefferson affirms that Mr. Dallas so stated the declaration of the 
Minister of France. Mr. Dallas now unblushingly affirms that 
Mr. Genet never told him that, &amp;c, both Mr. Dallas declarations 
cannot be true because they are in direct opposition. 

FROM THE AMERICAN MINERVA, 
N. Y., Dec. n, 1793. 

MR. A. J, DALLAS STATEMENT TO THE PUBLIC. 
Agreeably to the promise that was published on the 6th instant, 
I shall now proceed to declare the facts, relating to Mr. Genet s 
conversation with me, in the case of the Little Democrat. 



1793] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 465 

I feel indeed the indelicacy of disclosing what may appear, in 
some respects to be an official, and, in others, a private communi 
cation ; but the anxiety which the public mind has experienced 
on the subject ; the misapprehensions, which have prevailed ; 
and the example which is derived from the conduct of all other 
persons who have been involved in the discussion ; will, I think, 
be deemed a sufficient justification of the liberty that I find it 
necessary to take. 

Late in the evening of Saturday, the day of July last, I 

was informed that the Little Democrat (whose warlike equip 
ments, in opposition to the declared neutrality of the port had 
before attracted the attention of the Government) would sail in 
the course of the ensuing morning. Having immediately com 
municated this information to the governor, I received instruc 
tions to prepare for calling out a party of the militia, to prevent 
at all events the departure of the vessel ; but on my suggesting 
that the necessity of pursuing hostile measures might probably be 
superseded, by an application to the discretion of the French 
Minister, I was directed to wait upon that gentleman, with an 
overture of an amicable arrangement, before the party should be 
summoned to parade. 

It was about n o clock at night, when I arrived at Mr. Genet s 
house. Mr. Paschall withdrew from the room, into which I was 
introduced, soon after I entered it ; but Mr. Bournonville and 
Mr. Dupont remained there during the whole of my visit. I 
apologised for so unseasonable an intrusion ; and lamented that 
my errand was not of an agreeable import. I stated the nature, 
extent and obligation of the instruction, which the governor had 
received from the President, for the purpose of preserving the 
neutrality of the United States, within the jurisdiction of Penn 
sylvania ; and I described the circumstances, that rendered the 
Little Democrat an object of those instructions, as well as the 
recent intelligence of her intention to leave the port, which the 
governor was bound to prevent. I mentioned, however, that the 
governor was desirous to avoid the use of any compulsory means 
on the occasion, and, therefore, as the allegation, which had been 
made, that the vessel belonged to the Republic of France, and 
not to individuals, might produce an exception from the general 
rule, in her favour, he would cheerfully rely on the minister s 

VOL. I. 30 



466 RUFUS KING. [1793 

engagement, that she should not depart, till there was an opportu 
nity of consulting the President (who was then, I believe, on his 
way from Mount Vernon to the City of Philadelphia) upon the 
merits of this particular case. 

This representation was scarcely delivered when Mr. Genet ex 
claimed with great vehemence " that the proceeding was very 
extraordinary, improper and unjust. He thought that his uniform 
acquiescence in the wishes of the government (instanced in the 
surrender of the Grange, &amp;c) had not merited this return, which, 
he said, however, should regulate his conduct in future. He ex 
pressed surprize that the first intimation which was given of the 
matter, should be accompanied with a threat. He complained in 
strong terms, and with many angry epithets, of the ill treatment 
he had received from some of the officers of the government, 
which he contrasted with the cordial attachment that was ex 
pressed by the people at large for his nation. He ascribed the 
conduct of those officers to principles inimical to the cause of 
France and liberty. He expressed apprehensions that, owing to 
their influence, the President had, in that respect, been misled. 
He observed with a considerable emphasis that the President was 
not the sovereign of the country, for he could not legislate on gen 
eral subjects ; nor could he declare war, or make peace ; that 
Congress, the depository of those powers, was the only consti 
tuted body, that could, on the part of the United States, give a 
constitutional interpretation (possibly involving the question of 
war or peace) to the terms of the treaty ; that it was therefore the 
duty of the President (a duty of which he had frequently pressed 
a performance) to have convened Congress, before he ventured 
to decide, by the proclamation of neutrality, upon the general 
relation between America and the belligerent powers, or to pro 
hibit, by his instruction to the state governors, the enjoyment of 
the particular rights, which France claimed under the express 
stipulation of the Treaty ; he urged, that the powers which he 
had received from his constituents, gave him no latitude upon the 
point now in controversy ; that the privilege to arm and equip 
vessels was deemed by them indisputable, founded upon the plain 
meaning of the 22d article of the Treaty of Commerce ; and that 
he could not, therefore, enter into any arrangement, which might 
appear as a waiver of that privilege. He insisted that the Presi- 



1793] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 467 

dent s construction was neither just nor obligatory ; that notwith 
standing the existing causes, which would warrant an abrupt 
departure, his regard for the American people would induce him 
to remain here, amidst the insults and disgusts that he daily 
suffered in his official character from the public officers, till the 
meeting of Congress. He spoke of publishing his correspond 
ence with the officers of Government, together with a general 
narrative of his proceedings ; and he said, that if Congress agreed 
in the opinions, and supported the measures, of the President in 
relation to the Republic of France, he would certainly then with 
draw, conscious of having discharged his duty and leave the 
dispute to be finally adjusted by the two nations themselves. 

As soon as I could obtain an opportunity, I recalled Mr. 
Genet s attention to the immediate object of my visit ; but he 
peremptorily refused to enter into any engagement for suspend 
ing the departure of the Little Democrat ; and added, in a manner 
which I thought intemperate, he hoped no attempt to seize her 
would be made, for, as she belonged to the Republic, she must 
defend the honor of her flag, and would certainly repel force by 
force. 

Such was Mr. Genet s conversation with me ; and it will be 
allowed, that although I am responsible for the fidelity of the 
recital, I am not responsible for any inference which has been 
drawn from the facts that it contains. 

My report to the Governor on the same night, and to Mr. 
Jefferson the next morning, corresponded, as precisely as I can 
repeat, with the account which I have now given ; and I well re 
member, that Mr. Jefferson s relation of the discourse, that passed 
in his subsequent interview with Mr. Genet, on the same occa 
sion, so nearly corresponded with my report, that the similarity 
became a matter of remark with the Governor and Mr. Jefferson, 
as well as with me. 

But it will be expected that I should give a more direct reply 
to the specific charge which states, that I had reported to the 
Governor and communicated to Mr. Jefferson, " that Mr. Genet 
had declared, that he would appeal from the President to the 
People." 

Upon enquiry I find that the Governor thinks that I made use 
of the word appeal towards the close of my report, in this man- 



468 RUFUS ICING. [i793, 

ner, " that if after the business was laid before Congress, Mr. 
Genet did not receive satisfaction, on behalf of his nation, he 
would publish his appeal, withdraw and leave the governments 
themselves to settle the dispute." The word appeal appears, 
however, in my opinion more applicable to those facts which 
represent that Mr. Genet, controverting the justice and force of 
the President s decisions on the treaty, &amp;c, declared a determina 
tion to address Congress on the subject : but, in either place, if 
it is not construed necessarily to impart, that I heard a declara 
tion from Mr. Genet "that he would appeal from the President 
to the People," I am content to admit the expression. 

But I am likewise apprised, that soon after the transaction,, 
when, however, the report was circulating, that Mr. Genet had 
used the expression in question ; when it was reported to have 
been used by him in his conversation with Mr. Jefferson, and 
when Mr. Jefferson thought it proper to remove impressions 
made by the circumstance in the report, he stated in an official 
memorandum, that Mr. Genet s declaration of an intention to 
appeal from the President to the People, was not expressed to 
him, but to me. Whether Mr. Jefferson employed the language 
of his own inference from my recital on the occasion, or adopted 
the language of the current rumor, I will not attempt to discuss. 
But if, in the same early stage of the business, I had also en 
joyed the means of explanation, I, like Mr. Jefferson, should 
then have said, what I said the moment I heard the suggestion 
applied to me ; what I have since taken every proper opportunity 
of saying, and what I now most solemnly say, that Mr. Genet 
never did, in his conversation with me, declare " that he would 
appeal from the President to the People," or that he would make 
any other appeal, which conveyed to my mind, the idea of excit 
ing insurrection and tumult. 

Upon the whole, as my communications to the Governor and 
Mr. Jefferson were of an official and confidential nature, I think 
that I have cause to complain ; and the candor of others will in 
duce them to lament that I was not personally consulted (which 
common courtesy, as well as common caution, might have dic 
tated) before Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Knox (who had daily op 
portunities of seeing me) undertook to propagate the report con 
nected with my name ; or, at least, before Mr. Jay and Mr. King 



1793] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 469 

undertook to vouch for its authority. The most attentive hearer 
may sometimes misconceive the ideas of the person who addresses 
him ; the most upright narrator can seldom adhere strictly to the 
language of his author : and I am not aware of any just purpose, 
which could require that the sentiment which has been circulated 
should be immutably fixed, or that the form of words, in which 
it is cloathed, should be irrevocably prescribed. 

A. J. DALLAS. 

PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 7, 1793. 



J. JAY TO R. KING, 

NEW YORK, igth Deer., 1793. 
DEAR SIR : 

I have been favd. with yours of the i5th, &amp; yesterday reed. 
Dunlap s paper of the i7th, wh. you was so obliging as to send 
me. It is to be regretted that Mr. Jefferson &amp; Govr. Mifnin 
still remain as it were in a back Ground. I enclose an extract 
from one of our Papers, by wh. you will perceive the use made 
of it. 

I am inclined to think that Letters, calculated for publication, 
from Col. Hamilton &amp; Genl. Knox to Mr. Jefferson &amp; Govr. 
Mifnin, calling on them to admit or deny the Facts in Question, 
wd. have been, and may yet be useful. 

I shd. have no objection to amuse myself in animadverting on 
the Statement, but it so happens that I shall not have leisure, if 
now is the time, to do it in season. I shall set out in a day or two 
for Rye, where I expect to pass next week, and where a Variety 
of Circumstances will prevent my having any retired or vacant 
hours. On my Return affairs of another kind will immediately 
engage me, and which, as they require the attendance of Persons 
from a Distance, cannot conveniently be postponed. Besides the 
Evidence will not appear to be compleated while Jefferson &amp; 
MifHin remain silent, or their Silence is not accounted for. 

It has happened in more than one Instance, that Questions in the 
Circuit Courts, decided by one Set of Judges in the affirmative, 
have afterwards in the same Court been decided by others in the 
negative. As writs of Error do not reach every case, this Evil has 
no remedy. The natural Tendency of such Fluctuations is 



470 RUFUS KING. [1793 

obvious ; nor can they otherwise be avoided than by confining 
the Judges to their proper place, viz, the Sup. Court let their 
salaries be reduced I for my part wd. consent that a sum equal 
to the Expences of attending the circuits shd. be deducted. 

Yours very sincerely, 

JOHN JAY. 
Mr. KING. 

FROM THE AMERICAN DAILY ADVERTISER. 

The Printers of the American Daily Advertiser have received 
the following statement from an authentic source, with permis 
sion to make the source known to any party concerned, who may 
desire it : 

Mr. Dallas having lately made a statement different from that 
of Mr. Jay and Mr. King, with regard to the declaration alledged 
to have been made by Mr. Genet, namely " that he would ap 
peal from the President to the people," the following circum 
stances may serve to assist the public judgment, concerning the 
real nature of the transaction. 

The information which was certified by Mr. Hamilton and Mr. 
Knox to have been received from Governor Miffiin, was com 
municated by the Governor to those gentlemen separately, to the 
latter the day after the evening of the interview between Mr. 
Genet and Mr. Dallas, at which the declaration is understood to 
have been made (being Saturday the 6th of July last), to the for 
mer, the day following (that is the second day after the interview). 
Those gentlemen deemed it a matter of public importance, im 
mediately connected with an object upon which they had to act 
officially, compared with each other at the time the information 
they had severally received from the governor, and found it to 
agree as to the point in question, being precisely this, that Mr. 
Genet had said to Mr. Dallas " that he would appeal from the 
President to the people." 

The same second day after the interview between Mr. Genet 
and Mr. Dallas, in an official conference between Mr. Jefferson, 
Mr. Hamilton, and Mr. Knox, having relation to the affair which 
gave rise to the above-mentioned declaration, Mr. Jefferson stated 
that Mr. Dallas had told him likewise, that Mr. Genet had said., 



1793] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 471 

" he would appeal from the President to the people " ; the terms 
corresponding with those which had before been used by Gov 
ernor Mifflin in his separate communication to Mr. Knox and 
Mr. Hamilton. 

The two last mentioned gentlemen, in an official paper drawn 
up and signed by them the 9th of the same July, a copy of which 
was then delivered to Mr. Jefferson, recited the information they 
had received in the following words " The declaration of the 
Minister of France to Mr. Dallas, Secretary of the Commonwealth 
of Pennsylvania, as related by him to the Governor of that Com 
monwealth, and to the Secretary of State, is a further confirmation 
of the same system This declaration among other exceptionable 
things expressed that he (the French Minister) would appeal from 
the President to the people." 

Mr. Jefferson, in an official paper under his signature, dated 
the loth of the same July, stated the same transaction in the fol 
lowing words. " On repeating to him (the Governor) and Mr. 
Dallas what Mr. Genet had said, we found that it agreed in many 
particulars with what he had said to Mr. Dallas ; but Mr. Dallas 
mentioned some things which he had not said to me, and, partic 
ularly, his declaration that he would appeal from the President to 
the People." The conversation between Governor Mifflin, Mr. 
Jefferson and Mr. Dallas, at which this passed is stated in the 
same paper, to have happened on Sunday the 9th of July, the day 
after the evening of the interview between Mr. Genet and Mr. 
Dallas. 

No comments will be made on these particulars. The public 
is left to draw its own inferences. 

FROM THE AMERICAN DAILY ADVERTISER. 
To THE PUBLIC. 

A supplementaty certificate, in aid of the statement, that has 
been furnished by Mr. Jay and Mr. King, relative to Mr. Genet s 
conversation with Mr. Dallas, in the case of the Little Democrat, 
has been published without the name of its authors ; but a report 
has been raised that this supplementary certificate is published by 
the Governor and Mr. Jefferson. 



4/2 RUFUS KING. [^793 

A party concerned has, therefore, enquired into the fact ; and 
lest the circumstance reported may serve to mislead the public 
judgment concerning the real nature of the transaction, he thinks 
it proper to state, that he is informed by the printers, that the sup 
plementary certificate is composed and published by the same 
persons, Mr. Hamilton &amp; Mr. Knox, who composed and pub 
lished the original certificate (of which, indeed, it is merely a 
verbal amplification) annexed to the statement of Mr. Jay and 
Mr. King. 

No comments will be made on this particular : the public is 
left to draw its own inferences. 

* The public attention should not be diverted from a subject 
which it is anxiously desired should be kept out of sight. Not 
withstanding the declarations we have seen, that it was not the 
wish of France to involve us in the war, we are certainly not 
without proof that the practices of her agents, and the counte 
nance which these practices receive from a few of our citizens, 
are calculated with fatal certainty to involve us in the war. The 
equipment of privateers in our Ports, in violation of our laws and 
in contempt of the decision of our Government, is a conduct the 
most extraordinary which perhaps ever before happened in any 
country. This practice is persisted in and we are told that the 
Executive has been threatened with an appeal to the people to 
justify it. The practice is too open to be denied. Mr. Genet and 
his party (for it is to be feared that some of our citizens have ac 
quired a zeal in respect to the views and interest of France, at 
the expense of their fidelity and attachment to the highest and 
best interests of their own country) perceive the alarm excited by 
their illegal proceedings. They by no means abandon their pur 
suits, but with a view to lull the public into security with respect 
to their views, they exert all their faculties to create divisions, ex 
cite distrust and raise up those baneful jealousies among us, which 
are so well calculated to cover their intrigues aud to destroy our 
peace and prosperity. 

We hear them speaking of the antient distinction of Whigs and 
Tories, with a view to warm and raise our passions, discoursing on 

* Manuscript of R. King. 



3793] Z/ff AND CORRESPONDENCE. 4/3 

the excellence of a Republican government, and artfully insinua 
ting that their opponents are unfriendly to Liberty and Freedom. 
They declare that we are bound to make common cause with 
France and appear determined to hunt down, and with obloquy 
and reproach to stigmatize those who boldly assert and contend 
for the Rights and Privileges of our Country. And it has come 
to this, that a foreign Faction is so powerful, and has succeeded 
so far, that Americans dare not avow their attachment to their 
own Country. Is the approbation of a foreign minister to be 
sought for and purchased as a Passport for an American Patriot ? 

Pause a moment my countrymen Look around you and be sat 
isfied that America is the freest and happiest country on Earth 
Place your confidence in those who desire to preserve the enjoy 
ment of these inestimable blessings. Distrust those who, confed 
erating with the enemies of your Peace, are pursuing with inces 
sant application measures which must plunge you into the mission 
of war Hear a plain tale and wait for an answer. 

Our Government have decided that France has no right by 
treaty to equip and make Privateers in our ports. The French 
Minister opposes this decision and has caused many Privateers to 
be made and fitted out in our harbours. He is charged with hav 
ing threatened to appeal to the people from certain decisions of 
the President. He has not denied the charge he cannot deny 
it. Great pains are taken to call in question the propriety and 
motives which induced the change. It is pretty evident that the 
measure was not induced by Mr. Genet. The charge is a plain 
one, and if Mr. Genet is innocent he can deny it. It is much 
easier to deny it, if it is not true, than to be at the trouble of en 
quiring for the principles and motives of those who have proffered 
the charge. 

It remains to notice the query why Mr. Genet was not applied 
to before recourse was had to other measures. 

It is but candid to allow that courtesy and politeness, as well 
as propriety, indicated such a course in preference to any other. 
Every Ambassador is supposed to possess a superintendance, 
and at least an advisory controul over all the transactions of the 
members of his nation residing in the Country in which he may 
be placed. In the case of Mr. Genet, it is said, and the Decrees 



474 RUFUS KING. [1793 

of the National Convention, conferring powers on other public 
agents render it highly probable, that his Powers are large and 
extensive ; that in addition to the usual diplomatic authorities, 
he is clothed with those of Consul General and Commissary of 
the Republic in this quarter of the World ; and therefore that he 
could easily arrest and prevent any unfriendly and improper 
measures pursued by the Citizens of France in this country. To 
have availed ourselves of his Powers to restore the Brig Chelcomb 
and Cargo must have been much easier, less expensive and more 
consistent with that good and friendly correspondence which we 
desire should subsist between our Country and France, than the 
adoption of any other means. It is therefore to be inferred that 
the course which has been pursued, has been adopted from a 
conviction that an application to Mr. Genet would have proved 
ineffectual. This is not only presumable from the preceding 
considerations, but a series of facts authorise us to believe that it 
was in truth the case. 

The distribution of the French commissions of Letters of 
Marque and Reprisal must have been confided to Mr. Genet, or 
have been placed under his controul. No sooner had he arrived 
at South Carolina, and in going there he passed by the Seat of 
Government, where he might have been acknowledged, than we 
hear of the equipment of the Privateer called the Citizen Genet. 
This exceptionable measure must have been effected under his 
eyes and with his approbation and assistance. After his arrival 
at the seat of Government, where he was received in the kindest 
and most satisfactory manner, notwithstanding the great irregu 
larity of which he had been guilty in So. Carolina, there is reason 
to conclude that the decision of our Government was made 
known to him in respect to arming and making Privateers in our 
ports. The natural and proper conduct which Mr. Genet should 
have observed, required of him to cause the Privateer Genet im 
mediately to depart from our Coast without returning into any of 
our ports, or, in case of her return, to have directed that she 
should be dismantled and that she should not again have gone 
to sea. Indeed it has been said that he himself gave reason to 
expect a decision of this friendly and becoming nature. But 
from some cause which at present can only be the subject of con- 



1793] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 475, 

jecture, the result has been a conduct quite different from what 
was reasonably expected, repugnant to a just estimate of his 
proper authorities, contemptuous in the highest degree to the 
Government and people of our nation, and calculated with fatal 
certainty to involve our peaceful and happy Country in the hor 
rors and multiplied hazards of war. 

The Privateer Genet came into port and, after refitting, went 
again to sea. Vessels were equipped and commissioned as Priva 
teers in various places within our Jurisdiction, our citizens 
were debauched from their obedience to the laws of the land and 
enticed to enter on board these Privateers originally equipped in 
the bosom of a country at peace with all the world. Seditious- 
practices were beginning to show themselves in different places : 
the plainest maxims of integrity and fidelity were questioned, our 
countrymen, attached to liberty which they are worthy to enjoy, 
were told in public addresses and in private discourses, that our 
Freedom and Happiness depended on the success of the French 
Revolution. No efforts have been spared to plunge us in war, 
at the same time that it has been treacherously said that it was- 
neither expected nor desired by France that we should be 
involved. All these practices and pernicious proceedings were 
fairly fixed upon the author by the conduct which he observed 
with respect to the armed vessel called the Little Democrat. 

This vessel was equipped originally as an armed vessel at 
Philadelphia, and under the eye of Mr. Genet. It has been con 
fidently asserted, and it is believed that it cannot be contradicted,, 
that in this instance a direct requisition was made by authority 
of the President of Mr. Genet to detain this vessel, and that the 
requisition was treated with total disregard and contempt, and 
the vessel proceeded on a cruize in defiance of our highest 
authority. 

What should be the conduct of a nation, who have freely shed 
their blood and liberally bestowed their treasure to attain Liberty 
and Independence? Should they a second and third time ask, 
to be refused and insulted? or should they consider the reputa 
tion of a just and virtuous People too precious to be exposed to 
repeated contumely ? 



4/6 RUFUS KING. [i794 

To THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES.* 

PHILADELPHIA, December 18, 1793. 
SIR : 

The Minister Plenipotentiary of France has enclosed to me a 
copy of a letter of the i6th inst, which he addressed to you, 
stating that some libellous publications had been made against him 
by Mr. Jay, Chief Justice of the United States, and Mr. King, one 
of the Senators from the State of New York, and desiring that 
they might be prosecuted. This letter has been laid before the 
President, according to the request of the minister ; and the 
President, never doubting your readiness on all occasions to per 
form the functions of your office, yet thinks it incumbent on him 
to recommend it specially on the present occasion, as it concerns 
a public character peculiarly entitled to the protection of the laws. 
On the other hand, as our citizens ought not to be vexed with 
groundless prosecutions, duty to them requires it to be added, 
that if you judge the prosecution in question to be of that nature, 
you consider this recommendation as not extending to it ; its only 
object being to engage you to proceed in that case according to 
the duties of your office, the laws of the land, and the privileges 
of the parties concerned. 

I have the honor to be, 

T. JEFFERSON. 



STATEMENT IN R. KING S HANDWRITING IN ANSWER TO THE 

ABOVE. 

February, 1794. 

In answer to Genet s letter to the President calling on him to 
declare that he had never told him that he would appeal from the 
President to the people, Mr. Jefferson observes " that it was per 
haps immaterial whether the Decon. was made to the President 
or to another person." But afterwards when Genet had denied 
that he ever made the Decon., and requested that Mr. Jay and I 
would be prosecuted for a libel, Jefferson answers that the Presi 
dent had referred his Demand to the Attorney General with direc 
tions to do what the occasion should require. 

*TAe Writings of Thomas Jefferson, v. iv. , 97, New York, 1854. 



1794] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 477 

This reply from Mr. Jefferson by order of the President was 
considered by Mr. Jay and me as extraordinary, as it authorised 
inferences unfavorable to our characters, and such indeed, as 
both the President and Mr. Jefferson were sensible we did not 
merit. 

In December Mr Jay and I addressed a letter to the President 
on this subject, explanatory of our conduct, complaining of the 
letters which by his direction had been written by the Attorney 
General and the Secretary of State relative to this affair, and re 
quiring of his Justice to direct the Secy, of State to furnish us 
with a certified copy of his Report to the President, of the inter 
view between Mr. Dallas and him, and that he would permit us 
to publish the same in order to place before the public the evi 
dence relative to Mr. Genet s Declaration. 

Much difficulty occurred relative to this letter. Randolph, who 
with Jefferson was treated with much severity in it, endeavoured 
to induce the President to reply, and to justify his and their con 
duct. Hamilton advised the President to grant the copy re 
quired, and to reply in such a manner as would not acknowledge 
the charge of injustice made against him in the letter from Mr. 
Jay and me. Knox was desirous of preventing the affairs termi 
nating in a rupture between the President, Jay and me, and was 
therefore solicitous of some middle course, which should satisfy 
no one, but end in burying the affair in oblivion. He suggested 
our taking back the letter to the President, and that we should 
propose a personal interview in order to heal the wound inflicted 
by the Letter we declined the Letter was written and could not, 
nor indeed ought it to, be taken back with respect to an Inter 
view, it must proceed from the President s invitation. 

Finally it was thus arranged. The President sent for Mr. Jay 
they conversed freely upon the subject the President justified 
his own conduct and expressed his opinion that nothing incorrect 
or unfriendly had been intended by Jefferson or Randolph and 
complained of the severity of our Letter spoke of the difficulty 
of his situation and of the necessity of his conducting with great 
caution. Mr. Jay explained our situation, the purity of our views, 
the anxiety for the public peace wh. had stimulated our conduct, 
and the wounds inflicted upon us in consequence of the Part we 
had acted ; that under such circumstances we were entitled to 



4/8 RUFUS KING. [ J 794 

the full Force and disclosure of those Truths which would justify 
us in the presence of our fellow citizens ; that we had asked 
nothing ; but that when Genet had made requisitions of him 
in order to humiliate us, it was not to be expected that there 
should have been even a suppression, much less a misrepresen 
tation of the true history of the transaction in question. 

Much conversation passed at this interview ; the President 
expressed his friendship for Mr. Jay, and his respect and re 
gards for me, &amp;c., &amp;c. Mr. Jay finally proposed to the Presi 
dent by way of concluding the affair that he should furnish 
us with an authenticated copy of Mr. Jefferson s Report, or of 
so much of it as related to Mr. Genet s Decon., and that the 
original Draft of the letter that we wrote to the President, 
should also be delivered to him. 

This arrangement was agreed on Mr. Jay sent the Draft to 
-me immediately on his return to New York and I delivered it to 
the President, wh. together with the Letter, and a paper in the 
President s handwriting justifying his conduct and which he gave 
to me to read, he, in my presence, put into the fire. On this 
occasion a conversation between me &amp; the President took place, 
similar to what had passed between him and Mr Jay. He spoke 
in Terms of complaint of his difficult situation and of the intrinsic 
embarrassments of the last summer. I spoke to him respecting 
Fauchet, the new French minister, who had that day arrived in 
town and intimated my concern relative to the Fate of Genet ; so 
long as we were in danger from his Intrigues, we wished him ill 
that no longer existing we felt compassion and were anxious he 
should not be sacrificed. The President observed that Genet s 
situation was to be pitied, and, if understood, would be seen to 
be very distressing. I then apprehended what he alluded to and 
wh. a few days after explained to me, when in consequence of a 
note from him, I waited on him to receive a certified extract from 
Jefferson s Report of the interview between him and Dallas. The 
President told me, that Fauchet had demanded the delivery of 
Genet, in order to send him to France by the Return of the ships 
of war in wh. he arrived ; that this demand was made before 
Fauchet produced his credentials, and for this reason, that Genet 
being an officer of France might well be demanded and that the 
delivery of him while in the character of minister, would not 



1794] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 479 

affect the question of surrendering private criminals, who might 
have fled and obtained asylum in our Country ; that it had been 
concluded that it was best to refuse this requisition ; that Fauchet 
had then been received as Genet s successor and that enquiry 
had been made whether the Government would wink at an 
attempt to seize and send Genet to France ; that this had been 
discountenanced and upon this Principle that our Country was 
divided in their opinions about the French affairs, that we were 
not sanguinary in our Temper, that Genet s recall was an act of 
complaisance to the country, that in case of his being sent home, 
he would be guillotined, that his recall was intended to satisfy us, 
that this was enough ; and that we ought not to wish his punish 
ment, that this would excite Parties, and as the proposal of send 
ing Genet to France was probably intended to satisfy us, if it 
failed through our disinclination, it would excite no displeasure 
in France. 

Previous to the arrival of Capt. Culver, who was sent with the 
letters requesting Genet s recall and who brought back assurances 
that he should be replaced, the Proceedings of the South Caro 
lina Legislature respecting the Enlistment of Soldiers in that 
state by orders from Genet were received by the President. 

A question was made in the Executive how it ought to act 
upon that occasion. Hamilton and Knox advised the immediate 
dismission of Genet, and the annunciation of it, accompanied 
with a strong message and the Proceedings of the So. Carolina 
Legislature, to Congress Randolph doubted, suggested the con 
stant expectation of the return of Capt. Culver, &amp; of the probable 
recall of Genet ; that the proposed measure was a strong one ; 
that we were a new government and that Parties might be engen 
dered by so energetic a course. 

And as a middle way it was submitted to the President, for 
consideration, to send a message to the Congress, declaring his 
Resolution to dismiss the French Minister, unless within three 
days one or the other Houses should request otherwise. Hamilton 
conferred with me, and I think with Ellsworth, and some others, 
upon this subject I opposed the project of the provisional Dis 
missal, on the ground that it was throwing the Apple of Discord 
into Congress, and would inevitably produce a violent struggle 
.and convulsion. 



480 RUFUS KING. [i794 

This project was relinquished. The President took time to 
consider the subject, and on the morning of the day on which 
Culver arrived from France with assurances of Genet s Recall, 
the President had announced to the heads of Departments that 
he had well weighed the question and had come to a decision 
that he possessed the Right to dismiss, that the occasion would 
justify dismission and that the Duties of his station required of 
him the exercise of this power in the immediate dismission of Mr. 
Genet. Orders were therefore given to make the requisite prepa 
rations to communicate this Resolution to Congress. Culver 
arrived and the measure was suspended.

DEAR SIR : 

I am glad to hear that Congress have resolved to arm against 
the Algerines. I wish they may not be forced to arm against 
some other powers ; you will see by the papers that the British, 
French &amp; Spaniards have captured and condemned as prizes to 
the captors several of our Vessels &amp; Cargoes, I think contrary to 
the laws of nations : in short they treat us as if we were chil 
dren ; their conduct, if continued, with the Algerines, will soon 
put an end to our commerce, and of course our impost, as we are 
not able to defend ourselves at Sea. I know of no alternative 
but to adopt a non-importation from all those abusive powers : 
this method in the years 1765 &amp; 1769 had the desired effect, all 
but the 3d upon tea whh. we passed over. For my part I wou d 
turn my coat twice or wear homespun rather than to submit to 
them. These are my political sentiments, but the wisdom of 
Congress will without doubt act as they may judge best. A 
vessel arrived Saturday from the W. Indies advises that the 
British have carried into Antigua one of our homeward bound 
Indian vessels. . . . What they intend doing with her can t say. 
The cause they assign for the Capture is that she touch d at the 
Isle of France on passage from Bombay. . . .

C. GORE TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, March 10, 1793. 
MY DEAR FRIEND 

... I have not enjoy d so much real satisfaction, in our public 
affairs, since your session commenc d, as on reading the resolu 
tions offer d by Giles on the report of the Secy, of the treasury, 

* The resolutions here referred to were offered by Mr. Giles and read on 
February 28, 1793, three days before the final adjournment of Congress on the 
evening of March 2. They accused the Secretary of the Treasury with various 
violations of the laws in the use of the moneys of the Treasury, which were 
specified, and which, in the address introducing them, were characterized in 
severe terms, even as peculations. The motive was evidently to push them 
rapidly through and was exposed by Mr. Wm. Smith in these words : 

"Why were the resolutions brought before the House? Was it not to 
substantiate the truth of them by a vote ? And had the prosecution succeeded, 
would the Secretary have had an appeal to the public ? No, the resolutions 
would have been sent to the President, and the Secretary would have been 
removed, disgraced, and ruined forever without appeal." 

Mr. Barnwell, speaking against the resolutions, said that before discussing 
the observations which yesterday fell from the gentleman, he was " extremely 
happy that, in passing the medium of that gentleman s examination, this sub 
ject had changed its hue from the vile stain of peculation to the milder color 
ing of an illegal exercise of discretion aud a want of politeness in the Secretary 
of the Treasury." 

Mr. W. Smith said : " In recurring back to the origin and progress of thm 
examination, it must appear somewhat surprising that that which, in the com 
mencement of the session was sounded forth as gross peculation, now turns out 
to be nothing more than a mere substitution of funds, and that that which was 

* Annals of Congress , 1791-1793, pp. 962, 963. 



1793] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 483 

and their fate in the house. The views of the party are so clearly 
puurtrayed in their resolves, that they cou d not have expected 
defeat. The conquest to the cause of Government &amp; the reputa 
tion of Hamilton must be as glorious, as it was unexpected. If 
sense of shame cou d be roused in the heads of this faction, one 
would naturally expect some signs of remorse but of this, I sup 
pose, there is no hope. And with all the avowed regard to a rota 
tion in office with all that earnest solicitude for retirement &amp; 
philosophy, the patriotic Jefferson, we understand, will consent 
-again to serve the people. 

Our Senate and house are at war, about the mode of choosing 
a Senator. The house, after having several times non-concurr d 
Strong, &amp; sent up Jarvis, which choice of theirs was not acceded to 
by the Senate, resolved by a great majority, that the mode of elect 
ing a Senator shou d be by joint ballot of both houses in one room 
assembled. The Senate non-concurr d the resolve, and sent 
down Strong. I have heard that if the house do not agree to this 
choice, the Senate will make no farther choice this session. 

The house on a question being made relative to the incompati 
bility of an election as representative to Congress with a seat in 
their body, decided in favor of the member, who was an object of 
the vote, retaining his seat. Austin in Senate made a like motion 
which was intended to affect Coffin. No one seconded the 
motion. The Governor pushed on by S. Adams &amp; Warren has 
sent notice to the house that Coffin, Cobb, &amp;c., are elected to 
represent the inhabitants of Mass, in Congress ; this is intended 
to re-agitate the question. Dexter considering it unimportant 
and desirous of avoiding disturbance sent in his resignation. 

We can predict nothing certain of the next election ; tho 
Holten is, to all appearance, the most likely to succeed ; and, I 

announced as abominable corruption has dwindled away into a mere drawing 
sof money from Europe into this country, to be applied here according to law." 
The House rejected these resolutions by very large majorities. 
Hildreth concludes his review of this matter thus, 2d ser. , vol. i., p. 465 : 
" The result of this was, however, much to raise the character of the Secre 
tary of the Treasury by convincing the great body of impartial men, capable of 
understanding the subject, that, both as regarded talent and integrity he was 
admirably qualified for his office, and that the multiplied charges against him 
had been engendered by envy, suspicion and ignorance." 



484 RUFUS KING. [i793 

believe the friends of order &amp; government will generally vote for 
him : but it is difficult to raise them to any exertion. Mr. Bow- 
doin s friends have desir d Mr. Holten to resign as a candidate, 
thinking that their favorite, if a candidate, might obtain the elec 
tion. But Holten does not think it wou d be treating the com 
munity well to relinquish his pretensions, and many concur with 
him in this idea ; for Austin would surely distance Bowdoin in 
such a race. . . . Your friend,

NEW YORK, March 18, 1793. 
DR. SIR : 

Yours of 1 6 is just come to hand. I agree with you that we 
are in an alarming situation, and if my health will permit, I wou d 
by no means ask your resignation, as it wou d be esteemed either 
Careless or Slighting our common cause, which at this juncture 
requires most certainly prudence and firmness. I therefore at 
present shall say no more about it whilst I can keep my pen in 
hand for you know there is no one to apply to but myself. I am 
better than when I wrote last, but don t expect to get out of my 
room for many days and perhaps weeks. You will therefore act 
intirely under your own judgement &amp; shou d I require your 
presence shall give you timely notice. 

Affectionately, 

JOHN ALSOP. 

A. HAMILTON TO R. KING. 

PHILADELPHIA, April 2, 1793. 
MY DR. SIR : 

When you are acquainted with all the facts, I think you will 
alter the opinion you appear to entertain. My application comes 
literally within your rule. The loan is necessary for the current 
expenditure, independent of any new advance to France, or of 
purchases of the Debt. This has arisen from my having been 
under the necessity of remitting to Holland for a payment in 
June of 1,000,000 of Guilders as an installment of the Principal, 
and 470,000 Guilders for interest of the Dutch Debt. Late ad 
vices rendering it problematical whether a Loan could be obtained 



1793] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 485 

for the purpose of the installment, it became necessary to make 
the remittance to avoid danger to the public Credit. Hence with 
out a loan from the Bank, I ought to calculate upon a deficiency 
in the present Quarter (remember we are in April) of 672,023 
Dollars and 26 cents, and on the next of 325,447 Dollars and 28 
cents. 

This is the result of as accurate a view of Receipt and Expen 
diture as can now be taken. You will anticipate that by all the 
expenditures not falling actually within the periods, to which they 
are applicable, the real deficiency would not be as great as the 
calculated ; but you will at the same time perceive that the view 
given supposes a state of the Treasury which renders an auxiliary 
indispensable. 

At the same time I cannot think but that you apply your prin 
ciple too rigorously. I ought not to be forced to divert for a 
length of time funds appropriated for other purposes to the cur 
rent expenditure. To compel this would be in substance to with 
hold the means necessary for the current service ; for it would 
oblige the Treasury to employ an adventitious resource, which 
ought not to be so employed, and that too at a time when it would 
be employed advantageously, according to its original and true 
destination. I therefore think, independent of the real exigency, 
the Bank ought to make the loan. 

The loans to the Government stand on very different consider 
ations from those of Individuals. Besides the chartered privileges 
which are the grant of the Government, the vast deposits constantly 
in hand, and which ordinarily exceed the loans from the Bank, 
frequently very greatly, are an advantage, which, generally speak 
ing, bear no proportion to the dealings between Individuals and 
the Bank. 

Consider what has been the state of things for some time past, 
and the real sacrifices which have been made not to distress the 
Institution. If for such accommodations equivalent services are 
not to be rendered, they could not easily be defended. Besides 
from the necessity of having a considerable sum on hand in the 
Treasury, and the natural course of business, the Bank is pretty 
sure of having always on deposit a large part of what it lends to 
the Government. This does not exist in anything like the same 
degree in the case of Individuals. 



486 RUFUS KING. [1793 

You seem to calculate that the past advances will not be re 
placed. On the contrary, it is my intention pursuant to stipula 
tion to repay, as fast as the funds come in applicable to it, and in 
the last Quarter of the year, I hope to make a considerable prog 
ress in the reimbursement. Till then it will not be practicable. 

I do not know whether Mr. Kean stated to you the nature of 
my proposal. It was that the payments should be made in 4 
equal monthly installments : the first on the ist of June, and that 
each installment should be reimbursed in six months. The real 
advance of the Bank will be very temporary indeed before greater 
sums will come into its vaults from the duties. In the last quar 
ter of the present and the ist of the insuing year, very large re 
ceipts may be expected. 

You are sure that while I seek to put myself in a proper pos 
ture, I shall not fail to have a due regard to the safety and inter 
ests of the Institution. It is much to be wished that I could be 
enabled to make some purchases though this will not be the case 
with the loan in question unless a loan shall also have been ob 
tained in Europe. 

A meeting of the commissioners has lately been called by Mr. 
Jefferson out of the course heretofore practiced, in which I have 
been pressed to declare whether / had or had not funds applicable 
to purchases. I answered so as to be safe. But you readily per 
ceive the design of the movement. There is no doubt in my 
mind that the next session will revive the attack with more sys 
tem and earnestness : and it is surely not the interest of any body, 
or any thing, that a serious handle should be furnished. 

On the whole I am persuaded that the Bank can do what I ask 
without real inconvenience to itself and my situation is such that 
I shall be compelled to find an auxiliary. 

All the cry here is for peace. How is it with you ? Adieu. 
Truly &amp; affectly. yours, 

A. HAMILTON. 

A. HAMILTON TO R. KING. 

PHILA., May 2d, 1793. 

The failures in England will be so seriously felt in this country^, 
as to involve a real crisis in our money concerns. I anxiously

the U. States. Never was there a time, which required more the 
Union of Courage and Prudence than the present and approach

ject. Is it impossible for you to spend a month with us.

BOSTON, July 2oth, 1793. 
DEAR SIR : 

We are endeavouring to preserve some memoirs of the District 
of Maine. I think you will feel an interest in the business and 
therefore address this letter to you. 

There are the remains of a very antient settlement on the river 
Pemaquid. The history of that settlement is lost ; but I believe 
that it was made by People who went there under the Province 
of New York. The whole northern port of the continent was 
granted by James 2nd to the Duke of York. The aged People 
say that the country down to the east of Sheepscott was settled 
under the Duke : some say it was called the County of Cornwall, 
others that it was the County of New Castle and that one Dun- 
gan was governor. I wish you to search the records of New 
York State to see if you can find anything said on this subject. 
It must have been between the years 1648 &amp; 50. 

Your friend &amp; Servt.

C. GORE TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, August i, 1793. 
MY DEAR FRIEND : 

. . . Since the arrival of the new V. Consul a small vessel, 
of about 67 tons burthen, was fitted out as a privateer &amp; sailed 
from the wharf in Boston about 10 o clock of a Saturday night 
She continued in the harbor till Thursday night or Friday morn 
ing, when she return d to town. During her stay in the harbour 
she chased several vessels. There were on board two Americans; 



RUFUS KING. [1793 



agt. whom I obtained a warrant from Judge Lowell, but the mar- 
shall has not yet been able to apprehend them. They keep 
secret. Their names were placed on the back of the Commis 
sion. The Consul, tho he first gave his reason, why she went in 
the night and in so great hurry, that several British vessels were 
about to sail, afterwards affected to disapprove the conduct of 
the privateer in remaining in the harbor, &amp; I suppose by his 
order she returned. The Captain of her visit d Boston every day 
while she was in the harbor. The size and accommodation ren 
der it almost certain that she was intended merely as a cruizer in 
our harbor and bay. I wrote a statement of all the circumstances 
&amp; transmitted them to Mr. Lear, to be shewn to the President. 
I likewise communicated them to the Atty General &amp; desired his 
advice, what steps shou d be taken against vessels thus insulting 
our coasts and offending against the laws of neutrality. For tho 
I am at a loss to account for the conduct which the public papers 
announce to us to have taken place relative to the Little Democrat, 
I cannot hesitate in concluding that the French have no right to 
fit out privateers in our harbors. 

Jarvis and Austin are singular in their opposition to our neu 
trality, as well as their intimacy with Du Plaint. They are the 
only persons that have any pretensions to the character of 
gentlemen, that are acquainted with him. Du Plaint sent on 
Friday (the day the privateer returned to Boston) a memorial to 
the Governor, informing him, as of his own knowledge, that a 
british vessel was arming in the harbor, agt. the 226. article of the 
treaty with France, and stating in the memorial that she had on 
board 4 Carriage &amp; 2 Swivel guns. I happen d to be at the 
Custom House when the memorial was sent there by the Gov. for 
information, &amp; requested the Surveyor to examine the fact. He 
did, and found that she had two swivel guns on her quarter deck 
whh. she had on board when she came in &amp; were used merely as 
signal guns the ship had always carried with her. This vessel 
had been detained in port from Monday till Friday for fear of 
the pickeroon fitted out by the Consul &amp; others. I entertain but 
little doubt that this man is issuing commissions in numbers. He 
says he has Genet s orders so to do. 

Your affectionate friend, 

C. GORE.

G. CABOT TO R. KING, NEW YORK. 

BEVERLY, August 2, 1793. 
DEAR SIR : 

This morning s mail brought me your favor of the 27th of 
July. I thought a publication of some of the ideas it contained, 
with others which were naturally excited, might be useful &amp; there 
fore after giving them a little change of form and arrangement, 
have set them off for the press : but as they are gone by a sub 
terraneous passage &amp; under the patronage of another gentleman, 
it is uncertain whether they will ever appear, or if they do, in 
what shape. 

The people in this part of the country have but one wish 
respecting the National peace, and that is that it may be pre 
served. Excepting a few factious men in Boston &amp; a very few 
in other places, they are well united too in the Sentiment that the 
President is the proper Guardian of the public tranquillity, &amp; that 
the measures he takes to secure it, are fit and proper &amp; ought to 
be supported. Our commercial and maritime people feel them 
selves deeply interested to prevent every act that may put our 
peace at hazard ; but who can restrain opinions ? The cause 
of truth requires that they shou d be free and will on the whole 
profit by this freedom. Unfortunately the propagators of false 
hood are the most industrious, and, for the moment, the most 
successful. Indeed they are most of them stimulated by the 
strongest personal motives, while their opponents are actuated 
chiefly by a love of the public. Who can doubt on which side 
victory will be in such a contest ? It has been with surprize as 
well as concern that I have seen the rapid progress of Jacobinical 
principles since my return from Philadelphia. Until Pacificus * 
appeared there were very few Persons, whose ideas were tolerably 
just respecting the relation of the U. S. to France. Indeed there 
are not many now who think correctly upon the subject. But 
for these erroneous sentiments the friends of Government are as 
blameable as their adversaries. Why have they not always told 
the truth, at least so much of it, as wou d have enabled the 

* A series of articles published by A. Hamilton the first of which appeared 
June 29, 1793. Their object was to repel the charges against the President of 
having issued the Proclamation of neutrality without authority. 



490 RUFUS KING. [i?9S 

People to understand that France, in the aid she gave to the 
U. S. was actuated by policy, or to speak out, by Ambition ? 
Why has it been concealed that from the first moment of her 
connexion with us, she inserted herself into all our councils ? 
that by her influence there, she procured measures that placed 
the most precious interests of our country at her own mercy ? 
that she obstructed our commercial views that at the treaty of 
peace she endeavour d to depress us &amp; in a word, that she has 
constantly seem d to keep us low, imbecile &amp; dependent? 
&amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. 

But all this declaration is out of time. Altho I have lived 
much at home, yet I have not been wholly inattentive to what 
was passing these few months, and previous to the receipt of 
your letter had promoted in some degree the measures you wish. 
It will be useful to rouse the sober part of the community &amp; 
oblige them to attend to a subject, the discussion of which can 
no longer be avoided. I am always happy to hear from you, &amp; 
remain with sincere esteem your friend, &amp;c. 

G. CABOT. 



C. GORE TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, August 4, 1793. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

I received your favor 27. ult. by the last post &amp; having written 
you the day of its receit, in hopes of more intelligence by this 
post, I delay d telling you that all our seaports are hearty in their 
approbation of our neutrality, that from Penobscot to this place 
they are making resolutions similar to those of Boston. From 
time to time as they come in, they will be inserted in the public 
papers. The opponents are diminishing in numbers and influ 
ence. Very erroneous notions, on our obligations to aid France, 
have prevailed. The writings of Pacificus have done much 
good ; others are producing a conviction with respect to the 
precise tenor of our national duties. On Friday evening I 
receiv d notice that a vessel fitted as a privateer, and destin d to 
cruize against the enemies of France, had been equipp d at 
Hingham &amp; then lay in the gut of Nantasket. I requested the 
Surveyor of the port to send a boat &amp; examine her, which was 



1793] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 49 1 

done, &amp; the officer reported that she was in every respect fitted 
as a privateer. While the boat was gone, Mr. Jutau, Chancellor 
to the Consul, carried the commission of this vessel to the Custom 
house &amp; shew d it to the officers of the revenue. I made a 
memorial, as attorney for the U. S., to the Governor, &amp; stated 
these facts, &amp; accompanied this memorial with affidavits verifying 
the statement, and pray d him to stop her from going to sea. I 
presented it in person &amp; was graciously receiv d. His Excel 
lency promised to investigate the case and to do whatever he 
cou d constitutionally. Immediately after, I saw Mr. Sullivan, 
who says that the Governor can take the vessel into custody, and 
hold her until the President shall give order concerning her ; &amp; 
that he wou d so advise him. This morning, I understand from 
Mr. S., the Governor order d the Castle barge to visit her and 
report to him ; and so soon as the commanding officer of the 
Castle returns he will send all the papers to him, Mr. S., who has 
promised to consult with me. 

I have now a prospect of attaining compleat evidence that 
some of our citizens, &amp; some french residents here, have fitted 
out this vessel, which was purchased a few days since of an in 
habitant of New Port. The evidence may probably be full 
against Jutau, Chancellor to the French Consul. If this shou d 
be the case, I shall make complaint to the Judge of the District, 
&amp; pray that he may be bound over to answer at the next Circuit 
Court. Suppose the evidence to be direct against the Consul, I 
shall certainly think it my duty to offer to the Grand Jury a bill 
agt. him ; but as I wrote, a week since to the Atty General, &amp; 
requested his opinion as to the propriety of causing the Consul to- 
be bound over, I shall delay to do anything relative to him for 
the present ; but if there be any hazard in prosecuting the Chan 
cellor, I shall take it on myself, if the evidence will support a 
complaint. I know no immunity to a consul or his chancellor,, 
that authorizes their commission of crimes, or will protect their 
persons from justice. The Convention between France &amp; the 
United States expressly declares that they shall be subject to the 
laws of the land, as the natives are, with some exceptions as to 
personal service &amp; an immunity for their papers. Notwithstand 
ing this, the prosecuting either of them will cause a great clamor. 
We have a report that the privateer owned or commanded by 



492 RUFUS KING. [1793 

Citizen Neben has been captur d by the Boston Frigate and sent 
in to New York. If this is true, though the privateer may be 
ordered out, Neben may probably be in New York &amp; likewise one 
Whitesley, who was in the privateer &amp; was an inhabitant of Bos 
ton. Neben lived here many years &amp; I believe was naturalized : 
This, I shall ascertain. But it is very probable that the privateer 
was own d in great part in Boston. I shall write by this post to 
Mr. Harrison and request him to examine some of the people, or

R. KING TO A. HAMILTON.* 

NEW YORK, Saturday, August 3d, 1793. 

The French fleet from the Chesapeake arrived here yesterday 
and are in the North River, above the Battery. The Ambuscade 
also arrived last evening, and her accounts, confirmed by those of 
many spectators of the combat, leave no doubt of the flight of 
the English frigate. 

You will have seen in our newspapers, an invitation for a meet 
ing in the fields to address Mr. Genet, who is daily expected here. 
This business originated with M. Smith, Osgood, B. Livingston, 
Nicholson and others of like political character. Between two 
and three hundred persons assembled, and I am told they were 
generally anti-federal. Nicholson was in the chair. An address 
was produced and adopted, and a committee of thirty or forty 
persons appointed to present it. 

These gentlemen will not be stopped by trifles. They already 
affirm that the cause of France is that of America ; that it is time 
to distinguish its friends from its enemies ; that in respect to the 
rumor of Mr. Genet s appeal to the people from the decision of 

* Hamilton s Works, vol. v.. 572, N. Y. t 1861. 



1793] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 493 

the Executive, the people are competent judges of their own in 
terest and obligations ; that there can be no danger to them from 
the free exercise of their judgment on so great and interesting an 
occasion. True it is that their decision may displease men in 
high authority, but that will not prove their judgment to have 
been erroneous nay, some of these gentlemen go further, and 
not only excuse, but applaud the decree of the French conven 
tion, which not only contravenes our treaty of Commerce, but 
grossly violates the best established rules in the law of nations. 
In short, my friend, unless the Executive will quickly and vigor 
ously exercise its powers in checking the influence of Mr. Genet, 
it may experience the mortification of seeing them perish in its 
hands. Our Chamber of Commerce will on Tuesday pass reso 
lutions approving the proclamation, and we are resolved to try 
the citizens for a like purpose. But this is altogether wrong. We 
have with great trouble established a Constitution, which vests 
competent powers in the hands of the Executive. It is the duty 
of that department to see that the laws are executed, and the 
peace and order of the community preserved. It was never ex 
pected that the Executive should sit with folded arms, that the 
government should be carried on by town meetings and those 
irregular measures which disorganize society, destroy the salu 
tary influence of regular government and render the magistracy a. 
mere pageant. 

The decrees of the French convention have thrown the mer 
cantile people into the greatest embarrassments. Insurance on 
American vessels and cargoes cannot be made without paying 
war premiums. I am told that where four or five per cent was 
given, eighteen or twenty are now required. Adieu. 

Yours &amp;c. 



C. GORE TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, August 8, 1793. 
MY DEAR FRIEND : 

When I wrote you on Sunday, I had the fairest prospect of 
succeding in my endeavors to stop the french privateer but an 
hatred of the Union prevailed over even the love of power, or an 
exercise of sovereignty. 



494 RUFUS KING. [1793 

The Governor s* messengers reported the state of the privateer 
to be as represented in my memorial The atty general gave his 
opinion in writing that her fitting here was contrary to the law 
of nations, and a breach of neutrality and that unless the V. 
Consul wou d order her to the Wharf, &amp; detain her till the 
President s pleasure should be known, he, the Governor, shou d 
take her into custody, &amp; direct the Secretary of the Common 
wealth to communicate his doings to the Secy, of State, &amp; re 
quest the orders of the president what further shou d be done 
respecting her. 

This opinion in writing sign d by Mr. Sullivan was delivered to 
the Governor on Monday noon all that day &amp; Tuesday the 
little schooner mentioned in my former letter was employed 
in transporting stores from Boston to the sloop in Nantasket 
roads and on Tuesday afternoon she sailed arm d equipp d &amp; 
commission d as a privateer to cruise against the enemies of 
France I wrote a note on Tuesday evening to the Secretary of 
the Commonwealth, requesting to be informed if his Excellency 
had been pleas d to take any order on the subject matter of my 
memorial to this I have received no answer The Governor I 
have no doubt was well dispos d, but the Lt. Governorf as I learn 
was bitterly oppos d to my interfering. 

I made a complaint against Jutau &amp; one Woodward for fitting 
out the privateer &amp; supported the complaint by affidavits it 
hath been before the Judge since Monday He express d some 
doubts and as I had no reason to apprehend their absenting 
themselves, &amp; the vessel hath sail d, I mean to refrain calling 
on him till after Saturday night, when I expect to hear from the 
Atty Genl &amp; Mr. Lear. Yours affectionately, 

C. GORE.

TRENTON, Aug. 25, 1793. 
DEAR SIR : 

. . . I was much pleased with the Publication signed by Jay 
&amp; yourself relative to the Conduct of Mr. Genet in Philadelphia. 
I suppose it an indirect Measure of the Government to authenti- 
* Gov. John Hancock. \ Samuel Adams. 



1793] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 495 

cate a Charge of so important a Nature, the Truth of wh. had 
been rendered problematical by the positive Denial of the Minis 
ter s Partisans. This and the subsequent Measures of the Ex 
ecutive I highly approve, as they are calculated to maintain the 
Dignity of the Government &amp; to preserve in the view of all Man 
kind the declared Neutrality of this Country. But if Genet s 
Conduct, previously to his writing the letter to the President 
lately published, had not in the Opinions of some sufficiently 
marked him as a factious turbulent Man, the Terms of that 
letter must convey the fullest Proof of it to every unbiassed 
mind. 

It is easy to imagine that this Man will give a colour to the 
Transactions here relative to his Mission, to those who sent him, 
as favorable to himself, as it will be unfavorable to this country : 
but not so easy to decide what, in consequence, will be the meas 
ures of a Body of Men so exceedingly intemperate and phrenetic 
as that of which the French Convention is now composed. Such, 
however, is the Effect of Making his Conduct known to the 
World, that I can assure you, as far as my information extends, 
a very great Change has taken Place in the Sentiments even of 
his warmest friends and Partisans. 

With great regard, yours sincerely, 

L. CADWALADER. 

PHILEMON DICKINSON TO R. KING, N. YORK. 

HERMITAGE, 25th, August, 1793. 
DEAR SIR : 

My Son, with his friend Mr. G. McCall intends setting out in 
the morning on a tour to the Eastward. I could not suffer him 
to pass thro New York, without paying his comps. to you and my 
congratulations on the warm support, given to the President s 
wise and prudent measures. The sense of the Union, thus 
early expressed, will, I flatter myself, be productive of happy con 
sequences. We ought to be, &amp; I hope are, too sensible of the 
blessings we enjoy to part with them easily. 

I am sorry for the loss the Senate will sustain in our friend 
Read, who has accepted the Chief Justiceship of Delaware. 

With real esteem, &amp;c.

ISAAC WHARTON TO R. KING, NEW YORK. 

WOODFORD IN PHILAD., Sept. 23, 1793. 
DEAR SIR : 

I address this letter to you, from a Place, I purchased for 6000 
Dollars 4 weeks ago., &amp; then with my family retreated to, to avoid 
a malignant Fever, which for upwards of 6 weeks has raged in the 
City and for the last three weeks, with so much violence as to 
sweep away many hundreds of the Inhabitants nor has it as yet 
abated. Many respectable Merchants have died ; the greater 
part of the first Families are driven into the country. Indeed 
the citizens have retired in such numbers and Death has playd. 
such havock, that the streets seem desolate. The best Houses 
are deserted ; stores are generally shut up ; Commerce stagnated, 

&amp; the once gay and flourishing . But let us quit the 

melancholy scene. May Heaven preserve your City from such a 
dreadful Calamity. 

I do not recollect any of our particular Friends having per 
ished by this destructive Fever, which began in Water Street, nearly 
opposite to where I lived. Mr. Thos. Lee, son of Judge Shippen, 
fell a victim to it, yesterday ; I think you knew him ; he was a 
respectable character. 

Twice a week, I drive in my Coachee to the Bank ; and did I 
not deem it an indispensable Duty, no pecuniary Consideration 
would induce me to visit the City. Our President was attacked 
about two weeks ago, and, tho it s said slightly, yet he is so feeble 
that he has not since then been at the Bank. Mr. Kean attends 
closely and from the death, sickness &amp; absence, or rather deser 
tion of the Subalterns, has much to go through ; nevertheless he 
perseveres with undiminish d Ardour, and considering how many 
additional services have devolv d on him, acts with great dili 
gence and perspicuity. Mr. Fisher attended regularly until about 
10 days past, when he was likewise attacked by the disorder ; but 
has, it s understood, so far recovered, as to be out of danger ; all 
of his family have been ill, particularly his Bro. Samuel, tho for 
tunately none of them hath deceas d. 

We (the Directors) are reduced to four. Mr. McCall, who is 
our President (in the absence of Mr. Willing), Mr. Ball, Mr. Smith 
&amp; myself : who have not withdrawn ourselves a single day, not- 



1793] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 497 

withstanding each of us live out of the City. In justice to Mr. 
Wheelen let me add, that, tho he resides 12 miles off, he gen 
erally attends. Mr. Dalton went about 3 weeks past to Boston, 
Mr. Breck to Bristol, Mr. Bingham continues at Black Point and 
Capt. Anthony (who, poor man, lost a few days ago his Son &amp; 
Partner) has not return d from his visit to New England. I had 

promised myself a tour of two or three weeks ; but whilst B 

&amp;c are basking in the sunshine of security at their distant seats, 
four of us are exposed to all the dangers and Inconveniences of 
this afflicting awful Period, hazarding our Lives and Fortunes. 
For should we not attend, Discounting would cease, Deposits be 
withdrawn and the bank ruined but we must persevere at all 
risks. We discount all the good paper, which is offered, tho 
from the peculiar situation of the city, its not considerable. Ap 
pearances are favourable, that the Bank will not be injured by 
non-payment of any of the Notes, tho payment of some, will by 
the decease of the payee, in a few instances, be procrastinated. 

To Mr. Alsop be pleas d to present my unfeigned Regards and 
to Mrs. King Mrs. Wharton wishes to be conveyed the affectionate 
remembrance of the sincerest Esteem. 

Should any urgent Matter compel you to undertake a journey 
for Philada., before its Health is restored, I hope you will come 
to where I now reside, which is on the Ridge Road, 4 miles from 
the City &amp; about half a mile below Mrs. Lawrence s, in a large 
two story brick House, about 300 yards from the Road where 
we shall, need I add, be always happy to receive you ; but more 
especially when you can approach so near to the City with perfect 
safety. Adieu. May Health &amp; Happiness be long enjoyed by 
you, your family &amp; Friends. 

ISAAC WHARTON. 

P.S. I shall send this letter to morrow morning from the Bank 
without a clerk, I cannot transcribe it &amp; therefore hope you 
will excuse its incorrectness. 

Please to pay my respectful Compliments to Mr. Lawrance, Mr. 
Low, Mr. LeRoy and other Friends. Tell Mr. Low, Mr. M. 
Lewis, our common friend, has lost his eldest son another is very 
ill This ruthless fever spares not even the Bloom of Youth ; and, 
to add to the distress of the City, the Physicians do not agree in

the best mode to oppose it. You are doubtless apprized of the 
recovery of the Secretary of the Treasury &amp; his lady and that they 
set off a few days past for General Schuyler s. 

Bank of United States, Tuesday, Sept. 24th. Our little Com 
pany is met, with the addition of Mr. Wheelen. The Bank in 
respect to cash and its relation with the Banks of Pennsylvania &amp; 
No. America, stands well. The former Bank owes to our Bank, 
more than we are indebted to the latter, which is a pleasing cir 
cumstance. We discount less than the Branch in your City, by 
nearly one half. The Branches are doing exceedingly well. Once 
more adieu. 

I. W. 

We learn the Fever is not lessened many deaths this morning. 



ISAAC WHARTON TO R. KING, NEW YORK. 

WOODFORD IN THE COUNTY OF PHILA., Oct. 21, 1 793. 

It is, my dear Sir, a late hour to acknowledge the receipt of 
your Favour of the 25th Ulto, but the Communication from the 
Cashier, by order of the Board, to you &amp; the other Gentlemen 
Directors, residing in New York, made it less necessary unless 
it were from the satisfaction derived from an epistolary Corre 
spondence with one, whom we highly esteem And yet our City 
has been such a Spectacle of Disease, Misery &amp; Death, as to 
absorb almost every other Consideration than those arising from 
local and personal Duties. Now, however, I have the inexpres 
sible pleasure of assuring you the Fever, which has so long and 
so unmercifully ravaged the City, has greatly abated and, if it 
should please Heaven to send a heavy Rain, no doubt is enter 
tained of the Disease being immediately removed, the Merchants 
returning, and Commerce reassuming its former Spirit and 
Vigour. Perhaps no City ever experienced a greater Portion of 
Health, before this ruthless Disorder was introduced from His- 
paniola, and no place, except perhaps Marseilles, London, or 
Constantinople, during the visitation of the Plague, ever suffered 
more. For from the most accurate Calculation I can form, I 
conceive the deaths to be not less than 3000. Ought not this 



1793] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 499 

awful Example to teach us and our Sister Cities, to form such 
coercive Regulations, as will in future prevent the introduction 
of such a dreadful Evil ? 

The Board (still consisting of no more than three !) for tho 
Mr. Fisher is recov rd, yet so subtle and dangerous is the Dis 
order, we do not encourage his attending &amp; Mr. McCall s ad 
vanced Age &amp; other Circumstances, prevent him, tho we consult 
with him on all important Questions) will by this Post reply to 
-three letters received from you &amp; your Brethren, and, I hope, in 
a satisfactory manner. 

Individually I wish to say to you, that a removal of any part of 
the Specie, now in the Bank, would be instantly known (it could 
not be kept a secret) and be attended with the most serious Con 
sequences. It would beget Suspicion &amp; Alarm, &amp; create a sud 
den &amp; dangerous Call from the Depositors. Do not therefore I 
entreat you, for this and other weighty reasons press the matter. 
It s highly probable, a fortnight of such cool weather, as we now 
have, will revive trade and occasion as many Applications for 
Discounts as the Bank can with Prudence grant. Beside, why 
should any Hazard be run for the sake of employing one or two 
hundred thousand Dollars for a few Weeks ? In respect to the 
pecuniary Matters of Government, in relation to the Bank, every 
facility has been given not the smallest difficulty has occurred, 
and there is every Reason to conclude none will. Pardon these 
observations ; I would not trouble with them, but I believe them 
to be well founded. 

Not one of the Absentees have returned to their duty no, not 
even Mr. W g. We wrote a plain letter to each of them, more 
to justify ourselves than in expectation of receiving any Kind of 
Advice or Assistance, and we have not been disappointed. The 
Approbation we have rec d from you and our Brother Directors 
in New York, is highly gratifying to us. 

Be pleased to present me in the most affectionate &amp; respectful 
manner to Mr. Alsop. Your obliged &amp; faithful friend 

ISAAC WHARTON. 

I shall dispatch this letter from the Bank. 

. . . It s understood that the President of your Branch has 
written to Mr. Kean in Terms very dissuasive of his attending 



500 RUFUS KING. [^793 

the Bank. Certainly this is very indiscreet. However, Mr. 
Kean having stood his ground with remarkable firmness, will not 
surely now retire as the Danger is diminishing, &amp; the Bank is 
better officered than it was during several weeks. Keep this in 
formation to yourself. Mr. K. is unshaken. It bids fair to rain. 
May Heaven send a long &amp; heavy one it would do more good 
to the poor City than all the physicians or the art of man. 

Bank of U. S. Tuesday 10 o clock Mr. Ball, Mr. Smith &amp; My 
self are again met ; much rejoiced at the Accounts brought in of 
the City convalescing very fast Unfortunately the appearance 
of Rain is gone off, tho the weather is cool. The Business of 
the Bank is conducting with regularity and the Officers are atten 
tive. Our worthy Friend, Mr. Jas. C. Fisher is just come in, 
recovered in his health and so are all his amiable Family. They 
were sick for weeks together.

J. FENNO TO A. HAMILTON. 

PHIL., Nov. 9, 1793. 
SIR : 

After struggling for four years and an half with a complication 
of difficulties in supporting my publication, difficulties which no 
industrious person has perhaps been called to encounter since the 
organization of the general Government, I am reduced to a situa 
tion so embarrassing as incapacitates me from printing another 
paper without the aid of a considerable loan. The Types which 
I informed you I had wrote for are arrived. They amount to 
upwards of 500 Dollars. Debts, which I cannot any longer pro 
crastinate the payment of amount to 1000. It will require 500 to 
procure the necessary stock of paper &amp;c. to recommence business. 
A loan of Two Thousand Dollars therefore would relieve me, and 
not only so, but place me in a situation which would supercede 
probably the necessity of any further application of a similar 
kind. By the above statement you will perceive that matters are 
not altered for the better since the time I submitted a schedule of 
my Debts &amp; Credits to you, which was last Spring. Tho I have 
incessantly importuned my distant subscribers &amp; agents to make 
payment since the i8th September, I have rec d only 35} dol 
lars ; tho accounts to the amount of 1500 Dollars have been for 
warded during the period that has elapsed since. I therefore 
conclude that tho I have more than 4000 Dollars due, there is no 
dependence to be placed on a fund so wretchedly precarious. 

501 



502 RUFUS KING. [1795 

I have reserved myself to renew my business. Several eligible 
berths have been attainable in the Bank of the United States 
these are now filled. There are yet some vacancies in the Bank 
of Pennsylvania Mr. Fox is about leaving the office of Cashier, 
and the place of First Accountant is to be filled. I wish, Sir, for 
your counsel &amp; advice. If the plan you suggested some time 
since of a subscription can be carried into effect, or if a Loan can 
[be] made, all may be well. If not, my career as a Printer is, 
closed. Four years &amp; an half of my life is gone for nothing ; &amp; 
worse (for I have a Debt of 2500 Dollars on my Shoulders), if at 
this crisis, the hand of benevolence &amp; patriotism is not ex 
tended. 

Of the use of the word patriotism, no man can judge with so 
much propriety as yourself for no man is so well acquainted 
with the springs &amp; motives of my conduct. Wishing, Sir, that 
your health may be firmly re-established, &amp; apologizing for this in 
trusion, which nothing but the urgency of the case can justify at 
this time 

I am, sir, most respectfully your ever devoted and humble 

servant 

JOHN FENNO. 



A. HAMILTON TO R. KING. 

MY DEAR SIR : 

Inclosed is a letter which I have just received from poor Fenno. 
It speaks for itself. 

If you can without delay raise 1000 Dollars in New York, I 
will endeavour to raise another Thousand at Philadelphia. If this 
cannot be done, we must lose his services &amp; he will be the Victim 
of his honest public spirit. 

Yours truly

JOHN LAWRANCE. 

J. JAY TO R. KING, PHILA. 

N. YORK, Dec. 12, 1793. 
DEAR SIR : 

I thank you for yours of the 9th Inst. The President s speech 
meets with general approbation : his message has produced here 
its natural and proper Effect. Mr. Dallas statement is defended 
by some others call it subterfuge and harder names. I think it 
as artful as the subject and his Design would well admit. Mr. 

* There had been no treaty with the Algerine pirates, who had captured 
some of our vessels and held their crews prisoners. In 1792, it had been agreed 
in the Senate to appropriate money for the ransom of these prisoners and then 
to purchase peace with the Algerines. The negotiation had failed from the 
occurrence of several unanticipated events, " when the business was committed 
to Humphreys, the minister to Portugal. In consequence of difficulties between 
the Portuguese and the Algerines, a blockade of the Straits of Gibraltar had 
been maintained of late by a Portuguese fleet, and the Algerine cruisers had 
thus been kept within the Mediterranean. But before Humphreys had time to 
act under his commission, a peace had been made between Portugal and Al 
giers ; and, on the withdrawal of the blockading fleet, eight Algerine cruizers 
had issued into the Atlantic, to the great danger of American vessels." Hil- 
dreth, Hist. U. S., vol. I. 2d ser., p. 458. 

The result was that, in January, 1894, Congress resolved to " vote money to 
purchase a treaty, and also to provide a naval force," to protect the commerce 
of the United States. Ibid., p. 458. 



504 RUFUS KING. [ J 793 

Jefferson s Report should be, and perhaps is among the Papers 
referred to in the message &amp; its publication appears to me very 
adviseable Mr. Benson has heard of others to whom Dallas 
declared the same thing he will write to you on the subject. I 
think it important that in this case the Truth should shine, not 
behind a cloud however thin, but bright and with as few spots as 
possible. The Government, as well as those who endeavour to 
support it, will derive strength from it. When the evidence is all 
produced, Mr. Dallas statement should not escape careful and 
critical examination. 

Genet is by this time in Philada : prior to the arrival of the mes 
sage his Friends "to show their Respect for him," had sub 
scribed for a dinner. The message came they were puzzled 
he went away the morning of the Dinner, accompanied to the 
Boat by a number of Frenchmen on Horseback. The Chiefs 
were absent from the Dinner. I have heard that Lamb, Den 
ning, &amp;c and a number of Livingstons (not the Chancellor) 
were at it. It is thought that his abrupt Departure was the 
Result of Concert. 

The present Session appears to me to call for more than 
ordinary Vigilance, Circumspection &amp; Decision on the part of 
those who wish for the Continuance of Peace and good order. 
I expect the attack on Col. Hamilton will be renewed if so, 
the malcontents should be called upon to specify their charges, 
which should be published. A perfect Investigation shd. then 
take place and the Result in decided terms be also published. 
Delay wd. injure him and a Defeat disgrace them. I have 
heard it said that Gen. Knox means to resign. I very much 
doubt the utility of this to him, as well as to the public to 
be driven from one s station does not accord with my Judgment 

or Feelings. . . . Yours 

JOHN JAY. 

J. ALSOP TO R. KING, PHILA. 

N. YORK, 12 December, 1793. 
DEAR SIR : 

. . . I see by the President s letter to Congress that Mr. 
Genet must soon resign his office, and think Mr. Dallas must run 
low with all honest friends to their country. Mr. Genet set off 



1793] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 505 

on Tuesday last, escorted by 10 light horse, unexpectedly, for 
his friends had promised a Dinner for him of which he did 
not stay to partake. You 11 see by the last arrival here from Lis 
bon, that the Portuguese have let the Algerines loose upon us. 
They were the only power that confined them within the Straights : 
its said to be done by the Court of Great Britain, no doubt to 
encourage their own commerce and distress ours, wch. it will 
most effectually do, to Spain &amp; Portugal ; and I suspect it will 
cost me a few hundreds, for I have five or six risks out on those 
voyages : our writers will not write unless they have a premm. 
adequate to the risk. . . . 

Yours 
JOHN ALSOP. 

H. LEROY TO R. KING, PHILA. 

N. Y., Dec. 15, 1793. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

Your esteemed favor of the i3th inst. I have received and 
thank you kindly for its contents. That such harmony exists in 
Congress is truly pleasing, and that it may be of duration are my 
sincere wishes ; but when they get upon the ways and means 
business, I much fear they will split again. 

The Algerine business and the very serious aspect of our politi 
cal situation with Europe in general, proves a damper to most 
people here, who wish well to the Government, lest we may be 
drawn into some Scrape with G. Britain ; whereas the Correspon 
dence with that Government seems latterly to have been con 
ducted by our Executive in a firm stile. . . . As to the Sans 
Culottes we have nothing to dread from them, should they even 
encrease their madness, by acting hostilely against us. A certain 
party here say, that our ministers would exult were the latter 
event to take place. . . . 

Pray does not Mr. Jefferson mean to come forward shortly and 
confirm H. &amp; K. Certificates ? Your friends here are anxious, 
although satisfied in their own minds of what has passed, to see 
Mr. Dallas Jesuitical publication contradicted palpably. . . . 

Sincerely, &amp;c

shall we be able to keep from being embroiled in the Spring ? The

DEAR SIR : 

It having been supposed necessary that something ought to be 
done at Albany during the ensuing Session of the Legislature, 
respecting the next Election for Governor, some Friends waited 
on Mr. Jay a few evenings since to know his wishes and Deter 
mination. He answered, that when, on the Request of his 
Friends, he consented to become a Candidate at the last Election, 
the Office of a Judge of the Supreme Court of the U. S. was in a 
Degree intolerable, and therefore almost any other office of suita 
ble Rank and Emolument was preferable ; but that, in conse 
quence of the Relief which Congress have since given to the 



1793] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 507 

Judges, he would rather continue in his present office than be 
Governor of the State ; at the same time, however, as his Friends* 
had not deserted him, he certainly would not desert them ; and if 
therefore upon the whole they still judged it most advisable that 
he should again be a Candidate, that he would as certainly ac 
quiesce and if elected, would accept. 

It is proposed that the Friends should shortly meet to deliber 
ate on the Question, which, you will perceive, he has referred to 
them ; and in the meantime I was to write to you for Hamilton s 
&amp; your advice. It is needless for me to state Reasons either 
way, they will readily occur to both of you. I will only state that 
it is a very general opinion, &amp; I believe well founded, that, if 
Mr. Jay is not the Candidate, Mr. Clinton will meet with very 
little, if any, opposition from the Friends, and therefore that he 
most probably will be re-elected. Let me hear from you as soon 
as you conveniently can. 

Do you &amp; Hamilton know that the Friends here are not per 
fectly satisfied that a certain Business should, where it seems at 
present to, rest. You will recollect the draft which I shewed you 
of a Scrap. It does not appear by the best evidence the Nature of 
the case is capable of, where the Lie, if any, is, nor can it as long 
as Mess. Mifflin &amp; Jefferson remain wholly silent ; Mr. Dallas 
having positively denied that Mr. Genet ever declared to him " that 
he would appeal &amp;c.," and having by no means admitted that he 
ever reported to Mess. Mifflin &amp; Jefferson that Mr. Genet had 
so declared to him. We think a Requisition ought to be made 
on Mr. Mifflin and Mr. Jefferson to come out fully and positively. 
Where is the official Report which all here say and believe Mr. 
Jefferson made to the President, stating the Information as he 
had it at the time from Mr. Dallas ? ! The Enemies begin to bore 
the Friends about the Business. Yours 

EGBT. BENSON.

DEAR SIR : 

. . . Mr. Hamilton s request for Congress to investigate his 
department, must prove to the World the purity of his proceed-

ings ; his friends are pleased at his having made the proposition 
himself. 

We yesterday had a meeting of the Stockholders of the B. U. 
States, whh. was thin ; Mr. Watson called it in order to make 
known his resignation. Mr. Low resigned at the same time and 
declared to the meeting it was your wish not to be re-elected.

DEAR SIR : 

As your letter of the iyth inst., advising me of the intention of 
Congress endeavoring a treaty with the Algerines and the unfor 
tunate cause of its delay, appeared to me of a publick nature, I 
read it to the Gentn in our office, who were all well pleased to hear 
that such steps had been taken ; some said they feared that there 
had been some delay in the Executive, but now they were satis 
fied to the contrary, they one and all wished that Congress wou d 
immediately build or buy and equip six or eight stout Frigates to 
secure the honor and safety of our flag. . . . 

Yours JOHN ALSOP. 



C. GORE TO R. KING, PHILA. 

BOSTON, Dec. 23, 1793. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

I read with great concern that the Algerines are loose on our 
commerce. It affects the property of this place very much. 
There never was a time when our harbor was so crowded with 
vessels as at the present day, and never a time when we had half 
so many out on charter. 

The antis will clamor loud if Congress does not adopt some 
bold measure to meet and destroy this evil. They will not clamor 
less if the Government shall adopt the very steps they now pro 
pose ; but the federalists, and the lovers of our country will not 



1793] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 509 

join in the latter, though they will in the former. ... A 
Democratic Club has been established here ; but we are told that 
it is now dissolved ; this much is true, there are very few men 
who do not deny their connection with such a Society. How 
ever the faction opposed to the Government here is not and will 
not be restrained from doing anything which may interfere with 
its operations by any honorable considerations. Read the 
Chronicle and you will there see that falsehood and impudence 
are their strongest characteristics. 

Affectionately your friend, 

C. GORE. 

J. JAY TO R. KING, PHILA. 

N. YORK, Dec. 22d, 1793. 
DEA&amp; SIR: 

[ . . . Would it not be adviseable that, where Jurors are 
summoned by Marshalls, the Courts shd. be authorized to appoint 
Elizors in every case in which the Court shall have Evidence to 
induce reasonable apprehensions of Partiality or Interest in the 
Marshall, and that both in public and private causes ? 

As the yellow fever may again appear next summer at Pha., 
wd. it not be proper to provide that in such an Event, the sitting 
of the Sup. Court should be at another place ? Would it not also 
be adviseable to abolish the alternate sitting of the circuit Court 
at Yorktown and Pha. ? Double places create double trouble to 
all. parties. 

The federal Courts have Enemies in all who fear their Influ 
ence on State objects. It is to be wished that their Defects 
should be corrected quietly. If these Defects were all exposed 
to public view in striking colors, more Enemies would arise and 
the Difficulty of mending them be encreased. When it is con 
sidered that the important Questions expected to arise in the 
Circuit Courts have now been decided in them, I can conceive of 
no Reason for continuing to send the Sup. Court Judges to pre 
side in them of equal weight with the objections which oppose 
that measure. 

Insinuations that unwillingness to contradict or have Disputes 
with Col. Hamilton &amp; Gen. Knox, keep Govr. Mifflin &amp; Mr. 



510 RUFUS KING. [1793 

Jefferson silent will find Believers among those who do not see 
why the Authors of the last Statement should give their names to 
the Printers and not to the public ; especially when they are told 
that it was probably done to create an unfounded opinion that 
Mr. Jefferson was a party or a Privy to it. These are circum 
stances which many well meaning People are not qualified to 
explain ; but on the contrary are perplexed and ensnared into 
suspicions by them. It would be a pity that a single " Hook or 
Loop whereon to hang a doubt " should be left. They who 
write to the public write to the simple as well as to the wise.

DEAR SIR : 

. . . A vessel is arrived from Lisbon, wch. brings news that 
the Portuguese wou d grant a Convoy to American Ships ; but

with their treaty : however if they do it, it will serve us and they 
may account for their conduct. . . . 

Yours 

JOHN ALSOP. 

C. GORE TO R. KING, PHILA. 

BOSTON, Dec. 24, 1793. 
MY DEAR FRIEND : 

The statement published in Brown s paper leaves no room for 
Mr. Dallas to get rid of the assertion, but by saying that either 
Mr. Jefferson or himself has told a falsehood. 

The vile faction that disgraces Massachusetts still supports 
Genet. Their number is small, but their clamour loud and inces 
sant their impudence &amp; falsehood unparalleled. . . . The 
Algerines will deprive us of all the advantages of the present 
state of Europe ; and such is the rage of our people against Gt. 
Britain, to whom they attribute the peace made with Portugal and 
Holland, that a war with that nation is desired by many. They 
do not consider that certain loss would be our fate, if involv d in 



1793] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 511 

the quarrel ; and this disposition, it is to be feared, may have a 
tendency to introduce us into the war. I am happy to learn by 
your letter of the i5th, that you think we may yet remain at 
peace ; and I trust such measures will be adopted by Congress to 
block up the Algerine pirates, the ensuing summer ; our mer 
chants will lose their trade this winter. 

The federalists talk of running Judge Gushing for Governor, 
and there is some probability that he may be elected. Such an 
event is very desirable. It would make Massachusetts completely 
federal. 

Reports are circulated that Hamilton, Knox &amp; Jefferson are to 
resign. I most sincerely regret the necessity of that occasion, 
the loss which the public will sustain by the absence of the 
present Secretary of the Treasury. But why should he spend his 
health and his time and destroy the tranquillity of his mind for a 
people who really do not estimate his merits at a hundredth part 
of their value. The base and dishonorable abuse him the 
friends of order are willing to believe a slander against his fame, 
tho they never knew a truth come from the mouths of those who 
revile him. . . . 

Farewell, your friend, 

C. GORE. 



CHAPTER XXIX. 

Amendments to the Constitution Non-Suability of States One proposed for 
bidding an Officer of the Bank of the United States to be a Mem 
ber of either House Rejected Mr. King s Course Mr. Jefferson s 
Resignation, Mr. King s Name suggested as his Successor Mr. Randolph 
appointed Threatening Aspect of Affairs with England Suggestion of 
a Special Minister Conference of Messrs. Ellsworth, Cabot, Strong, and 
King respecting this Mr. Jay appointed Mr. King s Interviews with 
Mr. Hammond the British Ambassador Debate in the Senate on Suspen 
sion of the Fourth Article of the Treaty with Great Britain. 

In the practical working of the judicial power of the 
United States under the Constitution, a serious trouble 
manifested itself in carrying out the decision of the Courts 
in controversies between the States and citizens of other 
States or of a foreign State. Several cases had occurred in 
which this power of the Courts had been invoked; decisions 
had been made and the States had refused to obey the man 
dates of the Courts. A difficulty at once arose as to the 
power to compel them to obey. A general feeling mani 
fested itself, that it would be inexpedient, and probably 
would be impossible, if not dangerous to the public welfare 
to inforce these decrees. In consequence of this, the abro 
gation of the power was demanded by some of the States 
against which decisions had been made, and in February, 
1793, a few days before the adjournment of the 2d Congress 
an amendment to the Constitution was offered, but not 
acted upon, to meet the emergency. It was brought for 
ward early in the next Congress, in the Senate, and January 
14, 1794, an amendment to the Constitution was then 

512 



1794] RUFUS KING. 513 

adopted by a vote of 23 to 2 Mr. King voting in the 
affirmative in the following words: 

" The judicial power of the United States shall not be construed 
to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted 
against any one of the United States, by citizens of another State 
or by citizens or subjects of any foreign State." 

This was afterwards adopted in the H. of Representatives 
on March 4th, by 81 to 9 and having been afterwards 
assented to by the Legislatures of the States, removed what 
threatened to be a serious question of authority. 

Another amendment to the Constitution was proposed in 
the Senate on the last day of the Session of the 2d Congress, 
March 2, 1793, which was laid upon the table. It was in 
part : " No member of Congress shall be eligible to any 
office of profit under the authority of the United States, 
nor shall any person interested with the management of any 
bank or moneyed corporation within the United States, be 
capable of holding a seat in either House of Congress." 

This question was brought up in another form on the 
24th of the next December, and on January I5th an amend 
ment in the following words: 

" Nor shall any person holding any office in the Bank of 
the United States be a member of either House, whilst he 
holds such office." 

Being defeated by a vote of 12 yeas, and 13 nays Mr. 
King voting in the negative the subject was postponed and- 
does not appear to have been brought up again. 

The matter is alluded to here, because Mr. King, who was 
one of the directors of the Bank, had resigned his seat there 
before this, though there is no reason assigned for this 
action. But it is probable he had taken this step, in order 
that he might be free to act in accordance with his convic 
tion on the proposed amendment of the Constitution ; such 
at least has been given as his motive by those who knew 
him well. Mr. Lawrance in his letter of the I2th January, 
1794, says: 

VOL. I. 33 



514 RUFUS KING. [1794 

" It is to be hoped that the clamour of those who pretend to very 
much republicanism will now cease respecting the connection of 
those in the Government with the Bank. I perceive you are all 
out ; with yourself it was design but how did it happen with 
respect to the others ? " 



It is not necessary here to enter upon the discussion of 
the reasons which brought about the retirement of Mr. Jef 
ferson from the Cabinet of Washington. His avowed 
principles were in antagonism to the general policy of the 
administration, both as to foreign affairs and as to the con 
duct of Hamilton in the measures recommended and 
adopted, after warm discussion, for the administration of 
the financial department of the country. The personal 
animosity each felt towards the other, the radical differences 
in their views upon every public question, the evident con 
fidence shown by the President in Hamilton, and the failure 
of the friends of Mr. Jefferson to sustain against Hamilton 
the charges of peculation, and maladministration of the affairs 
of the Treasury, which resulted instead in his triumphant 
acquittal of them all, rendered it impossible that they should 
sit in the same Cabinet as advisers of the President, and 
Mr. Jefferson retired. 

It would appear that the name of Mr. King was promi 
nent among those suggested as the successor of the Secre 
tary of State. Mr. Madison had written to Mr. Jefferson at 
an earlier period when he had proposed to resign, saying, 
" In a word we " (Mr. Monroe and Madison) " think you 
ought to make the most of the value we perceive to be 
placed in your participation in the Executive Councils." 
Should he resign a successor would probably be appointed 
whose policy would be different from his. " I foresee, I think, 
that it will be either King, if Johnson is put at the Treasury ; 
or Edward Rutledge, if Wolcott should be put there." 

Mr. Hamilton says: "The recent hostile procedure of 



Life of Alexander Hamilton, by John L. Hamilton, vol.v., p. 440. 



1794] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 515 

Jefferson (in the Genet affair?) towards King had succeeded 
in creating an alienation between the President and that 
Senator, and it may have been hoped, would terminate his 
justly confiding reliance upon Jay." Mr. Jefferson, report 
ing a conference with Washington relative to his successor, 
says : " He (the President) said that Mr. Jay had a great 
opinion of the talents of Mr, King ; that there was also 
Mr. Smith of South Carolina and Edward Rutledge, " etc. 

Nothing further is said or known as to this matter, but 
Mr. Randolph was selected. 

A serious crisis existed at this time in the affairs of the 
country, consequent upon the undisguised efforts of the 
friends and supporters of French aggressions and a deep 
sense of the injustice of Great Britain in failing to carry out 
the agreements of the Treaty of Peace and in seizing and 
confiscating our vessels in the West Indies, a policy greatly 
aggravated by the Orders in Council of November 6, 1793, 
directing her cruisers to stop and bring in for adjudication 
all vessels with goods from the French Colonies or carrying 
provisions or goods to such colonies ; thus absolutely cut 
ting off all trade with them and causing heavy losses to the 
owners of vessels then in the West Indies. 

Measures looking to preparations for retaliation, raising 
of troops, building of war vessels, and fortifying the sea 
ports, found their first expression in the laying of an em 
bargo for thirty days, which was continued for thirty days 
longer, one of the chief objects of which was to prevent 
supplies for the English army and fleet. Resolutions for 
confiscating all debts to British subjects were brought for 
ward in Congress and discussed with great warmth, and 
although the British orders were soon after modified so far 
as to say that they only covered goods belonging to French 
men and bound for France, the feeling in the country was 
tending rapidly towards breaking off intercourse with Eng 
land and even war. 

In the midst of these perplexities which surrounded the 
President and which seemed almost insurmountable, the 



516 RUFUS KING. [i794 

friends of order and peace advised the sending a special 
ambassador to England to ascertain if a treaty of commerce 
could be made. In a letter of A. Hamilton to the Presi 
dent,* the condition of the country, the wrongs to which it 
was subjected, and a review of the proposed measures of 
retaliation, which would rather provoke the hostility of 
England than incline her to pacific action, are clearly and 
forcibly stated, and the suggestion which had been already 
made of sending a special ambassador to England was 
urgently pressed. At the same time he urged the adoption 
of " vigorous and effective measures to prepare for war 
should it become inevitable ; abstaining for the present from 
measures which may be contrary to the spirit of an attempt 
to adjust existing differences by negotiation." 

In this letter, recognizing the fact that his name had been 
under the consideration of the President for this appoint 
ment, he desired that it should not be brought forward, and 
suggested the name of Mr. Jay, who was immediately 
nominated, and though opposed in the Senate for political 
reasons, and especially his holding the position of Chief 
Justice, was finally confirmed. 

The manuscript of Rufus King, which is now given, writ 
ten at the time these matters were under consideration, will 
be found interesting and explanatory of much that without 
it would never have been known of the secret history of 
these times. This cannot, however, be presented to the 
public as entirely new, for Mr. J. C. Hamilton, who had 
access, through the courtesy of President Charles King of 
Columbia College, to these papers, has made use of them in 
his Life of Alexander Hamilton constantly, in ipsissimis verbis,. 
without any acknowledgment of the source of his informa 
tion, except this: "On the loth day of March, the day on 
which Sedgewick gave notice of his intended resolutions to 
increase the armed force, a conference was held between the 
Senators Cabot, Ellsworth, King and Strong. From minutes;

of tliis conference* it appears, that the proposed mission 
was approved, and it was determined that Ellsworth should 
confer with the President, etc."f The manuscript itself 
will show the source from which he derived his information 
without giving credit to Mr. King. + 

R. KING S MANUSCRIPT. 

10. March. The order of G. Britain of the 6. Nov., authorizing 
the seizing and sending in of American vessels for adjudication, 
having produced by the great number of captures in the West 
Indies, the most alarming irritation in the middle and eastern 
states (more than 200 sail having been taken and nearly half that 
number having been condemned), the Faction opposed to the 
Government having taken hold of the circumstance to embarrass 
and derange the administration Ellsworth, Cabot and Strong 
met at my room in order to confer on the course most advisable 
to pursue. 

The Result was that Ellsworth should go the next day to the 
President, that he shd. represent to him that the crisis was 
alarming ; that war might and probably would be the conse 
quence of these aggressions of England, unless some system cal 
culated to calm the public mind, as well as the public councils, 
was speedily adopted to avoid that scourge and to save the 
national honor, as well as to procure indemnification for the 
wrongs that our merchants had already suffered, that it would be

\ Mr. Henry Cabot Lodge, in his Life of George Cabot, p. 67, in giving an 
account of these meetings resulting in the election of Mr. Jay as the Minister 
to England, says in a note referring as his authority for Hamilton s History of 
the Republic, v. 532-5 inclusive: "Mr. Hamilton is my only authority for 
this account of the circumstances connected with the mission and the selection 
of Mr. Jay. In confirmation of his statement, he refers to minutes of the con 
ference held by Mr. Cabot and the other Senators. Where or of what nature 
these minutes are, I am unable to say ; and Mr. Hamilton offers no explanation. 
As Mr. Hamilton had access to many still unpublished documents, his oppor 
tunities for information were unusually good ; but the absence of exact refer 
ences in his work to any manuscript evidence he may have used renders this 
explanation necessary." It is all explained above. ED.

advisable, to adopt vigorous measures to put the Country in a 
posture of defence, as well by fortifying our principal commercial 
Points, as by organizing absolutely, or provisionally, an auxiliary 
military Force, by filling our arsenals and by digesting an effec 
tual plan of internal Taxes ; that these arrangements being made, 
a suitable person shd. be sent to the W. Indies for the purpose of 
ascertaining the true situation of our Property seized in the Eng 
lish Islands, and to assist our mariners and merchants in defend 
ing their Rights ; that further an Envoy extraordinary should be 
appointed and sent to England to require satisfaction for the 
loss of our Property and to adjust those points which menaced 
a war between the two Countries ; that in reference to the envoy- 
ship, Ellsworth should insinuate, that unless a person possessing 
Talents of the first order, enjoying the confidence of the friends 
of Peace and of the Government, and whose character was unex 
ceptionable in England was selected, it would be fruitless to 
make an appointment ; that under this conviction, it seemed that 
Col. Hamilton was the character whose qualifications afforded a 
very commanding preference ; and that his appointment permitted 
a rational hope that the objects of it would be obtained. 

12. March. Ellsworth executed the mission agreed on upon 
the loth instant. The President was at first reserved finally 
more communicative and apparently impressed with Ellsworth s 
representation. Some doubts were suggested respecting the 
character that Col. H. did not possess the general confidence of 
the Country that there could be no doubts in his, the Presi 
dent s, mind but that their existence was of some consequence. 

12. Mar. I intimated to R. Morris the purport of Ells 
worth s mission to the President and proposed that he should, 
if occasion offered, support it he consented to do so. 

1 8. Mar. The continued accounts from the W. Indies of the 
capture of our vessels increase the public irritation Congress 
propose an Embargo. 

26. Mar. A Letter from Skipwith, Consul at St. Eustatia, 
gives an account of the numerous captures and condemnations of 
our vessels. The House passed an Embargo for 30 days the 
Senate concur, and the Pr. approves. 

27. We this day received (Via Hatia) the new Instruction 
of the 8th Jany. revoking that of the 6th Novr. 



1794] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 519 

Propositions for sequestering all British Debts are proposed 
by Mr. Dayton in the House of Reps. 

Ap. Proposition to prohibit after day of all im 

portations from G. Britain and Ireland till satisfaction shall be 
made for spoliations on our commerce, the Delivery of the Posts, 
etc. 

Apr. 8. The President sent for R. Morris to consult him 
respecting the Envoyship to London. Morris confirms the 
course indicated by Ellsworth and decidedly supports the 
appointment of Hamilton. 

The President told him that he had thought of the Vice 
President, Hamilton, Jay and Jefferson. Morris objected to the 
first and the last ; and expressed his preference for the 
second. 

Ap. 12. Mr. Jay arrived to hold a circuit Court in Phila. 
he came to my room, the conversation soon turned to the present 
situation of the Country. I told him that the object of the 
Friends of peace was such as was agreed between Ellsworth, Cabot, 
Strong &amp; myself on the 10. Mar. ; that I had heard that the Pr. 
had mentioned the Vice President, Hamilton, Jefferson and him 
as persons whom he had thought of for the Envoyship ; that his 
friends were decided that it must be him or Hamilton. 

That so far as regarded the particular knowledge of the 
Cabinet, and the details of Commerce, Hamilton might deserve 
a preference. But that in other respects we should be perfectly 
satisfied with him ; that these points were not very important, 
and if on the other hand we consider weight of character abroad 
as well as at home, his appointment might be more advantageous 
than that of Hamilton. Besides that Hamilton was essential in 
his present station. Mr. Jay gave no Reply respecting himself 
but appeared fully to agree in the Propriety of Hamilton s 
appointment. 

We conversed respecting the Resolution before the House 
for cutting off commercial intercourse and sequestering British 
Debts. He joined me in opinion that they would frustrate all 
negotiations and said he should tell the President so when he 
saw him. 

13. April. Every effort has been made through Randolph, 
the Secry. of State, to defeat Hamilton s appointment. There is 



520 RUFUS KING. [*794 

reason to suppose that Fauchet, the French minister, has not 
failed to employ his influence to this End. Randolph in speak 
ing to Hamilton upon the subject of the appointment casually 
said " at that time I had not conversed with Mr. Fauchet." After 
further conversation Hamilton brought the Secretary back by 
observing that he had said " that at that time &amp;c " ; and then 
asked him whether Mr. Fauchet had expressed any opinion in 
opposition to the appointment. Randolph replied that he could 
not be more particular ; but the intimation which fell unguard 
edly from Randolph, being in reference to Hamilton s aversion 
to the French Revolution, may be considered as satisfactory evi 
dence of the interference of the Fr. minister. 

14. Hamilton abandons the idea of the Envoyship and ad 
dresses a letter of this date to the President representing the 
critical state of the public and proposing the appointment of Mr. 
Jay. 

The President sent for Mr. Jay the Envoyship is offered 
Mr. Jay tells him his opinion of the Resolutions before the House 
of Reps In the course of the conversation he states his Idea to 
be that the Resolutions are in the nature of a menace and that 
G. Britain would, and ought to, refuse to treat with us if they 
were adopted. 

Ap. 15. Hamilton, Strong, Cabot, Ellsworth and myself 
went to Mr. Jay this afternoon to press upon him the necessity 
which exists that he should not decline the Envoyship ; that in 
short he was the only man in whom we could confide, and that 
we deemed the situation of the Country too interesting and 
critical to permit him to hesitate. 

He did not decline. We urged the idea that he should rein 
force the opinion that the measures before the House wd. disap 
point the objects sought for in the appointment and that he 
could not consent to be Envoy charged with complaint and 
menace. 

Ap. 16. The conduct of the French or anti-English party re 
specting the Envoyship to London, when that measure was first 
agitated was somewhat extraordinary. The measure was called 
for from all quarters : the interest as well as the inclination of the 
country forbid an opposition to such measures as tended to obtain 
satisfaction for the Plunder of our commercial property, and to 



1794] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 521 

preserve the neutrality or peace of the nation. But those of this 
party who had, at the same time they appeared to consent to 
measures of a pacific nature, and calculated to close the breach 
with England, made use of their unremitted endeavours to em 
barrass the same ; and, finding the probability of an Envoy s being 
sent to England, caballed in favor of a character who from want 
of talents, or inclination, would frustrate the object of the mission. 
Gunn informed me that Randolph had proposed the Envoyship 
to Madison that the party also desired the appointment of Jef 
ferson, and that with a view of governing Butler, Monroe had in 
timated to him that it would be agreeable to the Party that he shd. 
be appointed ; that thus Butler had entertained the hope, if not a 
serious expectation, that he should be nominated ; and that his 
absence for ten days or a Fortnight from the Senate were days of 
suspense and foolish intrigue in relation to this appointment. 

That great pains had been employed to induce Jackson and 
Gunn to co-operate in measures to defeat the Mission ; and that 
after Mr. Jay s nomination, in a conversation with Butler in the 
presence of Burr, a proposition was made to him (Gunn) by But 
ler, in reply to which Gunn told him, that if he could suppose that 
he understood what he said (which from his being so frequently 
out of his head he could not believe) he would insult him. Gunn 
did not mention the purport of the Proposition and I did not urge 
him to disclose it. Gunn and Jackson both voted for the envoy- 
ship, and for the appointment of Mr. Jay. 

Ap. 1 6. The President this day nominated Mr. Jay Envoy 
Extra, to London Mr. Jay was with him in the morning and so 
far as he judged respectful, and in a decided manner expressed his 
disapprobation of the Resolutions of Mr. Dayton and Mr. Clark. 

From the Difficulty of passing particular instructions in the 
Senate, it seems to me to be most suitable that the Pr. shd. in 
struct, and that the Treaty shd. be concluded subject to the ap 
probation of the Senate. 

17 Ap. Mr. Jay s appointment opposed in the Senate. 

Mr. Monroe declared his opinion that he was not a suitable 
character, since he held opinions (as appears by his Reports while 
Secy, of for. affairs) against the interest and just claims of the 
Country. That, in the first place, in respect to the inexecution of 
the Treaty of Peace, Mr. Jay had avowed an opinion in favor of 



522 RUFUS KING. [l794 

interest upon British Debts, and secondly, had acknowledged that 
we were the first aggressors agt. the Treaty, and therefore that the 
Detention of the Posts, &amp;c., was justifiable on the part of G. 
Britain. Further that a secret Treaty existed between Spain and 
England, which probably had reference to the territorial rights of 
the former in America and consequently affected our Boundary 
and right to navigate the Mississippi ; that Mr. Jay might be 
sounded on these points, and it was well known that his opinions 
were unfriendly to our Rights and too complaisant to those of 
Sp. ; this was proved by his negotiation with Gardoqui, with whom 
he would have signed a Treaty, stipulating to forbear the use of 
the River for 25 or 30 years, and to refer the question of Bound 
ary to commissioners. 

Mr. Taylor also opposed the appointment, and upon the ground 
of incompatibility in the office of Ch. Justice and Envoy extra 
ordinary upon the idea that such an appointment would destroy 
the independence of the Judiciary by teaching them to look for 
lucrative employment from and dependent on the pleasure of the 
Executive. 

1 8th. Monroe moved for the production of Mr. Jay s Report, 
while Sec. of for. affs, upon the Brit, complaints of the violation 
of the Treaty on the part o.f the U. S., this motion was nega 
tived The day was consumed in debating the Propriety of Mr. 
Jay s appointment. On Mr. King s motion the President was re 
quested to lay before the Senate the Reports of Mr. Jay while 
Sec. of for. affairs. 

2oth April. Debate continued Burr moved the postponement 
of the nomination in order to adopt two Resolutions one, de 
claring the inexpediency of an Envoy, since we could act through 
Pinckney, the Resident minister the other that the appointment 
of a Judge to be Envoy was agt. the spirit of the Constitution, mis 
chievous and of bad policy. This motion was negatived and Mr. 
Jay s nomination approved 18 ays. to 8 nos. 

Ellsworth expressed his surprize that Burr should oppose an 
Envoy, since he had recently seen a Resolution in his handwriting 
proposing the measure. Burr said such a paper had been shown, 
but that it contained not his own opinion, but had been set down 
with other propositions wh. in conversation between three or four 
persons had been suggested for consideration. These propositions 



1794] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 523, 

Burr shewed to Mr. King some days before Mr. Jay s nomination; 
they were i. an Envoy-Extra., 2. an Embargo, 3. Sequestration of 
British Debts, 4. the organization of a corps of select militia, 5. 
categorical requisition for the delivery of the Posts and indemni 
fication for the capture of our vessels. 

Ap. 21. Hamilton, Ellsworth, Cabot, and King met Mr. Jay 
this evening to discuss the subject of Envoyship. All agreed that 
as the Pr. might give the instructions without consulting the Sen 
ate, it would be most advisable so to conduct the business, and 
that the Treaty, if any shd. be formed, should be signed subject to 
the approbation of the Senate. 

In case the inexecution of the Treaty should not be adjusted, 
it was agreed that strenuous efforts shd. be made to obtain satis 
faction for the spoliations on our Commerce, and to establish 
Rules wh. should prevail and be observed in future. On the sub 
ject of the old Treaty, that we should require its execution on the 
part of G. B. ; and, provided that they would fulfil it, and like 
wise compensate us for the capture of our vessels, that we might 
agree to allow them for the losses incurred by reason of the non 
paymt. of Debts a sum not exceeding half a million Sterg. Various 
propositions relative to a commercial Treaty, the posts, the Indian 
trade, the navigation of the Lakes, the West Indies, &amp;c, &amp;c, were 

also discussed and Mr. stated his conversation with the 

Secretary of State who appeared disposed to leave the negotiation 
open and the powers of the Envoy very discretionary. 

The following minute in Mr. King s handwriting contains 
the accounts of an interesting interview with Mr. Hammond,, 
the British Minister : 

* 

April 7th, 3. Not having met Mr. Hammond, the English 

Minister, for some weeks in public, and the Debates in the House 
of Reps, as well as the popular conversations, being angry on the 
subject of the capture of our vessels by the English Privateers, I 
concluded to make him a visit. He appeared to be pleased with 
the attention and expressed his regrets that others whom he called 
his friends had forborn to visit him for some time past. We 
soon fell into conversation relative to the situation of the two 
Countries. I expressed to him my opinion of the injustice of his. 



524 RUFUS XING. [1794 

Country in seizing our vessels ; and observed that the order of 
the 6th of Novr. 1793, the speech of Lord Dorchester to the 
Canada Indians and other circumstances led me to apprehend 
that England had actually meditated a war with us. But that 
either a more mature examination, the Reverses of the campaign, 
or some other cause seemed to have suspended, if not changed, 
her intentions. He replied with apparent candor by observing 
that he would admit what he had not been willing should be sup 
posed to be the Fact, that Dorchester s speech was genuine ; that 
he had hoped it would not have found its way to the public, since 
he would tell me in confidence that Dorchester was not authorized 
to have made the speech ; that with regard to the order of the 
6th of November, when we should know the unworthy and preva 
lent Practices of our Merchants, in covering with their names, &amp; 
our Flag, french property, it would appear less extraordinary that 
the order in question should have been issued ; that the subse 
quent instruction of the 8th. of Jan y revoked it and that Lord 
Grenville had declared that unless the vessel would have been 
liable to condemnation, independent of the existence of that 
order, no condemnation could be had under, or in virtue of, it. 

That by our own principles, we had no ground of complaint 
till we had pursued our claim to the highest judiciary Tribunals 
of the English nation ; that there was no Doubt that every facil 
ity would be given on the subject of appeals, and that all irregu 
larities would be corrected in the court of appeals. 

I remarked that the generality and peculiar nature of these 
cases took them out of this Rule, and that where distribution had 
been already made, the Remedy would prove ineffectual ; that 
therefore upon the principles of the last, or revoking instruction 
the nation would be bound to give us compensation. 

He said he did not believe this would be done that difficulties 
would exist of such a nature as would prevent compensation, 
that no money would be paid unless by consent of Parliament, 
and that the personal embarassments to which the ministry would 
be liable by pursuing this course would forbid an expectation that 
it would be adopted. 

I remarked that these were small considerations that indeed 
there seemed to be a series of Difficulties of the like size, which 



1794] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 525 

had, and which, I feared, would in future, prevent that good un 
derstanding between the two Countries, which their respective in 
terest so evidently required that the subject of British Debts, 
the payment for the negroes and the Posts, were all of no value 
or consequence to G. Britain that the two former were really of 
small consideration to us. But that our nation was young, that 
we were still new in the management of national affairs and that 
it was not easy with us, as with them, to decide questions of this 
nature, especially when they mingle with them private interest and 
political prejudice that the loss of the whole debt was nothing 
when compared with the loss of a good understanding between 
the two nations. 

He replied that we did not differ materially in our opinion, 
and said that it was difficult to write with that Freedom with 
which we could speak, but that he believed if he could return to 
England, he could effect a settlement of all points between the 
Countries that the merchants in England were very troublesome 
to the ministry that their representations and complaints had 
proved pernicious ; but that he was of opinion that they ought 
not to be so much attended to. He said he was happy to hear 
that the President thought of sending an Envoy to England ; that 
he had written to Lord Grenville that this would probably be the 
case, and that Mr. Jay, Mr. Hamilton, or I would be sent. 

In conclusion he observed, that he told Lord Grenville that he 
preferred the American Legation to any other ; that he had been 
a whig in the American Revolution ; that he had desired to see 
the best possible connections of Friendship and Commerce re 
newed and confirmed between the two nations ; that he had 
believed that the real interest of England would be advanced by 
such connexion, and by being the Instrument to effect that 
measure he had flattered himself with thereby obtaining reputa 
tion and esteem. 

In R. King s handwriting, we find this account of a debate 
in the Senate, May 6, 1794. 

Monroe, seconded by Taylor, in pursuance of an instruction 
from the Legislature of Virginia, and notice of yesterday, moved 



526 RUFUS KING. [i?94 

for leave to bring in a Bill providing under certain limitations, 
for the suspension of the Fourth Article of the Treaty of peace 
between the United States and Great Britain. 

Strong, opposed, because it admits that we have violated the 
Treaty, and we have no better right to say we will cease to exe 
cute until you have executed, than they have to use the same 
language. In the eastern states the Treaty has been complied 
with the law proposed will be partial, applying to some and not 
to other states. If we ask for Justice, Equity says we shd. do it 
with clean hand. 

Izard I do not discuss the policy of the proposed measure, 
but I ask by what right we can suspend. Will the judiciary 
regard your law is not the Treaty paramount to the Law ? 

Jackson The measure appears to proceed from an obedience 
to instruction rather than from the Judgment of the Movers. 
The measures already adopted are pacific &amp;c, and we are to pay 
no attention to the great property in the hands of the British. 
Is it prudent to take irritating measures which may produce a 
sacrifice of our Ships and Cargoes in the hands of the British ? 

Taylor I disapprove of the mild and supplicating course 
marked out for America. We shall proceed until the People can 
no longer be restrained. With regard to the Justice, the Law of 
nations requires the strong nation to perform the first act we 
have a right to require of G. B. to perform the Treaty on her 
Part. Besides we ought in the south to be attended to as well as 
our Brethren in the east. Our negroes and the Posts shd. be 
attended to as well as the Spoliations on our Commerce. The 
former is an old wrong, the latter is a recent one. An Envoy is 
dispatched to obtain redress on the latter point, the former is 
regarded with cold attention, and negroes and posts will be sac 
rificed to obtain satisfaction for commercial spoliation. We are 
not influenced by our being Debtors I never knew a Legislature 
in Virginia in wh. \ of the members were British Debtors. I owe 
nothing, nor do I believe that any of my Relations which are 
numerous owe 20 british money to a British subject. 

The previous question was put and failed. On the main 
question to give leave to bring in the Bill, it passed in the nega 
tive, Taylor and Monroe only in the affirmative. Vining, Gunn,

Rutherford, Bradley and Mitchell were out of town ; Robinson 
was in the Senate in the morning, but had retired before the dis 
cussion ; Burr was at his lodging and Frelinghuysen sent him a 
note informing him the subject was debating ; Jackson, Butler, 
Hawkins, Brown and Edwards retired to the lobby when the 
question was about to be put, and Martin was excused from voting 
at his own request. 



CHAPTER XXX. 

Albert Gallatin s Right to a Seat as Senator from Pennsylvania questioned 
His Statement Debate upon It R. King s Speech against his Claim 
Senate Doors opened to the Public during Legislative Business. 

Albert Gallatin was chosen a Senator of the United States 
by the Legislature of Pennsylvania on February 28, 1793, 
and took his seat in the Senate on December 2d of that 
year. On the same day * a petition of Conrad Laub and 
others was presented in the Senate against the right of Mr. 
Gallatin to a seat in that body upon the ground that he had 
not been a citizen of the United States for nine years at the 
time of his election, as required by the Constitution. 

The matter was referred to a Committee of the Senate, 
which, after summoning and hearing the petitioners and Mr. 
Gallatin, reported on February 10, 1794, the evidence they 
had taken as to the facts furnished by the former, and the 
reasons afterwards assigned by Mr. Gallatin why he should 
not be called upon "to adduce evidence on his part at the 
present stage of the enquiry," which plea the committee 
deemed not sufficient. The report concluded with a resolu 
tion "that in the opinion of the committee it is now incum 
bent on Mr. Gallatin to shew that he has become a citizen 
of the United States and when. . . . This resolution 
was read to him and he informed the committee he should 
rely on the answer he had before given," that is, that he 
conceived " fr,om the evident construction of the resolution 
[appointing the committee] I have a right to have the

1794] RUFUS KING. 529 

question decided by the Senate ... as the sufficiency of 
the parties and the matter charged in the petition," reserv 
ing to himself the right afterwards, if the case were decided 
against him by the Senate, to collect evidence and produce 
testimony in his favor. 

In the course of the discussion which followed, Mr. Gal- 
latin on the i /th made a speech, denying the competency 
of the petitioners and alleging the insufficiency of the 
evidence, for which reasons the parties should be non-suited. 
But that he had prepared a statement of facts, which in con 
sequence of certain observations made by a Senator from S. 
Carolina, [Mr. William Smith ED.] from a sense of duty to 
the Legislature of Pennsylvania, which, in case a vacancy 
were declared, might supply his place, he would present the 
next day. The facts were few on w r hich he would want proof 
namely that of residence and that of occupation, and it 
would take time to collect them. Thus he took upon him 
self the burden of proof. 

" A Statement* of facts was agreed upon between him and the 

* Albert Gallatin was born at Geneva, on the 2gih day of January, 1761. He 
left that place for the United States in April or May, 1780, arrived in Boston 
(Massachusetts) on the I4th or 15th of July of the same year, and has ever since 
resided within the United States. In October, 1780, he removed from Boston 
to Machias, in the Province of Maine, in which place and its neighborhood he 
resided one year, and commenced a settlement on a tract of vacant land. 
During that time he furnished, out of his own funds, supplies (amounting in 
value to more than sixty pounds Massachusetts currency) to Colonel John 
Allen, who was the commanding officer stationed there, and also Superinten 
dent of Indian Affairs for the Eastern Department, for the use of the American 
troops, and on several occasions acted as a volunteer under the same officer s 
command. For the said supplies he received, one year after, a warrant on the 
treasury of the State of Massachusetts, which he sold at a considerable depre 
ciation. In October, 1781, he returned to Boston ; and in the spring of 1782, 
was, by a vote of the Corporation of the University of Cambridge (otherwise 
called Harvard College), chosen instructor of the French language of the said 
University. By the same vote he was allowed a room in the college, the priv 
ilege of the Commons at the tutor s table, the use of the library, and also 
the right of having his pay (which depended on the voluntary subscription 

and attendance of students) collected by the steward of the institution, together

petitioners counsel, which being delivered to the Senate," Mr. 
Gallatin claimed in a second speech on the 2oth, that by the 
statement he proved that he had been a citizen more than thir 
teen years, was so before the Treaty of Peace and before the 
Ratification of the Confederation ; and proceeded to show this, 
basing his citizenship on the 4th Article of the Confederation 
" Citizenship the free inhabitants entitled to the rights of free 
citizens, &amp;c. ratified i. March / 87." This statute explains the 
law of nature, by which, in consequence of the Revolution, the 
question of citizenship must be established, the law of Allegiance 
to the King being overthrown. He was then an inhabitant and 
therefore a citizen. 

This plea was immediately answered by Mr. Lewis of Va., who 
acted as counsel for the petitioners, controverting this principle 
as well as other points of the statement upon which the argument 
turned, alleging that an oath of allegiance to the State of Vir 
ginia in Oct. 1785, gave no right as a citizen ; this oath, as the 
naturalization passed in October 1783, could not retrospect, and 
another oath was required to obtain the citizenship under that 
law ; mere inhabitancy never supposed naturalization. Legisla 
tures pass special acts for the purpose. Mr. Gallatin in a third 
speech in reply to Mr. Lewis said in substance that if he was not 
a citizen before his oath of allegiance to Virginia in 1785, he be 
came so by that oath which retrospected to his Birth or first 

with the other charges against the students for board and education. Those 
terms he accepted, and remained in that station for the term of one year. In 
July, 1783, he removed to Pennsylvania, and in November of the same year 
proceeded to Virginia, in which State he had purchased more than a thousand 
acres of land (and amounting to more than one hundred pounds Virginia cur 
rency in value) some time between July and November, 1783. Between this 
last mentioned period and the month of October, 1785, he purchased other 
lands in the said State to a very large amount, and in the said last mentioned 
month he took an oath of allegiance to the said State. In December, 1785, he 
purchased the plantation in Fayette county in Pennsylvania, on which he has 
lived ever since. In October, 1789, he was elected member of the convention 
to amend the Constitution of Pennsylvania, and in October, 1790, 1791, and 
1792, he was elected member of the Legislature of the same State. On the 
28th of February, 1793, he was chosen Senator to represent the said State in 
the Senate of the United States, and took his seat in December following.

arrival in America and that the oath of allegiance meant both 
oaths required by the Virginia law it was not necessary to 
specify the two oaths that residence was required to enable 
him to enjoy the privilege of electing or being elected. He was 
a citizen, with that inability, by the law of nature, the common law 
of America &amp; its statutes. By the declaration of independence, 
allegiance was no longer feudal or personal, but was founded on 
reason and nature, an allegiance to society of which the subt. was 
a member, not to the confederate states, but to the states sever 
ally. The confederation made a change and the allegiance was 
transferred from the states to the U. States. Every man who 
took a share in the Revolution became a citizen, unless there was 
some law defining how aliens should become citizens for a per 
son who took a share might have been punished as a traitor, 
&amp; he had in Massachusetts in 1780 furnished supplies for the use 
of the American troops and on several occasions acted as a volun 
teer in Machias, where he resided a year. " But I rely on the 
law of nature and of reason : he who aided the Revolution 
was thereby a citizen. He relied on the 4th Article of the Con 
federation, which related not only to commercial regulations, but 
was more comprehensive. The counsel contended that Free 
inhabitants means citizens in that article, but he claimed that 
where two words are used in the same sentence and not exactly 
of the same import they must be construed to have different mean 
ings which was here the case as evidenced by the practice of 
several states before and since the present constitution." Free 
inhabitants, that is they are thereby declared citizens his idea 
was that a free inhabitant possessing the qualification of a citizen 
shall be in all the states entitled to the rights of citizens, as by the 
article of the Confederation, Inhabitants are declared citizens in 
all the states a general naturalization &amp; reciprocity among the 
states. 

9 years requisite by the constitution was a disqualifying and 
disfranchising law which must be construed strictly &amp;, if doubt 
ful, is in his favor, if he slid, not be proved to be 9 years a 
citizen. 

The preceding summary of the grounds on which Mr. 
Gallatin based his claim of citizenship, and of the argument 



532 XUFUS KING. [*794 

by which he sustained himself, has been given to enable us 
to present the answer to these points, which we find among 
Mr. King s papers, an answer which, taking each one in de 
tail, shows their fallacy,* not that this was the only re 
sponse, for after each of Mr. Gallatirfs speeches, Mr. Lewis, 
the counsel for the petitioner, gave a clear and definite 
argument to meet each of his points. But this speech is a 
complete showing of the whole case and of the grounds on 
which it was settled against him. 

* Among those who opposed the petition and maintained the right of the 
returned member to his seat, were John Taylor of Virginia, Mr. Monroe, and 
Mr. Burr ; on the other side were Ellsworth, Strong, King, aud their political 
friends. "To Mr. King, it was assigned to answer Mr. Burr, if he should 
take part in the debate. Otherwise he was not to speak. Mr. Burr did not 
rise to address the chair until the president had proceeded halfway in putting 
the question ; he then commenced and went through a discourse of considerable 
ingenuity. When he had finished. Mr. King immediately replied ; and is said 
to have displayed his talents as an orator more powerfully than on any occasion 
during his whole life. An able judge of eloquence, and one of the first men 
of our country, represents the exhibition as transcending anything that modern, 
if not ancient times, ever produced. He says the orator worked himself up 
into such a fervour that he leapt from the floor, and that, extravagant as this 
action may now appear, it was no more then than the action suited to the 
word. ... Of late years it has been observed, that Mr. King has, with 
few exceptions, chastised the ardour of his public discourses, and has made 
the animation of his manner give place to a more calm and dignified modera 
tion." WILLIAM COLEMAN, Sketch of Rufus King, Delaplaines Repository, 
vol. i., p. 184. 

In the year 1793, Albert Gallatin was appointed a Senator of the United 
States by the State of Pennsylvania. On claiming his seat in January, 1794, 
a petition was presented against his admission into that body, on the ground 
that he had not been a citizen the requisite number of years. The subject was 
referred to a committee of seven. Their report elicited a warm debate, which 
continued for several days. Col. Burr took an active part and greatly distin 
guished himself in support of Mr. Gallatin s claim. His colleague, Mr. King, 
had taken the lead against the right of Mr. Gallatin to a seat. Mr. Taylor, of 
Caroline, Va., addressed a note to Col. Burr, in which he says : " We shall leave 
you to reply to Mr. King ; first, because you desired it ; second, all depends 
upon it ; no one else can do it, and the audience will expect it." The resolu 
tion vacating the election, on the ground of his " not having been a citizen of 
the United States, the term of years required as a qualification to be a Senator 
of the United States was passed by a vote of 14 to 12." Mem. of A. Burr :. 
Davis, i., 406.

It begins with a statement of Mr. Gallatin s points : 

1. By co-operating in the war, and contributing to its success 
by being engaged in a common risque, a common interest, citi 
zenship was obtained. 

2. By being in Massachusetts after the adoption, but before 
the commencement, of the administration of Government, citi 
zenship was obtained. 

3. By being a Resident in Massachusetts in Mar. 1781, when 
the Confederation was ratified, citizenship was obtained, because 
that instrument is a general naturalization of all aliens inhabiting 
the U. S. 

4. By naturalization in Virginia in Oct. 1785, I have been 9 
yrs. a citizen, since that naturalization relates back to my natural 
or territorial Birth. 

ist. It is truly said that the Declaration of Ind. laid the 
foundations of, and gave birth to 13 independent States or Bodies 
politic, composed of those subjects of G. B. who were the asso 
ciate or contracting Parties : their date is the 4th July, and not 
that of the treaty of peace, or at any intermediate epoch. Mass, 
was therefore on the arrival of Mr. Gain, a nation in league with 
others and engaged in war with G. Brit. The assistance that a 
stranger afforded her in that war would not make him a citizen 
any more than aid afforded to any old nation engaged in war wd. 
make the character affording it a citizen ; his arrival at such a 
period did not give him citizenship, more than at a period of 
peace. No authority can be shewn that such a law is common to 
all nations, natural Law gives no such right. A Society is a col 
lection of associates ; to belong to it requires mutual consent and 
thus every nation has some process whereby strangers are adopted 
who ask it. If any law has ever existed, as perhaps has been the 
case in some instances, it has depended on the laws of particular 
societies or nations. Masstts. never adopted such law, therefore 
it cannot have been. It is unnecessary for a nation to pass a law 
agt. the adoption of Foreigners, since unless it makes a law in 
favor of such adoption, the event cannot exist. It is a mistake 
that natural Law, Reason or Practice will authorize a man to be 
come a member of a nation without its consent generally or 
specially given. 



534 RUFUS KING. 



2nd. The reform of the Constitution of Mass, in .80 can 
give no such Right. Mass, was immediately on the Decn. of 
Indep. a nation, a body politic, a civil society, and has continued 
so ever since, notwithstanding any clause it may have made in its 
civil Constitution ; when a Monarchy is changed to a Republic, 
or a Repub. to a Monarchy, it is (says Rutherford) the constitu 
tional compact that is changed and not the social compact. The 
french nation or society is the same, tho her Constitution is 
changed ; and tho she is struggling in war to support that change ; 
Treaties made with the nation before the change are still in force 
notwithstanding the Form of Govt. is changed ; and for this rea 
son the social compact remains, tho the form of Govt. or consti 
tutional Compact is changed. 

But admitting that changing or reforming the constitutional 
compact or scheme of Govt. involved the idea of a dissolution 
of the social compact, and that all persons present, and expressly 
and tacitly consenting, were included in the new Society, yet the 
case of Mr. Gal. is not within the Rule ; for the reform or estab 
lishment of the constitution was a compact between the people 
present the i5th of June 1780 ; the compact was then Completed 
and finished and the administration under it commenced in Octo 
ber following. In the intermediate Time, the people were en 
gaged in electing the Officers and taking the requisite steps to 
commence the actual administration. It was a contract executed 
in June to be carried into effect in Oct. Mr. G., who arrived in 
the intermediate time was no more a party to the contract, than 
he who arrived at any period subsequent to Oct. But the first 
position is that which destroys Cavil and removes all Doubts on 
the Question ; a change of Govt. is one thing, a social compact 
is another the first is frequent, the last is rare. 

3rd. It is urged by Mr. G. that he became a citizen of the 
U. S. in virtue of the Confed. Art. 4, 1781 Mar. ; Decln. destroyed 
allegiance to the King, and thirteen independent States arose, the 
members of wh. immediately owed allegiance to the States respec 
tively in 1781. A new moral personage was formed by the Con- 
fedr. and by the 4th Art. of it all the free Inhab. (that is Inhabts. 
not slaves) were naturalized and made citizens, not of the several 
states but of the U. S., to which personage they afterwards owed 
Allegiance ; that he was then a free Inhabitant of Mass, and \vas 



1794] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 535 

in virtue of this general naturalization made a citizen of the 
U. S. Before the Confed. there were no citizens of the U. S. ; the 
character was thereby created, and in consequence it is required 
that a Senator should have been 9 yrs. a citizen of the U. S. 

First, on the Decl. of Ind. 13 new and separate states arose 
these were independent and their citizens aliens. 

2nd. The confed. did not abolish the sovereignty or Indep., 
nor did it create a general naturalization whereby the Citizens 
ceased to be Citizens of a particular state and become those of 
the U. S. No characters of the last description in strictness 
ever existed. No allegiance was ever due to the U. S. ; they had 
no law agt. Treason, nor had they power to erect courts to try 
such an offence ; Admitting that free Inhabitant describes a 
character who was not a citizen, and that the naturalization of 
free Inhabs. took place, Mr. G. was not a free Inhab, since 12 
months residence is requisite to gain such Inhabitancy as wd. 
charge a town with the support of a Pauper, and since the higher 
privileges of Inhabitancy are never gained in Mass, without the 
consent of the Town or the selectmen, (see Laws page 21.126 
(225) in the sense of ballot Mr. G. was not an Inhab. of Mass in 
Mar. 1781. 

But no such meaning as that contended for can be authorized 
by the article. If by free Inhab. is understood Inhabitants who 
are not, as well as those who are citizens, and it is admitted that 
the 4th Art. is a general naturalization, it follows that all aliens 
who for 8 months, and indeed for one month, or one week shall 
remain in the U. S. would, in virtue of the article become ipso 
facto, and that without request, and perhaps against their Con 
sent, be citizens of the U. S. All for. merchants who then, or 
between that period and the adoption of the new Cons., resided 
among us have been naturalized and that without their knowledge, 
against their consent and interest. 

All persons who at the period and during any portion of the 
term aforesaid happened to be within the U. S. were changed 
from For. to Citizens ; the weary Traveller in his first slumber, 
and while he still fondly dreamed of his beloved home, was 
changed, and altho he slept a Briton he awoke an American 
Citizen. The magic is so pleasing that one could almost wish 
the Dream was real. 



536 RUFUS KING. [i794 

The social Contract converts the several associates into one 
moral Person or Body Politic. This personage is composed of 
the contracting parties ; it continues by a succession by Birth and 
by additions by adoption or naturalization ; to whom allegiance 
is due I don t enquire ; I ask is A. B. a member of the Body 
Politic ? In reason every such addition supposes a renewal of 
the contract between the Body Politic and the adopted member 
the consent of both parties is requisite. All persons are in 
legal contemplation members of some one nation ; this relation 
continues until they are adopted or naturalized by some other 
nation : no nation except in peculiar instances adopts or natural 
izes without the request, much less agt. the will, of the member 
of another society ; some formality which is individual and ex 
press accompanies naturalization. A citizen is bound by Duties 
to which an alien is a stranger ; he may not have them required 
of him without having consented to become a citizen, he ought 
not silently to be embarrassed with a double allegiance ; in short 
no doctrine is less supported than that which teaches that a 
nation may at their Pleasure adopt the citizens of another nation 
without their Consent or application it certainly goes too far. 

Besides this doctrine is not only novel and unreasonable, but 
against contemporary exposition, and indeed is repugnant to 
laws wh. may fairly be deemed, declaratory of the meaning of the 
article. 

By the construction insisted on, every foreigner, who before the 
new constitution and after the adoption of the Confed. came into 
this country and resided here a term, though not exceeding 8 
months, became a citizen of the U. S. To such who did not desire 
this character such a law would be embarrassing to those, on the 
other hand, who did, the law would prove highly convenient, since 
no expence, trouble, delay nor oaths were required ; while a pro 
vision so extensive, and so easily and economically to be em 
ployed was in existence. It was not necessary that the States shd. 
pass special Laws of Naturalization, or Laws marking out another 
course whereby naturalization might be accomplished, &amp; who 
would have recourse to either mode while the fourth article of the 
Confed. furnished one so much easier, and which of the Legisla 
tures wd. have passed laws in a case in respect tc wh. the most 
ample Provision already existed ? 



17941 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 537 

That the Legislatures of many, and most probably all the States 
passed such Laws during the time referred to is not to be doubted. 
In respect to most of the States the Fact may be proved. Mass, 
passed as many as 14 special acts of naturalization within that 
period. New York also passed many such acts, Virginia passed 
in 1783 a Law prescribing a course whereby naturalization might 
be effected in that State. Indeed, the acts of Legislatures, some 
of which recite that the person to be naturalized had resided sev 
eral years within the State which naturalized them, in addition to 
the universal practice and opinion that an oath must be taken and 
a Proceeding had whereby the Fact of naturalization shd. be man 
ifested and some record thereof be preserved, must be considered 
as a satisfactory Refutation of the Construction contended for. 

It may be asked, if the interpretation insisted on is not correct, 
what is the reasonable and true meaning of the Article ? I answer 
that as in a statute the Preamble is sometimes a Key, with which 
to unlock and expose the meaning of the Law, so here the object 
of the article furnishes a guide to explain it : this object was 
twofold, the securing and perpetuating mutual Friendship and 
intercourse among the people of the different states ; and the 
article attains it first by removing the Disability of alienage in all 
cases in which a citizen removed from one state to reside in an 
other ; and 2ndly, by securing to the citizens of each state aright 
of ingress and regress to and from and of trade and commerce in 
any other state, upon the Terms enjoyed by the citizens of such 
other state ; with one privilege beyond them, that of carrying 
under any circumstances out of a state any Property brought 
within it. 

Not only the accomplishment of the object of the article is ef 
fected by this construction, the inconveniences of the one con 
tended for avoided, and the acts of the Legislatures of the several 
states made requisite and proper ; but the Terms are made to ex 
press their natural and familiar meaning. The word People is 
said to comprehend aliens as well as associates or citizens. There 
may be some authority for this opinion, I, however, am unac 
quainted with it ; especially in the sense of the article. " The 
People of the different states " is the aggregate of the People of 
the several states. The People of France are the citizens of 
France, as distinguished from the People of England, or of any 



538 XUFUS KING. [i794 

other country. The People of New York are the citizens of that 
state ; the process or command is in the name of " the People of 
New York " : this excludes aliens since they cannot be imagined 
to have any authority to issue commands to the magistrates of 
that State. 

The free Inhabitants of each state are said by Mr. Gal. to in 
clude aliens. The free inhabitants of each state is not the word 
of in this case equivalent to the words belonging to ? The house, 
or ship, of A. B., is the house or ship belonging to A. B. The 
ships of England are those belonging to England. The Inhabit 
ants of England are those belonging to England, or English In 
habitants. The free Inhabitants of a state may not express the 
same idea as the free Inhabs. in a state. A Citizen of New York, 
and a Citizen in New York may be different characters ; one 
must belong to New York, the other may belong to Pennsylvania, 
or to France. I infer from this criticism that the Term free In- 
hab. in this instance means Citizen ; and the clause is thus plain ; 
for it removes the Disability of Alienage and permits the Citizen 
of one state without Naturalization to remove to and become a 
Citizen in any other of the states thus promotes and secures 
mutual Friendship. 

The object of the 2nd member of the Paragraph is to secure 
mutual intercourse by Trade and transit among the People of the 
difft. States ; it asserts that the People of each state shall, &amp;c. 
The term the People of each State must here be interpreted in the 
manner before contended for, or this consequence will ensue ; 
that an Alien in New York, who in all his commercial transac 
tions there paid Alien Duties, by removing to Massachusetts 
would be exempt from alien Duties and enjoy the privileges of 
Trade &amp; Commerce as a Citizen so absurd a provision could 
never have been intended. The necessary interpretation is there 
fore that which has already been explained. 

Free Inhabs. in the first clause means the same as Inhabitant 
in the second ; in the second it necessarily means citizen ; there 
fore the Term free Inhab. in the first clause means citizen. 

The result of this debate was that, by a vote of 14 to 12, 
it was decided that Mr. Gallatin was not entitled to his seat, 



1794] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 539 

not having been a citizen of the United States nine years 
before his election. 

It may be proper here to mention an incident connected 
with this examination of the right of Mr. Gallatin to a seat 
in the Senate, as it changed the practice of the Senate to sit 
with closed doors at all times. As before mentioned, there 
had been many attempts to have them open when it was 
acting in a legislative capacity, so that those who chose 
might listen to the debates, but they had all failed, until, on 
February 11, 1794, a resolution was passed "that the doors 
of the Senate be opened during the discussion of the con 
tested claim of Mr. Gallatin." A few days afterwards, on 
February 2Oth, a resolution was adopted : 

"That after the present session of Congress and as soon as 
suitable galleries shall be provided . . . the said galleries 
shall be permitted to be opened every morning so long as the 
Senate shall be engaged in their legislative capacity, unless in 
such cases as may, in the opinion of the Senate, require secrecy, 
after which the said galleries shall be closed." 

This rule of order now governs the proceedings of the 
Senate. 

Mr. King uniformly voted in favor of having the legisla 
tive debates open to the public.

R. TROUP TO R. KING. 

NEW YORK, Jan. i, 1794. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

What a pleasant thing it is to see Jefferson, Randolph &amp; Genet 
by the ears ! All has ended well. There are now very few of 
Genet s friends, who have the hardiness to advocate his conduct. 
Brockholst &amp; Co. have been compelled to change the subject of 
clamor, and are endeavouring to excite hostilities against Great 
Britain for making a peace between the Portuguese &amp; Algerines. 
Upon this subject I have found some good men entertaining wild 
notions : but my hope is that the General Government will act with 
out prejudice &amp; that they will calculate with all possible accuracy 
the advantages we should obtain by engaging in a war. The great 
mass of our fellow citizens, most respectable for character &amp; 
property still preserve their wishes for peace. 

. . . It has been suggested to me that there may be an 
attempt to oust Lawrance of the direction (Bank of the U. States); 
&amp; after mature reflection I cannot help concluding that the at 
tempt would be impolitic in several respects. I think I can clearly 
see the distance between him and his old friends daily growing 
wider : and the force of a feather would almost throw him into 
the arms of our enemies. In the present state of things would it 
be wise to disgust him in such a manner as totally to alienate his 

540 



1794] RUFUS KING. 541 

attachment from us ? If this question should strike your mind 
in the same light it does mine, you will exert yourself to keep him 
in the Direction. 

Very sincerely your friend, 

ROB. TROUP. 



J. LAWRANCE TO R. KING, PHILA. 

NEW YORK, Jan. 12, 1794. 

Tomorrow we are informed the Commercial Battle commences 
in the House of Representatives.* I am of opinion that something 
ought to be done on the subject, but doubt whether the present 
moment is the proper one I would rather do it immediately 
on the close of the European war, than while it continues. Eng 
land has acted a very pitiful part towards us : notwithstanding 
a sense of what is our Interest to do, and not what she deserves 
from us, would actuate me ; but some day or other I hope we shall 
be able to make the most of our situation without apprehension 
from any of the European Powers. We grow fast now but 
should very much increase had we the possession of those advan 
tages nature intended we should have. 

It is to be hoped the Clamours of those, who pretend to very 
much republicanism will now cease respecting the connection of 
those in the Government with the Bank. I perceive you are all out, 
with yourself it was design but how did it happen with respect 
to the others. I have been silent lately in my communications to 
you, as I was informed my being the person, who was the cause 
of Mr. Gelston s Appointment in the Branch, was to extinguish 
my pretensions to a re-election. What occasioned an alteration 
in the opinion of these Gentlemen ? 

You no doubt have seen our latest European Intelligence. I 
believe Peace is not far off and should not be surprised if we

ALBANY, 22d Jany, 1794. 
SIR: 

In consequence of our former acquaintance, I take the Liberty 
to address you on a subject which I suppose will come officially 
before you &amp; in which I am deeply Interested. 

Being a proprietor in the Glass House here, we had it in con 
templation to have Petitioned Congress for an increase of the 
duties on Glass to 20 or 25 per cent previous to the Meeting of 
the present Congress. Our Intentions have received additional 
Support, in consequence of Mr. Jefferson s Report, and Mr. 
Madison s Bill on the subject of increasing the duties, in which to 
our Surprize Glass is omitted. 

Gen. Gordon will present our Petition and we ground our 
hopes of success on these facts. 

First. We are now encreasing the Plan of our Works on so 
Large a Scale, that we shall probably make Annually to the Value 
of ^"lo.ooo in Glass. 

Second. The Increased price of Labor (a heavy expence 
since we have now nearly 100 men employed in various branches) 
and several essential ingredients, particularly Salt, in consequence 
of the War. 

Besides which the National Convention having stopped all ex 
ports from France, except Silks and Glass, the consequence has 
been that Large quantities of Glass have arrived in the Port of 
New York, &amp; we presume in other parts of America, which has 
been received and is selling at a reduced price greatly to our 
prejudice. . . . 

Yours cordially,

C. GORE TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, March 3, 1794. 
MY DEAR FRIEND : 

I have the pleasure to inform you that the town meeting call d 
by Jarvis and others to influence the votes of our representatives 
on Madison s resolutions, ended in a compleat overthrow of those 
who advocated the interference of the town. It is said that we 
owe very much to Eustis, Jones &amp; Codman and Lyman. Otis 
also took a decided part and greatly aided the cause of good 
government &amp; order. Jarvis and Austin descended to personal 
abuse ; their supporters clappd. and huzza d applauses on their 
harangues ; they hiss d when the opponents spake ; but all this 
was without avail, and was in no instance imitated by those who 
supported the conduct of our representatives. The majority was 
more than two thirds ; the minority included none who were even 
known to the town except Jarvis, Austin and Nath. Fellows ; and 
a paper declaratory of the sentiments of more than three hundred 
persons concerned in trade has received their Signature and been 
forwarded to Cabot and Ames ; this was read with great force in 
the meeting. 

A vessel arrived yesterday from Bermuda &amp; New Providence 
and brings accounts of our vessels being discharg d that were car 
ried into those places. Some property belonging to Higginson &amp; 
others hath been restored, and vessels bound from the french W. 
Indies to Europe have been discharg d by their Courts and 
damages paid for their capture and detention. This has come 
very opportunely, and materially affects some Merchants who 
were hardly induc d to vote against the report of the committee. 
Our merchants now enjoy great spirits and feel that they can carry 
any point they choose : but we are not to expect they will always 
be so active and persevering as in this instance. 

Affectionately yours, 

C. GORE.

his present good intentions towards the Executive. I am sorry 
though to learn that Mr. Pinckney s dispatches are not flattering

threatning nature. I congratulate you with your success in 
ousting Citizen Gallatin, that s one great object gained. 

By the papers of this day you will see the resolves of the Com 
mittee, whh. are not much thought of. You will also perceive 
that from the Chamber of Commerce whereby it appears that no 
application has been made to their Committee, to complain to 
the Executive as to the injuries committed on our Flag by the 
Nations at war. This shows that the meeting were not composed 
of great sufferers, and that evidently they had a different object 
in View. Yet I must confess that I feel alarmed at our present 
Situation. . .

although 6. o clock, to that degree, that their noise makes me feel 
disagreeable, and I wish that it was done on some other occasion more

I am truly thankful to you for the contents of your kind letter 
dated 2. March and am sorry thereby to perceive the gloomy 
appearance of our being involved in the general Calamities of 
Europe. Last evening arrived here the Brig Morning Star be 
longing to this port from Carthagena. She confirms the surren 
der or evacuation of Toulon on the i9th December. The British 
got their fleet safe out, with only two French ships of the line &amp; 
4 Frigates ; the remainder of the ships found there, they were 
compelled to burn, with the arsenals, stores, &amp;c. 4000 inhabit 
ants left behind were driven in a square and there massacred by 
the French when they took possession ; some say the number 
was 10 thousand. The Spaniards suffered considerably at the 
evacuation ; part of their troops were arrived at Carthagena, be 
fore the sailing of the Morning Star. Some of the poor unfortu 
nate Refugees have actually come passengers in the Vessel. 

Our bells have been ringing since daylight to celebrate an act 
wh. if true, disgraces human nature.

by some moderate men, who are attached to the general Govern

&amp; I suppose that we shall remain so. 

You will perceive the abandonment of Toulon by the British &amp; 
Spaniards, is now well authenticated. The combined Powers are 
very much in disgrace. The Campaign being a very unsuccess 
ful one, it is to be hoped they will desist from prosecuting any 
farther the objects of their combination. I cannot induce myself

R. KING TO C. GORE. 

PHILADELPHIA, 10 March, 1794. 
DEAR SIR : 

Your letter of the 3d afforded us some satisfaction so far as it 
authorises a belief that the late vexatious seizures of our vessels 
in the West Indies have been without authority. We are still 
however anxious upon that subject the very general capture, and 
the condemnation in several cases, of vessels engaged in a com 
merce beyond all doubt lawful, is an affair of great embarrass 
ment ; and which may assume a character of great political 
Importance. 

If without notice, and before the Commencement of military 
operations in those seas, they should condemn our Property 
already, and which still may be, captured, the inference is too 
obvious not to be alarming. 

I hope a general Release and indemnification will take place ; 
but this transaction together with some other circumstances of an 
unpleasant nature, admonish us to prepare for the worst. 

It will be our object to preserve peace but it is our Duty to 
adopt measures to place the Country in a state of greater security. 

We must, and shall, attempt to fortify our principal Harbours 
to equip a number of stout Frigates, to engage a respectable 
military force to be provisionally employed, and also to impose 
some internal taxes. 

We shall, when these arrangements shall have been taken, be 
able to insist upon our Neutral Rights with a greater prospect of 
success, and by that means we shall possess a more rational 
foundation to expect the enjoyment of Peace.

DEAR SIR : 

. . . As I am advanced in life &amp; my infirmities increase, I 
wou d suggest to you the resigning your seat in the Senate, as I 
think you can do it with honor &amp; propriety in my present situa 
tion especially, for when I get out, it will not be in my power to 
continue the care of my own affairs, &amp; yours of course will require 
attention ; as our Legislature are now in session (if it accords 
with your sentiments) it may be as proper a time as any. How 
ever this must rest on your determination ; it wou d give Mrs. 
King pleasure &amp; me satisfaction to have you at home. We are 
all well but myself. 

Yours most affectionately,

J. WATSON TO R. KING. 

ALBANY, March 15, 1794. 
DEAR SIR : 

I received your favor of March 2nd, for which I am particu 
larly thankfull. A Bill had been sent by the Senate to the Assem 
bly for fortifying the port of New York. I was opposed to it 
upon constitutional grounds partly, &amp; partly because I conceived 
it to be the indispensable duty of Congress to protect us. There 
was no question, but that if they neglected to do it, and danger 
impended, we ought to do it for ourselves. This danger was not 
then in my apprehension sufficiently apparent ; your letter * came 
the next day, and almost convinced me it was. Besides the Bill 
might have been passed ad referendum, or commissrs. been 
appointed to carry the object into effect in case of exigence 
during the recess of Congress and of our State Legislature. But 
a motion to reject it was made on the reading of the first clause 
and carried. A Bill has since been bro t into the House by a 
different title proposing to loan money to Congress for the pur 
pose of fortifying our port. This with proper modifications may 
be made to answer the purpose and is not unlikely to pass. 

* This letter cannot be found. ED. 



552 RUFUS KING. [*794 

A Bill has also passed the Assembly to appropriate the sum of 
75,000 Dollars for the procurement of artillery, arms &amp; ammuni 
tion for the militia of the state. 

The Report of the Committee of Congress respecting fortifying 
the sea ports of the Continent gives facility to these measures. It 
is so utterly incompetent, that but little good is to be expected 
from any measure founded upon it. ... 

Yours &amp;c., 
J. WATSON. 



C. GORE TO R. KING. 

BOSTON, March 15, 1794. 
MY DEAR FRIEND : 

We are continually receiving information of the capture, deten 
tion &amp; condemnation of our vessels in the W. Indies. Our 
merchants conduct with great moderation &amp; temper on the occa 
sion. Convinc d that their losses might be increas d, but cou d 
not be diminished by war, they are averse to it themselves, &amp; un- 
remitted in their efforts to convince others of the fatal conse 
quences of such a step. They hope, they trust that a claim on 
the British Government, supported by plenary evidence of the 
amount of their losses, of the circumstances under which they 
were incurr d, of their scrupulous attention to the obligations of 
neutrality, wou d produce an indemnity. The whole force of 
those British merchants, who trade to this country, I am well con- 
vinc d, cou d easily be brought to act in concert with the Ameri 
can Minister in support of such a claim. The sufferers here think 
that a special deputation for this purpose wou d be more effica 
cious, than making the representation through the common 
medium. Perhaps this might be thought by the government an 
unnecessary expense &amp; perhaps it might be consider d as reflect 
ing on the conduct or talents of Mr. Pinckney. 

Supposing such considerations to weigh against a special depu 
tation there can be none against making the claim thro Mr. 
Pinckney in a manner the most flattering to British pride, most 
soothing to their wounded spirits, at the same time, most alarming 
to their apprehensions. A claim thus made, on ground assumed 



1794] LIFE A ^ D CORRESPONDENCE. 553 

as absolutely true, that Great Britain cannot hesitate to afford a 
satisfactory reply to so just a demand, might be attended with 
salutary consequences. At present, our people treat with disdain 
every suggestion of an attack on the property of individual sub 
jects of G. Brit, either in the funds or elsewhere. But such a 
temper cannot be expected to continue for any length of time, in 
those, who, from the most elevated state of affluence, are thrown 
into poverty and bankruptcy and this will be the unfortunate lot 
of many of our meritorious citizens, &amp; of that class of those 
very men, who have exerted all their powers, &amp; successfully too, 
to preserve peace and order and a good understanding between 
the two countries. 

The merchants of Salem have not that spirit of forbearance, 
which operates on those of this place. I was there the last week, 
and saw with pain the temper they discover d. Heated and angry 
beyond the point that wo d probably promote their interests, they 
talk of the advantages to be derived from privateering and exult 
that W. Gray &amp; others, who have always express d their confi 
dence in the justice of the British nation, are in danger of being 
ruin d by the detention of their vessels in the W. Indies. But 
still, I think, they will not, at present, take any rash steps. 

Yours affectionately, 

C. GORE. 

W. WILCOCKS TO R. KING, PHIL. 

ALBANY, March 16, 1794. 
SIR : 

I have seen your letter to our Speaker. We had shortly before 
received a bill from the Senate, for fortifying the port of New 
York. It became the subject of lengthy and animated discussion, 
but was finally rejected upon an Idea that we were not in immi 
nent danger ; and that it was the duty and interest of the federal 
Government to attend to our defence. 

The constitutionality of our right to erect fortifications was a 
theme of much declamation, pro &amp; con. In this I flattered myself, 
the affirmants had greatly the advantage. But the other doctrines, 
with the narrow spirited parsimony of public monies, damned the 
bill. 



554 RUFUS KING. 1.1794 

Your letter, however, came very opportunely and had the hap 
piest influence on the unbelievers &amp; sinners. This was also very 
well seconded by the report of your fortification Committee. It 
was the occasion of laughter, if not contempt, &amp; afforded the best 
evidence that Congress either will not, or cannot give us that pro 
tection which the nature of our Harbor, the importance of our 
commerce, and the occasion require. We have therefore origi 
nated another bill provisionally, about the success of which there 
is little doubt, as the minds of the opponents are materially 
changed. 

Probably before this arrives you will have found that we passed 
a bill, appropriating 75,000 Dolls, for the purchase of 10,000 stand 
of arms, and 42 pieces of field artillery, powder and ball &amp;c. I 
stood alone for $200,000, deeming it nonsense, if not unnecessary, 
for a free people, or perhaps any other, to hold immense sums in 
bank. 

We have confidence in the Wisdom and prudence of the Com 
mon Government, and therefore, tho it seems to be the hope of 
every rational man that we may avoid the war, still that if you de 
clare it necessary, it shall be supported with fortitude and energy.

any thing that may tend to strengthen the general Government.

in consequence, buying up all the Salt he can lay his hands upon, 
and if a war takes place, it must be a good one. What do you 
think of such a speculation ? if there is a probability of a war salt 
must rise ; but if I was to speculate in it, I should be for storing 
it at Hartford or some other safe place from the seashore. This 
city not being fortified will undoubtedly be much exposed, and the 
forts the general government mean to build here are deemed alto 
gether inadequate. 

I have heard one reason given why there certainly would be a

I have received yours of the 2d inst. The aspect of the Times 
begins to alarm. The means and manner contemplated by Con 
gress for fortifying this city are unsatisfactory here. They ap 
pear to me inadequate and improper. The Narrows &amp; Hell Gate 
are the only places which in my opinion merit any attention. 

Among the measures which strike me as adapted to the actual 
State of things, I am much inclined to a perfect stop to the Ex 
portation of Provisions of every kind for at least 6 or 8 months. 
I presume that the military operations especially in the W. Indies.

MY DEAR SIR : 

We are anxiously awaiting to hear the Result of the Debates 
in Congress which have been had for some days past with 
closed Doors. Our affairs are more critical &amp; alarming. I 
am really apprehensive the continued injuries we receive from 
England will oblige us to take decisive and hazardous measures 
against her. The opinions of people have changed very much 
lately on this subject. Those who were very pacific are now dif 
ferently disposed, and I really believe, should you make use of 
the last reason, great unanimity would prevail. However let it 
be the effect of dire necessity, not choice. . . . Our Legisla 
ture is still setting. A petition has gone from this place for a 
grant of money to fortify this place, the Congressional estimate 

being inadequate.

NEW YORK, 30 March, 1794. 
DEAR SIR : 

I have been duly favored with yours of the 2oth Inst., wherein 
I was really sorry to perceive the rash and premature motion 
made by Mr. Dayton &amp; Wm. Smith, to Sequester all British 
Debts, private &amp; public. The arrival here of the Proclamation 
of the 8th of Jany. started our Funds generally 6 pr. ct. &amp; the 
news of the above motion lowered them again as much on Satur 
day. I have my doubts whether such a measure would be justi 
fiable, were the British even to confirm the condemnation and 
object to Compensate. It would undoubtedly occasion many 
rascalities amongst us &amp; prove ruinous to our public credit, which 
most certainly is our interest to preserve in every point of 
view. . . 

Mr. Yates of this City has by this Packet received a letter from 
Bird, Savage and Bird of London, informing him that a Commit 
tee of Merchants interested in the American Trade waited upon. 
Mr. Pitt to know the cause of the condemnation of so many 
American vessels in the W. Indies ; to whh. he replied that it was. 
contrary to instructions given, and that the most ample compen 
sation to the sufferers would be given. This news I presume 
Mr. Hammond will communicate to the Executive, and I hope 
confirm it in such terms as to induce the Government to raise the 
Embargo, and adopt such lenient Measures as will tend to insure 
us the blessings of Peace, so desirable to this Country. . . . 
Ever sincerely your humble servn.

By this time I suppose that you have the great news as it is 
call d from England in favor of our Neutrality, which I think 
carries a check with it, that the Americans will not agree to, whh. 
is that when our Vessels are acquitted they are saddled with the 
costs, besides the delay and damage that may fall on the Cargoes, 
during the long time they generally wait before they can have 
their adjudication. It is too humiliating for a free &amp; spirited 
people to bear. . . . Since writing the above, reed, yours of 
the 29. I still fear if Congress sits long their warmth and rash 
resolves may be injurious to the Continuance of peace ; my senti 
ments are, cou d they agree to rise and leave sufficient power with 
the Executive, it would be to our advantage at present.

J. LAWRANCE TO R. KING, PHIL. 

NEW YORK, April 3, 1794. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

It is very clear if the British had been successful against the 
French, at the close of the last campaign, they would not have 
changed their Conduct respecting us. The concealment of the 
instructions of the 6th of Nov. until the end of December evinces 
their disposition to have injured and irritated us as much as pos 
sible, and the speech of the Canadian Chief * proves their deter 
mination to have measured Swords with us, were we indisposed 
to have borne with their Insults and Injuries. The hatred of the 
British Ministry to this Country is too apparent to admit of a 

* Refers to a " Speech of Lord Dorchester to certain Indians who had waited 
upon him as a deputation from the late general council held at the Rapids of 
the Maumee. The suggestion in this speech of the probability of a speedy 
rupture between the United States and Great Britain was taken as new and 
strong proof of the hostile disposition of the British, especially as Lord Dor 
chester had just returned from a visit to England and might be supposed to 
speak with authority." Hildreth s United States, 2d Ser., vol. i., p. 483. See

doubt, and I sincerely hope the Wisdom and Fortitude of our 
Legislators will improve the moment to put us in the best state of 
defence possible ; nay offence, should they not make us a com 
pensation for the injuries they have committed and remove every 
cause of complaint. It is best now the quarrel has begun, altho 
Blows have not taken place, to settle every grievance. Some 
time or other it must be done, and we never shall have harmony 
between the two Countries until there is a full and fair settle 
ment. 

I sincerely hope you will not relax from the system which had 
begun to show itself. I mean fortifying our Ports, having a com 
petent select body of Militia ready, supplying the deficiency in 
the Army &amp; providing for its increase on the contingency of a 
war, laying internal taxes sufficient to support our Credit, ascer 
taining the extent of our injuries, and demanding Compensation. 
I am averse to the plan of Sequestration. I think it will do us 
more Injury than benefit. Altho they have taken from our Mer 
chants their property, in a private and secret manner, I would not 
be guilty of like conduct. There is more magnanimity in coming 
to an open Rupture than in taking the property of men who 
trusted it on Public Faith and private Confidence. I wish the 
proposition had not been made. I cannot think it will succeed. 
If it should be expedient, it must be clogged with many provisions 
which will render it less productive than may be supposed. . . .

DEAR SIR : 

I was much pleased to perceive by your esteemed favor of the

Trade had tended to soften in a degree the growing resentment 
against G. Britain. But on the Contrary, I am sorry to perceive 
that your expectations are not verified as to the Sequestration of 
the British debts, since it appears that on yesterday Mr. Dayton 
was to call his motion up again in that respect, whh. I sincerely 
long to hear may have been rejected by a considerable majority 
in the lower house. 

I sincerely wish with you that Col. Hamilton may be 
appointed and that he may speedily go as Ambassador Extra

their designs. 

It has a suspicious appearance that we have no late arrivals 
from any port in England, tho many vessels expected, and a 
long course of Easterly winds has prevailed. I hope Congress will 
not relax their embargo, nor any spirited conduct to support the 
right and dignity of the Americans until they are fully convinced 
that England intends peace.

As the prospects of peace brighten, the Efforts of these Sons

I am of opinion with you that it wou d be best to continue the 
Embargo at least another month ; the merchants had better 
suffer a little by their vessels lying at the wharf, than sending 
them out with Cargoes and have them taken ; whh. still seems to 
be the case. It is said the Spaniards take all about Hispaniola. 
But I think you are right in not immediately interdicting our 
Commerce with Great Britain (if by the detention of our vessels 
they have not begun) until a negotiation takes place, provided it 
is not too long upon the carpet, and in the interim they continue 
their depredations on our Commerce. I wish Mr. Jay was 
appointed and would accept ; we all know his abilities and firm 
ness. That paragraph of yours informing of the appointment of 
Mr. Higginson to go to the W. Indies, as it was of a publick 
nature, I thought proper to communicate to our insurance office, 
and desired them to inform the merchants concerned in that 
commerce that they may act as they judge best. I may as an 
underwriter be eventually interested, but not being an owner 
have no authority to impower any person. By your 2nd I 
observe two American vessels acquitted at Antigua ; but the

Three of our London vessels have arrived. The Ohio, Belvi-

that the conjecture in England was, we should remain at Peace

Security. I think from present appearances our condition, in 
relation to a rupture is less gloomy than it has been for some 
time past. We may, with prudence, weather the storm. I cannot 
think the Resolution altho altered on the principle of its being 
amended will pass into a law. Time is of immense value to us, 
and before our final determination I hope many things will hap-

pen to convince us, peace is not only desirable but that it will 
continue. Our defensive works go on with spirit and make con 
siderable progress. We shall soon hear of the operation of the 
Embargo in the West Indies. If felt injuriously to any great 
degree, it may have a proper effect, in occasioning a treatment

that I was kept engaged untill the last moment. We are here at 
.a loss abt. a vessel. The neutrals in port are neither plenty nor 
very eligible. It is probable that we shall take our chance in an 
American. . . .

Beneath this in the handwriting of R. King is the following : 

Answered 2 May that I cd. not consent to accompany Mr. Jay 
on his Envoyship, because, equality of Parties, uncertainty of ye 
close of the Session, the still greater of the time of the next meet 
ing, added to domestic objections, forbid the measure, &amp;c., &amp;c. 



J. ALSOP TO R. KING. 

N. YORK, Ap. 29, 1794. 

By our late arrivals from Greenock &amp; Liverpool I perceive that 
the French are capturing our Vessels bound to Holland &amp; Bre 
men, loaded with sugar, coffee and cotton. Surely they don t 
intend condemning them. If they do I hope Congress will have it 
in their power to compensate the Owners and Insurers ; if not 
many of them will be much injured. This conduct, with embar 
going so many of our vessels for many months, does not accord 
with their flowery address lately sent to Congress. I fear they 
have not lost the French flattery and duplicity. 

This with the conduct of the British in the W. Indies must un 
doubtedly distress a great number of our merchants. ... I 
heartily wish our Envoy Extra, to the Court of London may have 
some influence to do us Justice. If not, I think Congress will do 
us Justice by interdicting their commerce until they do what is 
right by the Americans. . . .

J. JAY TO R. KING, PHIL. 

N. YORK, 3 May, 1794. 
DEAR SIR : 

I was this morning favd. with yours of yesterday, and regret 
the obstacles you mention. 

A Report is prevailing here that the chancellor is contemplated 
for France. Mrs. Montgomery is said to have mentioned it on 
what authority I know not. Your question deserves mature 
consideration. Unsuccessful opposition gives strength, especially 
in the Cases where it may be ascribed with a tolerable degree of 
plausibility, to personal and Party animosities. It is also a serious 
question who should succeed as Chancellor. In some hands that 
office would weaken the security of Property, &amp; be the engine of 
much political mischief. If he should be nominated by the 
Presidt. and approved by the Senate ; my Plan would be, to put 
you in his place and Gulian Verplank in yours. I am too much 
pressed for Time to write to our Friend Hamilton on these sub 
jects. I meant to suggest to him some Hints and immature 
Reflections, for I have not leisure to form any opinions which I 
should venture to rely upon. Be so good as to communicate this 
letter to him. This opinion I can rely upon, that it will always 
be best for you to consult each other rational men need and 
ask advice ; not for Direction, but for information. 

Yours very sincerely, 

JOHN JAY. 

R. KING TO J. ADAMS. 

PHILADELPHIA, 20 May, 1794. 
SIR: 

The amendment reported by the committee of the Senate to 
the bill relative to the balances due the creditor states is in itself 
so important, &amp; particularly so interesting to the state of New 



568 RUFUS KING. [i794 

York, that I feel great reluctance to be absent while the same is 
under discussion ; but a sudden indisposition in my family com 
pels me to return to New York. I hope to be again in my place 
on Monday or Tuesday next. 

May I be permitted Sir, through you, to request the Senate to 
suspend a decision upon this subject for a few days ? The unex 
pected absence of my colleague, occasioned by an afflicting event 
in his family, may be deemed an additional apology for my ask 
ing this indulgence. 

With great respect, I am, &amp;c., 

RUFUS KING. 

It would appear that this request was agreed to, and on 
the return of Mr. King, the bill having been taken up, 
the special amendment was rejected, Mr. King in the 
negative. Whether this amendment was one requiring the 
debtor States, of which New York was most indebted, to 
pay up the balances due by them, and from this amount to 
pay the creditor States what was due them, as had been 
suggested by Hamilton, (the amounts being very nearly 
equal), there is no record. In the House, the proposition 
had been negatived. The debts due to the creditor States 
were paid, but those due to the United States were never 
paid. ED. 



J. JAY TO R. KING, NEW YORK. 

LONDON, 8 July, 1794. 
DEAR SIR : 

Nothing here is as yet decided : appearances are favorable ; but 
you know appearances are often fallacious. It is a little unfortu 
nate, that not a single case of capture under the Novr. Instructions 
had been laid before the Minister here, nor have I yet reed, any 
from our agent in the W. Indies. I have reason to apprehend 
Delay on this head ; personally, I have abundant Reason to be 
pleased and satisfied. There is no Reason to apprehend that a 
war with us would be agreeable to the nation, unless they should 



1794] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 569 

perceive clearly that it was imputable to us. The war with France 
is unquestionably popular here. Many in this country begin to 
look towards ours and various circumstances induce me to believe 
that emigrations will become more and more frequent. 
Remember me to Mr. Alsop &amp; Mrs. King. 

Yours sincerely, 

JOHN JAY. 

R. KING TO J. LANGDON. 

NEW YORK, 13 July, 1794. 
DEAR SIR : 

Mr. Talleyrand de Perigord and Mr. Beaumez, both of whom 
I believe you had the pleasure to know at Philadelphia, intend 
visiting Portsmouth. 

They may stay a few days with you, and in order that their 
Time may pass in the most agreeable manner, I request your per 
mission to introduce them to you, and your esteemed connexions. 
With great Respect, I am dear Sir, 

Your obt. Servt, 

RUFUS KING. 

P. VAN GAASBECK TO R. KING. 

KINGSTON, July 19, 1794. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

It is with the most cordial pleasure and satisfaction that I 
acknowledge the Receipt of your friendly Letter of the 6th inst. 
The sentiments therein displayed were too important in my opinion 
to remain dormant or to be buried in oblivion. This was the de 
cided opinion of a number of Friends. Thinking so, I hope you 
will pardon me with your other Friends for giving it a place in the 
Kingston Rising Sun.* 

I had a Letter from our mutual Friend Sedgwick a few days 
since. He thinks it of the first importance that Tredwell s Reso 
lution f be published with the necessary comments : (I subscribed 

* No copy of this paper can be found. ED. 

f " Mr. Tredwell read a resolution for reducing the salaries paid to the officers 
of the United States. That of the President was to be reduced, after the present 



570 RUFUS KING. [1794 

chearfully to the Idea) indeed I believe I did suggest the propriety 
of it when last with you. By mislaying the Philadelphia Paper 
which contained the Resolution, I think it was in Bache s or 
Brown s, it is not in my power to bring it properly forward. 
Previous to the receipt of Mr. Sedgwick s Letter, I had written to a 
Friend at Philadelphia to send me the Paper containing the Reso 
lution, to which I have not received an answer, if you are in 
possession of the Paper, why not at once have it published, accom 
panied with such remarks as you may think proper, and by all 
means convey one or more Papers to me, when I shall take care 
that it becomes public. Should you not have the Papers, a copy 
of the Resolution may be obtained in an indirect manner from the 
Journal of our House, together with the Movers &amp; Second s names, 
which was Mr. Bailey. You will recollect that those two with 
Cortlant opposed the taking up the Resolution &amp; deciding there 
on. I am decidedly of opinion that it ought to make its first 
appearance in one or more of the New York Papers &amp; then dis- 
pers d thro the Country. I am very clear it will prove beneficial ; 
and while it is of the utmost importance to the salvation of the 
General Government to have a federal Representation from our 
State, so it behooves us at least to meet all machinations &amp; Elec 
tioneering projects upon their own ground and to frustrate their 
wicked tendency. 

I conceive this of the utmost importance because you must 
not expect the same representation from our district, nor from 
Columbia. Clintonians will in my humble opinion prevail let 
us therefore be watchful and displace the Westchester &amp; Long 
Island Representatives by doing this we shall at least remain 
upon our old Ground, as seven to three. 

I am fearful the breach made here at the last Election will 

term of appointment, to twelve thousand dollars, that of a member of Congress 
to four dollars per day, with various others of the same kind. 

" A motion to print it was rejected. It was then moved to proceed with it 
immediately. 

" Mr. Wadsworth considered it a good electioneering project. It would, he 
doubted not, be very popular ; and as there were only fifty or sixty members in 
the House just now, they had better take it up, and try and get all the credit of 
it to themselves. It was after some conversation withdrawn by the mover."

widen ; I however do not yet despair to heal the wound our 
Friends, at least those we have esteem d so, are the sole cause of 
all. It is rumored among the Clintonians that Addison is to be 
their Candidate. I am apprehensive, altho the Bait is too weak 
for a Man of the least discernment, that it will have an influence 
and lead ambitious men to snap at it, &amp; thereby overthrow in a 
great measure our well founded Politics. You shall hear from me 
farther on this Head whenever its properly ascertained. Not to 
tire your patience with too lengthy a scrawl, permit me to con 
clude &amp; believe me sincerely your assured Friend &amp; Obedt. Servt.,

WALTHAM, 5th Aug., 1794. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

. . . Mr. Talleyrand and De Beaumez are very much es 
teemed and have received great attentions in Boston. They 
dined with me there, when I introduced them to the most re 
spectable and liberal of our society. They passed a day with me 
at Waltham ; and on their return from the province of Maine, I 
expect their company for several days in this retirement. . . . 

Your affectionate friend,

P. BUTLER TO R. KING, N. YORK. 

PHILADELPHIA, Aug. n, 1794. 
DEAR SIR : 

Of whom shall we enquire for Men of Science, but scientific 
men ? On this ground and on long acquaintance I presume in 
troubling you with the execution of a Commission. 

Two gentlemen in Charleston, for whom I have a considerable 
esteem, have requested of me to Engage for them two Tutors 
every way qualified for private Education. They are Gentlemen 
of considerable fortunes, with whom the question of Salary is no 
Object when compared to the abilities of the persons Engaged. 



5/2 RUFUS KING. [1794 

One stipulation they make, that the Preceptor shall not be under 
thirty years of age, as there are some female Pupils. The Tutors 
will reside in the Families, Dine at the same Table and Associate 
with the same Company as the Parents of the Children. To each 
Tutor will be payd. Annually, exclusive of Board, a salary of 
Two Hundred pounds Sterling. From such a Salary a Con 
siderable saving may be made. Each Tutor will be furnished 
with a Horse to ride when he wishes to take Exercise. 

To a Man of the World, as Mr. King is, I need scarcely Men 
tion that good temper and a degree of polished manners are 
Tequisite for men who are to be inmates in polish d well bred 
Families. You will greatly oblige Me, My Dear Sir, if you can 
Engage for me two Tutors that meet your mind, and have your 
approbation. If they are not to be had in N. York possibly by 
writing to New England you might get them. 

Excuse the freedom I take. I have written a short letter to 
Dr. Johnson on this subject ; but permit me to place my reliance 
on you. The Doctor is Aged, &amp; from Him I can not expect 
active enquiry. 

My Daughters unite in best Compliments to Mrs. King &amp; your 
self. 

I am, with Sentiments of great regard &amp; Esteem, 
Your Friend &amp; Obedt. Servant, 

P. BUTLER. 

Tho the lower Country of Carolina is unhealthy in Summer, 
Charleston, Assuredly, is very healthy so that there is nothing 
to apprehend on the Score of Climate or health. 



J. JAY TO R. KING. 

LONDON, zyth Sept., 1794. 
DEAR SIR : 

It gives me pleasure to reflect that this letter will probably find 
you at Philadelphia, for which place the Bearer of it is about to 
embark in the Pigou, and where it will be in your Power to be 
useful to him. I am persuaded that you will be strongly disposed 
to .shew him marks of friendly attention, when I inform you, that 



1794] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 573* 

the Person whom I am now recommending to you is Mons. De 
Rochefoucauld Liancourt, formerly President of the National 
Assembly and a Duke and Peer of France. He has experienced 
vicissitudes, but he appears to me to bear them like a man. 

Yours Sincerely, 

JOHN JAY. 



A. HAMILTON TO R. KING, PHILADELPHIA. 

Sept. 17, 1794. 
DEAR SIR : 

When you recollect that I have two departments on my shoul 
ders, and when I tell you I have been out of health in the bar 
gain, you will perhaps admit an excuse for my not answering 
sooner your letter some time since received. 

Mr. Jay has given nothing conclusive. His letters to the 26th 
of June barely gave the idea that appearances were not unfavora 
ble. His last letter, I forget the date but it came by the last 
arrival at New York refers to letters which were not received, 
but which are supposed to have been confided to the Portuguese 
Minister. This letter is couched in the same cautious terms, con 
siders the scale as capable of turning either way, &amp; advises not 
to relax in military preparation. The Ministry, however, have 
certainly continued to countenance shipments to this country &amp; 
very large ones were making. Tis a strange mysterious busi 
ness. The change in Administration had made some pause in 
the negotiation. 

Nothing from the Western Country authorizes an expectation 
of a pacific termination of that business.* All the Militia are 
going forward as fast as they can be got forward. Virginia all 
below the Mountains is zealous, beyond neutral in conduct &amp; 
divided in affection. Jersey is also zealous ; So are the Eastern 
Shore of Maryland &amp; the Town of Baltimore. Thence to Fred 
erick Town a pretty good temper prevails ; beyond that a very 
insurgent spirit and some insurrection. In Philadelphia an ex- 

* Refers to the disturbances in W. Pennsylvania, arising from the endeavor 
to enforce the collection of the excise tax on distilled spirits. 



574 RUFUS KING. [1794 

cellent and productive zeal, embracing all parties, has been kin 
dled : a good spirit will generally pervade the old counties ; but 
there is much bad leaven in the new counties this side of, as well 
as beyond, the Mountains : Cumberland, Franklin, Mifflin &amp; even 
Northumberland. 

Governor Lee is at the head of the Virginia Militia &amp; will com 
mand, if the President does not go out. He is all zeal. Governor 
Howel with equal zeal was to march from Trenton today with the 
Van of the Jersey Militia, consisting of 500 horse. MifHin, who 
at first showed some untoward symptoms, appears now to be ex 
erting himself in earnest &amp; with effect, &amp; goes out at the head 
of his Militia. 

The President will be governed by circumstances. If the 
thing puts on an appearance of magnitude, he goes : if not, he 
stays. There is a pro. &amp; a Con. in the case If permitted I 
shall at any rate go. 

Affecty yrs. 

A. HAMILTON. 



A. HAMILTON TO R. KING. 

Sep. 22d, 1794,. 

I thank you My Dr. Sir, for your letter of the , a few days 

previously, I wrote you pretty fully : I hope my letter got to 
hand. 

. . . The Return from the Western Counties of this state 
are just come to hand. They show a valuable division, ranging 
on the side of the laws the most influential men, &amp; a respectable 
body of others ; but leaving a great number still uncomplying &amp; 
violent, so as to afford no assurance of submission to the laws 
without the application of Force. It will give you pleasure to 
learn that there is every prospect of our being able to apply this 
effectually, &amp; of the issue being favourable to the authority 
of the laws. It will occasion a large bill of Costs, but what is 
that compared with the object ? 

Adieu, affectly yrs.

A. HAMILTON TO R. KING, JONES S MILL. 

Oct. 30, 1794. 
DR. SIR : 

Our light corps, the Jersey infantry &amp; a brigade of cavalry are 
about 8^2 miles in front, beyond all the Mountains. This divis 
ion which has been delayed by a somewhat worse route &amp; the 
incumbrance of the public stores, will be at the same place this 
evening. The left wing is at a corresponding point. All is 
essentially well ; no appearance of opposition. It is of great 
consequence that a law should, if possible, be expedited through 
Congress for raising 500 infantry and 100 horse to be stationed in 
the disaffected country. Without this the expence incurred will 
be essentially fruitless. 

A law regulating a process of outlawry is also urgent, for the 
best objects of punishment will fly &amp; they ought to be com 
pelled by outlawry to abandon their property, homes &amp; the U. 
States. This business must not be skinned over. The political 
putrefaction of Pennsylvania is greater than I had any idea of. 
Without vigour everywhere our tranquillity is likely to be of very 
short duration, and the next storm will be infinitely worse than 
the present one. 

Yrs. with true affec. &amp; regard, 

A. HAMILTON.

WALTHAM, 6 Nov. 1794. 
MY DEAR SIR : 

I congratulate you on our late election. We have knowledge 
of all the towns except two or three and there are only two towns 
where Jarvis had a majority. . . . Ames will be elected. The 
town of Boston never looked more joyous than it has since Mon 
day ; and there never was an election, where our wealthiest 
merchants and respectable citizens exerted themselves more, or 



5/6 KUFUS KING. [1794 

persevered so long. I enclose you a certificate which did great 
good in the election and which I think must silence those who 
affect to say our merchants were dissatisfied with the doings of 
their representatives. ... On the whole the state of our 
politics is good. Many falsehoods told of Ames have been re 
futed. His character is deservedly high ; and good men seem 
willing to exert themselves to support government and maintain: 
order. 

Affectionately yours, 

C. GORE.. 



CHAPTER XXXII. 

President s Action on the Pennsylvania Insurrection approved in the Senate 
Answer to his Speech Burr a Candidate for Governor in New York 
Genet s Marriage Negotiation of a Treaty by Mr. Jay. 

The second session of the 3d Congress began on the 3d 
November, 1794, but the Senate being without a quorum 
until the i8th, the President s speech was not read until the 
iQth. He gave an account of the insurrection in the western 
counties of Pennsylvania to resist the law of 1 790, " to lay and 
collect the excises," upon the distillation of whiskey and 
spirituous liquors. The officers employed to enforce the law 
had been resisted, even to placing the marshall s life in jeop 
ardy and causing him and the inspector to flee to the seat 
of Government. The processes of the Courts could not be 
enforced, and on August 7th he had issued a Proclamation, 
appointing Commissioners to proceed to the scene of 
insurrection, to warn those who were resisting the laws, and 
offering pardon to them on condition of return to obedience. 
This effort failing to accomplish the purpose, he had called 
out the militia, to the number of 15,000 men, from Pennsyl 
vania and the adjoining States, hoping thus to quell the 
insurrection and prevent the effusion of blood. He himself 
had visited the place of the general rendezvous, but finding 
that " it being now confessed by those, who were not 
inclined to exaggerate the ill-conduct of the insurgents, 
that the malevolence was not pointed merely to a particu 
lar law, but that a spirit, inimical to all order, has actuated 
many of the offenders," and being then satisfied that every 

577 



578 RUFUS KING. [i794 

appearance indicated that there would be " such an issue as 
would redound to the reputation and strength of the U. 
States," he had left the command-in-chief with the Governor 
of Virginia. He had spoken in the early part of this mes 
sage of the " delusions which were no longer confined to 
the efforts of designing individuals," of the fact that " for 
bearance to press prosecutions was misinterpreted as fear 
of urging the execution of the laws," &amp; that, " from the 
" belief that, by a more formal concert, their operation might 
be defeated, certain societies assumed the tone of condem 
nation." He therefore calls upon all " citizens to determine 
whether it [the insurrection] has not been fomented by 
combinations of men, who, careless of consequences, and 
disregarding the unerring truth that those who rouse 
cannot always appease a civil convulsion, have dissemi 
nated, from an ignorance or perversion of facts, suspicions, 
jealousies, and accusations of the whole Government." 

The remaining portion of the speech related to the suc 
cess of the army under General Wayne, against the Indians 
north of the Ohio, to his hope of the establishment of a 
definite plan for the redemption of the Public Debt, and 
to his efforts to cultivate peace with all the world. 

The address was committed to Messrs. King, Ellsworth, 
and Izard in the Senate to draft a response. Mr. King made 
the report, which was adopted the next day, after an in 
effectual attempt on the "motion of Mr. Burr, seconded by 
Jackson, to expunge the second paragraph relative to the 
" proceedings of certain self-created societies, etc." It is 
altogether probable that this answer was drafted by Mr. King, 
and thus we learn his views. The address is as follows : 

" SIR : 

"We receive with pleasure your Speech to the two Houses of 
Congress. In it we perceive renewed proofs of that vigilant and 
paternal concern for the prosperity, honor and happiness of our 
country, which has uniformly distinguished your past admin 
istration. 



17941 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 579 

"Our anxiety, arising from the licentious and open resistance 
to the laws in the Western counties of Pennsylvania, has been 
increased by the proceedings of certain self-created societies, 
relative to the laws and administration of the Government ; pro 
ceedings, in our apprehension, founded in political error, calcu 
lated, if not intended, to disorganize our Government, and which, 
by inspiring delusive hopes of support, have been influential in 
misleading our fellow citizens in the scene of insurrection. 

" In a situation so delicate and important, the lenient and per 
suasive measures which you adopted merit and receive our affec 
tionate approbation. These failing to procure their proper effect, 
and coercion having become inevitable, we have derived the 
highest satisfaction from the enlightened patriotism and animat 
ing zeal with which the citizens of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, 
Maryland and Virginia have rallied around the standard of 
Government, in opposition to anarchy and insurrection. 

" Our warm and cordial acknowledgments are due to you, Sir, 
for the wisdom and decision with which you arrayed the militia, 
to execute the public will ; and to them, for the disinterested 
ness and alacrity with which they obeyed your summons. 

" The example is precious to the theory of our Government, 
and confers the brightest honor upon the patriots who have 
given it. 

" We shall readily concur in such farther provisions for the 
security of internal peace and a due obedience to the laws, as the 
occasion manifestly requires. 

" The effectual organization of the militia, and a prudent at 
tention to the fortifications of our ports and harbors, are subjects 
of great national importance, and, together with the other meas 
ures you have been pleased to recommend, will receive our 
deliberate consideration. 

" The success of the troops under the command of General 
Wayne cannot fail to produce essential advantages. The pleas 
ure with which we acknowledge the merits of that gallant General 
and Army, is enhanced by the hope that their victories will lay 
the foundation of a just and durable peace with the Indian 
tribes. 

" At a period so momentous in the affairs of nations, the tem 
perate, just and firm policy that you have pursued, in respect to 



580 RUFUS KING. [1794 

foreign Powers, has been eminently calculated to promote the 
great and essential interest of our country, and has created the 
fairest title to the public gratitude and thanks." 

The Senate on the 27th November concurred in an act 
which had already been passed by the House of Representa 
tives to authorize the President to call out and station for a 
time a corps of militia in the western counties of Pennsyl 
vania a measure suggested by the President in his message. 
Mr. King was a member of the committee appointed to 
report on the House bill to make " appropriations for the 
support of the military Establishment . . . and for the 
expenses of the militia lately called into the service of the 
U. States," which was on their report passed ; and he 
was also chairman of a conference committee to consider a 
disagreement between the two houses in reference to a bill to 
regulate the pay of the non-commissioned officers, musicians, 
and privates of the militia of the United States, when called 
into actual service. The result of the conference was 
adopted by the Senate.

. . . Mr. Smith s re-election gives general satisfaction to the 
Supporters of good government, and to his friends in particular 
for the great majority with whh. he has got on. Mr. Butler s

much grief ; and as for the Mountain Mr. Monroe appears seated 
upon, I sincerely hope it may prove to be formed of snow, and 
for the good of Mankind dissolve with the approaching Summer. 
Col. Burr, its reported here I understand, declares himself a can 
didate for Governor at our ensuing Election, whh., if true, will 
I imagine prevent his attending the Senate very constantly.

" This variation from our last advices is not very surprising, as

must be added another circumstance little expected by the people

NEW YORK, November 17, 1794. 
DEAR SIR : 

. . . I am very thankful to you for your few but interesting 
lines of the i3th, thereby to perceive the forwardness Mr. 
Jay s negotiations are in and the compleat success he is likely to 
meet with. This news is truly agreeable, and if the posts are once 
given up, we may then look upon a Continuation of peace with 
England as reduced to a certainty, whh. God grant. . . . 

H. LEROY. 



J. JAV TO R. KING, PHIL. 

LONDON, igth Nov., 1794. 
DEAR SIR : 

I sent by the Packet the fruit of my Negotiations a Treaty 
I wish I could go with it, as well that I might again be in my 
own country, as, that I might answer Questions on these subjects. 
The Draft has undergone several Editions, with successive alter 
ations, additions, &amp;c. This shews that Time and Trouble have 
not been spared. I have just finished a hasty letter to Mr. Ran 
dolph It will be thought slovenly, but I cannot help it : the 
Packet must go. 

If I entirely escape censure, I shall be agreeably disappointed. 
Should the Treaty prove, as I believe it will, beneficial to our 
country, Justice will finally be done ; if not, be it so ; my mind 
is at ease. I wish I could say as much for my body, but the 
Rheumatism will not permit me. Health and Happiness to you 
my good friend. 

Yours sincerely, 

JOHN JAY.

J. O. HOFFMAN TO R. KING, PHIL. 

Dec. 26, 1794, N. YORK. 

DEAR SIR : 

I am induced to write to you from an account I have lately 
had from the Country. Mr. Whitbeck is writing circular letters, 
to all Mr. Burr s friends or rather to the opponents of Mr. Clin 
ton stating by way of an extract of a letter from Philadelphia, 
the appointment of Mr. Pinkney to the Court of Spain, and 
hence inferring a certainty of Mr. Jay s continuation in London 
&amp; warmly recommending Mr. Burr From the whole complexion 
of this business, I have no doubt that it has been a plan arranged 
at Philadelphia ; &amp; as it is plausible, it may meet with some 
success. 

As we propose leaving this city during the next week, for the 
Legislature, some explanation may become necessary, particularly 
as to the propriety of the inference drawn by Whitbeck. A state 
ment of facts as to Mr. Pinkney may become useful. In short, 
my good Sir, our Northern friends are yet unsteady on this im 
portant object. I sincerely wish they could be under the influ 
ence of a Letter from Col. Hamilton. . . . Have you had 
any conversation with Gaasbeck ? Whitbeck speaks of him, as 
an avowed supporter of Burr. His declaring the contrary would 
have a good and an extensive effect. 

With esteem, &amp;c., &amp;c., 

Jos. OGDEN. HOFFMAN. 



J. O. HOFFMAN TO R. KING. 

N. Y. Dec. 29, 1794. 

The inclosed was received by me this morning. The rest of 
our friends here have received similar letters. They occasion 
some embarrassment as to our proper line of conduct. . . 

Jos. OGDEN HOFFMAN. 



584 RUFUS KING. [i794 

D. HALE TO J. O. HOFFMAN. 

ALBANY, Dec. 23, 1794. 
DEAR SIR : 

Since my last we have had several meetings and finally came 
to a general good understanding. General Schuyler has come 
out as warm and decisive in favour of Mr. Jay as we could wish 
and appears to have been uniformly of the same sentiment ; the 
Patroon also fully acquiesces and goes with us. Any remarks 
that I may have made on the subject had better be suppressed, 
and I must defer an explanation until we meet ; but rest assured 
that Witbeck has been dangerously mischievous. You will by 
this stage receive a letter addressed to Comfort Sands, yourself 
&amp; others on the subject of giving Mr. Jay a nomination from 
your city. Pray let it be done without delay and in as short and 
concise a manner as possible. Mr. Van Rensselaer has freely 
consented to stand as Candidate for Lt. Governor ; you can 
therefore insert his name in your nomination, and immediately 
on its coming to our hands we will take it up and circulate it 
with one from this City throughout our District. The nomina 
tion ought to be decisive as to any doubt of Mr. Jay s arrival a 
doubt generally tends to confusion immediate attention should 
be paid to our friends in Ulster, in Dutchess in particular, as 
Mr. Burr s Creatures are indefatigable thro the whole State. 

With respect &amp; esteem, 

DANIEL HALE. 



The correspondence which has been presented, and which 
is all that can be recovered, suggests several subjects of pub 
lic interest, upon which Mr. King had evidently expressed 
decided opinions. These can be ascertained only through 
the tenor of the correspondence with his friends and by his 
votes, recorded in the Journal of the Senate. These, how 
ever, show that he was always at his post, and supported 
the general policy of the administration, in its financial 
measures, in preventing the adoption of resolutions whose 
tendency would have been to embarrass the Government in 



1794] LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE. 585 

dealing with the outrages inflicted upon the commerce of 
the country by Great Britain, and, as we see by his notes, in 
his earnest advocacy of the special embassy to England, 
while he counselled that active preparations for the defence 
of the country should be steadily made. 

The Journal shows that on March I3th he was made chair 
man of a committee to take measures to provide for the de 
fence of certain harbors, etc., etc., on the I4th of one to make 
appropriations for the support of the military establishment 
of the United States, while on the igth he was one of a 
committee to provide for erecting and repairing arsenals, 
magazines, etc., and his name appears also in many other 
committees relating to commercial and financial regulations 
of the country; thus showing his active participation in the 
business of this Congress. 

It is much to be regretted that so little can be gathered of 
his interference in the interesting political events in his own 
State towards the close of the year, anticipatory of the Gov 
ernor s election, in which it is known that Mr. King felt a 
deep concern. 



APPENDIX I. 



RUFUS KING S NOTES OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVEN 
TION OF 1787. 

Among the manuscripts in the handwriting of Rufus 
King is one containing an abstract of a portion of the 
debates in the Convention for the formation of the Con 
stitution, which appears to have been made as the debate 
proceeded. The copy was written out, nearly verbatim, by 
him, somewhere about 1818-21 * (for the paper bears the 
watermark of 1818), from rough notes taken at the time. It 
will be observed that he does not reproduce his own re 
marks, except in speeches on the powers of the Convention. 
There is no new information as to the proceedings, or the 
opinions of members of the Convention, but the reports 
previously published in the Madison and Yates papers are 
corroborated in these. 

Thursday, May ji. 

House of Representatives to be elected by the People. 

Gerry opposes. Appointment by the State Legislature prefera 
ble, because the People want information. 

Mason, Virginia in favor of popular choice, because the first 
Branch is to represent the People. We must not go too far. A 
portion of Democracy should be preserved ; our own children 
in a short time will be among the general mass. 

* Probably at the time of the publication of the Madison report. Both this 
copy and the original notes are in the possession of the Editor. 

587 



588 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

Wilson of Penn. agrees with Mason. We ought to adopt meas 
ures to secure the popular confidence, and to destroy the Rivalry 
between the Genl. and State Governments ; in this way both will 
proceed immediately from the People. 

Madison agrees with Wilson. The measure immediately intro 
duces the People, and will naturally inspire the affection for the 
Genl. Govt. that exists toward our own offspring. A legislative 
appointment will remove the Govt. too far from the People. In 
Maryland the Senate is two Removes from the People, and a 
Deputy appointed by them would be three Removes off ; and if 
the first Branch appoint the second, the Deputy wd. be four 
Removes and if the Legislature of the U. S. appoint the Presi 
dent or Executive, the Executive wd. be five Removes from the 
People. If the Election be made by the People in large Districts, 
there will be no danger of Demagogues. 

Meastire carried. That first Br. be elected by People of the 
several States. Mass. N. Y. Penn. Virginia. N. Car. &amp; Georgia 
aye. Con. &amp; Del. divided N. Jersey &amp; S. Carolina, No. 

Friday June i. Com. of the whole. 

Executive power to be in one person. 

Motion by Wilson Penn. Seconded by Chs. Pinckney So. Car. 

Rutledge in favor of the motion. 

Sherman preferred leaving the number to the Legislature. 

Wilson. An Executive should possess the Power of secresy, 
vigour &amp; Dispatch, and so constituted as to be responsible. Ex 
ecutive powers are intended for the execution of the Laws, and 
the appointment of officers not otherwise appointed : a single 
Executive may be responsible, but a numerous one cannot be 
responsible. 

Madison agreed with Wilson in the Definition of Executive 
power. Ex vi termini. Executive power does not include the 
Power of War and Peace. Executive Power shd. be limited and 
defined. If large, we shall have the Evils of Elective Monar 
chies. Perhaps the best plan will be a single Executive of long 
duration, with a Council and with Liberty to dissent on his per 
sonal Responsibility. 

Gerry. I am in favor of a Council to advise the Executive : 
they will be organs of information respecting Persons qualified 
for the various offices. Their opinions may be recorded, so as to 



APPENDIX. 589 



be liable to be called to account &amp; impeached in this way, their 
Responsibility will be certain, and for misconduct their Punish 
ment sure. 

Dickinson. A limited yet vigorous Executive is not republican, 
but peculiar to monarchy the royal Executive has vigour, not 
only by power, but by popular Attachment &amp; Report an Equiva 
lent to popular attachment may be derived from the Veto on the 
Legislative acts. We cannot have a limited monarchy our con 
dition does not permit it. Republics are in the beginning and 
for a time industrious, but they finally destroy themselves because 
they are badly constituted. I dread the consolidation of the 
States, &amp; hope for a good national Govt. from the present Divi 
sion of the States with a feeble Executive. 

We are to have a Legislature of two branches, or two Legis 
latures, as the sovereign of the nation this will work a change 
unless you provide that the judiciary shall aid and correct the 
Executive. The first Branch of the Legislature, the H. of Rep 
resentatives, must be on another plan. The second Branch or 
Senate may be on the present scheme of representing the States 
the Representatives to be apportioned according to the Quotas of 
the States paid into the general Treasury. The Executive to be 
removed from office by the national Legislature, on the Petition of 
seven States. 

Randolph by a single Executive, there will be danger of 
Monarchy or Tyranny. If the Executive consist of three per 
sons, they may act without danger. If of one, he will be depend 
ent on the Legislatures &amp; cannot be impeached till the Expiration 
of his Office. A single Executive against the Genius of America. 

Wilson There are two important points to be considered, the 
extent of the Country &amp; the Manners of the People of the U. S. 
the former requires the Vigour of Monarchy, the latter, are 
against a Kingly Executive, our manners are purely republican. 

Montesquieu is favorable to confederated Republics I also 
am in favor of this Scheme, if we can take for its Basis, Liberty, 
and are able to ensure a vigourous execution of the Laws. A 
single executive is not so likely so soon to introduce Monarchy 
or Despotism, as a complex one. The people of America did 
not oppose the King, but the Parliament Our opposition was 
not against a Unity, but a corrupt Multitude. 



590 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

Williamson There is no true difference between an Executive 
composed of a single person, with a Council, and an Executive 
composed of three or more persons. 

The Question postponed. 

After debating the Powers, the Committee proceeded to discuss 
the Duration of the Executive Power. 

Wilson proposed three years, without rotation or exclusion. 

Madison proposed good behaviour, or Seven years with exclu 
sion for ever afterward. 

Mason In favor of Seven years, and future ineligibility by 
this Provision the executive is made independent of the Legisla 
ture, who may be his Electors if re-elected, he will be com 
plaisant to the Legislature to obtain their favor &amp; his own 
Re-election. 

On the Question for Seven years Mass. Gerry &amp; Strong, no. 
Gorham &amp; King aye divided.* Cont. N. C, S. C. &amp; G. no. 
N. Y. N. J. Penn. Del. Virginia aye. 5 ayes, 4 nos i. divided.

Unity of Executive-power resumed. 

On Question of single executive carried thus. 

Mass. Cont. N. Y. Penn. Virg. N. C., S. Car. Georg. Ay. 

N. J. Del. Mard . No. 

Motion by Gerry seconded by Mr. King, to postpone the article 
for a Council of Revision, and to vest a qualified Negative in the 
Executive. 

Affirmative all the States except Cont. &amp; Mard. 

Wilson second Hamilton proposed a complete Negative in 
the Executive. The natural operation of the Legislature will be 
to swallow up the Executive power : divided power becomes the 
object of contest ; if the powers are equal, each will preserve its 
own otherwise the strongest will acquire the whole. 

Butler opposed because it will become a King. 

Franklin opposed Our former Govt. in Penn. abused this 
power of a full Negative and extorted money from the Legisla-

ture, before he would sign their acts in one instance he refused 
his Signature to a Bill to march the Militia agt. the Indians, till 
the Bill exempted from Taxes the Estate of the Proprietors on 
account of the expense of the Militia. 

One man cannot be believed to possess more wisdom than 
both Branches of the Legislature the Royal Negative has not 
been exercised since the Revolution ; he easily does by corrup 
tion what could be done with some risk by his negative. 

Madison opposed No man would dare negative a bill unani 
mously passed. It is even doubtful whether the King of England 
wd have Firmness enough to do so. 

Mason opposed We have voted that the executive power 
be vested in one person it is now proposed to give this person 
a negative in all cases you have agreed that he shall appoint all 
officers, not otherwise to be appointed, and those he has not the 
sole power to appoint, you propose to grant to him the power to 
negative with these powers the Executive may soon corrupt the 
Legislature the Executive will become a monarchy. We must 
regard the Genius of our people, which is Republican, &amp; will not 
receive a King. 

Franklin The Prince of Orange at first had limited Powers, 
and his office was for Life his son raised a faction &amp; caused 
himself to be declared hereditary we may meet the same fate. 

Unanimous negative, except Wilson, Hamilton, King. 

Madison The judiciary ought to be introduced in the business 
of Legislation they will protect their department, and united with 
the Executive make its negatives more strong. There is weight 
in the objections to this measure but a check on the Legislature 
is necessary, Experience proves it to be so, and teaches us that 
what has been thought a calumny on a republican Govt. is 
nevertheless true In all Countries are diversity of Interests, the 
Rich &amp; the Poor, the Dr. &amp; Cr., the followers of different Dema 
gogues, the Diversity of religious Sects the Effects of these Divi 
sions in ancient Govts. are well known, and the like causes will now 
produce like effects. We must therefore introduce in our system 
Provisions against the measures of an interested majority a 
check is not only necessary to protect the Executive power 
but the minority in the Legislature. The independence of the 
Executive, having the Eyes of all upon him will make him an 



5Q2 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

impartial judge add the Judiciary, and you greatly increase his 
respectability. 

Wilson Wilson moved and Madison seconds, that the judiciary 
be added to the Executive in revising the Laws. 

Dickinson opposed you shd. separate the Departments you 
have given the Executive a share in Legislation ; and it is asked 
why not give a share to the judicial power. Because the Judges 
are to interpret the Laws, and therefore shd. have no share in 
making them not so with the executive whose causing the Laws 
to be executed is a ministerial office only. Besides we have ex 
perience in the Br. Constitution which confers the Power of a 
negative on the Executive. 

^f the motion was withdrawn. 

JUDICIARY POWER. 

Wilson proposes that the judiciary be appointed by the National 
Executive, because he will be responsible. 

Rutledge opposes, because the States generally appoint by their 
Legislatures. 

Franklin The 15 Lords of Sessions in Scotland are appointed 
by the Barristers or Doctors these elect the most learned of 
their own order, because he has the most business, wh. after 
wards is divided among themselves. 

Madison in favor of further deliberation. Perhaps the 
appointment shd. be by the Senate 

Postponed N. H., Mass, NY, Penn &amp; Md. by the Executive 
power R. Island by the People Con. N.J. Del. Virg. N. Car. &amp; 
So. Car. elect Judges by Legislatre. 

Rutledge proposes to have a supreme Natl. Tribunal but no 
subordinate ones, except those established by the States respec 
tively. 

Wilson of a different opinion. 

Dickinson The State &amp; Genl. Tribunals will interfere we 
must have a National Tribunal entire and proceeding from the 
Genl Govt. 

Madison proposed to vest the Genl. Govt. with power to 
establish an independent Judiciary, to be co-extensive with the 
nation. Ayes, 5, No, 4, divided 2. 



APPENDIX. 593 



REPRESENTATIVES. 

Chs. Pinckney proposes that the Representatives shd. be 
chosen by the Legislatures &amp; not by the People as the old 
members of Congress are chosen. 

Gerry proposes that the People shd. elect double the requisite 
number, and out of them the Legislature to choose the author 
ized number of each State. The People may be imposed upon 
by corrupt and unworthy men. 

Wilson Representatives shd. be elected by the People, there 
by we shall come nearer to the will or sense of the majority 
If you give the Election to the State Legislatures, you give it to 
the Rivals of the General Govt. the People having parted with 
sufficient Powers, it remains only to divide these Powers between 
the Genl. &amp; State Govts. 

The People will love &amp; respect the Genl. Govt., if it is founded 
on their consent &amp; derived from them it will acquire rank above 
the State Govts. 

Mason at Present the Reps, in Congress do not represent 
the People but the States It is now proposed to form a Gov. 
for men, not for States therefore draw the Reps, from the 
People the Representation to be faithful shd. shew the Defects 
of the People ; if not, how are they to be corrected ? A Repre 
sentation proceeding from the Legislatures will not afford this 
correction. 

Suppose a majority of the Legislature to be in favor of Paper 
money, or some other bad measure, would they not elect Members, 
to Congress, holding the same opinions ? 

Sherman If the State Govts. remain, they shd. appoint Repre 
sentatives to Congress if they are to be swept away, then the 
People must elect, the State Govts. must continue few objects 
in this case will be before the Genl. Govt. for war, treaties &amp; com 
merce Let the Genl. Govt. be a collateral Govt. to secure the 
States in particular Exigencies for war, or war between the States. 

I am opposed to a Genl. Govt. &amp; in favor of the independence 
&amp; Confederation of the States give the Genl. Govt. powers to 
regulate Commerce, drawing therefrom a Revenue. 

Dickinson We cannot form a Genl. Gov. unless we draw a

Branch from the People, and a Br. from the Legislatures of the 
States in theory this is requisite, and to the success of the 
scheme, it is also essential the objection to popular Elections 
arise from the nature of free Govts. and are slight in comparison 
with the Excellence of such Govts. the other Branch or Senate 
must come from the State Legislatures they will thereby be more 
respectable, and for Respectability &amp; Duration resemble the Br. 
H. of Lords. They can come from Legislatures who are &amp;: have 
been opposed to the general Govt. they shd. be appointed for 
3&gt; 5 or 7 years, not subject to a recall and dependent on the Genl. 
Gov. for support. 

Read We must come to a consolidation State Govts. must be 
swept away we had better speak out that the People will dis 
approve is perhaps a mistake the State Magistrates may disap 
prove but the People are with us. 

Genl. Pinckney An election in South Carolina by the people 
is impracticable the settlements are so sparse, that four or five 
thousand cannot be assembled to give their votes. I am in favor 
of an Election by the Legislatures in So. Carolina the Legislature 
is against the issue of Paper Money with a tender, but in my Opin 
ion a majority of the People are in favor thereof. 

Wilson I would preserve the State Govts. there is no danger 
of their being swallowed up by the Genl. Govt. the States have 
overpowered the Confederated Governments The Amphictionic 
Council &amp; the Achaean League were destroyed by the encroach 
ments of the Members. 

Madison The Election may be safely made by the People, if 
you enlarge the sphere of Election Experience shows this if 
bad Elections be made by the People, it will be found to happen 
in small Districts. 

Butler Until the Ratio be fixed, I am opposed to settling the 
mode of Election ; if this be established on a principle favorable 
to Wealth as well as numbers of free Inhabitants, I am content to 
unite with Delaware (Mr. Read) in abolishing the State Legis 
latures and becoming one nation instead of a Confederacy of 
Republics. 

On question to choose Reps, by States Legislatures 

Con., N. Jersey &amp; S. Car. aye. The Eight other States no. 



APPENDIX. 595 



Motion by Wilson seconded by Madison. 

To reconsider the partial Negative by the Pr. to vest this power 
in him jointly with the Judiciary 

Madison A check requisite, to prevent legislative encroach 
ment in the Judiciary, the Executive, or on private Rights. 

By the judiciary Union, the check is increased in power and 
respectability the Ex. alone is too weak the King of Eng. wd. 
hesitate to negative a Bill unanimously passed by Parliament. 

Gerry The motion aims to unite Departments wh. ought to be 
separate the union destroys Responsibility. 

Chs. Pinckney opposed as it destroys Responsibility. 

Mason The Purse &amp; the sword must not be in the same 
Hands if so, and the Legislature are able to raise revenue and 
make and direct war, I shall agree to a Restriction in the Execu 
tive, or in a Council of Revision. 

Dickinson hurry, vigour and Despatch are not properties of a 
Republic we cannot have these in a Council but Responsibility 
of such immense value, we can have by a single Executive unite 
the judiciary and you lose Responsibility the measure is further 
more bad by uniting Departments which should be separate and 
independent. It will require as great talents &amp; firmness to dis 
charge the other executive Duties, as to interpose a veto on the 
Laws, wh. shall require two thirds of both branches of the Legis 
lature to remove. 

We have not introduced a plurality in the Executive in the 
former instance and why should we do so in this case ? For Re 
consideration Con. N. Y. Virginia, ay. 8 others no. 

SENATE. 

The proposition that the Senate be chosen by the H. of Reps, 
out of Persons nominated by the State Legislatures being nega 
tived. 

Dickinson moved that the Senators be appointed by the State 
Legislatures because the mind &amp; body of the several States 
shd. be represented in the national Legislature ; and because 
these Legislatures would choose men of distinguished Talents as 
Senators such men would have a chance to be chosen by the 
People as national Representatives failing in such choice, 



596 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

Wealth, family, or Talents may recommend them to be appoint 
ed Senators let the Number of Senators be more than 200 
by enlarging their number, their influence and weight will be in 
creased by combining the Families and Wealth of the aristocracy 
and thereby you will establish a Balance against, and a check of 
the Democracy. 

Wilson if this amendment succeed, we shall not have a 
National Government the Senate will be too numerous, repre 
senting neither Property, nor numbers, but States or Societies, 
whose interests may oppose the General Govt.; the consequence 
will be unfavorable to the Harmony of the Nation. 

Madison We propose to form a National Government, and 
therefore must abandon Ideas founded in the Plan of a Con 
federation. 

The Senate shd. come from, and represent, the wealth of the 
Nation, and this being the Principle, the proposed amendment 
cannot be adopted besides the numbers will be too large His 
tory proves this proposition, that delegated power has most 
weight and consequence in the hands of a few. The Roman 
tribunes when few, checked the Senate when numerous, they 
divided, became weak and ceased to be the Guardians of the 
People, which was the object of their institution. 

Dickinson The objection is, that you attempt to unite distinct 
Interests : I do not consider this Union to be an objection that 
we should regard Safety may flow from these various Interests 
this diversity exists in the Constitution of England we can 
not abolish the States, and consolidate the whole into one Gov 
ernment if we could consolidate, I should oppose our doing so. 
Let our Government be like that of the solar system let the 
Genl. Govt. be the Sun and States the Planets, repelled yet 
attracted, and the whole moving harmoniously in their several 
orbits. 

The objection from Virginia (Madison) that Power delegated 
to a few will prove a more weighty and efficient check upon the 
Democracy, as in the instance of the roman Tribunes, proves 
too much ; they never exceeded Ten ; and no one thinks that 
the Senate should consist of so small a number, as that of the 
Tribunes at any Time, much less when their number was only 
t hree. 



APPENDIX. 597 



Wilson I am not in favor of the abolition of the States. I 
revere the theory of the British Government, but we cannot 
adopt it. We have no Laws in favor of Primogeniture no Dis 
tinction of Families the partition of States destroys the influence 
of the few. Yet I well know that all confederations have been 
destroyed by the growth and ambition of some of their Mem 
bers, and if the State Legislatures appoint the Senators, the 
Principle will be received by which the antient Confederacies 
were ruined. I therefore propose that the Senators be elected by 
the People, and for this purpose, that the territory be formed into 
convenient divisions or Districts. 

Dickinson Opposes Mr. Wilson s substitute, because it is either 
impracticable, or unfair the Districts must be parts of a State, 
or entire States, or parts of distinct States if the first, how can 
you prevent fraudulent &amp; corrupt elections ; if the second, How 
can you establish an intermediate body, from which to elect those 
who have a majority of voters, and who are not elected ; if the 
third, the small States will never have a Senator, therefore it 
would be unfair. 

On Question to agree to Wilson s substitute, Penn. aye, the 
other 10 States, no. 

Mason It is true that the old Confederacies were ruined by 
gt. overgrown power and the ambition of some of their Members 
but their circumstances differed from ours We have agreed 
that the natl. Govt. shall have a negative on the acts of the State 
Legislatures. the danger now is that the national Legislature 
will swallow up the Legislatures of the States. The Protection 
from this Occurrence will be the securing to the State Legisla 
tures, the choice of the Senators of the U. S. So adopted unani 
mously. 

June 8. 

Charles Pinckney moved, seconded by Madison, to reconsider 
the vote, giving to the National Legislature power in certain 
cases to negative the State Laws, in order to vest in the Nat. 
Legislature power in all cases to negative State Laws, agreed to 
reconsider. 

Chas. Pinckney the violation of Treaties and ordinances, 
passed by Congress, by Laws enacted by the States, are known 



598 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

by all. The Harmony of the Union calls for this Measure of a 
general Negative, and the National independence requires the 
same. 

Williamson the State Legislatures ought to possess indepen 
dent Powers in purely local cases, relating to their separate in 
ternal Policy. 

Madison A Reconsideration of the amendment seems neces 
sary. I am of opinion that the general Govt. will not be able 
to compel the large and important States to rescind a popular 
Law, passed by their respective Legislatures. If this power does 
not vest in the national Legislature, a check will be wanting against 
the centrifugal force, operating constantly to force the several 
States off from the common centre, or national union. 

Gerry This Power may enable the Genl. Govt. to depress one 
State for the advantage of another State. It may prevent the en 
couragement that some States may be inclined to give to manu 
facturers, or prevent the States from training the militia, and 
thereby establish a military force, and so a Despotism. 

Wilson In the establishmt. of society, every man yields to it a 
power over his Life, his Liberty, his Character &amp; his Property. 
There is no such reservation, that the individuals shall be sub 
jected to one, and exempt from another, Law. We have seen the 
Legislatures in our own Country deprive the Citizen of Life, of 
Liberty &amp; of Property. We have seen Laws of Attainder, Punish 
ment and Confiscation. If we mean to found a national Govt., 
States must submit like individuals the Govt. must be supreme 
either the national, or State Govt. must be so. We should re 
member the language with which we began the Revolution We 
then united in saying Virginia is no more, Massachusetts is no 
more, we are one in name, let us be one in truth and fact. Unless 
this Power is vested in the general Govt., the States will be em 
ployed by foreign Powers, against the Union. New States will 
soon be formed, the Inhabitants may be foreigners, and possess 
foreign affections and unless the Genl. Govt. can check the State 
Laws, the nation may be involved in tumult and confusion. 

Dickinson There can be no line of separation, dividing the Leg 
islative power between the Genl. and State Governments. The 
consequence is inevitable that there must be a supreme &amp; august 
national Legislature the objection that the States may be pre-

THE MANNER OF COMPOSING THE H. OF REPRESENTATIVES. 
THE RATIO OF THE CENSUS. 

Br early opposes the Equality of Representatives * numerically 
it is equal, but in operation it will be unequal there will be t\vo di 
visions, or parties one composed of Mass. Penn. &amp; Virginia ; and 
the other of the 10 other States. If Georgia sends one Rep., Vir 
ginia will send 16 these will be united, but the Reps, of the 
smaller States will act without a common impulse and be divided ; 
the Rule of the Confed. is unequal, the large &amp; small States have 
the same Power correct this, take the Map, and divide the whole 
into 13 equal Parts, this done, equality of Representation will be 
just. 

Paterson Our Powers do not extend to the abolition of State 
Governments in order to establish a national Govt. we may 
amend the present system, keeping for our Basis the Confedera 
tion, which establishes the equality of votes among the States I 
consent to the equal Division of the Territory of the U. S. when 
this Equality will be the Parent, or origin, of an equality in the 
Representation. 

* Id est according to the Ratio of the Census. 



600 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

But perhaps the Inequality of the present system is not so 
obvious the States being equal, have equal votes so in the 
respective States individuals have equal votes, tho they possess 
unequal Property. 

Men with 4000 pounds, and those with 100 pounds have equal 
votes, tho one possesses 40 times the Property of the other. 

Mr. Galloway early in Congress from Penn., proposed that 
America should be represented in Parliament, America to have 
200 &amp; G. Br. 500 members but it was quickly foreseen that in 
this way there would be no security of the Liberties of America. 
In like manner an inequality in Representation from the several 
States will not succeed should the Convention approve thereof, 
they cannot bind the States. I cannot agree to the Project here, 
and will employ my influence against it in N. Jersey, which never 
will approve of the Plan. 

Wilson The true Doctrine of Representation is, that the 
Representative ought to speak the language of his Constituents, 
and that his voice should have the same influence, as if given by 
his Constituents Apply this Theory, and the conclusion is in 
favor of a Ratio of Representation and against the present 
system. 

QUERE IF PATERSON S PROJECT. 

The Powers of the Convention only authorize the enlargement 
of the Provisions of the Confederation, viz. 

1. To grant Powers to Congress to collect an impost on the 
importation of foreign Goods, to pass stamp acts &amp; to regulate 
the post off., to regulate Commerce for. &amp; domestic, provided the 
fines &amp; forfeitures be recovered in the course of the common 
Law. 

2. Apportionments on the States to be according to the num 
ber of Whites &amp; f of all others and in case of arrears by the 
State, to pass Laws remedied of the Evil. 

3. Congress to appoint Persons as an Executive to hold their 
Offices years, with fixed salaries &amp; to be ineligible after 
wards removable by Congress on application of a majority of 
the State Executives, but no member of this Executive to com 
mand in any military Expedition. 



APPENDIX. 60 1 



4. The national Executive to appoint the supreme Judicial 
magistrates for good behaviour with Power to try impeachments 
of officers of Gen l. Govt., and questions of appeal from State 
judiciaries, in the construction of treaties, where the Laws of 
trade &amp; Revenue are affected, or in cases in wh. foreigners are 
Parties. 

5. The Laws &amp; treaties of U. S. to be paramount over State 
Laws in case of opposition to treaties or general Laws, the Execu 
tive to call out the militia to cause the treaties and Laws to be 
observed. 

6. Naturalization to be the same in every State. 

7. A citizen guilty of offence in one State, and belonging to 
another State to be punished as tho belonging to the State where 
the offence was committed. 

1 8 June (? 19.) 

Madison It is an Error to say that because unanimity was 
requisite to form the Confederation, that unanimity is also 
required to dissolve it. A contract may be dissolved by the 
breach of a single article such is the Law of Treaties and the 
same Law is applicable to analagous Compacts provisions are 
sometimes made to preserve the Treaty or Compact, notwithstand 
ing the breach of a single article. 

Georgia without authority and against the articles of the Con 
federation, declared &amp; prosecuted war agt. the Indians, and after 
wards treated for Peace with them. New Jersey expressly 
refused to comply with a constitutional Requisition Virginia 
and Maryland formed a Compact respecting the River Potomac. 
Pennsylvania &amp; N. York made an agreement about their boundary 
Line. Massachusetts has raised an army and is now about to 
augment their military Establishment. 

Do not these violations of the Confederation prove that a federal 
Govt. will not answer, the Amphictions had power to decide 
controversies between the members of the League, to fine offend 
ers, to send ambassadors, to choose the Commander in Chief, to 
command the general forces and to employ them agt. the States 
who did not obey the General Regulations. The Athenean League

was similar to that of the Amphictions this League failed by the 
overgrown power of some of the members. Helvetic Confedera 
tion, loose &amp; weak, and the situation of the Swiss differs from our 
own. The German Confederacy, unequal among themselves 
the strength of some members being greater than that of the Con 
federacy The Netherland Union, subject to great Defects 
could act only by unanimity which is not attainable in difficult cases, 
and may be defeated by for. influence in the most important. 

Our System must be such as to escape these Defects. 

Wilson. I do not apprehend that the General Govt. will 
swallow up that of the States the States and their separate Gov 
ernments must be preserved they will harmonize with the Genl. 
Govt. The U. S. are too extensive for one &amp; a free Govt. No 
Despot has governed a Country so extensive. Persia is divided 
into 20 subordinate Govts. and the Roman Empire &amp; Republic 
was divided between the Proconsuls. Alfred divided England 
into societies of 10. persons, 100 persons &amp; into Towns and 
Counties.* 

* Objections to a general or national Govt. 

Seep. 212, Madison Papers. Elliot s Debates, vol. v. 

The Convention does not possess authority to propose any reform which is 
not purely general. 

2. If they possessed such power it wd. be inexpedient to exercise it, be 
cause the small States wd. lose their State influence or equality, and because 
the Genius of the people is of that sort that such a Reform wd. be rejected. 

Answer (R. King) The States under the confed. are not sovereign States 
they can do no act but such as are of a subordinate nature or such as terminate 
in themselves and even these are restrained coinage, P. office &amp;c they are 
wholly incompetent to the exercise of any of the gt. &amp; distinguishing acts of 
sovereignty They can neither make nor receive (embassies) to or from any 
other sovereign they have not the powers of injuring another or of defending 
themselves from an Injury offered from one another they are deaf, dumb and 
impotent these Faculties are yielded up and the U. S. in C. Assd. hold and 
possess them, and they alone can exercise them they are so far out of the 
controul of the separate States yt. if every State in the Union was to instruct yr. 
Deleg., and those Delegates within ye powers of the Arts, of Union shd. do an 
act in violation of their Instructions it wd. nevertheless be valid. If they 
declared a war, any giving aid or comfort to the enemy wd. be Treason ; if 
peace, any capture on the high seas wd. be piracy. This remark proves yt. 
the States are now subordinate corporations or societies and not sovereigns 
these imperfect States are the confederates and they are the electors of the.

Mason The Powers are sufficient and were they not so, we 
should imitate the Amer. Ministers who negotiated the Treaty of 
Peace &amp; did so without full Powers, trusting to the Congress to 
ratify. 

Moreover the proposed System is not impracticable the public 
opinion is not opposed to it the Impost was opposed because the 
Congress consisted of a single Branch, possessing Legislative, 
judicial and executive powers. They were unworthy of being 
entrusted with additional Powers, the People would not rest 
satisfied with the secret Journals of a Conclave. 

magistrates who exercise the national sovereignty. The Articles of Confedr. 
are perpetual Union, are partly federal &amp; partly of the nature of a constitution 
or form of Govt. arising from and applying to the Citizens of the U. S. &amp; not 
from the individual States. 

The only criterion of determining what is federal &amp; what is national is this, 
those acts which are for the government of the States only are purely federal, 
those which are for the government of the Citizens of the individual States are 
national and not federal. 

If then the articles of Confedr. &amp; perpetual union have this twofold capacity, 
and if they provide for an alteration in a certain mode, why may not they be so 
altered as that the federal article may be changed to a national one, and the 
national to a federal ? I see no argument that can be objected to the authority. 
The 5th article regulates the influence of the several States and makes them 
equal does not the confed. authorize this alteration, that instead of this 
Equality, one state may have double the Influence of another I conceive it 
does and so of every Article except that wh. destroys the Idea of a confedy. 
I think it may be proved that every article may be totally altered provided you 
have one guarantying to each State the right of regulating its private &amp; internal 
affairs in the manner of a subordinate corporation. 

But admitting that the Arts, of Confed. &amp; perpet. Union, or the powers of 
the Legis. did not extend to the proposed Reform ; yet the public Deputations 
&amp; the public Danger require it the system proposed to be adopted is no 
scheme of a day, calculated to postpone the hour of Danger, &amp; thus leave it to 
fall with double ruin on our successors It is no crude and undigested plan ; 
the child of narrow and unextensive views, brought forward under the Auspices 
of Cowardice &amp; Irresolution It is a measure of Decision, it is the foundation 
of Freedom &amp; of national Glory. It will draw on itself and be able to support 
the severest scrutiny &amp; Examination. It is no idle experiment, no romantic 
speculation the measure forces itself upon wise men, and if they have not 
firmness to look it in the face and protect it Farewell to the Freedom of our 
Government our military glory will be tarnished and our boasts of Freedom 
will be the scorn of the Enemies of Liberty. 



604 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

The whole People agree in two points first, that the Govern 
ment should be Republican Second, that the Legislature shd. 
consist of two Branches. 

That two branches shd. be unanimously adopted, must have 
happened by a miracle, or by a fixed and universal opinion of the 
People. 

The Gentlemen from N. Jersey adhere to the plan of the Con 
federation, and think that Requisition, after all experience, may 
be made on the State, and, if requisite, executed by military 
Force. I think that this cannot be accomplished. We can no 
more execute civil Regulations by the Militia, than we can unite 
opposite Elements, mingle fire with water besides military coer 
cion does not distinguish between the innocent and the guilty 
and it would therefore be unjust. I will never consent to abolish 
the State Govts., because no General Govt. can perform their 
Duties. We may proceed a certain length in favor of the Genl. 
Govt., but for myself, I will take equal care of the State Govts. 
We cannot make a perfect System, there will after doing our best 
be faults in the work and we can trust our successors with further 
Amendments. 

Martin The Confederation was formed for the safety &amp; Pro 
tection of the particular States, and not for the safety &amp; protec 
tion of the union. I cannot support the Genl. Govt. at the 
Expence of the State Govts., but will contend for the Safety and 
Happiness of the particular States at the expense of the U. S. 

Sherman. Two Branches not requisite, one is sufficient and 
most fit for a Confederation. No example can be given of two 
Branches in a federal Govt. Increase the powers of Congress 
preserve the States and avoid a Consolidation of them. Our 
Treaties would become void by the abandonment of the Articles 
of Confederation these were formed by &amp; with the U. S. of 
N. H., Mass., &amp;c. 

Wilson. It is made a question whether the Legislature shall 
be composed of one or two bodies whether it shall be elected by 
the States, or by the People, and whether the States shall be 
equally represented, or in proportion to their respective wealth &amp; 
numbers. The antient Confederacies were formed in the infancy 
of Politicks and soon fell victims to the inefficacy of their organi- 



APPENDIX. 605 



zation. Because they had only a single body, it is not therefore 
expedient that we shd. follow their example. 

The Dutch &amp; Swiss Confederacies have been preserved by 
external balances The German League is kept by the predomi 
nance of the imperial House. Our equality of Votes was an 
occasional Compact, produced in a crisis of our Affairs. The 
Great States conducted like the true mother in the controversy of 
the Harlots they like her, in the claim of her child, gave their 
sovereignty to the small States, rather than it shd. be destroyed 
by the British King. 



June 20 (t 21.) 

Johnson The Gentleman from N. York is praised by all, but 
supported by no Gentleman. He goes directly to the abolition 
of the State Governments. All other Gentlemen agree that the 
Genl. Govt. shd. be made more powerful and the State Govt. less 
powerful. In the Virginia Plan, Provision is made to increase 
the general Powers, but it contains no Provision for the security 
of the States The Plan of N. Jersey provides for the Security 
of the Genl. &amp; State Govts. If the advocates for the Virginia 
Plan can show that it affords to the States security against the 
Gen. Govt. we may all agree. 

Wilson We have agreed that the Legislatures shall appoint one 
Branch of the national Govt. give to the National Gov. power 
reciprocally to appoint one Br. of each State Legislature How 
wd. this endanger the States ? What Power of the States would 
the General Govt. desire to have ? Would a portion of the State 
powers, were they acquired, be of considerable importance to the 
Genl. Govt. ? any attempt to acquire the same would excite and 
the People would not suffer it. 

Madison The History of the antient Confederacies proves, that 
there has never been Danger of the ruin of the State Govts. by En 
croachment of the General Govt., but the converse is true, the par 
ticular Govts. have overthrown the Genl. Govt. I have therefore 
been assiduous to guard the general Govt. from the power of the 
State Govts. These Govts. regulate the conduct of their Citizens., 



-606 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

they punish offenders, cause ordinary Justice to be administered 
&amp; perform acts which endear the Govt. to the People, who will 
not suffer the general Govt. to injure the State Govts. 

2^~ The Convention resolved that the Genl. Legislature slid. 
consist of two Branches. So. Carolina moved that Representa 
tives shd. be chosen as the several State Legislatures shd. judge 
proper. 

Madison andWilson opposed the Election by State Legislatures 
.and recommended the Election by the People. State Elections 
will introduce State influence opposed to that of the Genl. Govt. 
The States will elect to Congress and manage the affairs of the 
States also if the State Legislatures elect, they will also instruct 
and so embarrass the Representatives otherwise, if elected by 
the People. There will be no difficulty in popular Elections 
the returns may be made to the State Legislatures who may settle 
contested Elections.

APPENDIX. 607 



June 25. 

ELECTION OF SENATE. 

Wilson Every man will possess a double character. He will 
be a citizen of a particular State and also of the U. S. The 
National Legislature will apply to the latter, and should there 
fore be chosen by the citizens of the U. S., and not by the State 
Legislatures because the Members of the State Legislatures are 
particularly chosen on account of their State Citizenship and 
attachments they have a remote connexion with the Genl. Govt. 
and a direct and intimate one with that of the several States. 

The Distinction indicates the character of the Electors of the 
Senate, and the Circumstance shd. influence our decision in re 
spect to the choice of the Senators. The General Govt. is separ 
ate and distinct from the State Govts. ; War, Peace, Commerce, 
Revenue, are the particular concerns of the Genl. Govt., while 
inferior and local interests are confided to the State Govern 
ment. In whatever concerns the Questions confided to the 
Genl. Govt., we act as Citz. of the U. S., and in relation to the 
interests intrusted to the State Govts. we act as Citz. of the 
respective States. We should not then refer ourselves to the 
Legislatures of the States in appointing the Senators of the U. S., 
but should proceed on the Basis of the People, and choose the 
Senators by Electors appointed by the People. 

Ellsworth We must build our Genl. Govt. on the strength &amp; 
vigour of the State Govts. The Genl. Govt. could not proceed 
without their support, or by the help of a large standing army. 
Massachusetts is unable to go on with her republican Govt. with 
out an army Virginia cannot &amp; does not govern Kentucky 
Each of these States (Mass. &amp; Virg.) are too large for a Repub 
lican System. I am in favor of the old scheme &amp; for proceed 
ing on the continuation of the States, and therefore for electing 
Senators of the U. S. by the State Legislatures. 

Johnson When the Question of State Security or individual 
ity occurred, it was urged by Mr. Wilson &amp; Mr. Madison that 
the States were secured by the Rights of their Legislatures to 
.appoint the Senators of the U. S. If their security depend on 



608 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 



this mode of choice, the proposed plan to elect the Senators by 
Electors chosen by the people would destroy the promised secur 
ity of choosing them by the Legislatures of the States. 

Mason The national Executive has a negative on the two 
Branches and each Branch has a negative on the other. The 
Genl. Govt. moreover has a negative on the several State Legis 
latures, and this Regulation is necessary on the principle of Self- 
Defence, which is an instinctive Principle, or Law of Nature ; 
and in a suitable degree shd. be possessed by natural and arti 
ficial bodies being granted to the Genl. Govt., why withhold it 
from the State Govt. ? What other influence over, or check upon 
the Genl. Govt. will the States possess, if their Legislatures do 
not elect the Senate or second Branch of the Natl. Govt. I am 
unwilling to have the States without a self-protecting Power as 
I desire the continuance of the several States, I shall not agree 
to deprive them of the Faculty of self-Protection. 

June 27. 

That the suffrage of the first Branch of the Legislature (the 
H. of R.) ought not to be equal among the States. 

Martin. The States are equal and we have agreed in the 
Equality of votes excepting Virginia &amp; N. Carolina, the latter 
being divided By giving more votes to the large than to the 
small States, the large ones will combine and tyrannize over the 
small States these States would have 42 of 90 votes in the first 
Branch Now, under the confederation, seven States may com 
bine but they are the constitutional majority. 

(Remarks. The Ratio of taxes is determined by the 8 art. of 
the Confederation wh. gives equal votes to the States even the 
Post office cannot be so regulated as to obtain a Revenue beyond 
the Expenses of supporting but under the proposed amendment 
the Power of taxation is not limited, but may be exercised in such 
manner as the national Legislature may prefer.) 

Martin continued The amendment of the Confederation must 
be made in reference to the State Govts. and for their Safety &amp; 
Protection all which relates to external, and concerns that are 
merely national, may be granted to the U. S. while all that is in- 



APPENDIX. 609 



ternal and relative to the individuals of the separate States must 
continue to belong to the particular States If further Powers to 
the U. S. become requisite a future Convention may propose them 
to the States. If we give more than enough now, it can never be 
retained (resumed). We hear it said, that if the Genl. Govt. 
makes Laws affecting individuals instead of States the Govt. ceases 
to be federal but if the persons and concerns affected by the 
laws of the Genl. Govt. be foreign or external, the Govt. would 
be merely federal as regards everything within the power of the 
States separately, which would remain wholly subject to State 
Laws the States being equal must have equal influence and equal 
votes. 

All men out of Society are by nature equal, in freedom and 
every other Property of men. Locke, Vattel and all other writers 
establish this Truth. 

June 28. 

Madison The Gentlemen opposed to a Representation founded 
upon the number of Citizens of the respective States, are some 
what inaccurate in their observations They speak of Tyranny 
and of the small States being swallowed up by the large ones 
They apprehend combinations between Mass. Penn. &amp; Virginia 
against the other States. But there is nothing in Religion, man 
ners, modes of thinking or Habits of any sort, manufactures or 
course of Business, commerce or natural Productions which would 
create a common interest or Prejudice between these States ex 
clusive of all others. There is no fact in the history of men or 
nations that authorizes such a Jealousy. England and France 
might have combined to divide America. The great States of 
Greece, Athens &amp; Sparta, which were members of the Amphic- 
tionic League never combined to oppress their co-estates instead 
thereof, they were Rivals and fought each other. The greater 
Cantons of the Helvetic Union, did not combine against the small 
Cantons ; no such combination has existed in the Union of the 
Netherlands. Instead of Combination, the great States of Ger 
many have often been at war with each other These are not only 
Historical Facts, but they proceed from a Law of Nature that 

VOL. I.-39 



6lO LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

governs men and Nations, which are but aggregates of men. 
When men or Nations are strong and equal they become Rivals 
and Jealousy prevents their Union. 

Chas. Pinckney. The Honors &amp; Offices may become the objects 
of strong desire and of combination to acquire them. If Repre 
sentatives be apportioned among the States in the Ratio of num 
bers, the Citizens will be free and equal but the States will be un 
equal, and their sovereignty will be degraded. 

Friday, June 29. 

Johnson. The two sides of the House reason in such a man 
ner that we can never meet. Those who contend for the equality 
of votes between the States, define a State to be a mere associa 
tion of men and affirm these associations to be equal ; on the 
other side, they who contend for the apportionment of votes ac 
cording to numbers, define a State to be a District, or country 
with a certain number of Inhabitants, like a parish or county ; and 
these say that these Districts should have an influence in propor 
tion to the number of their Inhabs. Both reason correctly from 
their Premises. We must compromise and gratify both ; let one 
branch be composed according to the Rule of Equality, and the 
other by the Rule of Proportion. 

Madison. We are vague in our language. We speak of the 
Sovereignty of the States. The States are not sovereign in the 
full extent of the term. There is a gradation from a simple cor 
poration for limited and specified objects, such as an incorpora 
tion of a number of Mechanicks up to a full sovereignty as 
possessed by independent Nations, whose Powers are not limited. 
The last only are truly sovereign. The States, who have not such 
full power, but are deprived of such as by the Confedn. compose 
the natl. powers are in the true meaning of the word Sovereigns. 
They are political associations or corporations, possessing certain 
powers by these they may make some, but not all. Laws. 

Hamilton. Men are naturally equal, and societies or States, 
when fully independent, are also equal. It is as reasonable, and 
may be as expedient, that States should form Leagues or com- 



APPENDIX. 6ll 



pacts, and lessen or part with their national Equality, as that men 
should form the social compact and, in doing so, lessen or sur 
render the natural Equality of men. This is done in every 
society ; and the grant to the society affects Persons and Prop 
erty ; age, minority &amp; Estates are all affected. 

A Man may not become an Elector or Elected, unless of a 
given age &amp; having a certain Estate. Let the People be repre 
sented according to numbers, the People will be free : every 
Office will be equally open to all and the majority of the People 
are to make the Laws. Yet it is said that the States will be 
destroyed &amp; the People will be Slaves this is not so. The 
People are free, at the expense of an artificial &amp; ideal Equality of 
the States. 

On this Question for apportionment 

Cont. N. Yk, N. Jersey &amp; Delaware No.

Ellsworth moved that in the second Br., or Senate, each State 
should have one Vote only. As the first, or Democratic, Br. rep 
resents the People, let the second Br., or Senate, represent the 
States. The People will thus be secured and the States protected. 
Without we agree in this motion we shall have met in vain. None 
of the eastern States, except Mass, will consent to abolish the 
States. If the southern States agree to a popular, instead of a 
State, Representation we shall produce a separation. The Union 
must be cut in two at the Delaware. This plan of forming the 
Senate is to give an equal vote to the States, will secure the small 
States, and as the numbers of the large States will have more in 
fluence, tho they have the same &amp; an equal vote with the small 
States, they will receive no injury. Holland has but one Vote in 
the States, yet her influence is greater than that of any two of the 
States. There is Danger that the large States may combine to 
overpower the small States ; the danger is not so great by reason 
of the distance between the large States, still there is danger ; 
they will be able to combine and therefore there is danger. 
Three or four can more easily enter into Combinations than nine 
or ten. 



6l2 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

Madison. One Gentleman from Connecticut has proposed 
doing as much as is prudent now, leaving future amendments to 
Posterity, this is a dangerous doctrine. The Defects of the 
Amphictionic League were acknowledged, but were never re 
formed. The Netherlands have four times attempted to make 
amendments in their Confederation, but have failed in each 
attempt. The Fear of innovation, the hue &amp; Cry in favour of the 
Liberty of the People will as they have done prevent the neces 
sary Reforms. If the States have equal Votes &amp; influence in the 
Senate we shall be in the utmost danger, the minority of the 
People will govern the majority. Delaware during the late war 
opposed and defeated an Embargo, to which twelve States had 
agreed, and continued to supply the enemy with Provisions in 
time of war.

SHALL THE SENATE BE EQUALLY APPD. AMONG THE STATES ? 

Wilson. The proportionate Representation in the H. of R. 
was opposed by 22 out of 90 : the latter number standing for the 
who. Population. The Equality of votes among the States will 
subject the majority of the People &amp; Property to be governed by 
the minority of each even if the States, being a majority, make 
-flyths of the whole and will be able to govern and control 
ff ths. This is too palpable an error, too great a Defect in the 
Constitution to permit the expectation of public harmony &amp; 
Happiness. 

The Gentleman from Connecticut (Ellsworth) urges that if the 
Representation in the Senate be in proportion to the numbers of 
the People, we shall establish an aristocracy or monarchy three 
or four large States may combine for monarchy ; if not so, for aris 
tocracy. 4 States containing a majority of People will govern 9 
other States but the danger of combination &amp; aristocracy is not 
greater, nor so great, among the large States as the small ones. 
Seven States contain only ffths of the People : if the 24 con 
trol the 66, this would in reality be an Aristocracy and one that 
could not endure.

SHALL THE RATIO OF REPRESENTATIVES BE 4O,OOO ? 

G. Morris Mere numbers should not be the rule : tho it may 
be a fit rule at present, it will cease to be so, when the Western 
Country is settled. We should take care not to establish a Rule, 
that will enable the poor but numerous Inhabitants of the West to 
destroy or oppress the Atlantic States. Men do not enter into 
Society to preserve their Lives or Liberty the Savages possess 
both in perfection they unite in Society for the Protection of 
Property. 

Genl. Rutledge. I agree with Mr. Morris. Property is the ob 
ject of Society. I therefore propose that the Representation 
should be in proportion to the taxes paid in given Districts let 
the property be represented. I do not consider Numbers to be a 
true index of wealth even now, hereafter it will become less so. 

Saturday, July 7. 

IN THE HOUSE. ON THE REPORT OF GENL. COMEE. SHALL THE 
STATES HAVE EQUAL VOTES IN THE SENATE ? 

Gerry. I agree to the measure, provided that the first Br. (H. 
of Reps.) shall originate money bills and money appropriations. 
The prejudices as \vell as the interest of our Constituents must 
be regarded two or three thousand men are in office in the 
States their influence will be in favor of an Equality of votes 
among the States. 

Madison. Equality in the Senate will enable a minority to hold 
a majority, and to oblige them to submit to their interests, or they 
will withdraw their assent to measures essential and necessary to 
the general Good. I have known one man, when the State was 
represented by only two, and they were divided, oppose six States 
in Congress on an important occasion for three days, and finally 
compel them to gratify his caprice in order to obtain his suffrage. 
The Senate will possess certain exclusive Powers, such as the ap 
pointments to office, if the States have equal votes ; a minority of 
People will appoint the Great Offices. Besides the small States 



6 14 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

may be near the Seat of Govt. a bare Quorum of the H. of R. 
may be easily assembled, and carry a bill against the sense of a 
majority if all were present, and the Senate, tho all were present, 
might confirm such Bill. Virginia has objected to every addition 
of the powers of Congress, because she has only T V of the Power 
when she ought to have one sixth. 

Paterson. I hope the question will be taken : if we do not 
give equal votes in the Senate to the States, the small States agree 
ing that money Bills and appropriations shall originate in the H. 
of Reps., elected according to numbers, it must not be expected 
that the small States will agree to the amendments of the Con 
federation. Let us decide this question and lose no more time. 
I think that I shall vote against the provision, because I think 
that the exclusive originating of money Bills &amp; appropriations by 
the H. of Reps, is giving up too much on the part of the small 
States. 

Gov. Morris. Let us examine what the small States call the 
consideration which they are to give for the adventure of an equal 
vote in the Senate. How did it happen that the small States ac 
quired this advantage of an equal vote ? When England pressed 
hard upon us, the small States said go on with your opposition 
without us, or give us an equal vote ; and so they obtained it. 
And now they call the Confederation, made under these circum 
stances, a sacred Compact, that cannot be changed. We are met 
to propose new and further powers for the Genl. Govt. The great 
States may truly say that the Confederation is defective, it wants 
more power, especially as respects the levying of Taxes, and the 
regulation of Trade we are sensible of this Truth, but we also 
know the further Defect of the want of a proportionate Represen 
tation in Congress, and are unwilling to add to the Powers unless 
the Representation bear a just Proportion to the power we confer 
&amp; the interest that we shall have in the Regulations of the Gen 
eral Govt. Unless we can agree with others in establishing a 
vigourous General Government, we must for our own safety make 
vigourous State Govts., &amp; not depend on a weak General Govt. 
Germany has an Emperor and a powerful one, a common Lan 
guage ; her religion, customs, Habits and interests are not dis 
similar, yet the glory of her Princes and the Prosperity of her free 
cities are preferred to those of the Empire, whose honors are less

esteemed than those of the subordinate Princes In our plan, we 
propose an Aulic Council, but we shall have no Emperor to exe 
cute its Decrees.

MEMORANDUM. 

July is, &lt;?/. 

About twelve days since the Convention appointed a Grand 
Comee, consisting of Gerry, Ellsworth, Yates, Paterson, Frank 
lin, Bedford, Martin, Mason, Rutledge &amp; Baldwin to adjust the 
Representation in the two Brs. of the Legislature of the U. S. 
They reported yt. every 40,000 Inhabs. taken agreeably to the 
Resolution of Cong, of ye 18 Ap. 1783, shd. send one member to 
the first Br. of the Legislatre, yt. this Br. shd. originate exclu 
sively Money Bills, &amp; also originate ye appropriations of money ; 
and that in ye Senate or upper Br. each State shd. have one vote 
&amp; no more. The Representation as to the first Br. was twice 
recommitted altho not to the same Committee ; finally it was 
agreed yt Taxation of the direct sort &amp; Representation shd. be 
in direct proportion with each other that the first Br. shd. consist 
of 65 members, viz. N. H. 3, M. 8, R. I. i, C. 5, N. Y. 6, N. J. 4, 
P. 8, D. i, M. 6, V. 10, N. C. 5, S. C. 5, G. 3, and that the orig 
ination of money Bills and the Appropriations of money shd. 
belong in the first instance to yt Br., but yt in the Senate or 2nd 
Br. each State shd. have an equal Vote. In this situation of the 
Report it was moved by S. Car. that in the formation of the 2nd 
Br., instead of an equality of Votes among the States, that N. H. 
shd. have 2, M. 4, R. I. i, C. 3, N. Y. 3, N. J. 2, P. 4, D. i, M. 3, 
V. 5, N. C. 3, S. C. 3, G. 2 -total 36.

Aug. fth. 

3rd Article. A negative in all cases proposed to be altered to 
all cases in which Each Branch has concurrent jurisdiction. 

Madison proposed to strike the clause out, which was done. 
He also proposed to omit the provision, fixing the time when the 
Legislature should meet. 

Morris in favor of leaving the time of meeting to the Legis 
lature, and observed that if the time be fixed in the Constitution, 
it would not be observed, as the Legislature wd. not be punctual 
in assembling. 

Gorham in favor of the Legislature s meeting once a year and 
of fixing the time. They should meet, if for no other Business, 
to superintend the Conduct of the Executive. 

Mason in favor of an annual meeting. The Legislatures are 
also inquisitorial and should meet frequently to inspect the con 
duct of the public Officers. 

4 Art. i. Electors to be the same as those of the most 
numerous Branch of the State Legislature. 

Morris proposed to strike out the Clause, and to leave it to the 
State Legislatures to establish the Qualification of the Electors 
and Elected, or to add a clause giving to the Nat. Legislature 
powers to alter the qualifications. 

Ellsworth If the Legislature can alter the qualifications, they 
may disqualify three fourths, or a greater portion of the Electors 
this would go far to create aristocracy. The clause is safe as it 
stands the States have staked their liberties on the Qualifications 
which we have proposed to confirm. 

Dickinson It is urged that to confine the Right of Suffrage to 
the Free-Holders is a step towards the creation of an aristocracy. 
This cannot be true. We are all safe by trusting the owners of 
the soil ; and it will not be unpopular to do so, for the Freehold 
ers are the more numerous Class. Not from freeholders, but from 
those who are not freeholders, free Govts. have been endangered. 
Freeholds are by our Laws of inheritance divided among the 



APPENDIX. 617 



children of the deceased, and will be parcelled out among all the 
worthy men of the State ; the merchants &amp; mechanicks may 
become freeholders ; and without being so, they are Electors of 
the State Legislatures, who appoint the Senators of the U. S. 

Ellsworth Why confine the Right of Suffrage to freeholders ? 
The Rule should be that he who pays and is governed, should be 
an Elector. Virtue &amp; Talents are not confined to the Freehold 
ers, and we ought not to exclude them. 

Morris. I disregard sounds and am not alarmed with the word 
aristocracy, but I dread the thing and will oppose it, and for this 
reason I think that I shall oppose this Constitution because it will 
establish an Aristocracy. There cannot be an aristocracy of Free 
holders if they all are Electors. But there will be, when a great 
&amp; rich man can bring his poor Dependents to Vote in our Elec 
tions unless you establish a qualification of Property, we shall 
have an aristocracy. Limit the Right of suffrage to freeholders, 
and it will not be unpopular, because nine Tenths of the Inhabi 
tants are freeholders. 

Mason. Every one who is of full age and can give evidence of 
his common Interest in the Community should be an Elector. By 
this Rule, freeholders alone have not this common Interest. The 
Father of a family, who has no freehold, has this Interest. When 
he is dead his children will remain. This is a natural interest or 
bond which binds men to their country lands are but an artifi 
cial tie. The idea of counting freeholders as the true and only 
persons to whom the Right of Suffrage shd. be confided is an 
English Prejudice. In England, a Twig and Turf are the 
Electors. 

Madison. I am in favor of entrusting the Right of Suffrage to 
Freeholders only. It is a mistake that we are governed by Eng 
lish attachments. The Knights of the Shires are chosen by free 
holders, but the members of the Cities and Boroughs are elected 
by freemen without freeholds, &amp;who have as small property as the 
Electors of any other country. Where is the crown influence 
seen, where is corruption in the Elections practiced not in the 
Counties, but in the Cities and Boroughs. 

Franklin. I am afraid that by depositing the Right of Suffrage 
in the freeholders exclusively we shall injure the lower Class of 
freemen. This Class possess hardy Virtues and great Integrity. 



6l8 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

The revolutionary war is a glorious Testimony in favor of Ple 
beian Virtue our military and naval men are sensible of this 
Truth. I myself know that our Seamen who were Prisoners in 
England refused all the allurements that were made use of, to 
draw them from their allegiance to their Country threatened with 
ignominious Halters, they still refused. This was not the case 
with the English Seamen, who, on being made Prisoners entered 
into the American Service and pointed out where other Prisoners 
could be made and this arose from a plain cause. The Ameri 
cans were all free and equal to any of their fellow citizens 
the English Seamen were not so. In antient Times every free 
man was an Elector, but afterwards England made a Law which 
required that every Elector should be a freeholder. This Law 
related to the County Elections the Consequence was that the 
Residue of the Inhabitants felt themselves disgraced, and in the 
next Parliament a law was made, authorizing the Justice of the 
Peace to fix the Price of Labour and to compel Persons who were 
not freeholders to labour for those who were, at a stated rate, or 
to be put in Prison as idle vagabonds. From this Period the com 
mon People of England lost a great Portion of attachment to 
their Country. 

Wednesday 8. August. 

QUALIFICATIONS OF ELECTORS OF REPS. 

Gorham. The Qualifications (being such as the several States 
prescribe for Electors of their most numerous Branch of the 
Legislature) stand well. Gentlemen are in error, who suppose 
the Electors of Cities may not be trusted. In England the mem 
bers chosen in London, Bristol &amp; Liverpool are as independent as 
the members of the Counties of England. The Crown has little 
or no influence in City Elections, but has great influence in Bor 
oughs, where the Votes of Freeholders are bought &amp; sold. There 
is no risk in allowing the merchants &amp; mechanicks to be Electors ; 
they have been so time immemorial in this Country &amp; in England. 
We must not disregard the Habits, usages &amp; Prejudices of the 
People. Propose a window Law in New England and you would 
offend the People ; propose a Poor Tax in Old England, and it 



APPENDIX. 619 



would in like manner offend the People. So if you exclude 
Merchants &amp; Mechanicks from the list of Electors you will 
offend them. 

Question respecting qualification of Elector &amp; between Resi 
dent, Inhabitant with residence of 3 years. 

Morris proposed that Freeholders only shd. be Electors of 
Reps. 

Rutledge proposed Residence for 7 years in the State. 

Mason. I am in fav. of Residence being a qualification of 
Representation, otherwise a stranger may offer and by corruption 
obtain an Election. Without this security, we may have a Bor 
ough system and Eng. Corruption. After several votes the 
Question settled as in ye Constitution. 

NATURALIZATION. 

14 years Residence after naturalization being proposed as 
requisite to be chosen a Senator of the U. S. it was said to be 
illiberal. 

Morris. Liberal and illiberal are relative and indefinite Terms. 
The Indians are the most liberal of any People, because when 
Strangers come among them, they offer their wives and daughters 
for their carnal amusement. It is recommended that we throw 
open our Doors, and invite the oppressed of all Nations to come 
&amp; find an asylum in America. It is true we have invited them to 
come &amp; worship in our Temple, but we have never proposed 
that they should become Priests at our Altars. We should 
cherish the Love of our Country and exalt its honour these are 
wholesome Prejudices in its favor. Foreigners cannot learn our 
Laws or understand our Constitution under fourteen years.. 
Seven years are requisite to learn to be a shoemaker, &amp; double 
this Term will be necessary to learn to be an American Legis 
lator ; and it will require at least fourteen years to eradicate 
native attachment &amp; the affections of Education. 

Franklin opposed to fourteen years. It will be illiberal. We 
have many good friends in England and other parts of Europe 
who ought not to be excluded. 

Wilson^ opposed to fourteen years.

POWERS OF THE CONVENTION. 

Endorsed " Federal Constitution Speeches in Genl. Convention 

1787." 

K. We have power to propose anything, but to conclude 
nothing. 

We may expect the approbation of Congress and hope for that 
of the Legislatures of the States. It is not so sure as some 
Gentlemen believe it to be, that the Power of the States is the 
idol of the People, and that they are unwilling to see established 
a general or national Govt. A citizen of N. Jersey who may be 
gratified by being called so, will not feel himself degraded by 
being called a Citizen of the U. S. The object of our Conven 
tion is to increase the power of the general Govt. and that too 
at the expense of the State Govts. 

It is not requisite, nor expedient, that theRights or power of the 
People should be diminished they have already given powers 
sufficient both for the State &amp; general Govt. and all that we are 
called upon for, is to make a right Division of these Powers be 
tween the General and the State Governments. Whether we 
regard the Power, which makes the Laws, or that which inter 
prets them, or that by which they are carried into execution, 
nothing further is necessary then a proper division of each 
Department between the Genl. and the State Govts. 

The organization of the State Govts. will remain, or may be 
altered by the States respectively. Our business is to organize 
the General Govt., to divide it into Legislative, executive &amp; 
judicial bodies ; and to do this on safe Principles, neither giving 
to either too much power, nor too little, beginning with the Legis 
lative and causing the judicial &amp; executive power to be co-exten 
sive. To constitute the Legislature of a free Govt. it must rest 
upon the Power of the People, and be created by them not like 
the Power of Congress, which rests upon the States &amp; is unsound 
because it rests upon a single unbalanced body. Moreover it is 
unequally composed, the Equality of Votes is a Vicious Principle 
that cannot be endured tho with the actual Powers of Congress, 
it has hitherto been borne, the badness of the Principle is such 
that the large States will not consent to enlarge these Powers 



APPENDIX. 621 



if further Powers be given, the National Legislature must be 
appointed in Proportion to the numbers &amp; wealth of the several 
States. It must also be divided into two Branches by this 
means it may be balanced, which is impracticable with one Body. 

And tho to restrain and balance the Powers of the Legislature 
it must be divided, the contrary is true with the Executive. 
Division of the Executive destroys Responsibility the members 
contend with each other, or combine for bad purposes the first 
Triumvirs at Rome, and afterwards the Consuls prove that this 
will be the case. 

The Judiciary must be independent, and its powers co-exten 
sive with those of the Natl. Govt. 



APPENDIX II. 

The following, in the handwriting of R. King, gives an in 
teresting statement of the circumstances attending the dis 
solution of the American army after the peace of 1783 : 

In a conversation with Col. Wm. D r on the i2th Oct. 88, 

concerning the views of the American Army a short time previous 
to its being disbanded, there was reason to conjecture that his 
knowledge of that subject might be relied on, as well from his per 
sonal observations made at the time, he being then in camp, as 
from conversations since with Col. Armstrong, who was author of 
the letter addressed to the army and deep in the conspiracy. 
From this conversation it appears that the arrival of peace and the 
approaching dissolution of the army formed a singular crisis in 
the military annals of America a return to private life was to a 
majority of the American officers a prospect of obscurity if not of 
actual misery. The American governments were not favorable to 
their claims. Their respectability wd. be lost by separation and 
their pretensions derided. They were without wealth or family 
influence and their military situation was more inviting and pleas 
ant than any that they cd. expect or hope. 

Their object was to perpetuate that situation or procure one 



622 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

more eligible for this purpose. They must have a leader and 
property must be combined for their support. Although the severe 
virtues of the Commander in chief gave small hopes of his coun 
tenance, yet they did not despair of alluring him in some measure 
to their views. Col. Walter Stuart was employed by the conspi 
rators to sound the General. The agent is said to have been ill- 
chosen. How far the plan was opened by him to the Genl. does 
not appear ; but a fixed conviction was produced in the mind of 
Col. Stuart that they should meet with the most decided opposi 
tion from the Commander in Chief. Genl. Gates was then fixed 
on as their leader, and the conspiracy was too inviting to be re 
jected by him. R. Morris was sounded &amp; listened to the conspir 
acy ; the hopes of future greatness, which he might promise him 
self in case of success, by having the sole direction and controul of 
the Finances, perhaps might influence him he is said, when asked 
how can an army be fed when opposed by the country, to have 
replied, " / will feed them." 

Knox is said to have acquired some information on the subject 
and to have communicated it to the Comr. in chief before the 
publication of the first address to the Army. This gave him time 
to prepare in season. The manner in wh. he acquired informa 
tion was such that the communication thereof to the Genl. gave 
universal dissatisfaction to the conspirators. The public meeting 
is said to have been exquisitely critical. Pickering, who was not 
in the conspiracy, &amp; who was not partial to the Commander in 
chief, spoke with firmness concerning the wrongs of the Army 
but disapproved the Address. There was wanting but a man of 
Firmness and moderate Eloquence to have followed Pickering, and 
notwithstanding the Address of the General, to have taken the 
army out of his hands &amp; to have placed it in those of the appoint 
ment of the Conspirators. The issue is well known ; the army was 
quietly disbanded. Washington was before dissatisfied with 
Gates ; this step must have finished his aversion. It is said that 
he has since been informed that R. Morris was in the conspiracy ; 
if so, the cordiality between him &amp; Morris cannot be sincere. He 
must dislike Morris, because he conspired in favor of his Rival and 
against his Glory. 

The statement ends here. ED. 



APPENDIX. 623 



APPENDIX III. 

The following statement, in the handwriting of R. King, 
gives some information about the plan of certain capitalists 
in France to contrive with persons in the United States to 
purchase the Debt due from the U. S. to France. 

NEW YORK, 21 December, 1788. 

Some days since Col. Duer mentioned to me that his situation 
required that he shd. pay some attention to his pecuniary Con 
cerns, and to the establishment of some permanent provision for 
the Decline of Life and the support of his Family. He remarked 
that Mons. de Warville who lately returned to France came to 
this country with a view of looking into its Debt &amp; Resources, to 
be able to give good information to such European capitalists as 
may be disposed to speculate in the American funds. That 
Mons. de Warville, who was a Geneva Banker, had devised a 
plan of purchasing the Debt due from the U. S. to France, that 
Capitalists of France would embark in the Purchase, that they 
proposed the association of Americans to the amount of a moiety 
of the Purchase, that he had been consulted on the Subject and 
the plan had been submitted to him, and proposed t ~ me a con 
cern in the project my answer was ambiguous and indefinite. 

Yesterday Col. Duer renewed the conversation and told me 
that he had conferred with Wadsworth, Genl. Knox &amp; Mr. 
Osgood on the Subject that he had informed them that Rob. &amp; 
Gov. Morris had in view something of the same nature with 
Clav r iere s plan ; that they had proposed to unite with him (Duer^ 
and that Gov. Morris was going to Europe, with this among 
other views. That he had in some sort assented to the Morris 
proposals, and given letters to Govr. to the associates of Claviere 
having previously shewn them to Warville. That the design of 
Govr. was that Duer, R. Mor. &amp; Govr. Morris shd. be the princi 
pal Americans, that Constable &amp; Duer s friend (Osgood) shd. be 
admitted and such other shares as shd. become absolutely in 
dispensable shd. be taken into the Association ; and that beyond 
these shares or Portions (which Govr. seems to have in view to 
limit) the surplus gains shall be equally divided between Duer 



624 LIFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF RUFUS KING. 

R. M. &amp; Gouvr. Morris That the operation or effect of the Let 
ters given to Govr. Mor. wd. go no farther than to admit him &amp; 
R. M. as individual associates, on a common footing That the 
intention of Claviere &amp; Warville was to make a conditional Con 
vention for the Transfer of the Debt due to France, the conven 
tion to become valid when ratified by Congress. But shd, this 
fail, the Idea of the Morrises and of Claviere and others, is that 
the measure might be accomplished by the Influence of an Ameri 
can Minister in Holland R. Morris &amp; the few friends of Govr. 
Morris would push his appointment Duer conceived that Mrs. 
Knox had been assailed on the subject, that Knox might be 
influenced in its favor, &amp;c, &amp; said that he had therefore in com 
pany with Wadsworth freely conversed with Genl. Knox concern 
ing the whole project that Knox &amp; Wadsworth had requested 
him to apply to me and to know whether I wd. accept a public 
appointment to Holland that he had fully conversed with 
Osgood on the subject, and that Knox, W. &amp; Osgood concurred 
in the entire propriety of my appointment. I told Col. Duer 
that I was not indisposed to a foreign appointment that the 
honor &amp; Duties of such an office wd. be my Sovreign rule of 
Cond. &amp; that if in perfect consistence with the Duties &amp; Dignity 
of the Office, I cd. promote the interest of my Friends, it wd. be 
a great satisfaction to me. But that I desired not to be con 
sidered as giving an answer any way at present, that although 
Knox might prefer me to Govr. Morris, yet the opinions of Mr. 
Jay &amp; Col. Hamilton were of consequence in my mind. That 
previous to any Decision on my part I must be ascertained of 
their opinions. 

Duer observed that there were some reasons why I should make 
an early Determination such as the undecided State of Genl. 
Knox s mind and the probability of a direct application for his 
Influence from R. Morris.
