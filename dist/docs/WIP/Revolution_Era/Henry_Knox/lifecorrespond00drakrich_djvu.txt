PREFACE. 



THE materials for this Memoir, prepared a short 
time since for the " Memorials of the Massachusetts 
Society of the Cincinnati," have been mainly derived 
from the original letters and papers of General Knox. 
These papers, which fill fifty-six large portfolios, 
include, besides Knox s own letters and military 
papers, many of the letters of Washington Greene, 
and other prominent actors in the Revolution and a 
variety of documents illustrating the history arid set 
tlement of that part of Maine included in the Mus- 
congus or Waldo patent. About the year 1840 they 
were placed by the family in the hands of Hon. 
Charles S. Daveis of Portland, who began, but did 
not finish, a memoir of Knox ; and in 1853 they were 
transferred, with the same object, to Mr. Joseph Wil- 
lard of Boston, a gentleman eminently qualified for 
the task, but who unfortunately died before its com 
pletion. During their transit by water from Portland 
to Boston, the vessel in which they were embarked 
was wrecked, and they were slightly injured, having 
been for some hours submerged. They are now,

however, in safe keeping, their former owner, Ad 
miral Henry Knox Thatcher, U.S.N., grandson of 
General Knox, having recently presented them to 
the New-England Historic Genealogical Society of 
Boston. 

It should be borne in mind, in reading Knox s let 
ters, that the greater part of them exist only in the 
origin al rough drafts, and hence occasional inaccura 
cies and ungrammatical expressions will be noticed, 
which the letters themselves would probably not 
contain. 

The author s acknowledgments are due to Mr. 
David G. Haskins, Jr., of Cambridge, to whose cour 
tesy he is indebted for the privilege of using the 
materials respecting the family and early career of 
Knox, collected by his grandfather, Hon. Charles

the well-known truth, that Revolutionary epochs 
are prolific of great men as well as of exalted ideas, 
that period of the history of our own country which marks 
its transition from a state of colonial dependence to that 
of an independent nation presents a striking example. 
Prominent in the remarkable group of which Washington 
forms the grand central figure, and second to none in the 
esteem, the confidence, and the affection of that illustrious 
man, with possibly the single exception of La Fayette, 
his adopted son ; trusted and leaned upon by him as a 
stanch and tried support in moments of anxiety, diffi 
culty, and danger; sharing with him in every conflict 
of the Revolution in which that great leader was per 
sonally engaged, such was Henry Knox, who rose by 
the simple force of his character and abilities from the 
condition of a volunteer to the highest rank in the army, 
that of major-general. Placed at once by his genius 
and merit at the head of an important branch of the 
military service, the artillery, he discovered powers 
admirably suited to its requirements, and which cannot 
perhaps be better shown than by contrasting the feebleness 
and inefficiency of that arm at Bunker s Hill with its ter 
rible efficacy in the trenches of Yorktown. 

Inferior, perhaps, as a general to Greene, between whom

and himself the closest ties of friendship existed, he was 
happier in living to witness the benefits conferred by their 
toils and sacrifices in the establishment of a constitutional 
government, a result which, as the head of the war depart 
ment, he was indefatigable in his efforts to bring about; 
while under his auspices was achieved also Wayne s 
memorable victory over the Indians, which gave peace 
and security to the West, and opened to settlement that 
immense region destined to be the centre of Western 
civilization. 

While few of our Revolutionary patriots are more 
worthy of the love and admiration of posterity, there are 
very few to whose memory so little justice has been 
accorded. None engaged in the noble cause of freedom 
with more ardor and enthusiasm ; and none with more 
entire dedication of all the powers of body and mind, both 
of which were unusually vigorous. 

The paternal ancestors of Knox were from the Low 
lands of Scotland, a place bearing that name being found 
on the southern border of the Clyde, within the barony 
of Renfrew. John Knox, the great reformer, was a native 
of the neighboring district of East Lothian, where the 
name is still numerous and respectable. During the reign 
of James I., many Scotch Presbyterians settled in the north 
of Ireland, whence numbers of them subsequently emigrated 
to America, whose descendants were conspicuous in the 
cause of liberty during the Revolutionary war. In the year 
1729 some of these emigrants landed in Boston, bringing 
with them their pastor, John Morehead, and founded in 
Bury Street a religious society, which was the origin of the 
Federal Street Church, afterward the scene of the labors of 
the eloquent Channing. It is remarkable that the first two 
names found on the baptismal records of this society, of 
which the parents of Knox were members, are those of

Knox and Campbell. The tradition in the family of Knox 
was that they came from the vicinity of Belfast, Ireland, 
and that William, his father, was a native of St. Eustatia, one 
of the West Indies. He was married at Boston, on Feb. 11, 
1735 (o.s.), by Rev. Mr. Morehead, to Mary, daughter of 
Robert Campbell ; was a ship-master, and the owner of a 
wharf and a small estate on Sea Street, near Summer,

which he was in 1756 compelled by misfortune to relin 
quish, and in 1759 went to St. Eustatia, where he died 
March 25, 1762, aged fifty years. His widow, Mary, died 
in Boston, Dec. 14, 1771, aged fifty-three. 

Henry, the seventh of ten sons, of whom only four 
attained to manhood, was born July 25, 1750. His two 
elder brothers, John and Benjamin, went to sea, and never 
returned, but were believed to be living in 1769. William, 
the youngest, born in 1756, some time consul at Dublin, 
was afterward a clerk in the employ of his brother while 
Secretary of War, and died insane about the vear 1797. 



1() LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

The house in which Knox was born is still standing, and 
is opposite the head of Drake s Wharf, on Sea Street. It 
has the gambrel roof common to houses of that period, 
and was once surrounded by a garden, which has since 
given place to dwellings. Some changes have taken place 
in it, as will be observed upon comparing its present ap 
pearance with the engraving, which is copied from an old 
drawing, and preserves its former features. At present a 
portion of the old house is covered by a modern structure : 
the doorway has been altered, and a low wooden building 
intervenes between it and the street. Here the family 
resided until 1758. 

Losing his father about the time when he had completed 
his grammar-school course, young Knox, upon whom the 
care of his widowed mother and younger brother now 
devolved, was fortunate in being employed by Messrs. 
Wharton & Bowes, booksellers, in Cornhill.* 

The excellent Mr. Nicholas Bowes supplied the place of 
a father to him, keeping a strict eye upon his morals and 
forming him in early life to habits of industry and regu 
larity. Long afterward he was enabled to repay a portion 
of his debt to his early benefactor, the widow of Mr. 
Bowes having become the recipient of his bounty. Among 
the many estimable traits of Knox s character, that from 
which in after life he derived the purest satisfaction was 
the recollection of his attentive and affectionate solicitude 
for his widowed mother. 

Possessing an inquisitive mind and an ardent thirst for 
knowledge, Knox was not slow r in availing himself of the 
advantages around him for its acquisition, and thus ob 
tained a knowledge of the French language and also of

the south corner of what is now State and Washington Streets. Wharton

military science, for which he early developed a strong 
inclination. He was also fond of studying the illustri 
ous examples of antiquity in the pages of Plutarch, and, 
as Dr. Eliot tells us, " gave early presages of future 
eminence." 

Of a robust and athletic frame, and an enterprising and 
resolute character, he was foremost in the contests between 
the North and South Ends, two rival sections of Boston, to 
the latter of which he belonged ; and it is related that 
once, during the celebration of Pope s Night, the wheel of 
the carriage which sustained the cumbrous pageant having 
given way, Knox, to prevent the disgrace sure to result 
from its non-appearance and the consequent triumph of 
the adverse party, substituted his own shoulder and bore 
the vehicle without interruption through the conflict.* 

On the evening of the affray of the 5th of March, 
1770, which took place in King Street, known as " The 
Boston Massacre," Knox endeavored to keep the crowd 
away from the soldiers, and when Captain Preston came 
upon the ground, " took him by the coat and told him for 
God s sake to take his men back again, for if they fired 
his life must answer for the consequence ; he replied he 
was sensible of it, and seemed in great haste and much 
agitated." Knox saw nothing to justify the use of fire 
arms, and with others remonstrated against the use of 
them. One result of this lamentable affair was to intensify 
the hatred of the citizens toward the " bloody backs," as 



* The 5th of November was set apart for these pageants, which are thus 
described : An effigy of the Pope and another of the Devil were borne 
through the streets by a mock procession, and finally were committed to the 
flames amid the shouts of the surrounding multitude. The rival processions 
always encountered one another, usually in or about Union Street, and 
engaged in a pitched battle, ending in the capture of one of the popes and 
the rout of his supporters, the rival effigies being finally made a bonfire of. 
The Revolution put an end to these displays. 



12 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

they styled the red coats, two regiments of whom were 
upon the demand of the people removed from the town 
to the castle. 

Having attained the age of twenty-one, Knox quitted 
his employer and began business on his own account. 
From Edes and Gill s " Gazette " of July 29, 1771, we 
take the following : " This day is opened a new Lon 
don Bookstore by HENRY KNOX, opposite Williams Court 
in Cornhill, Boston, who has just imported in the last 
ships from London a large and very elegant assortment 
of the most modern books in all branches of Literature, 
Arts, and Sciences, (catalogues of which will be pub 
lished soon,) and to be sold as cheap as can be bought 
at any place in town. Also a complete assortment of 
stationery." 

" Knox s Store," says General Henry Burbeck, a con 
temporary, " was a great resort for the British officers and 
Tory ladies, who were the ton at that period," and Harrison 
Gray Otis long afterward described it as " one of great 
display and attraction for young and old, and a fashion 
able morning lounge." Intelligent, amiable, and patriotic, 
he was a general favorite, and seemed in a fair way to 
become a prosperous merchant. The gathering storm of 
the Revolution, however, loomed dark and threatening in 
the sky ; and ere long the Boston Port Bill, which put a 
sudden stop to the prosperity of the town, involved also 
that of our young bookseller. 

One of Knox s business correspondents was James 
Rivington, the Tory bookseller and editor of New York, 
who sent him (28 July, 1774) five chests of tea, which he 
understands is very scarce in Boston, and begs him " to 
put them into such hands in the deepest confidence [this 
tea had paid no duty, hence the injunction of secrecy], 
as may be able to complete the sale of them as soon as 



JAMES RIVINGTON. LONGMAN. 13 

convenient." Knox declined the commission, and in Sep 
tember Rivington orders its delivery to a Mr. Palfrey. 

Rivington, having sent him three hundred " Other Side 
the Question" (an answer to the " Friendly Address "), 
under date of 1 Dec. 1774, writes thus : 

" * The Friendly Address I do not send to you, for fear of hurting 
your interest: it was forwarded to Messrs. Mills & Hicks to be 
printed. My reasons for not troubling you with these very warm, 
high-seasoned pamphlets is that your very numerous friends on the 
patriot interest may be greatly disgusted at your distributing them ; 
but if you are not so very nice, as I supposed, from the state of your 
interest, &c., and are willing to have these sort of articles, I will 
secure them for you from time to time. Pray explain yourself on 
this head directly, for I mean to show every expression of my 
attention to you." 

As Knox was thoroughly identified with the ardent sons 
of liberty, we can easily imagine his reply. 

His first purchase of books of Thomas Longman and 
Sons of London, dated 22 April, 1771, amounted to 340, 
and up to December, 1772, they had reached a total of 
.2,066. After this there was a great falling off from 
political causes, concerning which he writes Longman in 
November, 1774, as follows : 

"SiR, I have received yours per Captain Callahan, and the 
books in good order, also the magazines to August inclusive. I am 
sorry it is not in my power to make you remittance per this oppor 
tunity, but shall do it very soon. This whole continent have entered 
into a general non-importation agreement until the late acts of par 
liament respecting this government, &c., are repealed, which will 
prevent my sending any orders for books until this most desirable 
end is accomplished. I cannot but hope every person who is con 
cerned in American trade will most strenuously exert themselves, 
in their respective stations, for what so nearly concerns themselves. 
I had the fairest prospect of entirely balancing our account this fall ; 

3

but the almost total stagnation of trade, in consequence of the Boston 
Port Bill, has been the sole means of preventing it, and now the 
non- consumption agreement will stop that small circulation of busi 
ness left by the Boston Port Bill. I mean the internal business 
of the province. It must be the wish of every good man that 
these unhappy differences between Great Britain and the Colonies 
be speedily and finally adjusted. The influence that the unlucky 
and unhappy mood of politics of the times has upon trade is my only 
excuse for writing concerning them. The magazines and new pub 
lications concerning the American dispute are the only things which 
I desire you to send at present." 

During the occupancy of the town by the British, and 
while Knox was with the besieging army, his store, with 
many others, was robbed and pillaged ; and though long 
after the war he honorably paid Longman a portion of his 
debt, yet, owing to grave financial embarrassments, a part 
remained unsettled at his decease. Upon making this last 
payment of 11,000 guilders (about XI, 000), Knox, under 
date of 15 Dec. 1793, writes thus : 

" It is but justice to myself to say, that while I experience the 
strongest sensations of gratitude for your forbearance and liberality, 
that it is with extreme inconvenience that I pay so heavy an arrear 
for property destroyed by events which I could no more control than 
I could the great operations of nature, [nor] am I more responsible 
for them : I mean the war. In paying you, I feel inclination and 
duty blended together. Had my pecuniary situation admitted of 
the measure, you should long ago have received the amount due." 

At the age of eighteen, Knox, in obedience to a strong 
natural bent, joined a military company ; and when the 
" Boston Grenadier Corps " was formed by Captain Joseph 
Peirce, he was one of its founders and was second in 
command. The splendid uniform, military appearance, 
drill and efficiency of this corps, which made its first 
parade June 8, 1772, under Captain Peirce, gave it 
high renown, and elicited the warm encomiums even of 



BOSTON GRENADIER CORPS. 15 

the British officers. Its members, Knox included, had 
volunteered as a guard over the tea ships ; and Governor 
Gage had been struck by their martial bearing on the 
occasion of his public entry into Boston in May, 1774. 
Knox was aided in drilling and disciplining the corps by 
its orderly sergeant, Lemuel Trescott, afterward a major, 
and one of the best officers in the Continental Army ; and 
each man was from five feet ten to six feet in height. By 
conversing with the British officers who frequented his 
bookstore, by earnest study of military authors and by 
careful observation of the soldiery in Boston, he soon 
attained great proficiency in the theory and practice of 
the military art. 

While on a gunning excursion among the islands in 
Boston harbor (24 July, 1773), he lost, by the bursting of 
his fowling-piece, the two smaller fingers of his left hand, 
a defect he was accustomed to cover up by the folds of a 
handkerchief, and which, in Stuart s half-length portrait in 
Faneuil Hall, is skilfully concealed by resting the hand on 
a cannon.* 

It was about a month after this occurrence that Knox, 
who was an uncommonly good-looking officer, and pos 
sessed also a fine military bearing, attracted the attention 
of his future wife. This is related, on the authority of 
General Burbeck, as having taken place " at the next par 
ade of the corps, when Lieutenant Knox appeared with the 
wound handsomely bandaged with a scarf, which of course 

* Other portraits of Knox are that by C. W. Peale and the one by 
Edward Savage, from which the engraving accompanying this volume is 
taken. Concerning this picture. Savage writes to Knox from London, Jan. 
22, 1792: 

" Agreeable to your request, I have sent by Mr. West the half-dozen 
prints from the original portrait which you did me the honor to sit for. . . . 
I was much flattered by Mr. West, historical painter to his Majesty, as he 
knew it to be my first performance on copper, and without any assistance.

excited the sympathy of all the ladies." The good im 
pression thus made was improved by the young lady s 
visits to his bookstore, and an acquaintance soon sprung 
up, which ripened into mutual love and esteem, and 
resulted in a true and happy union.* Her father, Thomas 
Flucker, Esq., " a high-toned loyalist, of great family pre 
tensions," and Secretary of the Province of Massachusetts 
Bay, was exceedingly averse to the match, as indeed were 
all of the young lady s aristocratic connections, who were 
Tories, while Knox s sympathies were, as was well known, 
strongly enlisted in behalf of his countrymen. Indeed, 
the match is said to have wanted little of an elopement on 
this account, her friends regarding her social prospects as 
ruined by her wedding one who had embraced the rebel 
cause. 

The consequences were depicted to her in lively colors, 
and without any softening of the shades. She w^as told 
that, while her sisters were riding in their coaches, she 
would be eating the bread of poverty and dependence ; 
that there could be but one issue to the conflict ; and that 
the power of Great Britain was overwhelming. Disre 
garding all these well-meant warnings, the young lady. 
who had fully adopted the views and feelings of her future 
husband, resolved to follow the fortunes of him to whom 
her heart had been given. Here is a brief glimpse of 
their courtship : 

KNOX TO MISS FLUCKER. 

" Monday Evening, March 7, 1774. 

" What news ? Have you spoken to your father, or he to you, 
upon the subject ? What appearance has this [to us] grand affair 

* Mr. Otis, whom we have before quoted, says : " Miss Flucker was dis 
tinguished as a young lady of high intellectual endowments, very fond of 
books, and especially the books sold by Knox, to whose shelves she had 
frequent recourse."

at your house at present ? Do you go to the ball to-morrow evening ? 
I am in a state of anxiety heretofore unknown. I wish the medium 
of our correspondence settled, in order to which I must endeavor 
to see you, when we will settle it." 

Love, as usual, triumphed over all obstacles ; and in the 
" Gazette " of June 20, 1774, the marriage was thus an 
nounced : 

"Last Thursday (the 16th), was married, by the Rev. Dr. Caner, 
Mr. Henry Knox of this town, to Miss Lucy Flucker, second daughter 
to the Hon. Thomas Flucker, Esq., Secretary of the Province." 

The young couple at once commenced housekeeping, 
but their domestic enjoyments were seriously interrupted 
by the events of the 19th of April, 1775 ; and just one 
year from the day of his marriage Knox quitted Boston 
in disguise (his departure having been interdicted by 
Gage), accompanied by his wife, who had quilted into the 
lining of her cloak the sword with which her husband was 
to carve out a successful military career. Large promises 
had been held out to Knox to induce him to follow the royal 
standard, as it was thought of consequence to prevent so 
talented a young man from attaching himself to the pro 
vincials ; but his patriotism was as sincere as it was ardent, 
and he did not for a moment hesitate, but embarked heart 
and hand in the patriot cause. 

Repairing at once to the head-quarters of General Ward 
at Cambridge, he was actively engaged in reconnoitring 
service on the memorable 17th of June, and upon his 
reports the general s orders were issued. After the battle, 
his wife having been safely bestowed at Worcester, Knox, 
while declining any particular commission, lent his aid in 
planning and constructing works of defence for the various 
camps around the beleaguered town, at the same time 
acquiring skill as an artillerist, and was thus occupied for 



18 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

some months. In this employment, the comparative profi 
ciency he had acquired, by seizing every chance occasion 
for mastering that branch of military science, was of sen 
sible service to his country, then greatly in need of skilled 
engineers ; and it also proved the stepping-stone to his 
future distinction. The chief work constructed by him 
was the strong redoubt crowning the hill in Roxbury, 
known as Roxbury Fort, the site of which is now covered 
by the Cochituate Stand Pipe. A few extracts from his 
letters to his wife and to his brother during the siege are 
here given, from the first of which it appears that his 
skill and activity had attracted the notice of Washington 
only three days after he had taken the command of the 

army : 

" ROXBURY (Lemuel Childs s), 
" Thursday Morning, 6 o clock (July 6, 1775). 

" Yesterday, as I was going to Cambridge, I met the generals 
[Washington and Lee], who begged me to return to Roxbury again, 
which I did. When they had viewed the works, they expressed the 
greatest pleasure and surprise at their situation and apparent utility, 
to say nothing of the plan, which did not escape their praise." 

" WATERTOWN, July 9. 

" General Washington fills his place with vast ease and dignity, 
and dispenses happiness around him. General Lee will become 
very popular soon. I am obliged to go to Cambridge to wait on 
General Washington, and promised to be there by seven o clock. I 
am now half past that time." 

"Monday, July 11. 

" I go to Roxbury and Cambridge in the morning, and return 
here every evening for the sake of Mr. Jackson s company. We 
are here in a very decent private house, Mr. Cook s, near the 
bridge. . . . You heard, I suppose, by our neighbor Curtis that our 
people burnt Brown s houses on Boston Neck, except the store ? It 
was a brave action, and well performed. The regulars were in 
such trepidation in Boston and on the lines that I perfectly believe 
750 men would at that time [have] taken the full possession of the 



SIEGE OF BOSTON. 19 

town. The new generals are of infinite service in the army. They 
have to reduce order almost from a perfect chaos. I think they are 
in a fair way of doing it. Our army still affect to hold the army 
besieged, * and will effectually continue to do so." 

" August 9, 1775 
" (General Thomas s Head-quarters, Roxbury). 

" I was yesterday at Cambridge. Generals Washington and Lee 
inquired after you. I dined at General W. s. While I was there, 
the navy prisoners whom I wrote to you about yesterday came there 
on- horses. There were seven; viz. .one lieu ten an t,f one doctor, one 
master, and four midshipmen, all handsome, genteel-looking men. 
The officers were disposed of genteelly for the present, and are soon 
to be sent into the country." 

To his brother William, 25 Sept. 1775 : 

" Last Friday Lucy [Mrs. Knox] dined at General Washington s. 
Last Saturday, let it be remembered to the honor and skill of the 
British troops, that they fired 104 cannon-shot at [our] works, at 
not a greater distance than half point blank shot, and did what ? 
W T hy, scratched a man s face with the splinters of a rail-fence ! I 
have had the pleasure of dodging these heretofore engines of terror 
with great success; nor am I afraid they will [hit me?], unless 
directed by the hand of Providence." 

On page eighty-six of John Adams s autobiography, he 
says : " Colonel Knox had been a youth who had attracted 
my notice by his pleasing manners and inquisitive turn of 
mind, when I was a man in business in Boston ; " and on 
the same day (Oct. 1, 1776) he writes to Knox, request 
ing his sentiments upon a plan for the establishment of a 
military academy in the army. The following letter, writ-

commander, Gage.

ten while in attendance upon Congress, still further evinces 
Mr. Adams s appreciation of him : 

JOHN ADAMS TO KNOX. 

"PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 11, 1775. 

" I had the pleasure of a letter from you a few days ago, and was 
rejoiced to learn that you have at last determined to take a more 
important share than you have done hitherto in the conduct of our 
military matters. I have been impressed with an opinion of your 
knowledge and abilities in the military way for several years, and of 
late have endeavored, both at camp, at Watertown, and at Phila 
delphia, by mentioning your name and character, to make you more 
known, and consequently in a better way for promotion. 

" It was a sincere opinion of your merit and qualifications which 
prompted me to act this part, and therefore I am very happy to be 
able to inform you that I believe you will very soon be provided for 
according to your wishes ; at least you may depend upon this, that 
nothing in my power shall be wanting to effect it. It is of vast 
importance, my dear sir, that I should be minutely informed of every 
thing which passes at the camp while I hold a place in the great 
Council of America ; and therefore I must beg the favor of you to 
write me as often as you can by safe conveyances. I want to know 
the name, rank, and character of every officer in the army, I 
mean every honest and able one ; but more especially of every 
officer who is best acquainted with the theory and practice of forti 
fication and gunnery. What is comprehended within the term 
Engineer ? and whether it includes skill both in fortifications and 
gunnery ; and what skilful engineers you have in the army ; and 
whether any of them, and who, have seen service, and when and 
where. 

" I want to know if there is a complete set of books upon the 
military art in all its branches in the library of Harvard College, 
and what books are the best upon those subjects." 

On Nov. 2, Washington writes to Governor Trumbull 
respecting the want of competent engineers, and says : 
" Most of the works which have been thrown up for the 
defence of our several encampments have been planned 



APPOINTED COLONEL OF ARTILLERY. 21 

by a few of the principal officers of the army, assisted by 
Mr. Knox, a gentleman of Worcester." 

And to the President of Congress on the 8th of the 
same month : 

"The council of officers are unanimously of opinion that the com 
mand of the artillery should no longer continue in Colonel Gridley ; 
and knowing of no person better qualified to supply his place, or 
whose appointment will give more general satisfaction, I have taken 
the liberty of recommending Henry Knox to the consideration of 
Congress." 

Gridley, a veteran of the French war, was incapacitated 
by age and infirmity for active service ; and the next in 
rank, David Mason, offered to serve as lieutenant-colonel 
of the artillery regiment if Knox might be appointed 
colonel. There were a number of young officers of merit 
in that branch,* but they joined unanimously in making 
this request ; and he was accordingly commissioned by 
Congress colonel of the artillery regiment on Nov. 17, 
1775. His commission did not reach him, however, until

* Many of these officers, among whom were John Crane, Ebenezer Stevens, 
Winthrop Sargent, and others, who became distinguished, were trained in 
Paddock s artillery company, formed in 1763 by David Mason. Paddock, 
who succeeded him in the command in 1768, brought it to a high state of 
efficiency ; but being a Tory left Boston with the British troops, and died in 
the Isle of Jersey, 25 March, 1804, aged seventy-six. 

t It seems not a little singular that one who had never been even a private 
of artillery, nor had the advantages of a military school, should have been 
selected for the eminently practical role of chief of artillery of the army. His 
fitness for the position was, however, conceded at once and without question, 
and was afterward abundantly manifested. 

A return of the artillery regiment, consisting of twelve companies, dated 
3 March, 1776, gives 635 men. The field-officers were Henry Knox, 
colonel ; William Burbeck, first lieutenant-colonel ; David Mason, second 
lieutenant-colonel; John Crane, first major; John Lamb, second major.

enemy from Boston, was felt to be one of serious concern ; 
and to the enterprising and fertile mind of Knox belongs 
the credit of having conceived and successfully executed 
a project by which the besieging army was supplied with 
the means for effecting that important object. This plan, 
which was approved by Washington, was to procure from 
Fort Ticonderoga the needed cannon and stores, and to 
transport them on boats and sleds to the camp at Cam 
bridge. 

Armed with the necessary instructions from the com- 
mander-in-chief, and accompanied by his younger brother, 
William, then nineteen years of age, and who was of great 
service to him in this enterprise, Knox left the camp at 
Cambridge on Nov. 15, and, after a brief visit to his wife 
at Worcester, reached New York on the 25th. After 
transacting his business there, he started northward on the 
28th, "glad," as he writes in his diary, "to leave New 
York, it being very expensive." He reached Albany Dec. 
1, and Ticonderoga on the 5th. From this place he began 
his laborious and difficult journey homeward on the 9th, 
having put on board some small craft, such ordnance and 
stores as were essential and could be safely transported. 
He was assisted in his arduous labors by General Schuyler, 
and after undergoing much hardship and suffering, and 
encountering numerous obstacles as well as the annoy 
ances and vexations incident to so hazardous an enter 
prise in the midst of a severe winter, he finally had the 
satisfaction of reaching camp on Jan. 24, 1776, and of 
receiving the congratulations of the commander- in-chief 
upon the important service he had thus rendered the army 
and the country. While crossing the Hudson on the ice, 
one of the cannon fell into the river near the landing. It 
was recovered on the following day, with the assistance of 
the people of Albany, in return for which service Knox 
christened her " The Albany." 



ENCOUNTERS ANDRE. 23 

This achievement stamped the character of Knox for 
boldness, enterprise, fertility of resource and genius, sup 
plied the means for fortifying Dorchester Heights, and vin 
dicated the judgment of Washington in selecting him for 
the important and responsible duties of the artillery and 
ordnance departments.* 

A memorable incident of this journey was his encounter 
with the gallant but unfortunate Andre. The latter, who 
had been taken prisoner by Montgomery at St. John s, 
was on his way to Lancaster, Pa., to remain there until 
exchanged, while Knox was pursuing his way northward. 
Chance made them one stormy winter night inmates of the 
same cabin on the border of Lake George, and even of the 
same bed. Though of opposite political attachments, they 
had much in common. Their ages were alike ; each had 
given up the pursuits of trade for the military profession, 
of which each had made a study ; and their tastes and aims 
were similar. They parted on the morrow with strong 
mutual sentiments of regard and good-will, and their inter 
view left an indelible impression on the mind of Knox. 
The respective condition of the two was not mutually 
made known until just as they were about to part ; and 
when Knox, a few years later, was called on to perform 
the painful office of a judge upon that tribunal which con 
demned Andre to death, the memory of their meeting gave 
additional bitterness to that unpleasant duty. 

To Washington he wrote on Nov. 27, from New York, 
earnestly recommending that cannon for the army be cast 
there, "where it can be expeditiously and cheaply done." 



* "For expenditures in a journey from the camp round Boston to New. 
York, Albany, and Ticonderoga, and from thence, with 55 pieces of iron and 
brass ordnance, 1 barrel of flints, and 23 boxes of lead, back to camp (includ 
ing expenses of self, brother, and servant), .520.15.8f." Knox s Account- 
book. (For schedule of cannon, &c., see Appendix.) 



24 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

And on Dec. 17, from Fort George : 

"I returned to this place on the loth, and brought with me the 
cannon, it being nearly the time I computed it would take us to 
transport them here. It is not easy to conceive the difficulties we 
have had in getting them over the lake, owing to the advanced 
season of the year and contrary winds ; but the danger is now past. 
Three days ago it was very uncertain whether we should have 
gotten them until next spring; but now, please God, tliey must go. 
I have had made 42 exceeding strong sleds, and have provided 
80 yoke of oxen to drag them as far as Springfield, where I shall 
get fresh cattle to carry them to camp. The route will be from here 
to Kinderhook, from thence to Great Harrington, and down to 
Springfield. I have sent for the sleds and teams to come here, and 
expect to begin to move them to Saratoga on Wednesday or Thurs 
day next, trusting that between this and then we shall have a fine 
fall of snow, which will enable us to proceed further, and make the 
carriage easy. If that shall be the case, I hope in sixteen or seven 
teen days time to be able to present to your Excellency a noble 
train of artillery." 

From Albany, 5th Jan. 1776 : 

" I was in hopes that we should have been able to have had the 
cannon at Cambridge by this time. The want of snow detained us 
some days, and now a cruel thaw hinders from crossing Hudson 
River, which we are obliged to do four times from Lake George to 
this town. The first severe night will make the ice on the river 
sufficiently strong ; till that happens the cannon and mortars must 
remain where they are. These inevitable delays pain me exceed 
ingly, as my mind is fully sensible of the importance of the greatest 
expedition in this case. . . . General Schuyler has been exceedingly 
assiduous in this matter. As to myself, my utmost endeavors have 
been, and still shall be, used to forward them with the utmost des 
patch." 

And on the same day he writes to his wife : 

"... A little about my travels. New York is a place where I 
think in general the houses are better built than in Boston. They 
are generally of brick, and three stories high, with the largest kind 



APPEARANCE OF NEW YORK. ALBANY. 25 

of windows. Their churches are grand ; their college, workhouse, 
and hospitals most excellently situated, and also exceedingly com 
modious ; their principal streets much wider than ours. The 
people, why, the people are magnificent: in their equipages, 
which are numerous ; in their house furniture, which is fine ; in 
their pride and conceit, which are inimitable ; in their profaneness, 
which is intolerable ; in the want of principle, which is prevalent ; 
in their Toryism, which is uusufFerable, and for which they must 
repent in dust and ashes. The country from New York to this city 
[Albany] is not very populous, not the fifth part so much so as in 
New England, and with much greater marks of poverty than there. 
The people of this city, of which there are about 5,000 or 6,000, 

are, I believe, honest enough, and many of them sensible people, 

much more so than any other part of the government which I ve 
seen. There are four very good buildings for public worship, with 
a State House, the remains of capital barracks, hospital, and fort, 
which must in their day have been very clever. (It is situated on 
the side of a hill.) 

" Albany, from its situation, and commanding the trade of the 
water and the immense territories westward, must one day be, if not 
the capital, yet nearly to it, of America. There are a number of 
gentlemen s very elegant seats in view from that part of the river 
before the town, among them I think General Schuyler s claims the 
preference ; the owner of which is sensible and polite, and I think 
has behaved with vast propriety to the British officers who, by the 
course of war, have fallen into our hands. Certain of them set out 
from this for Pennsylvania yesterday, among whom was General 
Prescott, who has by all accounts behaved exceedingly ill to Colonel 
Allen of ours, who was taken at Montreal. Here is also Major 
Gamble, who wrote the letters from Quebec which were published 
last summer. There are in all about sixty commissioned officers, 
besides about twenty of the Canadian noblesse, who appeared as 
lively and happy as if nothing [had] happened. One or two of the 
officers I pitied, the others seemed concerned, but not humbled. The 
women and children suffer amazingly at this advanced season of 
the year. It is now past twelve o clock, therefore I wish you a 
good night s repose, and will mention you in my prayers." 

On the night of the 4th of March, 1776, under cover of 
a furious cannonade from Knox s batteries at Cobble Hill, 



26 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

Lechmere s Point, and Roxbury, General Thomas took 
possession of Dorchester Heights commanding the town 
and harbor of Boston, which he so strongly fortified that 
Howe, the British commander, though he made prepara 
tions to attack him on the following day, dared not do so, 
and was consequently obliged to evacuate Boston on the 
17th.* 

Reinforcements were immediately sent to the northern 
army ; and the remainder of Washington s force was, early 
in April, moved to New York, which was soon to become 
the theatre of active operations. 

Knox s engineering talents were now called into re 
quisition in Connecticut and Rhode Island ; and previous 
to his arrival in New York, on the 30th of April, he wrote 
to Washington and to Mrs. Knox several letters, from 
which we extract as follows : 

TO WASHINGTON. 

"NORWICH, 21 April, 1776. 

" In passing through Providence, Governor Cooke and a number 
of the principal people were very pressing for me to take Newport 
in my way, in order to mark out some works of defence for that 
place. The spirited conduct of the colony troops posted there, in 
driving away the king s ships, alarmed the whole colony for the 
safety of its capital. Knowing your Excellency s anxiety for the 
preservation of every part of the continent, I conceived it to be my 
duty to act in conformity to your wishes, especially as I could get 
to Norwich as soon as the stores which set out on the 14th. Accord 
ingly I went to Newport, and marked out five batteries, which, from 
the advantageous situation of the ground, must, when executed, 
render the harbor exceedingly secure. 

" Lieutenant-Colonel Burbeck declined complying with your Ex 
cellency s orders, alleging that the province had settled on him four 
shillings sterling per day during life, after the war was over, which, if 

* The Fluckers accompanied the royal troops to Halifax, and sailed 
thence to England, where the father and mother of Mrs. Knox both died : 
the former, in March, 1783 ; the latter, in December, 1785.

he went out of the province, he might perhaps lose.* Lieutenant- 
Colonel Mason, who came with the ordnance to this town, being in 
ill health, I have permitted to go by land." 

TO WASHINGTON. 

" NEW LONDON, April 24, 1776. 

" SIR, In consequence of your Excellency s directions, I am 
employed in looking at and getting the necessary information re 
specting the harbor, in which I shall spare no pains. I mentioned 
to your Excellency Newport harbor, which, in conjunction with 
this, will, when fortified, afford a safe retreat to the American navy 
or their prizes in any wind that blows. They are equally con 
venient for ships coming from sea ; and if the wind is not fair to go 
into one harbor, they may go into the other. The artillery and 
stores are all embarked, together with the remaining company of 
my regiment, and have been waiting for a fair wind two days. 

" Admiral Hopkins is still in this harbor, and I believe will be 
obliged to continue here some time. He has this day received in 
telligence that four ships and two brigs are off Montauk Point and 
Rhode Island, stationed in such a manner that but one appears at a 
time, and each able to come up to the assistance of the others. The 
captain of the * Cerberus was on Block Island yesterday, and told a 
man there that he was waiting for Admiral Hopkins, and expected 
in four days to be joined by Captain Wallace and his squadron." 

In a letter to his wife he thus describes Admiral 
Hopkins : 

" I have been on board Admiral Hopkins s [ship], and in company 
with his gallant son who was wounded in the engagement with the 
Glasgow. The admiral is an antiquated figure. He brought to 
my mind Van Tromp, the famous Dutch admiral. Though anti 
quated in figure, he is shrewd and sensible. I, whom you think 
not a little enthusiastic, should have taken him for an angel, only he 
swore now and then." 



* This officer remained in Massachusetts and never rejoined the regiment. 
He was many years commander at Castle William, and died in Boston, 22 July, 
1785, aged sixty-nine. 



28 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

To protect New York city, Washington was compelled 
to hold Kingsbridge, Governor s Island, Paulus Hook, and 
the Heights of Brooklyn. For all these posts, separated by 
water, some of them fifteen miles apart, he had, early in 
August, but about 10,000 men fit for duty, beside Knox s 
regiment of artillery. Most of the cannon in the field- 
works were of iron, old and honey-combed, broken and 
defective.* 

On July llth Knox writes to his brother : 

" DEAR BILLY, I received your affectionate letter by the post, 
for which I thank you. In consequence of a false report, my Lucy 
and her babe are at Stamford or Fail-field, where she writes me she 
is very unhappy, and wants to return here again, which would make 
me as unhappy in contemplating the idea which you had of her 
flight as if it was real. Indeed, the circumstances of our parting 
were extremely disagreeable. She had, contrary to my opinion, 
stayed too long. From the hall window, where we usually break 
fasted, we saw the ships coming through the Narrows, with a fair wind 
and rapid tide, which would have brought them up to the city in 
about half an hour. You can scarcely conceive the distress and 
anxiety that she then had. The city in an uproar, the alarm guns 
tiring, the troops repairing to their posts, and every thing in the 
[height] of bustle ; I not at liberty to attend her, as my country 
calls loudest. My God, may I never experience the like feelings 
again ! They were too much ; but I found a way to disguise them, 
for I scolded like a fury at her for not having gone before." 

To Mrs. Knox, at Norwalk or Fan-field, 13th July : 

" I thank heaven you were not here yesterday. Two ships and 
three tenders of the enemy about twenty minutes past three weighed 
anchor, and in twenty-five minutes were before the town. We had a 

* On June 10, Knox reported to Washington that there were mounted, 
and fit for action in the city and neighboring posts, 121 heavy and light can 
non, requiring for their service 1,210 men. His regiment, present and fit for 
duty, numbered (including 50 officers) 520. He therefore recommends that 
it be immediately raised to the required number by draught from the other 
battalions. 



BATTLE OF LONG ISLAND. 29 

loud cannonade, but could not stop them, though I believe we damaged 
them much. They kept over on the Jersey side too far from our 
batteries. I was so unfortunate as to lose six men by accidents, and 
a number wounded. This affair will be of service to my people : it 
will teach them to moderate their fiery courage." 

August llth, he again writes her : 

" You wish to know how I pass my time. I generally rise with 
or a little before the sun, and immediately with a part of the reg 
iment attend prayers, sing a psalm, and read a chapter in [the Bible at] 
the Grand Battery. General Putnam constantly attends. I despatch 
a considerable deal of business before breakfast. From breakfast 
to dinner I am broiling in a sun hot enough to roast an egg. Some 
times I dine with the generals, Washington, Putnam, Stirling, &c. ; 
but I am mortified that I haven t had them to dine with me in 
return. However, that cannot be. I go to bed at nine o clock or 
before, every night." 

Knox s quarters were at the battery near those of Wash 
ington, with whom he crossed over to Long Island daily, 
in the discharge of his duty. He thus writes to his wife 
of the disaster of Aug. 27th: 



"& 



"About two o clock in the morning (yesterday) the enemy 
attacked the woods in front of our works on Long Island, where our 
riflemen lay. They attacked with a chosen part of the Hessians, 
and all the light infantry and grenadiers of the army, and after 
about six or seven hours smart skirmishing our people fell back in 
front of our works. The enemy lost nearly one thousand killed. 
We lost about the same number killed, wounded, and taken pris 
oners, among whom are General Sullivan and Lord Stirling. Gen 
eral Parsons was missing until this morning, when he returned. I 
met with some loss in my regiment : they behaved like heroes, and 
are gone to glory. I was not on the island myself, being obliged 
to wait on my Lord Howe and the navy gentry who threatened to 
pay us a visit." 

5 



30 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

To the same Sept. 5th : 

" We want great men, who when fortune frowns will not be dis 
couraged. God will I trust in time give us these men. The Con 
gress will ruin every thing by their stupid parsimony, and they begin 
to see it. It is, as I always said, misfortunes that must raise us to 
the character of a great people. One or two drubbings will* be of 
service to us ; and one severe defeat to the enemy, ruin. We must 
have a standing army. The militia get sick, or think themselves so, 
and run home ; and wherever they go, they spread a panic." 

On the 15th of September the army of General Howe 
effected a landing at Kip s Bay, about three miles above 
the city, the evacuation of which, already in progress, was 
hurriedly completed by the Americans. Knox, who had 
for some days been engaged in removing the ordnance 
and stores, left the city about twelve o clock to join 
General Washington. Encountering Silliman s brigade, 
retreating in great confusion in the vicinity of Corlaer s 
Hook, he lost time in attempting to rally the fugitives, 
with whom he then threw himself into Fort Bunker Hill, 
an unfinished work near the site of the present Centre 
Market, where he " thought only of a gallant defence." 
Colonel Aaron Burr, who was one of Putnam s aids, riding 
up, assured the troops that a retreat was practicable, and 
led them in safety to the Bloomingdale road, near what 
is now 60th Street. Knox, who was almost the last to 
leave the city, escaped capture only by seizing a boat and 
making his way by water. His arrival at Harlem, where 
great anxiety was felt for his safety, was greeted with a 
shout of welcome, and by an embrace from Washington. 

To his brother he writes on the 19th: " My constant 
fatigue and application to the business of my extensive 
department has been such that I have not had my 



HOWE S BAD GENERALSHIP. 31 

clothes off once o nights for more than forty days." 
And again : 

" HEIGHTS or HARLEM, 8 miles from New York, 
Sept. 23d. 

" You, with our other friends at Boston, are anxious for our sit 
uation and wish to know it exactly. It is my lot, and it has been 
so invariably since I have been in the arrny, to be in an exceeding 
busy department. This I mention not by way of dislike, but as 
an excuse for any seeming negligence or remissness in writing to 
you. . . . The general leading features or outlines of what has already 
happened have, almost ever since I have been this way, been fully 
impressed on my mind. Islands separated from the main by nav 
igable waters are not to be defended by a people without a navy 
against a nation who can send a powerful fleet to interrupt the com 
munication. We had one chance to defend New York. I don t 
know whether to call it a whole chance. I think I cannot with 
propriety : it was only part of a chance, which was by being com 
pletely victorious on Long Island. Even had this event taken place, 
they could have burnt the town by their shipping : this is indis 
putable, in my opinion. They in their first attack on Long Island, 
lost us by our own fault in not guarding the passes, made such 
lodgement near our works, that they were not obliged to leave more 
than five thousand men to guard them. This would have left fifteen 
thousand men at least to have made a push up the North River, 
and landed in our rear and fortified. Had they taken this measure, 
which in good policy they ought to have done, they might at one 
stroke have reduced the whole army to the necessity of becoming 
prisoners without being able to fight in the least. But in this and 
several other capital matters they have not acted the great war 
riors : indeed I see nothing of the vast about them either in their 
designs or execution. But, good God, if they are little, thou 
knowest full well we are much less, and that nothing less than the 
infatuation of the enemy and the almost immediate interposition 
of thy providence has saved this rabble army. 

" The general is as worthy a man as breathes, but he cannot do 
every thing nor be everywhere. He wants good assistants. There 
is a radical evil in our army, the lack of officers. We ought to 
have men of merit in the most extensive and unlimited sense of 
the word. Instead of which, the bulk of the officers of the army 



32 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

are a parcel of ignorant, stupid men, who might make tolerable 
soldiers, but fare] bad officers; and until. Congress forms an estab 
lishment to induce men proper for the purpose to leave their usual 
employments and enter the service, it is ten to one they will be 
beat till they are heartily tired of it. We ought to have academies, 
in which the whole theory of the art of war shall be taught, and 
every other encouragement possible given to draw persons into the 
army that may give a lustre to our arms. As the army now stands, 
it is only a receptacle for ragmuffins. You will observe I am 
chagrined, not more so than at any other time since I ve been in 
the army; but many late affairs, of which I ve been an eye-witness, 
have so totally sickened me, that unless some very different mode 
of conduct is observed in the formation of the new army, I shall 
not think myself obliged by either the laws of God or nature to 
risk my reputation on so cobweb a foundation. 

" The affair of last Monday (battle of Harlem Plains) has had 
some good consequences towards raising the people s spirits. They 
find that if they stick to these mighty men they will run as fast as 
other people. We pursued them nearly two miles. About fifteen 
hundred of our troops engaged ; of the enemy, about the same num 
ber. The grounds on which we now rest are strong, I think we 
shall defend them : if we don t, I hope God will punish us both in 
this world and the world to come, if the fault is ours. Pay Mrs. 
Crane, wife to Major Crane, fifty dollars, and inform her that the 
Major is in a fair way to do well. He is in high esteem in the 
army, and the loss of his services much regretted by me.* The 



* Crane had, a few days before, been wounded in the foot by a shot from 
Captain Wallace s frigate, whicli he was cannonading. John Crane was born 
at Braintree, Mass., 7 December, 1744, and died at Whiting, Me., 21 August, 
1805. He was a housewright ; was one of the " Tea Party," and lived 
in a house still standing in Tremont Street, Boston, opposite Hollis Street. 
He removed to Providence in 1774, and there raised a company of artillery, 
with which he joined Gridley s regiment in the summer of 1775, with the 
rank of major. He received the same commission in Knox s regiment, Jan. 
1, 1776, and raised in the following year and commanded throughout the 
war a regiment of continental artillery. Colonel Crane was one of the mem 
bers of Paddock s artillery company before the war, and distinguished him 
self upon several occasions during the contest, being honorably mentioned by 
General Sullivan during the Rhode Island expedition. After the war he 
carried on the lumber business in Washington County, Me. 



FORT WASHINGTON. GREENE S LETTER. 33 

scoundrel Hessians took my baggage-cart, with the great part of 
my necessary matters, which I find very difficult to replace at 
present." 

He writes him also an account of the action of Oct. 
28th : - 

" Near WHITE PLAINS, 32 miles from New York, 
1 Nov. 1776. 

" Last Monday, the enemy with nearly their whole force ad 
vanced upon the hills above us ; and soon after ten o clock in the 
morning, with a large part of their army, began a most furious 
attack on a hill (Chatterton s) on our right, where we had about 
one thousand posted under General McDougall, which they carried 
with considerable loss. Our loss was not very great. Our men 
had no works, and were not timely reinforced, owing to the distance 
they were from the main body. The enemy s having possession of 
this hill obliged us to abandon some slight lines thrown up on 
White Plains. This we did this morning, and retired to some hills 
about half a mile in the rear. The enemy are determined on 
something decisive, and we are determined to risk a general battle 
only on the most advantageous terms. We are manoeuvring, in 
which I think they are somewhat our superiors." 

The loss of Fort Washington, which took place on Nov. 
16th, was a serious blow to the Americans. General 
Greene s mortification at the event, as well as his reasons 
for endeavoring to hold that post, are given for the first 
time in this highly interesting letter to his friend Knox : 

"FORT LEE, Nov. [17], 1776. 

"Your favor of the 14th reached me in a melancholy temper. 
The misfortune of losing Fort Washington, with between two and 
three thousand men, will reach you before this, if it has not already. 
His Excellency General Washington has been with me for several 
days. The evacuation or reinforcement of Fort Washington was 
under consideration, but finally nothing concluded on. Day before 
yesterday, about one o clock, Howe s adjutant-general made a 
demand of the surrender of the garrison in the general s name , but 
was answered by the commanding officer that he should defend it 



34 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

to the last extremity. Yesterday morning, General Washington, 
General Putnam, General Mercer, and myself went to the island to 
determine what was best to be done; but just at the instant we 
stepped on board the boat the enemy made their appearance on the 
hill where the Monday action was, and began a severe cannonade 
with several field-pieces. Our guards soon fled, the enemy advanced 
up to the second line. This was done while we were crossing the 
river arid getting upon the hill. The enemy made several marches 
to the right and to the left, I suppose to reconnoitre the fortifica 
tions and lines. 

There we all stood in a very awkward situation. As the disposi 
tion was made, and the enemy advancing, we durst not attempt to 
make any new disposition ; indeed, we saw nothing amiss. We all 
urged his Excellency to come off. I offered to stay, General Putnam 
did the same, and so did General Mercer; but his Excellency thought 
it best for us all to come off together, which we did, about half an 
hour before the enemy surrounded the fort. The enemy came up 
Harlem River, and landed a party at head-quarters, which was 
upon the back of our people in the lines. A disorderly retreat soon 
took place ; without much firing the people retreated into the fort. 
On the north side of the fort there was a very heavy fire for a long 
while ; and as they had the advantage of the ground, I apprehend 
the enemy s loss must be great. After the troops retreated in the 
fort, very few guns were fired. The enemy approached within 
small-arm fire of the lines, and sent in a flag, and the garrison capit 
ulated in an hour. I was afraid of the fort : the redoubt you and I 
advised, too, was not done, or little or nothing done to it. Had that 
been complete, I think the garrison might have defended themselves 
a long while, or been brought off. I feel mad, vexed, sick, and 
sorry. Never did I need the consoling voice of a friend more than 
now. Happy should I be to see you. This is a most terrible 
event: its consequences are justly to be dreaded. Pray, what is 
said upon the occasion ? A line from you will be very acceptable. 
I am, dear sir, your obedient servant, N. GRKENE.

[Mem. on the back.] I have not time to give you a description of 
the battle.

CONFIDENCE OF KNOX. 35 

In this unfortunate affair, the artillery regiment lost 
about one hundred men, including Captain Pierce. Then 
followed the evacuation of Fort Lee and the memorable 
retreat of Washington s little army through the Jerseys, 
" protracted for eighteen or nineteen days in an inclement 
season, often in sight and within cannon-shot of his 
enemies, his rear pulling down bridges and their van build 
ing them up," delaying them till midwinter and impas 
sable roads should close the campaign. On Dec. 13th, 
Howe, believing that the American force would melt away 
at the near expiration of their engagements, returned to his 
winter quarters in New York, leaving Colonel Donop with 
his Hessians and the 42d Highlanders to hold the line from 
Trenton to Burlington. 

At this critical moment, when even the calm soul of 
Washington trembled for his country s freedom, Knox was 
one of those who strengthened his hand and encouraged 
his heart ; and his letters written in the darkest periods of 
the war show that he never yielded to despondency, but 
confidently anticipated its triumphant issue. 

Washington now resolved to strike a blow that should 
cripple his enemy and revive the sinking spirit of his 
countrymen. He crossed the Delaware, Knox superin 
tending its passage, and by his stentorian voice making 
audible the orders of his chief above the fury of the 
blast, and surprising the post at Trenton captured the entire 
garrison. After this victory, Knox and Greene were in 
favor of following it up by marching upon New Bruns 
wick. Washington was inclined to adopt this course, but 
the generality of the other officers opposed it, an opposi 
tion they afterward regretted. His account of this and 
the subsequent brilliant affair at Princeton is given in the 
following letters to Mrs. Knox : 



36 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

" DELAWARE RIVER, near TRENTON, 

Dec. 28, 1776, near 12 o clock. 

"MY DEARLY BELOVED FRIEND, You will before this have 
heard of our success on the morning of the 26th instant. The 
enemy, by their superior marching, had obliged us to retire on the 
Pennsylvania side of the Delaware, by which means we were obliged 
to evacuate or give up nearly all the Jerseys. Soon after our retiring 
over the river, the preservation of Philadelphia was a matter exceed 
ingly precarious, the force of the enemy three or four times as 
large as ours. However, they seemed content with their success 
for the present, and quartered their troops in different and distant 
places in the Jerseys. Of these cantonments Trenton was the most 
considerable. 

" Trenton is an open town, situated nearly on the banks of the 
Delaware, accessible on all sides. Our army was scattered along the 
river for nearly twenty-five miles. Our intelligence agreed that the 
force of the enemy in Trenton was from two to three thousand, with 
about six field cannon, and that they were pretty secure in their 
situation, and that they were Hessians, no British troops. A 
hardy design was formed of attacking the town by storm. Accord 
ingly a part of the army, consisting of about 2,500 or 3,000, passed 
the river on Christmas night, with almost infinite difficulty, with 
eighteen field-pieces. The floating ice in the river made the labor 
almost incredible. However, perseverance accomplished what at 
first seemed impossible. About two o clock the troops were all on the 
Jersey side ; we then were about nine miles from the object. The 
night was cold and stormy ; it hailed with great violence ; the troops 
marched with the most profound silence and good order. 

" They arrived by two routes at the same time, about half an hour 
after daylight, within one mile of the town. The storm continued 
with great violence, but was in our backs, and consequently in the 
faces of our enemy. About half a mile from the town was an 
advanced guard on each road, consisting of a captain s guard. These 
we forced, and entered the town with them pell-mell ; and here 
succeeded a scene of war of which I had often conceived, but never 
saw before. The hurry, fright, and confusion of the enemy was 
[not] unlike that which will be when the last trump shall sound. 
They endeavored to form in streets, the heads of which we had 
previously the possession of with cannon and howitzers ; these, in 



SURPRISE OF THE HESSIANS. 37 

the twinkling of an eye, cleared the streets. The backs of the 
houses were resorted to for shelter. These proved ineffectual : the 
musketry soon dislodged them. Finally they were driven through 
the town into an open plain beyond. Here they formed in an 
instant. During the contest in the streets measures were taken for 
putting an entire stop to their retreat by posting troops and cannon 
in such passes and roads as it was possible for them to get away by. 
The poor fellows after they were formed on the plain saw them 
selves completely surrounded, the only resource left was to force 
their way through numbers unknown to them. The Hessians lost 
part of their cannon in the town : they did not relish the project of 
forcing, and were obliged to surrender upon the spot, with all their 
artillery, six brass pieces, army colors, &c. A Colonel Rawle com 
manded, who was wounded. The number of prisoners was above 1,200, 
including officers, all Hessians. There were few killed or wounded 
on either side. After having marched off the prisoners and secured the 
cannon, stores, &c., we returned to the place, nine miles distant, where 
we had embarked. Providence seemed to have smiled upon every 
part of this enterprise. Great advantages may be gained from it if 
we take the proper steps. At another post we have pushed over 
the river 2,000 men, to-day another body, and to-morrow the whole 
army will follow. It must give a sensible pleasure to every friend 
of the rights of man to think with how much intrepidity our people 
pushed the enemy, and pi-evented their forming in the town. 

" His Excellency the General has done me the unmerited great 
honor of thanking me in public orders in terms strong and polite. 
This I should blush to mention to any other than to you, my dear 
Lucy ; and I am fearful that even my Lucy may think her Harry 
possesses a species of little vanity in doing [it] at all." 

" TRENTON, 2d Jan. 1777. 

" We are collecting our force at this place, and shall give battle 
to the enemy very soon. Our people have exerted great fortitude, 
and stayed beyond the time of their enlistment, in high spirits, but 
want rum and clothing. Will it give you satisfaction or pleasure 
in being informed that the Congress have created me a general 
officer a brigadier with the entire command of the artillery?* 

* His commission was dated Dec. 27, 1776, the day following the victory 
of Trenton, but before the news had reached Congress. That body had 
previously resolved to augment the artillery to a brigade of four regiments.

38 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

If so, I shall be happy. It was unsolicited on my part, though I can 
not say unexpected. People are more lavish in their praises of my 
poor endeavors than they deserve. All the merit I can claim is 
industry. I wish to render my devoted country every service in my 
power ; and the only alloy I have in my little exertions is, that it 
separates me from thee, the dearest object of all my earthly hap 
piness. May Heaven give us a speedy and happy meeting. 

" The attack of Trenton was a most horrid scene to the poor 
inhabitants. War, my Lucy, is not a humane trade, and the man 
who follows [it] as such will meet with his proper demerits in 
another world." 

" MORRISTOWN, Jan. 7, 1777. 

" MY DEAREST LOVE, I wrote to you from Trenton by a Mr. 
Fu mess, which I hope }ou have received. I then informed you 
that we soon expected another tussle. I was not out in my conject 
ure. About three o clock on the 2d of January, a column of the 
enemy attacked a party of ours which was stationed about one 
mile above Trenton. Our party was small, and did not make much 
resistance. The enemy, who were Hessians, entered the town pell- 
mell, pretty much in the same manner that we had driven them a 
few days before. 

" Nearly on the other side of Trenton, partly in the town, runs a 
brook (the Assanpink), which in most places is not fordable, and 
over which through Trenton is a bridge. The ground on the other 
side is much higher than on this, and may be said to command 
Trenton completely. Here it was our army drew up, with thirty 
or forty pieces of artillery in front. The enemy pushed our small 
party through the town with vigor, though not with much loss. 
Their retreat over the bridge was thoroughly secured by the artil 
lery. After they had retired over the bridge, the enemy advanced 
within reach of our cannon, who saluted them with great vocifera 
tion and some execution. This continued till dark, when of course 
it ceased, except a few shells we now and then chucked into town 
to prevent their enjoying their new quarters securely. As I before 
mentioned, the creek was in our front, our left on the Delaware, our 
right in a wood, parallel to the creek. The situation was strong, to 
be sure ; but hazardous on this account, that had our right wing been 
defeated, the defeat of the left would almost have been an inevitable 
consequence, and the whole thrown into confusion or pushed into 
the Delaware, as it was impassable by boats. 



BATTLE OF PRINCETON. 39 

" From these circumstances the general thought it best to attack 
Princeton, twelve miles in the rear of the enemy s grand army, and 
where they had the 17th, 40th, and 55th regiments, with a number 
of draughts, altogether perhaps twelve hundred men. Accordingly, 
about one o clock at night we began to march and make this most 
extra mano3uvre. Our troops marched with great silence and order, 
and arrived near Princeton a little after daybreak. We did not 
surprise them as at Trenton ; for they were on their march down to 
Trenton, on a road about a quarter of a mile distant from the one 
in which we were. You may judge of their surprise when they 
discovered such large columns marching up. They could not pos 
sibly suppose it was our army, for that they took for granted was 
cooped up near Trenton. They could not possibly suppose it was 
their own army returning by a back road ; in short, I believe they 
were as much astonished as if an army had dropped perpendicularly 
upon them. However they had not much time for consideration. 
We pushed a party to attack them. This they repulsed with great 
spirit, and advanced upon another column just then coming out of 
a wood, which they likewise put in some disorder; but fresh troops 
coming up, and the artillery beginning to play, they were after a 
smart resistance totally put to the rout. The 17th regiment used 
their bayonets with too much severity upon a party they put to 
flight ; but they were paid for it in proportion, very few escaping. 
Near sixty were killed on the spot, besides the wounded. We 
have taken between three and four hundred prisoners, all British 
troops. They must have lost in this affair nearly five hundred 
killed, wounded, and prisoners. We lost some gallant officers. 
Brigadier-General Mercer was wounded : he had three separate stabs 
with a bayonet. A Lieutenant-Colonel Fleming was killed, and 
Captain Neil of the artillery, an excellent officer. Mercer will get 
better.* The enemy took his parole after we left Princeton. We 
took all their cannon, which consisted of two brass six-pounders, a 
considerable quantity of military stores, blankets, guns, &c. They 
lost, among a number of other officers, a Captain Leslie, a son of 
the Earl of Leven and nephew to General Leslie : him we brought 
off, and buried with the honors of war. 

" After we had been about two hours at Princeton, word was 

* Mercer s wound proved mortal, and he died on the 12th. 



40 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

brought that the enemy were advancing from Trenton. This they 
did, as we have since been informed, in a most infernal sweat, run 
ning, puffing, and blowing, and swearing at being so outwitted. As 
we had other objects in view, to wit, breaking up their quarters, 
we pursued our march to Somerset Court House, where there were 
about thirteen hundred quartered, as we had been informed. They, 
however, had marched off, and joined the army at Trenton. We at 
first intended to have made a forced march to Brunswick ; but our 
men having been without either rest, rum, or provisions for two 
nights and days, were unequal to the task of marching seventeen 
miles further. If we could have secured one thousand fresh men 
at Princeton to have pushed for Brunswick, we should have struck 
one of the most brilliant strokes in all history. However, the 
advantages are very great : already they have collected their whole 
force, and drawn themselves to one point, to wit, Brunswick. 

" The enemy were within nineteen miles of Philadelphia, they are 
now sixty miles. We have driven them from almost the whole of 
West Jersey. The panic is still kept up. We had a battle two 
days ago with a party of ours and sixty Waldeckers, who were all 
killed or taken, in Monmouth County in the lower part of the 
Jerseys. It is not our interest to fight a general battle, nor can I 
think under all circumstances it is the enemy s. They have sent 
their baggage to Staten Island from the Jerseys, and we are very 
well informed they are doing the same from New York. Heath 
will have orders to march there, and endeavor to storm it on that 
side. There is a tide in the affairs of men, which taken at the 
flood leads on to victory. For my part, my Lucy, I look up to 
heaven and most devoutly thank the great Governor of the Universe 
for producing this turn in our affairs; and the sentiment I hope will 
so prevail in the hearts of the people as to induce them to be a peo 
ple chosen of Heaven, not to give way to despair, but at all times 
and under all circumstances never to despair of the Common 
wealth." 

After the battle at Princeton, Knox recommended the 
march to Morristown, which he had observed to be a good 
position. The army would be on the enemy s flank, and 
might easily change its situation if requisite. His earnest 
importunities prevailed, and winter quarters were there

established. He was then sent on a mission to the east 
ward, to see to the casting of cannon and the establish 
ment of laboratories, during which he visited his wife at 
Boston, whence he writes to the Commander-in-chief, under 
date of Feb. 1st : - 

" After my letter to General Greene from Springfield of the 
26th ult., I set out for this place, in order to provide such materials 
as were necessary to carry on the various branches connected with 
the laboratory and ordnance establishment. Upon my arrival here, 
I was much surprised at the very extraordinary bounty offered by 
the State ($86) for recruits for the service. Part of a regiment, 
consisting of four hundred men with a detachment of one hundred 
and fifty artillery, marches to-morrow and next day for Ticonderoga. 
The enlistments in this town have been exceeding rapid. General 
Ward is here, but whether he acts as a councillor of the Massachu 
setts or a continental general is difficult to say. There must be one 
battalion of artillery raised in this State ; for all the old artillery 
men, who have been two years in the service, and acquired some 
experience, are from this town and colony. If the Congress should 
still adhere to Brookfield in preference to Springfield, it will delay 
every thing for three or four months. I wrote General Greene 
from Springfield that it was the best place in all the four New Eng 
land States for a laboratory, cannon foundry, &c., and I hope your 
Excellency will order it there." 

In the following May we find him associated with Greene 
in planning the defences of the North River. On the 
eighth, Mrs. Knox writes him from Sewall s Point (Brook- 
line, near Boston), where she with her babe had been 
undergoing inoculation for the small pox: 

" I have no company here but Madame Heath, who is so 
stiff it is impossible to be sociable with her, and Mr. 
Gardner the treasurer, so that you may well think what I 
feel under my present anxiety." And a few days later 
she writes from Boston : 



42 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

"A French general (Ducoudray), who styles himself commander- 
in-chief of the continental artillery, is now in town. He says his 
appointment is from Mr. Deane, that he is going immediately to 
head-quarters to take command, that he is a major-general arid a 
deal of it. Who knows but I may have my Harry again ? This I 
am sure of, he will never suffer any one to command him in that 
department. If he does, he has not the soul which I now think him 
possessed of." 

To his wife, Knox writes from Morristown, on May 
20th:- 

" From the present information it appears that America will have 
much more reason to hope for a successful campaign the ensuing 
summer than she had the last. Our forces come in pretty fast, and 
are disciplining for the war. We are well supplied with arms and 
ammunition of all species : this, with the blessing of Heaven, will 
assist us much ; but, I am sorry to say it, we seem to be increasing 
most rapidly in impiety. This is a bad omen, but I hope we shall 
mend, though I see no immediate prospect of it. ... Though your 
parents are on the opposite side from your Harry, yet it s very 
strange it should divest them of humanity. Not a line ! My God ! 
what stuff is the human heart made of ? Although father, mother, 
sister, and brother have forgotten you, yet, my love, your Harry will 
ever esteem you the best boon of Heaven." 

Again from Camp Middlebrook, 21st June, 1777 : 

"We have the most respectable body of continental troops that 
America ever had, no going home to-morrow to suck, hardy, brave 
fellows, who are as willing to go to heaven by the way of a bayonet 
or sword as any other mode. With the blessing of Heaven, I have 
great hopes in the course of this campaign that we shall do some 
thing clever. I think in five days there will not be an enemy in 
the Jerseys ; but I fear they will go up the North River, where per 
haps they may plague us more. The inhabitants here appeared as 
one man, and as people actuated by revenge for the many rapes 
and murders committed on them. The Congress have taken some 
precious steps with regard to Mr. Ducoudray. They have resolved 



MONSIEUR DUCOUDRAY. 43 

that Mr. Deane has exceeded his commission, and that they cannot 
ratify his treaty with Mr. Ducoudray. Pretty this ! to bring a gen 
tleman 1,200 leagues to affront him." 

" CAMP POMPTON PLAINS, 13 July, 1777. 

u The letter which I wrote to Congress, to know whether they had 
appointed Mr. Ducoudray, has, in conjunction with the letter of 
Generals Sullivan and Greene, produced a resolve purporting the 
said letters to be an infringement on the liberties of the people, as 
tending to influence the decisions of Congress, and expecting that 
we make acknowledgments to them for so singular an impro 
priety. Conscious of the rectitude of my intention and of the 
contents of my letter, I shall make no acknowledgments whatever 
Though my country is too much pressed at present to resign, yet 
perhaps this campaign will be the last. 1 am determined to con 
tribute my mite to the defence of the country, in spite of every 
obstacle." 

These officers neither resigned nor made the required 
apology ; and Congress having decided not to ratify Mr. 
Deane s engagement, the difficulty was removed. Wash 
ington had written to the President of Congress and to 
Mr. R. H. Lee, a member of that body, that the appoint 
ment of Ducoudray would cause the retirement of General 
Knox, " one of the most valuable officers in the service, 
and who, combating almost innumerable difficulties in the 
department he fills, has placed the artillery upon a footing 
that does him the greatest honor; " and he further charac 
terizes him as u a man of great military reading, sound 
judgment, and clear conceptions." 

The opening movements of Sir William Howe s cam 
paign for the acquisition of Philadelphia are thus described 
in Knox s letter to his intimate friend and life-long corre 
spondent, Harry Jackson, at Boston : 

" CAMP MIDDLEBROOK, 21 June, 1777. 

" General Howe on the 14th put his whole army in motion. lie 
had for a long time past been collecting his force from Rhode Island, 



44 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

New York, Staten Island, &c. The boats upon which he designed 
to cross the Delaware as a bridge were fixed on wagons, besides 
which he had a large number [of] flat-bottom boats fixed on wag 
ons to transport to the Delaware. These boats with the necessary 
apparatus, wagons to convey the baggage and the ammunition 
wagons, &c., swelled the number of his wagons to perhaps 1,000 
or 1,100, a great incurnbrance to an army not very numerous. As 
I have before written, our position was exceeding good, and while 
we continued on it the passage to the Delaware would be rendered 
extremely precarious, and to attack us in camp was an event much 
to be wished. However, something v\as to be done. General Sul 
livan was posted at Princeton, with a force pretty respectable in 
itself, but not sufficient to stop General Howe s army ; and he might 
by a forced march push a column between Princeton and us, and 
cut off General Sullivan s communications at least ; but, our intel 
ligence being pretty good, the general directed Sullivan to take 
post about four miles from Princeton, in such a manner that the 
surrounding him would be impracticable. We also had a party at 
Milstone, as a cover for the ammunition to Princeton. This was a 
dangerous post from its proximity to the enemy, but rendered less 
so by the extreme vigilance which we recommended, and which the 
officer commanding particularly obeyed. Matters were thus sit 
uated on the morning of the 14th, when we discovered that the 
party at Milstone was attacked. Support was immediately sent to 
cover the retreat of the party, when it was discovered to be the 
enemy s main body, as the same body of observation posted there 
were obliged to retreat pretty quick. The enemy took position. 
Our whole army was immediately ordered under arms, ready to be 
put in motion ; but the conduct of the enemy rendered it unnec 
essary, for instead of immediately pushing for the Delaware, distant 
about twenty -five miles, or attacking General Sullivan, he set down 
on the ground and instantly began to fortify in a very strong posi 
tion ; but it was not till the next day that we discovered their 
works. Their conduct was perplexing. It was unaccountable that 
people who the day before gave out in very gasconading terms that 
they would be in Philadelphia in six days should stop short when 
they had gone only nine miles. The intelligence was pretty good 
with respect to their designs, yet it was too imperfect with respect 
to their numbers to warrant an attack on troops so well disciplined, 



HOWE S RETROGRADE MOVEMENTS. 45 

and posted as they were. We also in the course of a day or two 
discovered that they had not moved with any baggage, even tents 
and the most necessary, but had come out with an intention of 
drawing us into the plain ; had left their immense number of wag 
ons behind them, but even in this kind of ostentatious challenge 
they omitted not one precaution for their own safety. They had 
Brunswick and the Raritan River on their right, secured by eight or 
ten strong redoubts. At Brunswick the Raritan bends, and runs a 
little way north, and then turns nearly west. This they had in their 
front secured by strong redoubts at Middlebrook. Their left was 
secured by the river Milstorie, which empties itself into the Raritan 
near Bound Brook : from their right to left was about eight miles. 

"In this situation they continued until early in the morning of the 
19th, continually at work throwing up redoubts. We had a large 
body of riflemen, under Colonel Morgan, perpetually making inroads 
upon them, attacking their pickets, killing their light-horse ; and 
beset them in such a manner, assisted by the militia, that Mr. Howe, 
instead of marching to Philadelphia, found himself almost block 
aded in an open flat country. Nothing could exceed the spirit 
shown on this occasion by the much injured people of the Jerseys. 
Not an atom of the lethargic spirit that possessed them last winter, 
all fire, all revenge. The militia of Pennsylvania likewise turned 
out universally, so that had Sir William put his attempt into exe 
cution, we should probably had twenty-five or thirty thousand 
militia upon his back, besides the most respectable body of conti 
nental troops that ever were in America. 

" These things being fully represented to General Howe, he 
thought it proper to take himself and light army back to Brunswick 
again, and accordingly marched about one o clock in the morning 
of the 19th, without beat of drum or sound of fife. When his army 
had gotten beyond the reach of pursuit, they began to burn, plunder, 
and waste all before them. The desolation they committed was 
horrid, and served to show the malice which marks their conduct. 

" The militia, light-horse, and riflemen exhibited the greatest marks 
of valor, frequently taking prisoners within two hundred yards of 
their encampment. Their loss must be at least one hundred killed 
and wounded and taken prisoners, among whom are two lieuten 
ants of grenadiers of the 55th, and a cornet of light-horse, and a 
number killed, two sergeants taken. This little march of General

Howe s fully proves that no people or country can be permanently 
conquered where the inhabitants are unanimous in opposition. 

" What his next manoeuvres may be I can t say, but we suppose 
the North River ; there I believe he will be also disgraced. The 
motive for belief that the North River will be the scene of his 
operations is, that intelligence is received that Mr. Burgoyne is 
about crossing the lakes to Ticonderoga, and General Howe must 
make an attempt to push for a junction. The enemy from all 
appearances and advices are upon the eve of evacuating the Jer 
seys. Times are much altered for them from last fall. The people 
are unanimous in opposing them : just now four thousand marched 
off to harass the enemy ; as many more will go down towards 
Brunswick this afternoon." 

The subsequent events of the campaign of 1777 in the 
vicinity of Philadelphia are detailed by Knox in the fol 
lowing letters to his wife and others of his correspondents 
at Boston : 

TO MRS. KNOX. 

" BEVERHOUT, 8 miles north of Morristown, 
26th July, 1777. 

" General Howe has sailed from the Hook, we suppose for Phila 
delphia, therefore we are now marching that way. If he is not 
going [there], then Boston must be his object. We intercepted a 
letter from him to General Burgoyne, purporting that the expedition 
up the North River is given up for one to Boston. This letter was 
designed to fall in our hands, in order to deceive. We suppose he 
will be at Philadelphia near as soon as we : we are now four days 
march from it. Upon the whole, I know he ought, in justice to 
his master, to go either up the North River or the eastward, and 
endeavor to form a junction with Burgoyne: therefore (if he is not 
a fool) he will operate accordingly ; but we are bound to Philadel 
phia upon this supposition, and it s very reasonable." 

"DERBY, 7 miles below Philadelphia, 
25th Aug. 1777. 

" The army yesterday marched through the city of Philadelphia. 
Their excellent appearance and marching astonished the Tories, 
who are very downcast on the respectability of the army. I was so

unhappy as to be absent at this time. General Greene and myself 
begged the favor of his Excellency s permission to pay a visit to 
Bethlehem, distant about forty miles, to purchase some things for my 
dear, dear Lucy. The weather was extremely hot, and we set out 
at four o clock in the afternoon, and arrived next morning at nine. 
An express from the general was waiting for us, with orders to 
return immediately: he had rode all night. However, we first 
visited all parts of this singularly happy place, where all the inhabi 
tants seem to vie with each other in humility and brotherly kind 
ness. We joined the army, after a most fatiguing jaunt of a hundred 
miles yesterday, about an hour after they had passed through Phila 
delphia." 

"WILMINGTON, DEL., 1 Sept. 1777. 

" The enemy have landed at the head of Elk, in Maryland, about 
twenty miles from this. Whether they intend to advance or not is at 
present uncertain. We shall remain here a few days ; and if they 
will not come to us, we shall go to them. It is supposed the enemy 
intend for Philadelphia ; if so, they will meet with a stout opposi 
tion. I am at this moment president of a court-martial to try an 
officer of General Howe for recruiting in the Jerseys." 

" CAMP NEAR SCHUTLKILL, 13 Sept. 1777. 

" My dear girl will be happy to hear of her Harry s safety ; for, 
my Lucy, Heaven, who is our guide, has protected him in the day 
of battle. You will hear with this letter of the most severe action 
that has been fought this war between our army and the enemy. 
Our people behaved well, but Heaven frowned on us in a degree. 
We were obliged to retire after very considerable slaughter of the 
enemy : they dared not pursue a single step. If they advance, we 
shall fight them again before they get possession of Philadelphia ; 
but of this they will be cautious. My corps did me great honor : they 
behaved like men contending for every thing that s valuable." * 

* " The regiment of artillery with their general behaved with their usual 
coolness and intrepidity. Some of them could scarce be prevailed on to quit 
their guns, even when surrounded by the enemy and forsaken by our in 
fantry. The Boston boys did themselves great honor. I rode up to Captain 
Allen in the beginning of the action. Young Cooper was with him at the 
same gun, and a number of our Boston lads : they seemed in high spirits." - 
Extract of a Letter from a gentleman of distinction in Philadelphia, Ind. Chronicle, 
2 Oct. 1777 



48 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

We insert here the account of the battle of Brandy- 
wine, written by Knox to the President of the Council of 
Massachusetts : 

" CAMP NEAR SCHUTLKILL, 13th Sept. 1777. 

" SIR, I do myself the honor to transmit to you an account of 
an action which happened between the American and the British 
troops, the llth instant, on the heights of Brandy wine. 

" Brandy wine is a creek which empties itself into the Delaware, 
near Wilmington, about thirty miles from Philadelphia. On the 9th 
instant our army took post about eleven miles up this creek, having it 
in front at a place called Chad s Ford, that being the most probable 
route by which the enemy would endeavor to pass to Philadelphia. 
The enemy on the 10th advanced to Kenuet Square, within three 
miles of our advanced parties, and at eight o clock in the morning of 
the llth a considerable body of their army appeared opposite to us. 
Immediately a heavy cannonade commenced, and lasted with spirit 
for above two hours, and more or less the whole day. Our advanced 
light corps, under General Maxwell, engaged the advanced parties 
of the enemy on the other side of the creek with success, having 
twice repulsed them, and entirely dispersed a body of 300 Hessians. 
This light corps was engaged with their advanced parties almost, 
through the day. At the same time this body advanced opposite to 
our army, another large column, consisting of the British and Hes 
sian grenadiers, light infantry, and some brigades, took a circuitous 
route of six miles to our right, and crossed the creeks at the forks 
of Brandywine. His Excellency General Washington, notwith 
standing his utmost exertions to obtain intelligence, had very con 
tradictory accounts of the numbers and destination of this column 
until it had crossed the creek six miles to our right. He imme 
diately ordered General Sullivan s, Lord Stirling s, and General 
Stephen s divisions to advance and attack them. This was about 
three o clock P.M. These divisions, having advanced about three 
miles, fell in with the enemy, who were also advancing. Both sides 
pushed for a hill situated in the middle. 

"The contest became exceedingly severe, and lasted without 
intermission for an hour and a half, when our troops began to give 
way, having many of them expended all their cartridges. 

" His Excellency, who in the beginning of this action galloped to 



BATTLE OF BRANDYWINE. 49 

the right, ordered Greene s division and Nash s brigade from the 
left ; but, the distance being so great, the other divisions had retreated 
before they arrived. However, they formed, and were of the utmost 
service in covering the retreat of the other divisions, particularly 
Weedon s brigade of Greene s division, which behaved to admiration 
in an excessive hot fire, checked the British grenadiers, and finally, 
after dark, came off in great order.* 

" While this scene was acting on the right, the enemy opened a 
battery on the left of seven pieces of cannon opposite to one of ours 
of the same number. General Wayne, with a division of the Penn 
sylvania troops, having Maxwell s light corps on his left, and 
Nash s brigade (which was afterward drawn off to support the right 
wing) on his right, formed the left wing. The enemy s batteries 
and ours kept up an incessant cannonade, and formed such a column 
of smoke that the British troops passed the creek un perceived on 
the right of the battery, on the ground which was left unoccupied 
by the withdrawal of Nash s brigade. 

" A very severe action immediately commenced between General 
Wayne and the enemy, who had now got possession of a height 
opposite to him. They made several efforts to pass the low grounds 
between them, and were as frequently repulsed. Kight coming on, 
his Excellency the General gave orders for a retreat, which was 
regularly effected without the least attempt of the enemy to pursue. 
Our troops that night retired to Chester, and will now take post in 
such a manner as best to cover Philadelphia. 

" It is difficult at present to ascertain our loss ; but, from the most 
particular inquiry I have been able to make, it will not exceed seven 
hundred or eight hundred killed, wounded, and missing, and ten 
field-pieces. 

* In a letter to Rev. Dr. Gordon, then about leaving for England, where 
his History of the American Revolution was to be published, Knox, under 
date of New York, llth March, 1786, gives the composition of Weedon s 
brigade, which behaved with conspicuous gallantry at Brandywine. In it 
were Colonel Walter Stewart s Pennsylvania regiment, and the Virginia 
regiments of Colonel Spotswood (3d), Lieutenant-Colonel Hendricks (6th), 
Colonel Ed. Stevens (10th), and (14th) Colonel Lewis, who was afterward 
wounded at Guilford, where he commanded a brigade of militia. Knox fur 
nished the Doctor with other materials for his work, and closes his letter 
thus : " I observe," he says, " the printers are exceedingly angry with you 
at Boston for the intention of printing it [Gordon s History] in Great Britain, 
and some of the squibs are republished here." 



50 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

It is a common practice in war to diminish our own loss and 
magnify that of our enemy ; but, from my own observation and the 
opinion of others, their loss must be much greater than ours." 

TO MRS. KNOX. 

POTTSGROVE, 24 Sept. 1777. 

" I wrote you on the 13th. The same day we crossed the Schuyl- 
kill, in order to try the issue of another appeal to Him who directs 
all human events. After some days manoauvring, we came in sight 
of the enemy, and drew up in order of battle, which the enemy 
declined ; but a most violent rain coming on obliged us to change 
our position, in the course of which nearly all the musket cartridges 
of the army that had been delivered to the men were damaged, con 
sisting of above 400,000. This was a most terrible stroke to us, 
and owing entirely to the badness of the cartouch-boxes which had 
been provided for the army. 

" This unfortunate event obliged us to retire, in order to get 
supplied with so essential an article as cartridges, after which we 
forded the Schuylkill, in order to be opposite to the enemy ; accord 
ingly we took post at a place called Flatland Ford. 

" A defensive war is the most difficult to guard against, because 
one is always obliged to attend to the feints of the enemy. To 
defend an extensive river when it is unfordable is almost impossible ; 
but when fordable in every part, it becomes impracticable. On the 
afternoon of the 21st the enemy made a most rapid march of ten or 
twelve miles to our right: this obliged us to follow them. They 
kindled large fires, and in the next night marched as rapidly back 
and crossed at a place where we had few guards, and pushed towards 
Philadelphia, and will this morning enter the city without opposition. 
We fought one battle for it, and it was no deficiency in bravery that 
lost us the day. Philadelphia, it seems, has been their favorite 
object. Their shipping has not joined them there. They will first 
have to raise the chevaux de frise in the Delaware, and defeat the 
naval force there, which is considerable. 

" The troops in this excursion of ten days without baggage suffered 
excessive hardships, without tents in the rain, several marches of 
all night, and often without sufficient provision. This they endured 
with the perseverance and patience of good soldiers. Generals 
Smallwood, Wayne, McDougall, and a considerable body of militia, 



ANOTHER BATTLE EXPECTED. 51 

will join us to-day and to-morrow. This day we shall move towards 
Philadelphia, in order to try the fortune of another battle, in which 
we devoutly hope the blessing of Heaven. I consider the loss of 
Philadelphia as only temporary, to be recovered when expedient. 
It is no more than the loss of Boston, nor, in my opinion, half so 
much, when the present" trade of the latter be considered. It is 
situated on a point of land formed by the rivers Delaware and 
Schuylkill, so that it would [have] been highly improper to have 
thrown ourselves into it. 

" If the enemy do not get their shipping up soon, and go into 
Philadelphia, they will be in a very ineligible situation. I do not 
in the present circumstances consider Philadelphia of so much con 
sequence as the loss of reputation to our arms ; but I trust in God 
we shall soon make up that matter. Billy* is well, and undergoes 
the hardships of the campaign surprisingly well, and they are neither 
few nor small." 

TO COLONEL HENRY JACKSOX.f 

" CAMP AT METUCHIN, 20 miles from Philadelphia, 

3d Oct. 77. 

"MY DEAR HARRY, The enemy are now encamped at Phila 
delphia and its environs for about six miles. The Delaware frigate 
was given up to them in a manner scandalous to relate. The crew, 
it s said, after they had fired one broadside at a battery which was 
erecting near the city, ran her ashore, and gave her up to the 
Britons. The crew were principally foreigners. Our army has had 
several reinforcements of militia, &c., since the late action. I hope 
for better success in the next ; and an action we shall most assuredly 
have before they or we go into winter quarters." 

* His brother William had joined him in July, as his secretary, and 
behaved with spirit a few days later at Germantown. 

t Jackson had been appointed colonel of one of the additional continental 
battalions to be raised in Massachusetts, and numbered the 16th. He was 
born in Boston in 1748, and died there 4 Jan. 1809 ; commissioned colonel 
12 Jan. 1777 ; distinguished at Monmouth, in Sullivan s Rhode Island cam 
paign, and at Springfield, N.J. ; and commanded the last body of continental 
soldiers disbanded in 1784 ; major-general first division Massachusetts militia, 
1792-96 ; and, as United States agent, superintended the construction of the 
frigate " Constitution." Jackson was the intimate friend and correspondent of 
Knox, for whom he acted as a business agent in many important transactions. 
Many of his letters, which are exceedingly interesting, are preserved in the 
Knox Papers. 



52 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

Washington having been reinforced by troops from 
Peekskill on the Hudson, and knowing that Howe had 
weakened his army by detachments for the reduction of 
the posts on the Delaware, resolved to attack his main 
division at Germantown. 

The following account of the battle of Germantown was 
written by Knox to Hon. Artemas Ward, President of the 
Council of Massachusetts Bay. 

"ARTILLERY PARK, PERKEOMY CREEK, Oct. 7, 1777 
(27 miles from Philadelphia). 

SIR, I shall endeavor to give you a short authentic account 
of an attack made by our army on the British army, lying at Ger 
mantown, six miles from Philadelphia, on the morning of the 4th 
instant. 

"At six o clock on the evening of the 3d, the army, under his 
Excellency General Washington, began their march in four columns 
on as many roads towards the enemy ; the nearest column had to 
march fourteen, and some twenty, miles. By marching all night, 
the columns arrived a little after break of day [opposite] to the 
respective posts of the enemy assigned to them. The attack com 
menced by forcing their pickets, which were soon reinforced in front 
by all the light infantry of the line and other troops. After a smart 
action, these were obliged to give way, our troops pressing on with 
great spirit and good order. 

" The different attacks being made at the same time distracted 
the enemy s attention so much, that after about an hour s engage 
ment they began to give way on every part ; but, most unfortunately 
for us, a fog which had arisen about daybreak became so exces 
sively thick from the continued firing that it was impossible to 
discover an object at twenty yards distance. 

" This was the unhappy cause of our losing the victory after 
being in possession of it for near two hours, and having driven the 
enemy above two miles from the place where the engagement begun, 
quite through their encampment. In this unusual fog it was im 
possible to know how to support, or what part to push. At this 
instant, the enemy again rallied and obliged part of our troops to 
retire ; and after a smart resistance, the retreat of the line became 



BATTLE OF GERMANTOWN. 53 

general. The enemy followed with caution, and we came off with 
out the loss of a single piece of cannon or any thing else, except 
one empty ammunition wagon, the engagement from beginning to 
end being about two hours and forty minutes. 

" Our loss in killed, wounded, and missing, is not fully ascertained, 
but will not exceed five hundred or six hundred. We had a very 
considerable number of officers of merit killed and wounded. 
Brigadier-General Nash, of North Carolina, mortally wounded by a 
cannon-ball taking off his thigh. 

" The enemy s loss, we hear from pretty good authority, is very 
considerable. General Agnew killed. Sir William Erskine 
wounded. This is the first attack made during this war by the 
American troops on the main body of the enemy ; ancl had it not 
been [for] the unlucky circumstance of the fog, Philadelphia 
would probably have been in our hands. It is matter worthy of 
observation that in most other countries which have been invaded 
one or two battles have decided their fate ; but America rises after 
a defeat ! 

" We were more numerous after the battle of Brandywine than 
before, and we have demonstration of being more numerous now 
than before the 4th. Our men are in the highest spirits, and ardently 
desire another trial. I know of no ill consequences that can follow 
the late action ; on the contrary, we have gained considerable expe 
rience, and our army have a certain proof that the British troops 
are vulnerable*" 

In a letter to Mrs. Knox he says : " To this cause [the 
fog], in conjunction with the enemy s taking possession of 
some stone buildings in Gerinantown, is to be ascribed the 
loss of the victory. We brought off the greater part of 
our wounded." 

TO MRS. KNOX. 

" CAMP, 24 miles from Philadelphia, 13th Oct. 1777. 
..." I send you this by Captain Randall, who has the misfor 
tune to be again made a prisoner, after being slightly wounded in 
seven or eight places. 

" The matter you mention about rations cannot be complied withj

54 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

and I thank God I have too much reliance on his divine providence 
to have any of those misgivings and forebodings of which my dear 
Lucy seems so apprehensive. I trust the same Divine Being who 
brought us together will support us. The enemy have not yet re 
duced our obstacles in the river Delaware below Philadelphia, and 
consequently have not got their shipping up to the town. They have 
made several efforts, but hitherto in vain, in one of which we took 
two officers and fifty-six privates prisoners. If the enemy cannot 
get their shipping up, Philadelphia is one of the most ineligible 
places in the world for an army surrounded by rivers which are 
impassable, and an army above them. We have been pretty quiet 
since the action of the 4th ; but we have yet tolerable prospects 
and hopes to winter in Philadelphia. I mean our army ; for how 
ever clouded the prospect may be, yet I have sanguine hopes of 
being able to live this winter in sweet fellowship with the dearest 
friend of my heart. Ere you receive this, you will receive the 
account of the loss of Fort Montgomery, which I own to you is in 
my opinion exceedingly heavy, but it must stimulate us to make 
greater exertions. America almost deserves to be made slaves for 
her non-exertions in so important an affair. . . . Observe, my dear 
girl, how Providence supports us. The advantages gained by our 
Northern army give almost a decisive turn to the contest. For my 
own part I have not yet seen so bright a dawn as the prospect, and 
I am as perfectly convinced in my own mind of the kindness of 
Providence towards us as I am of my own existence." 

TO THE SAME. 

" CAMP, 10 miles from Philadelphia, Nov. 3, 1777. 

....** The enemy have not yet been able to drive our galleys 
away, or storm or batter our forts with success. We have lately 
had a storm, which has ruined their batteries and works erected 
against Fort Minim. Since they had two men-of-war burnt on the 
23d in the river, and were defeated the 22d at Red Bank, they 
have appeared quite silent in deeds, but not so in words. They have 
been very angry for our feux de joie, which we have fired on the 
several victories over Burgoyne, and say that by and by [we] shall 
bring ourselves into contempt with our own army for propagating 
such known falsehoods. Poor fellows ! nothing but Britain must 
triumph." 



OPPOSES AN ATTACK ON PHILADELPHIA. 55 

On the 15th of November, after the fall of Fort Mifflin, 
Knox, with De Kalb and St. Clair, was sent to provide for 
the security of Red Bank. This post, known as Fort 
Mercer, fell, however, after a brave defence on the 18th. 

In the council of war on Oct. 26, and again on Dec. 
3d, Knox opposed the project of an attack on the enemy s 
lines at Philadelphia, giving on the day last named these 
reasons : " Our entire want of clothing ; the impossibility 
and impracticability of surprising 10,000 veteran troops 
in a well fortified city ; the impossibility of our keeping 
the field to besiege their works and city regularly, being 
almost totally deficient in warlike apparatus for so arduous 
an enterprise ; and the uncertainty of obtaining a suffi 
cient number of militia to warrant the enterprise." He 
proposed that the army go into winter quarters, with the 
right at Lancaster and the left at Reading, provided a 
sufficiency of houses and good cover could be had there ; 
if not, that it should be hutted about thirty miles from 
Philadelphia, near the Schuylkill. The army wintered at 
Valley Forge, somewhat nearer the city ; and Knox took 
advantage of the cessation of active operations to visit his 
wife at Boston. A picture of the privations of the army 
during this memorable winter is given in the following 
letter from Greene to Knox : - 

" CAMP, VALLEY FORGE, 26th Feb. 1778. 

" The army has been in great distress since you left it. The 
troops are getting naked ; they were seven days without meat, and 
several days without bread. Such patience and moderation as 
they manifested under their sufferings does the highest honor to 
the magnanimity of the American soldiers. The seventh day they 
came before their superior officers, and told their sufferings in as 
respectful terms as if they had been humble petitioners for special 
favors. They added that it would be impossible to continue in 
camp any longer without support. Happily relief arrived from the 



56 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

little collections I and some others had made, and prevented the 
army from disbanding. We are still in danger of starving. Hun 
dreds of our horses have already starved to death. The committee 
of Congress have seen all these things with their own eyes. They 
have been urging me for several days to accept the quartermaster- 
general s appointment, his Excellency also presses it upon me 
exceedingly. I hate the place, but hardly know what to do. I wish 
for your advice in the affair, but am obliged to determine imme 
diately." 

Mrs. Knox arrived in camp at Valley Forge on May 20, 
1778, soon after the news of the alliance with France had 
been received. She was attended from New Haven by 
General Arnold, who was of great service to her dur 
ing her journey, and remained with the army until it 
was disbanded. 

At the battle of Monmouth, which occurred on June 
28th, and of which he ever after spoke with much pride, 
Knox reconnoitred in front, rallying the retreat, and bring 
ing up the rear with a brisk fire from a battery planted in 
the night, directed by his brigade adjutant, the chevalier 
Mauduit Duplessis. Of the services of this arm, Wash 
ington, in general orders, says he " can with pleasure 
inform General Knox and the officers of the artillery that 
the enemy has done them the justice to acknowledge that 
no artillery could have been better served than ours." 

To his brother and to his wife, Knox wrote the partic 
ulars of this battle, and of the events which preceded 
it: 

TO HIS BROTHER WILLIAM. 

HOPEWELL TOWNSHIP, NEW JERSEY, 

4 o clock A.M., 25th June, 1778. 

"The enemy evacuated Philadelphia on the 19th. Lucy and I 
went in, but it stunk so abominably that it was impossible to stay 
there, as was her first design. The enemy are now at Allen Town, 
about ten miles southeast of Princeton, and we are at about six 



HOWE EVACUATES PHILADELPHIA. 57 

miles north [of] Princeton, so that the two armies are now 
about nineteen or twenty miles apart. We are now on the march 
towards them, and their movements this day will determine whether 
we shall come in close contact with each other. We have now very 
numerous parties harassing and teasing them on all quarters. 
Desertion prevails exceedingly in their army, especially among the 
Germans. Above three hundred German and English have de 
serted since they left Philadelphia. Had we a sufficiency of num 
bers, we should be able to force them to a similar treaty with 
Burgoyne ; but, at present, have not quite such sanguine hopes. 
If general actions had no other consequences than merely the killed 
and wounded, we should attack them in twenty-four hours. But 
the fate of posterity, and not the illusive brilliancy of military glory, 
governs our Fabian commander, the man [to whom], under God, 
America owes her present prospects of peace and happiness." 

TO MRS. KNOX. 

" June 29, near Monmouth Court House. 

"Mr DEAREST LOVE, I wrote you some few days ago that a 
day or two would determine whether we should have an engage 
ment with the Britons. Yesterday, at about nine o clock A.M., our 
advanced parties under General Lee attacked their rear while on 
the march towards Shrewsbury, upon which their whole army, 
except the Hessians, came to the right about ; and, after some fight 
ing, obliged him to retire to the main army, which was about two 
miles distant. The enemy advanced with great spirit to the attack, 
and began a very brisk cannonade on us, who were formed to 
receive them. 

" The cannonade lasted from about eleven until six o clock, at 
which time the enemy began to retire on all quarters, and left us 
in possession of the field. We have had several field officers killed, 
and a considerable number of others. Colonel Ramsay, Mrs. Ram 
say s husband, was taken prisoner, and this morning released on 
his parole. I have had several officers killed and wounded. My 
brave lads behaved with their usual intrepidity, and the army gave 
the corp^ of artillery their full proportion of the glory of the day. 

" Indeed, upon the whole, it is very splendid. The capital army 
of Britain defeated and obliged to retreat before the Americans, 



58 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

whom they despised so much ! I cannot ascertain either our or the 
enemy s loss, but I really think they have lost three times the 
number we have. I judge from the field of battle, which, to be sure, 
is a field of carnage and blood : three to one of the British forces 
lie there. The Britons confess they have never received so severe 
a check. The enemy took a strong post, about a mile from the 
place of action, to dislodge them from which, as it was dark, would 
cost too many men, and by which they covered the retreat of their 
army. After having been fighting all day, and one of the hottest 
I ever felt, they decamped in the night and marched off with the 
utmost precipitation, leaving a great number of their wounded, 
both officers and men, in our hands. We have sent out large bodies 
in pursuit, but I believe they will not be able to come up with the 
main body. . . . The number of deserters, since they left Phila 
delphia, must exceed eight hundred. The march has proved to 
them a most destructive one, and is very ill-calculated to give Sir 
II. Clinton any eclat. He may storm Fort Montgomery, but is 
very ill-calculated, in my opinion, to be at the head of a large 
army. 

"My friend, Harry [Jackson], crossed over from Philadelphia, 
and was in the unfortunate [i.e., early] part of the day. I saw him 
once on the field, for a moment : he appeared much fatigued. His 
regiment had a few killed and wounded, and is reported to have 
behaved well." 

TO HIS BROTHER WILLIAM. 

" CAMP BRUNSWICK, 3d July, 1778. 

..." The enemy inclined more to their right than we expected, 
and took the road to Sandy Hook, instead of the supposed one to 
South Amboy. 

" A body of Jersey militia, amounting to near 2,000, had en 
deavored to retard them, by taking up the bridges, felling trees, and 
harassing their flanks and rear. Beside these, his Excellency 
General Washington had detached several large bodies for the same 
purpose, all of which, except Colonel Morgan, were, on the 28th ult., 
united under General Lee, who early on that morning advanced to 
Monmouth Court House with the intention of attacking the cover 
ing party by left flank, the main army moving on at the same time 
to support him, although it was some miles in the rear. The parties 



BATTLE OF MONMOUTH. 59 

under General Lee, instead of finding a covering party as was 
expected, found their whole army or the greater part of it. After 
some manoeuvring, cannonading, and some other circumstances, 
which are not yet sufficiently explained, it was thought proper by 
General Lee to retire until it met the main army, which it effected 
without much loss. The army was drawn up on advantageous 
ground to receive the enemy, who advanced to the attack with 
considerable impetuosity, and began a brisk cannonade, which was 
returned with becoming spirit. The action of the musketry was 
various, and with intermissions until about six o clock, when we 
pushed the enemy off the field. . . . Their whole loss may amount 
to about ten or twelve hundred killed, wounded, and prisoners. His 
Excellency, the General, has done the corps of artillery and me the 
honor to notice us in general orders in very pointed and flattering 
terms. Indeed, I was highly delighted with their coolness, bravery, 
and good conduct. The effects of the Battle of Monmouth will be 
great and lasting. It will convince the enemy and the world that 
nothing but a good constitution is wanting to render our army equal 
to any in the world." 

From letters to his brother at various times we extract 
as follows : 

" CAMP, WHITE PLAINS, 14th Sept. 1778. 

..." We wish to know where Lord Howe is, as it might be 
some clew to the designs of the enemy ; though as to dangerous de 
signs, they have none, I am persuaded, nor never had, except to 
themselves. It is improper for a person in my station to speak 
thus, were it to be divulged; but I do not believe there ever was 
a set of men so perfectly disqualified, by a total and profound 
ignorance of every thing that ought to constitute the characters of 
leaders of an army to conquest. I beg you not to imagine that by 
depreciation of their abilities I mean to exalt our own. God forbid ! 
I shall say nothing about it but only this, that we never set our 
selves up as great military men. I believe they [the enemy] are 
about to quit the continent, and perhaps only wait for their last 
orders to effect it." 



60 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 



" PHILADELPHIA, 3 Feb. 1779. 

..." We are in great want of lead. The Board of War have 
desired me to write to Boston to inquire what quantity can be 
gotten there and at the neighboring towns, and at what price. I 
wish you to make the inquiry, or rather to get some person to make 
it for you, as the gentlemen speculators may suspect from your con 
nection that you want it for the public, and advance their prices in 
proportion. Write me the result speedily as possible, so that I may 
communicate it to the board. ... I am glad you have gotten into 
the old store. I thank you for the little pamphlet. The girls are 
the same everywhere, at least some of them : they love a red 
coat dearly. Arnold is going to be married to a beautiful and 
accomplished young lady, a Miss Shippen, of one of the best 
families in this place." 

"Feb. 13. 

..." You will see in the papers some highly colored charges 
against General Arnold, by the State of Pennsylvania. I shall 
be exceedingly mistaken if one of them can be proven. He has 
returned to Philadelphia, and will, I hope, be able to vindicate 
himself from the aspersions of his enemies." 

" PLUCKEMIN, 28 Feb. 1779. 

..." You wish to know my business to Philadelphia. It was 
merely to get the ordnance department better regulated. Besides 
the satisfaction of having the business of the public done better, 
the only advantage that will result to me will be some pay expressly 
for the management of the ordnance department in the field. I 
undoubtedly might have at first stipulated for some pecuniary ad 
vantages for myself; but I know not how it is, I do not approve of 
money obtained in the public service : it does not appear to me, in 
a war like ours, to be right, and I cannot bring myself to think 
differently, although poverty may be the consequence. We had at 
the Park [of artillery], on the 18th, a most genteel entertainment 
given by self and officers. Everybody allowed it to be the first of 
the kind ever exhibited in this State at least. We had about 
seventy ladies, all of the first ton in the State, and between three 
and four hundred gentlemen. We danced all night, an elegant 



PRIVATEERING SPECULATIONS. 61 

room. The illuminating, fireworks, &c., were more than, pretty. It 
was to celebrate the alliance between France arid America." 

" March 13. 

"I am sorry for the loss of the vessel you mention, but not dis 
couraged. I hope the little vessel will at least make up for her. 
I wrote to you to try something, by way of adventure, in the 
* General Arnold. She is a good vessel and commander. ... I 
am exceedingly anxious to effect something in these fluctuating 
times, which may make us lazy for life. You know my sentiments 
with respect to making any thing out of the public. I abominate 
the idea. I could not, at the end of the war, mix with my fellow- 
citizens with that conscious integrity, the felicity of which I often 
anticipate." 

Knox seems to have been unfortunate in his privateer 
ing speculations, vessel after vessel in which he had a 
share being captured by the enemy, some of them with 
valuable cargoes and just as they were entering port. 

" PLUCKEMIN, N.J., 7 May, 1779. 

" If we are to believe Rivington s paper of May 1, we are to have 
bloody work this summer. They swear by monstrous big oaths they 
will exterminate us this campaign. However that may be, we at 
present have but little apprehensions of it, although, from a variety 
of corroborating circumstances, we expect we shall have a much 
more active campaign than the last." 

In a later letter he says : 

"The whole army have moved up to this place [Middlebrook] 
to cover the almost infinitely important posts in the highlands, 
which we do in so effectual a manner that, were the enemy much 
stronger than they are, I should be in no pain for the safety of the 
posts. The enemy have established themselves so securely at 
King s Ferry that we shall not be able to dislodge them at present. 
Perhaps a future and more important operation may involve the 
posts at King s Ferry in its fall. The enemy expect reinforce 
ments, and we, with the blessing of Heaven, expect to baffle their 
utmost efforts. We expect every thing from the discipline and good 
ness of our troops ; but probably we shall want some assistance from 
our brethren."

62 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

Of the warmth of Knox s affection for his friend Gen 
eral Lincoln, his letters give ample evidence. Here is an 
extract from one written just after the capture of Charles 
ton by Sir Henry Clinton, where Lincoln and his army 
became prisoners. 

" The great defence made by you and your garrison in field for 
tifications will confer on you and them the esteem and admiration 
of every sensible military man. I hope and believe that Congress 
will most unequivocally bestow that applause which you have so 
richly merited. No event, except the capture of Sir H. Clinton 
and his army, would give me more pleasure than to see you. He 
is now in force at Springfield, below Morristown." 

And at a later period he writes : 

" The first moment I had the happiness of being acquainted with 
you I conceived a high degree of friendship, which uniformly has 
increased as I became more intimate, until the present period. I 
consider the confidential manner in which we have indulged as one 
of the happy circumstances of my life, and in all events of grief or 
joy there is no man from whose friendship I should more readily 
expect the most cordial balsam, or whose bosom would more cheer 
fully expand in a participation of my happiness." 

The French army under the Count de Rochambeau, des 
tined to co-operate with the Americans, arrived at Newport 
in July, 1780 ; and on Sept. 21st, Knox, with Washington 
and La Fayette, visited the French general and admiral, de 
Ternay, at Hartford, to concert the details of a plan of 
operations. . While returning from this meeting, they 
heard of Arnold s treason, and immediately hastened to 
West Point. 

Knox was one of the board of general officers which 
tried and condemned Major Andre to death as a spy, a 
sentence which the usages of war compelled them to pro 
nounce, but which was especially distasteful to him since 



CHASTELLUX VISITS THE CAMP. 63 

that chance meeting on Lake George, narrated on a pre 
vious page, when they had made each other s acquaintance 
under such peculiar circumstances. 

In the latter part of November, the Chevalier de Chas- 
tellux, a major-general in Rochambeaii s army and a mem 
ber of the French Academy, visited the American camp 
at New Windsor. From his Travels, published a few years 
later,, we extract the following interesting particulars of 
this visit. 

In the morning while at breakfast, horses were brought 
and orders given for the men to get under arms, and the 
chevalier and Washington repaired to the camp, where 
they were received by General Knox at the head of his 
artillery. This was exhibited in fine order, formed in the 
foreign manner, each gunner at his post ready to fire. 
Knox politely apologized for not firing a salute, on account 
of the troops on the other side of the river, which had 
been put in motion by a previous order, and whom he was 
afraid of giving some alarm. 

Returning from a subsequent tour to visit the general 
officers of the line at their respective quarters with La 
Fayette, they met with Knox, who brought them back to 
head-quarters by the nearest way through a wood, where 
they fell into a road leading to his retired residence. This 
was a little rural spot where Mrs. Knox had passed part 
of the campaign ; and here the chevalier found what he 
called a real " family," formed besides the general and his 
wife of a little girl of three years and an infant of six 
months. 

The wretched situation of the army at this time, 
which culminated in the mutiny of the lines of Pennsyl 
vania and New Jersey, is graphically described in this 
extract from Knox s letter to his brother, dated Dec. 2, 
1780: 



64 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

" We depend upon the great Author of Nature to provide sub 
sistence and clothing for us through a long and severe winter; for 
the people, whose business, according to the common course of 
things, it was to provide the materials necessary, have either been 
unable or neglected to do it. The soldier, ragged almost to naked 
ness, has to sit down at this period, and with an axe perhaps his 
only tool, and probably that a bad one to make his habitation for 
winter. However, this, and [being] punished with hunger into the 
bargain, the soldiers and officers have borne with a fortitude almost 
superhuman. The country must be grateful to these brave fellows. 
It is impossible to admit of the idea of an alternative." 

In January, 1781, he was sent by Washington to the 
Eastern States to represent the suffering condition of the 
troops with a view to their relief, and on the 14th ar 
rived at Boston with the news of the mutiny of the Penn 
sylvania line. 

An active campaign was now planned which, with the 
aid of our allies, it was hoped would be decisive. Wash 
ington, on Feb. 16, wrote to Knox, instructing him to 
procure the articles necessary to a " capital operation 
against New York, or against Charleston, Savannah, Peii- 
obscot, &c., in case of inability to undertake the siege of the 
first and principal object." Knox in reply promised his 
utmost efforts to obtain the requisite supplies, but details 
the great want of proper material for such an operation, 
and complains of the Board of War for neglecting his 
repeated requisitions. " Powder," he says, " is an article 
of which we are so deficient that, when a reasonable quan 
tity shall be appropriated for the use of the important 
posts in the highlands (which ought and will be furnished 
under all circumstances), there will literally none remain." 

The following letters and extracts of letters throw 
light upon the occurrences of this eventful campaign. 



CONFERENCE WITH KOCHAMBEAU. 65 



TO WILLIAM KNOX. 

" WETHERSFIELD, 20 May, 1781. 

"I am here, my dear brother, having arrived last evening with 
his Excellency the General and General Duportail to meet Count 
Bochambeau and Admiral Barras, upon some matters of great con 
sequence. We came here last night. The French gentlemen will 
be here to-morrow, and we shall probably depart in two days after." 

And on the 25th he writes him : 

" We have not finished our business until this morning. Count 
Rochambeau left us yesterday, and we shall set out in about one 
hour, and shall expect to reach New Windsor to-morrow evening." 

At this important meeting the plan of the subsequent 
campaign was discussed, and as far as possible decided on, 
the primary object being New York. 

WASHINGTON TO KNOX. 

" HEAD-QUARTERS, NEW WINDSOR, May 28, 1781. 

" As you are perfectly acquainted with the measures which have 
been concerted with the Count de Rochambeau, I have only to 
request that you will be pleased to make all the necessary estimates 
of articles wanted in your department, and also put the whole busi 
ness for the operation (so far as is within your reach) in the best 
train of execution which our embarrassed circumstances will possibly 
admit. Under the present appearances of an evacuation of New 
York, I think it will be [proper] to draw the stores from the east 
ward rather than from the southward." 

TO WILLIAM KNOX. 

" CAMP AT PHILLIPSBURG, 10 miles from King s Bridge, 
20 July, 1781. 

" Lucy, with her sweet children, has gone up the river with Mrs. 
Cochran, on a visit to some families. I suppose she will proceed as 
far as Albany ; after which, I think, she will sit down in Jersey for 
the remainder of the campaign. Although we are not bad in ac- 



66 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

commodating ourselves to our circumstances, yet I sensibly feel the 
inconveniences we labor under, to accumulate in proportion to the 
increase of our family. I sincerely pray God that the war may be 
ended this campaign, that public and private society may be re 
stored. . . . 

The vile water-gruel governments which have taken place in 
most of the States are totally disproportioned to the exigencies of 
the war, and are productive of sentiments unworthy an energetic 
republic. However, I hope we shall wade through. 

" I cannot, in justice, omit paying some compliments to our State. 
The policy appears to be enlarged and liberal ; and the exertions 
greatly surpass, at this present time, any State in the union. The 
same tone, sentiments, and exertion pervading all the States, would 
indisputably render this the last campaign. 

" The enemy lately sent some ships up the river with an intent 
to interrupt our communication by water with West Point, but 
they yesterday retired without effecting any thing of consequence." 

TO MRS. KNOX. 

" CAMP, NEAR DOBBS FERRY, 3 Aug. 1781. 

..." Yesterday was your birthday. I cannot attempt to show 
you how much I was affected by it. I remembered it, and humbly 
petitioned Heaven to grant us the happiness of continuing our union 
until we should have the felicity of seeing our children flourishing 
around us, and ourselves crowned with virtue, peace, and years, and 
that we both might take our flight together, secure of a happy im 
mortality. 

..." All is harmony and good fellowship between the two armies. 
I have no doubt, when opportunity offers, that the zeal of the French 
and the patriotism of the Americans will go hand in hand to glory. 
I cannot explain to you the exact plan of the campaign : we don t 
know it ourselves. You know what we wish, but we hope more at 
present than we believe." 

FROM WILLIAM KNOX. 

BOSTON, 22 Aug. 1781. 

" I suppose, from necessity, you are obliged to speak much French, 
which, you having long since learnt the theoretic part, I should 
imagine, from a little practice, would come easy to you. 



GREENE S LETTER. 67 

" If I recollect, the Compte Rochambeau doesn t speak a word of 
English, nor do the two brothers Viomenil, Marquis Laval, or 
Compte St. Maime. The two counts Deux Pouts, on the other 
hand, speak [it] pretty well ; and the most amiable General 
Chastellux, a merveille. If you have opportunity, I am sure you 
must be very intimate [with] General C., if the two characters of 
the man of letters and polite gentleman are recommendations. I 
know nobody who can be more strongly recommended. I have 
reason to speak of the civility of all the gentlemen I have named, 
and of many which I have not, and who belong to that army, but 
more particularly of those shown me by the Chevalier Chastellux, 
at whose petits soupers I was invited two evenings out of three 
when at Newport. I mention this as being a particular mark of 
his attention, for the being invited to dine is a common compliment 
from him to recommended strangers ; but the evening circle is 
always selected." 

FROM GENERAL GREENE. 

" HEAD-QUARTERS, HIGH HILLS, SANTEE, Aug. 17, 1781. 

"My DEAR FRIEND, If accounts are true, that New York is 
seriously invested, you must be the hero of the day. Methinks I 
hear the cannon roar while I am writing. The shells and the shot 
fired from the besiegers and besieged must make a terrible rattling. 
The splendor of such a siege will sink our puny operations into 
nothing. But, after you have done at New York, it is to be hoped 
you will come to the southward and unfetter the poor unfortunate 
inhabitants of Charlestown. I should be happy to see my old 
friend, McDougall, in the field of speculation. How goes on his 
chapter of difficulties ? The siege of New York, I imagine, will 
afford him a large collection of materials. Where is Howe, with 
his nose ? has he left off his port, or forgiven the boy that insulted 
it so grossly at Morristown ? The story is told even in this country ; 
and I declare, upon my honor, I did not bring it here. 

44 Where is the noble Earl [Stirling] ? 1 hope he s had an oppor 
tunity to review the ground on Long Island ; and, I presume, every 
officer of note in the French army has heard in detail the partic 
ulars. We have had a report here that General Howe and he had 
had a duel, but I did not believe it. Honest fellows, what have they 
to quarrel about ? 



68 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

" I am sending aide-de-camp after aide-de-camp to get news from 
the northward. I am not a little apprehensive the people on the 
road will think the Southern army is broken up. 

" I beg you will present Mrs. Knox with my most affectionate 
regards ; and I hope you will not get in the way of a four-and- 
twenty pounder, but will return to her with whole bones. My com 
pliments to honest Shaw." 

And again : 

"Sept. 29, 1781. 

"Mr DEAR FRIEND, Where you are I know not, but if you 
are where I wish you, it is with the General in Virginia ; the pros 
pect is so bright and the glory so great, that I want you to be 
there to share in them. I was in hopes you would have operated 
seriously against New York, which would have been still more 
important ; but as your operations are directed another way, I take 
it for granted means were wanting to play the great game. 

" We have been beating the bush, and the General has come to 
catch the bird. Never was there a more inviting object to glory. 
The General is a most fortunate man, and may success and laurels 
attend him. We have fought frequently and bled freely, and little 
glory comes to our share. Our force has been so small that nothing 
capital could be effected, and our operations have been conducted 
under every disadvantage that could embarrass either a general or 
an army. 

" I long to see you, and spend an evening s conversation together. 
Where is Mrs. Knox ? and how is Lucy and my young god-son, Sir 
Harry ? I beg you will present my kind compliments and best 
wishes to Mrs. Knox. 

" How is my old friend, Colonel Jackson ? is he as fat as ever, 
and can he still eat down a plate of fish that he can t see over? 
God bless his fat soul with good health and good spirits to the end 
of the war, that we may all have a happy meeting in the North. 
Please to give my compliments to your brother, and tell him we 
are catching at smoky glory while he is wisely treasuring up solid 
coin." 

On the 19th of August, Washington, learning of the 
expected arrival of the fleet of De Grasse, marched his 



CAMPAIGN IN VIRGINIA. 69 

army to the southward, having abandoned the attempt 
upon New York, in order to operate, in conjunction with 
the French military and naval forces, against Lord Corn- 
wallis in Virginia. He reached Williamsburg on Septem 
ber 14, and, accompanied by Rochambeau, Chastellux, 
Knox, and Duportail, immediately repaired to the fleet 
of De Grasse, and a plan of co-operation was arranged 
on board the " Ville de Paris." Expecting an attack from 
a British fleet not much inferior to his own, and thinkina* 

o 

his station within the Chesapeake unfavorable for a naval 
combat, the French admiral a few days later designed to 
put to sea with his fleet in quest of the British. This 
alarmed the American commander, who despatched La 
Fayette and Knox to entreat him to preserve his station, 
in which they fortunately prevailed. 

The following letters, relating to the investiture and 
siege of Yorktown, are not uninteresting, that to Mr. Jay, 
our minister to Spain, giving a full account of the Virginia 
campaign : 

TO WILLIAM KNOX. 

"HEAD OF ELK, 8 Sept. 1781. 

" I rob my business of one moment to inform you that our army 
is here, and will, with all its stores, proceed down the Chesapeake 
in three days. Our prospects are good ; and I shall hope to inform 
you, in fifteen days, that we have had Cornwallis completely in 
vested. The Count de Grasse s squadron is a noble one, and will 
prevent the enemy s escape by water. I hope we shall do it by 
land. 

" Lucy leaves her daughter in Philadelphia, and in five or six 
days will set out for Virginia to reside with Mrs. Washington." 

TO MRS. KNOX AT MOUNT VERNON. 

" CAMP BEFORE YORK, 1 Oct. 1781. 

" We came before York on the 28th, on the 29th nearly com 
pleted the investiture ; but yesterday the enemy evacuated their 

10 



70 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

outposts, which gives us a considerable advantage in point of time. 
Our prospects are good, and we shall soon hope to impress our 
haughty foe with a respect for the continental arms." 

TO MRS. KNOX. 

"CAMP BEFORE YORK, eight o clock A.M., 19 Oct. 1781. 
" I have detained William until this moment that I might be the 
first to communicate good news to the charmer of my soul. A glorious 
moment for America ! This day Lord Cornwallis and his army 
march out and pile their arms in the face of our victorious army. 
The day before yesterday he desired commissioners might be named 
to treat of the surrender of his troops, the ships, and every thing 
they possess. He at first requested that the Britons might be sent 
to Britain, and the Germans to Germany ; but this the General 
refused, and they have now agreed to surrender prisoners of war, 
to be kept in America until exchanged or released. They will have 
the same honors as the garrison of Charleston ; that is, they will not 
be permitted to unfurl their colors, or play Yankee Doodle. We 
know not yet how many they are. The General has just requested 
me to be at head-quarters instantly, therefore I cannot be more 
particular." 

TO JOHN JAY. 

" CAMP BEFORE YORK, IN VIRGINIA, 21 Oct. 1781. 

" The enemy s operations in these States, though not carried on 
with great armies, compared with those of 1776 and 1777, yet 
were so formidable as to dispel every force which the country of 
itself was capable of opposing. This rendered it necessary for 
America to march its army here, or give up the Southern States 
as lost. It appears, also, to have been the opinion of the French 
Court, as Count de Grasse gave intelligence of his intention of 
arriving at the Capes of Virginia. Our previous views were New 
York. The dispositions were made on the Hudson s River for the 
attack of Lord Cornwallis in Virginia, and every thing has suc 
ceeded equal to our sanguine wishes. 

" This important affair has been effected by the most harmonious 
concurrence of circumstances that could possibly have happened : a 
fleet and troops from the West Indies, under the orders of one of the 



SIEGE OF YORKTOWN. 71 

best men in the world ; an army of American and French troops, 
marching from the North River, five hundred miles, and the 
fleet of Count de Barras, all joining so exactly in point of time as 
to render what has happened almost certain. 

"I shall not enter into a detail of circumstances previous to the 
collection of our force at Williamsburg, twelve miles distant from 
this place, which was made on the 27th ult. On the 28th we 
marched to the camp, and on the 29th and 30th we completed the 
investiture of York. A body of American militia, Lauzun s legion, 
and some marines from the fleet of Count de Grasse, at the same 
time formed in the vicinity of Gloucester, so as to prevent any 
incursions of the enemy into the country. From the 1st October to 
the 6th was spent in preparing our materials for the siege, bringing 
forward our cannon and stores, and in reconnoitring the points of 
attack. On the evening of the Gth we broke ground and began our 
first parallel within six hundred yards of the enemy s works, un 
discovered. 

"The first parallel, four redoubts, and all our batteries were 
finished by the 9th, at two o clock P.M., when we opened our bat 
teries and kept them playing continually. On the night of the 12th 
we began our second parallel, at three hundred yards distance from 
the enemy. And on the night of the 14th we stormed the two 
redoubts which the enemy had in advance of their main works. 
The gallant troops of France under the orders of Baron de Vio- 
menil, and the hardy soldiers of America under the Marquis de 
la Fayette, attacked separate works and carried them in an in 
stant. This brilliant stroke was effected without any great loss 
on our side : the enemy lost between one and two hundred. This 
advantage was important, and gave us an opportunity of perfecting 
our second parallel, into which we took the two redoubts. On the 
16th, just before day, the enemy made a sortie, and spiked up some 
of our cannon, but were soon repulsed and driven back to their 
works. The cannon were soon cleared; and the same day our 
batteries in the second parallel began the fire, and continued without 
intermission until nine o clock in the morning of the 17th October, 
ever memorable on account of the Saratoga affair, when the enemy 
sent a flag, offering to treat of the surrender of the posts of York 
and Gloucester. The firing continued until two o clock, when com 
missioners on both sides met to adjust the capitulation, which was 



72 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

not finished and signed until twelve o clock on the 19th. Our troops 
took possession of two redoubts of the enemy soon after, and about 
two o clock the enemy marched out and grounded their arms. 

"The whole garrison are prisoners of war, and had the same 
honors only as were granted to our garrison at Charleston, their 
colors were cased, and they were prohibited playing a French or 
American tune. 

"The returns are not yet collected ; but including officers, sick, 
and well, there are more than seven thousand, exclusive of seamen, 
who are supposed to amount to one thousand. There are near forty 
sail of topsail vessels in the harbor, about one-half of which the enemy 
sunk upon different occasions ; about two hundred pieces of cannon, 
nearly one-half of them brass ; a great number of arms, drums, and 
colors are among the trophies of this decisive stroke. The prisoners 
are to be sent into any part of this State, Maryland, or Pennsyl 
vania. The consequences will be extensively beneficial. The 
enemy will immediately be confined to Charleston and New York, 
and reduced to a defensive war of those two posts, for which they 
have not more troops in America than to form adequate garrisons." 

Knox s skill and activity in providing and forwarding 
heavy cannon for the siege of Yorktown caused Washing 
ton to report to the President of Congress that " the 
resources of his genius supplied the deficit of means ; " 
and he was complimented in general orders after the sur 
render, and recommended for promotion. Chastellux, in 
his " Travels in North America," also pays him a high 
compliment. " We cannot," he says, " sufficiently admire 
the intelligence and activity with which he collected from 
different places and transported to the batteries more than 
thirty pieces of cannon and mortars of large calibre, for 
the siege." Again he says: "The artillery \vas always 
very well served, the general incessantly directing it and 
often himself pointing the mortars : seldom did he leave 
the batteries. . . . The English marvelled at the exact 
fire and the terrible execution of the French artillery ; and 
we marvelled no less at the extraordinary progress of the 



CONGRATULATIONS OF GREENE. 73 

American artillery, and at the capacity and instruction of 
the officers. As to General Knox, but one-half has been 
said in commending his military genius. He is a man of 
talent, well instructed, of a buoyant disposition, ingenuous 
and true : it is impossible to know him without esteeming 
and loving him." In a letter to Knox, of March 30, 1782, 
he thus manifests the warmth of his friendship : - 

" My sentiments will always meet yours, and I hope that I shall 
not be excelled in serving America and loving General Knox. 
Let us be brothers in arms, and friends in time of peace. Let the 
alliance between our respective countries dwell in our bosoms, where 
it shall find a perfect emblem of the two powers : in mine, the 
seniority ; in yours, the extent of territory. 

" I depend upon your faith, and pledge my honor that no interest 
in the world can prevail over the warm and firm attachment with 
which I have the honor to be DE CHASTELLUX." 

General Greene thus congratulates his friend upon the 
victory at Yorktown : 

" HEAD-QUARTERS AT THE ROUND 0, 10 Dec. 1781. 

"Mr DEAR FRIEND, Your favor of the 1st November has just 
corne to hand. Whatever sweet things may be said of me, there 
are not less said of you. Colonel Lee, who lately returned from 
the Northern army, says you are the genius of it, and that every 
thing is said of you that you can wish. I will not wound your deli 
cacy by repeating his remarks. Your success in Virginia is brilliant, 
glorious, great, and important. The Commander-in-chief s head is 
all covered with laurels, and yours so shaded with them that one can 
hardly get sight of it. 

" I long to be with you, our spirits are congenial and our prin 
ciples and sentiments the same. A long distance separates, and 
alas ! I fear, with you, we .-hall not have a happy meeting for a long 
time to come. But be assured my esteem and affection are neither 
lessened by time nor distance ; and I hope at some future day, when 
the cannon shall cease to roar, and the olive-branch appears, we 
shall experience a happy meeting. Your great success in Virginia 



74 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

gives me the most flattering hopes that this winter will terminate 
the war. 

" P.S. Don t be surprised if you hear I attempt the siege of 
Charleston ; nor must you be disappointed greatly, should we fail." 

In March, 1782, Knox and Gouverneur Morris were 
appointed commissioners to arrange a cartel for a general 
exchange of prisoners ; to liquidate the expenses of their 
maintenance ; and to provide for their subsistence in 
future. 

They met the British Commissioners General William 
Dalrymple, whom Knox had formerly known as com 
mander of the 14th Regiment in Boston, and Andrew 
Elliot, Esq. at Elizabethtown, N. J., on the 30th ; but the 
differences upon essential points were so great, no arrange 
ment could be effected, notwithstanding the earnest and 
persevering exertions of the American agents. They 
transmitted the account of their proceedings to Washing 
ton, who thus replied : 

; I should do injustice to my own feelings on this occasion if I 
did not express something beyond my bare approbation of the atten 
tion, address, and ability exhibited by you, gentlemen, in the course 
of this tedious and fruitless negotiation. The want of succeeding in 
the great object of your mission does not, however, lessen in my 
estimation the merit which is due to the unwearied assiduity for the 
public good, and the benevolent zeal to alleviate the distresses of 
the unfortunate, which seem to have actuated you on every occasion, 
and for which, I entreat, you will be pleased to accept my most 
cordial t hanks." t 

In the following letter to Washington, Knox refers 
to the obstacles the commissioners had encountered, and 
acknowledges his obligations to him for his promotion as 
a major-general, which took place on the 22d of March, 
1782, dating from 15 November, 1781 : 



APPOINTED TO COMMAND AT WEST POINT. 75 



KNOX TO WASHINGTON. 

" BASKENRIDGE, 21 April, 1782. 

" "We have at last left Elizabethtown. Our stay tliere was 
unreasonably protracted by tlie frequent references to New York. 

"We have very good reason to believe that all the important 
propositions made by us were discussed in New York by a council 
of general officers. . . . Every circumstance we observed tended 
to convince us that we never shall obtain justice or equal treatment 
from the enemy but when [we are] in a situation to demand it. 

..." Your Excellency knows the importance and value of the 
intelligence you obtain through the medium of Elizabethtown. In 
my opinion, nothing but the importance of this would counter 
balance the evils which arise from continuing a post there. If all 
exchanges of prisoners were made by the North River, it would be 
better, and prevent much improper communication, which unavoid 
ably prevails at present. 

"I have received a letter from General Lincoln, informing that 
Congress have been pleased to promote me in the manner most 
flattering to my wishes, founded upon your Excellency s letter from 
Yorktovvn. 

" I cannot express how deeply I am impressed with a sense of 
your kindness, and the favorable point of view in which you have 
regarded my feeble attempts to promote the service of my country. 
I shall ever retain, my dear General, a lively sense of your goodness 
and friendship, and shall be happy indeed if my future conduct shall 
meet with your approbation." 

In July, Knox, who had been inspecting the fortifica 
tions of West Point, informed .Washington by letter of its 
inability to stand a siege, and of the deficiencies in its 
magazines, buildings, &c. ; and, on being appointed to the 
command of that post on Aug. 29, set himself vigorously at 
work to strengthen and complete the works. In his letter 
of instructions, Washington thus evinces his appreciation 
of Knox : "I have so thorough a confidence in you, and 
so well am I acquainted .with your abilities and activity, 
that I think it needless to point out to you the great out 
lines of your duty." 



76 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

The discontent of the army respecting the arrearages of 
its pay was increased by the prospect of its being ere long 
disbanded, without adequate provision by Congress for a 
settlement ; and it manifested itself in audible murmurs 
and complaints, which threatened serious consequences. 

In December, 1782, a committee of officers was chosen 
to draft an address and petition to Congress. This was 
drawn up by Knox, its chairman, and contained a state 
ment of the amounts due them ; a proposal that the half- 
pay for life should be commuted for a specific sum ; and a 
request that security should be given by the government 
for the fulfilment of its engagements. 

General McDougall, with Colonels Brooks and Ogden, 
were deputed to bear this memorial to Congress, which 
body, in January, 1783, passed resolves concerning it, 
indefinite in their character and unsatisfactory to the 
officers. The disappointment and irritation felt at this 
result produced the famous " Newburg Addresses," by 
which the feelings of the officers were wrought up to 
the highest pitch. 

At this point the strenuous exertions of Knox were 
joined with those of Washington, in composing the dis 
contented and mutinous spirit which appeared ; and at 
the meeting of officers held March 15th, at which Wash 
ington by a patriotic and impressive address allayed the 
storm which threatened the peace of the country, Knox 
moved the resolutions thanking him for the course he had 
pursued and expressive of their unabated attachment, and 
also declaring their unshaken reliance on the good faith of 
Congress and their country, and a determination to bear 
with patience their grievances till, in due time, they should 
be redressed. The subject was again considered in Con 
gress, and the commutation and other provisions asked for 
in the memorial were granted. 



DISCONTENT OF THE AKMY. 77 

The extracts from Knox s letters, given below, present a 
faithful picture of his sentiments and those of the army 
upon this subject, and upon the still more important one, 
a stronger and more responsible government. 

TO GENERAL LINCOLN. 

" 20 Dec. 1782. 

" I am, and I believe the whole army are, perfectly in sentiment 
with you respecting a commutation of half-pay. The accounts up 
to the present period ought to be settled by somebody. The State 
settlement for the reasons you have given must be preferable. The 
expectations of the army, from the drummer to the highest officers, 
are so keen for some pay, that I shudder at the idea of their not 
receiving it. The utmost period of sufferance upon that head has 
arrived. To attempt to lengthen it will undoubtedly occasion com 
motions. The gentlemen sent with the address have been unable 
to raise the money for their expenses, until yesterday. The army 
will have anxious moments until they shall know the result." 

TO GOUVERNEUR MORRIS. 

" 21 Feb. 1783. 

" The army generally have always reprobated the idea of being 
thirteen armies. Their ardent desires have been to be one conti 
nental body looking up to one sovereign. This would have pre 
vented much heart-burning at the partialities which have been 
practised by the respective States. They know of no way of bring 
ing this about, at a period when peace appears to be in full view. 
Certain it is they are good patriots, and would forward any thing 
that would tend to produce union, and a permanent general consti 
tution ; . . . but they must be directed in the mode by the proper 
authority. 

"It is a favorite toast in the army, A hoop to the barrel, or 
Cement to the Union. America will have fought and bled to little 
purpose if the powers of government shall be insufficient to preserve 
the peace, and this must be the case without general funds. As 
the present Constitution is so defective, why do not you great men 
call the people together and tell them so ; that is, to have a conven 
tion of the States to form a better Constitution ? This appears to us, 

11 



78 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

who have a superficial view only, to be the more efficacious remedy. 
Let something be done before a peace takes place, or we shall be 
in a worse situation than we were at the commencement of the 
war." 

TO GENERAL MCDOUGALL. 

" WEST POINT, 21 Feb. 1783. 

" I received the report signed by you and Colonel Ogden, copies 
of which have been distributed to the different parts of the army. 
The business, instead of being brought to a close, seems more re 
mote from a decision than it was before the application to Congress. 
The complex system of government operates most powerfully in 
the present instance against the army, who certainly deserve every 
thing in the power of a grateful people to give. 

" We are in an unhappy predicament indeed, not to know who 
are responsible to us for a settlement of accounts. 

" Posterity will hardly believe that an army contended incessantly 
for eight years under a constant pressure of misery to establish the 
liberties of their country, without knowing who were to compensate 
them or whether they were ever to receive any reward for their 
services. It is high time that we should, now we have a prospect 
of peace, know whether the respective States or the whole, aggre 
gately, are to recognize our dues and to place them upon such prin 
ciples as to promise some future benefit. Much has been said about 
the influence of the army : ... it can only exist in one point, that 
to be sure is a sharp point, which I hope in God will never be 
directed but against the enemies of the liberties of America. . . . 

" It will take much time to change or amend the present form [of 
government] : must our accounts, therefore, remain unsettled until 
this shall have been considered and decided upon ? I think not. 

" My sentiments are exactly these. I consider the reputation of 
the American army as one of the most immaculate things on earth, 
and that we should even suffer wrongs and injuries to the utmost 
verge of toleration rather than sully it in the least degree. But 
there is a point beyond which there is no sufferance. I pray sin 
cerely we may not pass it. ... I have not taken the sense of the 
army upon your report ; that is, I have not called any number of 
officers together upon this subject, because, as no decision has been 
made, nothing they can say will, in the least, forward the matter. I 
ardently wish you may be able to fix the rate of commutation, and 






OPPOSES VIOLENT MEASURES. 79 

have a person appointed to settle the accounts of the army, and then 
have a reference to the respective States, to become responsible for 
the sums which may be found due upon both principles of accounts 
and commutation of half-pay. 

" You will readily perceive I mean this as a private letter, nay, 
more, a confidential one." 

TO THE SAME. 

" WEST POINT, 3 March, 1783. 

" The army are impatiently waiting the result of your mission. 
I earnestly wish it may produce more than it at present seems to 
promise. I am certain nothing is wanting on your part to bring 
the matter to a happy termination. It is enough to sicken one 
to observe how light a matter many States make of their not being 
represented in Congress, a good proof of the badness of the 
present Xkuistitution^ 

" Your view of the sentiments of the people on a prospect of 
peace is a just representation of what we are to expect after that 
event. However, let them first do the army justice, and we shall 
demand a very small pittance of their gratitude, and little shall we 
find it. 

To McDougall he again writes on the 12th, two days 
after the appearance of the " Newburg Addresses : " 

" I sincerely hope we shall not be influenced to actions which 
may be contrary to our uniform course of service for eight years. 
The men who, by their illiberality and injustice drive the army to 
the very brink of destruction, ought to be punished with severity. 

" The measures we can take to remedy our evils are not known 
to me. I know not how by any violence we can obtain a settle 
ment of accounts, arid have the half-pay placed upon proper prin 
ciples, except by the applications we have made. Endeavor, my 
dear friend, once more to convince the obdurate of the awful evils 
which may arise from postponing a decision on the subjects of our 
address." 

TO GENERAL LINCOLN. 

" WEST POINT, 3 March, 1783. 

"I most earnestly conjure you to urge that every thing respect 
ing the army be decided upon before peace takes place. No time 



80 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

ought to be lost. Let the public only comply with their own prom 
ises, and the army will return to their respective homes the lambs 
and bees of the community. But if they should be disbanded pre 
vious to a settlement, without knowing who to look to for an adjust 
ment of accounts and a responsibility of payment, they will be so 
deeply stung by the injustice and ingratitude of their country as to 
become its tigers and wolves." 

And again, on the 12th: 

"The officers are waiting impatiently the result of General 
McDougall s mission. Their impatience is almost heightened into 
despair. Papers have been distributed by unknown persons, call 
ing the body of the officers together yesterday in the new building, 
accompanied by an address calculated to rouse the officers to re 
dress their own grievances. The Commander-in-chief requested 
that the meeting might be postponed until next Saturday. What 
will be the result, God only knows. Congress ought not to lose a 
moment in bringing the affairs of the army to a decision. Push the 
matter instantly, my dear sir, with all your might and main." 

On the 16th he writes : 

"The meeting was had yesterday. The occasion, though in 
tended for opposite purposes, has been one of the happiest circum 
stances of the war, and will set the military character of America 
in a high point of view. If the people have the most latent spark 
of gratitude, this generous proceeding of the army must call it forth. 
For these reasons, I think the proceedings ought to be published. 
Can you not have this done immediately? If so, forward some 
hundred copies to the army. The General s address is a masterly 
performance." 

It was at this time that Knox, in order to perpetuate 
the friendships formed by the officers of the army, so soon 
to be disbanded, and at the same time to create a fund for 
their indigent widows and orphans, founded the Society of 
the Cincinnati, each officer upon joining contributing to 



FOUNDS THE CINCINNATI SOCIETY. 81 

its treasury one month s pay. Washington was chosen 
its President, and Knox Secretary ; and the French ad 
mirals, generals, and colonels who had served in America 
were also constituted members. 

Its Institution, which was the work of Knox, was car 
ried into effect, with some slight amendments, in May, 
1783. One of its features aroused considerable hostilit} -, 
and gave rise to much discussion. This was the provision 
by which the eldest male heir succeeded to a vacant mem 
bership, and which was vehemently assailed as introducing 
an order of nobility into the republic. Time has refuted 
the calumnies to which the Society was subjected ; and its 
career of beneficence, still active, testifies to the wisdom 
as well as to the benevolence of its founder. Knox con 
tinued its secretary until the year 1800, and in 1805 
became vice-president. He was also vice-president of the 
Massachusetts branch in 1783. 

Knox had been left by Washington in command of the 
army on August 26, and in November he began the deli 
cate and arduous task of disbanding it. The evacuation of 
New York by the enemy gave rise to the following cor 
respondence between the respective commanders : 

WASHINGTON TO KNOX. 

" ROCKY HILL, 23 Oct. 1783. 

" The arrival of the definitive treaty and the evacuation of New 
York have been so long delayed as to interfere very materially with 
our arrangements for the celebration of peace. ... I think, there 
fore, that it will be best to defer it until the British leave the city, 
and then to have it at that place, where all who choose to attend 
can find accommodation. 

" Sir Guy Carleton some time since informed me, through Mr. 
Parker, that he should leave New York, in all, next month, prob 
ably by the 20th ; and that when the transports which were gone 
to Nova Scotia returned, he should be able to fix the day. This 



82 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

notice may be short ; and, as it is best to be prepared, I wish you to 
confer on the subject with Governor Clinton, and have every neces 
sary arrangement made for taking possession of the city on their 
leaving it. You will please to report to me the arrangements you 
may agree on. 

" Enclosed I transmit you copy of a proclamation of Congress for 
the dissolution of the army : you will please to publish it to the 
troops under your orders." 

KNOX TO SIR GUY CARLETON. 

" WEST POINT, 9 Nov. 1783. 

" SIR, By your Excellency s verbal message, transmitted 
through Mr. Parker to his Excellency General Washington, ex 
pressing your expectations of being able to withdraw his Brittauic 
Majesty s troops from New York in the course of the present month ; 
and by recent reports from there, it appears probable that the period 
is fixed for that event. In this case, I flatter myself your Excel 
lency will see how necessary it may be for the protection of the 
city and its inhabitants, that it should be immediately occupied by 
some American forces. I have received his Excellency General 
Washington s directions on this head, and I have consulted with his 
Excellency Governor Clinton, who is too unwell to take any meas 
ures himself, but is exceedingly desirous that every arrangement 
should be made which would induce to good order until the civil 
authority of the State should be established. 

" Having the command of the military in this quarter, and being 
assured of your Excellency s perfect disposition to insure the safety 
of the city, I have taken the liberty to address you upon this point, 
and to request the honor that you would favor me in season with 
the information of the precise time when you may please to relin 
quish the jurisdiction of the posts now in your possession, as the 
troops for the before-mentioned purpose would principally be drawn 
from the neighborhood of this post. I hope it will be a sufficient 
apology for requesting five or six days notice previous to the em 
barkation of the last of your corps. 

" Captain Lillie, my aide-de-camp, will have the honor to deliver 
this letter and receive your Excellency s answer." 



EVACUATION OF NEW YORK. 83 



SIR GUY CARLETON TO KNOX. 

" NEW YORK, 12 Nov. 1783. 

" SIR, I have this day communicated to his Excellency General 
Washington, by letter, my intention of relinquishing the posts at 
King s Bridge and as far as McGowan s Pass, inclusive, on this 
Island on the 21st instant; to resign the possession of Herrick s 
and Hampstead with all to the eastward on Long Island, on the 
same day ; and, if possible, to give up this city with Brooklyn on 
the day following, and Paulus Hook, Dennys s, arid Staten Island 
as soon after as may be practicable, reserving only with respect to 
New York that, if any of our ships should happen to want repairs 
after the town is evacuated, we shall still have the free and unin 
terrupted use of the Ship Yard, under the direction of such officer 
as the Admiral shall appoint, as long as it may be requisite for that 
purpose. 

" Major Beckwith, my oldest aide-de-camp, who waits upon you 
with this letter, will communicate such other particulars as may be 
necessary for your further information." 

On the 25th of November the British army evacuated 
the city ; and Knox, at the head of the American troops, 
took possession. The principal officers of the army yet 
remaining in service assembled, on Dec. 4, at Fraunce s 
Tavern to take a final leave of their beloved chief. Wash 
ington entered tbe room where they were all Availing, and 
taking a glass of wine in his hand he said, " With a heart 
full of love and gratitude I now take leave of you. I most 
devoutly wish that your latter days may be as prosperous 
and happy as your former ones have been glorious and 
honorable." Having drunk, he continued : " I cannot 
come to each of you to take my leave, but shall be obliged 
to you if each will come and take me by the hand." Knox 
who stood nearest to him turned and grasped his hand ; 
and while tbe tears flowed down the cheeks of each, the 
Commander-in-chief kissed him. This he did to each of 
his officers, while tears and sobs stifled utterance. 



84 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

Upon his return to West Point, Dec. 18th, Knox was 
officially thanked by Governor Clinton and the Council for 
his attention to the rights of the citizens of the State of 
New York, and for his zeal in preserving peace and good 
order since the evacuation. 

The following letter to Washington explains itself : 

" WEST POINT, 29 Sept. 1783. 

* SIR, I beg leave to state to your Excellency, and through 
you to the honorable Congress, that the unavoidable expenses aris 
ing from the command of this post and its dependencies have 
greatly exceeded any emoluments of office arising from my rank 
in the army ; and that, in order to support my station with some 
propriety, so as not to reflect disgrace upon the public rank I sus 
tain, I have been obliged to make use of my private resources to a 
considerable amount. 

"That it has uniformly been customary, from the peculiar 
expenses of the command, to allow the emoluments of a major- 
general commanding in a separate department, and that said allow 
ance was withdrawn a short time previous to your Excellency s 
ordering me on the command. It may be unnecessary to enter 
into a detail of circumstances which have rendered my com 
mand as expensive as that of my predecessors. It is sufficient 
that I can easily prove that it has been so. I therefore honestly 
hope to have the same compensation. 

u I pray that your Excellency would have the goodness to place 
this request before Congress in the manner that you may think it 
deserves." 

In consequence of this application, Congress, on the 
30th of October, allowed him the pay of a major-general in 
a separate department, during his command at West Point. 
This gave him an additional sum of ninety dollars per 
month from Sept. 1st, 1782, amounting to $1,350. He 
retained command of that post until early in January, 
1784. 

With Washington he continued to keep up an active 



MASTER GENERAL OF ORDNANCE. 85 

correspondence, which terminated only with the death of 
his chief, whose efforts were not wanting when, as in the 
present case, it seemed likely that they could be of service 
to his friend who desired to continue to serve his country 
in the capacity in which he could be most useful. 

KNOX TO WASHINGTON. 

" WEST POINT, 17 Sept. 1783. 

"My DEAR GENERAL, I canuot refrain from communicating 
the joy I feel, and the pleasure manifested by the officers in gen 
eral, upon the noble testimony of gratitude exhibited by Congress 
in their resolve concerning the Equestrian Statue. This permanent 
evidence of their sense of your services will illustrate their virtue 
and honor more than whole columns of panegyric. 

" I am daily solicited for information respecting the progress 
of the officers petition for a new State westward of the Ohio. 
. . . Were the prayer of the petition to be granted, the officers 
in a very few years would make the finest settlement on the fron 
tiers, and form a strong barrier against the barbarians. 

" I have had it in contemplation for a long time past, to mention 
to your Excellency the idea of a master general of ordnance. But I 
hesitated, and finally declined it in my last opinion to you upon 
a peace establishment, lest it might be concluded that I was endeav 
oring to create a post for myself. But the resignation of the min 
ister of war eventual upon the definitive treaty of peace, and his 
opinion that no successor will be appointed, joined to the necessity 
of having some person responsible to Congress, seem to combine to 
render such an officer peculiarly necessary, who should principally 
reside near Congress to execute orders as they should think proper 
for the dignity or security of the republic. It is a well-known 
fact that so complex and extensive a business as the formation 
of an ordnance and its numerous dependencies, the manufacture of 
small arms and accoutrements, must be the work of much time, and 
can only be effectually prepared in profound peace. 

" Congress have evinced so much wisdom and magnanimity in 
their conduct, that it cannot be doubted that they will make the 
most substantial arrangements for future exigencies consistent with 
their revenues and the nicest economy. 

12 



86 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

" The abundant experience I have had of your Excellency s 
kindness and friendship has induced me to communicate this in 
confidence. &gt;I beg leave at the same time to remark, that, although 
my expectations and wishes are for private life, yet if any office 
similar to the above should be formed upon the broad scale of 
national policy, I might, if thought worthy, find it convenient to 
give it my zealous assistance. I mention this matter more readily 
from a remembrance of your favorable recommendations for the 
office of Secretary at War." 

WASHINGTON TO KNOX. 

" ROCKY HILL, 2d Nov. 1783. 

" General Lincoln s resignation has been offered, and accepted by 
Congress. ... I have conversed with several members of Congress 
upon the propriety, in time of peace, of uniting the offices of Secre 
tary at War and Master of Ordnance in one person, and letting him 
hav.e the command of the troops on the peace establishment, not as 
an appendage of right, for that I think would be wrong, but by 
separate appointment at the discretion of Congress. Those I have 
spoken to on the subject seem to approve the idea, which, if adopted, 
would make a handsome appointment. I will converse with others 
on this head, and let you know the result. My wishes to serve you 
in it you need not doubt, being with much truth 

" Your most affectionate 

" GEORGE WASHINGTON." 

KNOX TO WASHINGTON. 

" WEST POINT, 3d Jan. 1784. 

..." I have discharged all the troops but those specified in the 
enclosed return. I believe I did not mention to your Excellency 
my ideas of the pay for the offices that might be associated ; viz., 
the duties of the Secretary at War, Master of Ordnance, and 
charge or command of any troops which might be retained in ser 
vice. It appears to me, and I hope that I fairly estimate the 
expenses and trouble, that the pay and emoluments of a major- 
general in a separate department free of any encumbrances would 
not be an unreasonable appointment. Should Congress think 
proper to honor me with an offer of these offices associated together, 
I should be willing to accept them upon the above terms ; but I 



COMMISSIONER TO THE PENOBSCOT INDIANS. 87 

should do injustice to myself and family to accept of any employ 
ment which would not prevent my involving myself. 

" Having brought the affairs here nearly to a close, I shall soon 
depart for Boston, for which place Mrs. Knox and her little family 
set out from New York on the 10th ult. I should do violence to 
the dictates of my heart were I to suppress its sensations of affec 
tion and gratitude to you for the innumerable instances of your 
kindness and attention to me. And, although I can find no words 
equal to their warmth, I may venture to assure you that they will 
remain indelibly fixed. I devoutly pray the Supreme Being to con 
tinue to afford you his especial protection." 

In January r 1784, Knox arrived at Boston, and took up 
his residence in Dorchester.* 

With General Lincoln and George Partridge he was in 
June appointed by the General Court of Massachusetts a 
commissioner to treat with the Penobscot Indians, in order 
to induce them to relinquish their lands from the head of 
the tide forty miles up the river. They were also in 
structed to examine whether the people under the govern 
ment of Nova Scotia had encroached upon the territories 
of Massachusetts, and to settle the Eastern boundary line, 
a dispute having arisen as to which was the river St. Croix 
intended by the treaty with Great Britain. The commis 
sioners having performed the duty assigned them made 
their report a few months later. 

From Paris La Fayette writes to Knox on Jan. 8, 
1784 : - 

" It has been to me a great happiness to hear from you ; and while 
we are separated, I beg you will let me enjoy it as often as possible. 
You know my tender affection for you, my dear Kuox, is engraved 

* The house in which Knox lived may still be seen a short distance 
beyond the Second Congregational Church, on the upper road to Milton. It 
was formerly owned by a Mr. Jones. It has long been the property of the 
Welles family, bankers of Boston and Paris, and was for one or more years 
the summer residence of Daniel Webster. r 



88 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

in my heart, and I shall keep it as long as I live. From the begin 
ning of our great Revolution, which has been the beginning of our 
acquaintance, we have been actuated by the same principles, im 
pressed with the same ideas, attached to the same friends, and we 
have warmly loved and confidentially intrusted each other. The 
remembrance of all this is dear to my heart ; and from every motive 
of tenderness and regard, I set the greater value by the happiness 
of your possession as a bosom friend. I have been much employed 
in rendering America what service I could in the affairs of her 
commerce. What I can do must be entirely done before the spring, 
when 1 intend embarking for my beloved shores of Liberty. My 
delays in Europe are owing to motives of American public ser 
vice. . . . Dunkirk, L Orient, Bayonne, and Marseilles have been 
declared free ports of America." 

When the gallant Frenchman visited Boston in October, 
1784, he was met at Watertown, on the 15th, by a number 
of the officers of the late continental army, headed by 
Knox ; and together they sat down to an elegant repast 
provided for the occasion. On the following day he was 
waited on by them with an address by Knox, to which the 
marquis made a suitable reply. A more general welcome 
was extended by the citizens on the 19th, when a public 
dinner, was given in his honor, at Faneuil Hall, at which 
many persons of distinction, among them seventy-five 
officers of the Revolutionary army, were present. 

Congress having, on March 4, 1785, fixed the salary of 
the Secretary of War for the future at $2,450, proceeded 
on the 8th to elect Knox to that office. He thus replies 
to the letter of the Secretary notifying him of his elec 
tion : 

TO CHARLES THOMSON, ESQ., SECRETARY OF CONGRESS. 

" BOSTON, 17 March, 1785. 

" SIR, I have had the pleasure to receive your favor of the 
9th instant, informing of the honor conferred on me by the 



APPOINTED SECRETARY OF WAR. 89 

United States in Congress assembled, in electing me Secretary of 
War, and enclosing the ordinance for ascertaining the powers and 
duties of the office, the act establishing the salary, and the minute 
of the election. 

" I have the most grateful sentiments to Congress for this distin 
guishing mark of their confidence ; and I shall, according to the best 
of my abilities, attempt to execute the duties of the office. I shall 
have a perfect reliance upon a candid interpretation of my actions, 
and I shall hope that application to business and propriety of inten 
tion may, in a degree, excuse a deficiency of talents. 

" My affairs here will require my personal attention the latter end 
of May and beginning of June, and I hope to be indulged with a 
few weeks absence at that time, provided it can be granted without 
public injury. In the mean time, I shall endeavor to be at New 
York about the 12th of next month." 

And from Boston he wrote to Washington on the 24th, 
acquainting him with his appointment, from which letter 
we extract as follows: 

" You may probably have heard that Congress have been pleased 
to appoint me Secretary at War. I have accepted the appointment, 
and shall expect to be in New York about the 15th of next month. 
From the habits imbibed during the war, and from the opinion of 
my friends that I should make but an indifferent trader, I thought, 
upon mature consideration, that it was well to accept it, although 
the salary would be but a slender support. I have dependence upon 
an unwieldy estate of Mrs. Knox s family, and upon the public cer 
tificates given for my services ; but neither of these is productive, 
and require a course of years to render them so. In the mean time, 
my expenses are considerable, and require some funds for their sup 
ply. Congress have rendered the powers and duties of the office 
respectable ; and the circumstances of my appointment, without 
solicitation on my part, were nattering, nine States out of eleven 
voting for me. I do not expect to move my family to New York 
until June next." 

Washington in reply, under date of June 18th, says : 
" Without a compliment, I think a better choice could not 
have been made." 



90 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

It is impossible to read without emotion the following 
lines from a letter written by General Greene a short time 
before his death, which occurred on June 19th. It bears 
Knox s indorsement : " This is the last letter I ever 
received from my truly beloved friend, General Greene." 
The first paragraph refers to two pieces of cannon pre 
sented to him by order of Congress, upon which Knox had 
caused appropriate inscriptions to be engraved. Its closing 
request received Knox s earnest and friendly attention : 

" MULBERRY GROVE, 12 March, 1786. 

" I thank you for the polite attention you are paying to my pub 
lic trophies ; but I have been so embarrassed and perplexed in my 
private affairs for a long time past, which originated in the progress 
of the war, that I have but little spirit or pleasure on such subjects. 
My family is in distress, and I am overwhelmed with difficulties ; 
and God knows when or where they will end. I work hard and 
live poor, but I fear all this will not extricate me. . . . Please to 
give me your opinion upon sending George [his son] to the Marquis 
La Fayette, agreeable to his request. Let your answer be as candid 
as I trust your friendship is sincere." 

The disturbances in Massachusetts having assumed a 
serious aspect, in October we find Knox at Springfield, 
providing for the security of the arsenal there. To a 
request from General Shepard of the State militia for per 
mission to use the arms and stores of the United States 
there collected, Knox replies on Jan. 27, 1787, that in case 
the insurgents should demonstrate an intention of seizing 
the arsenal or any of the stores, and it could not other 
wise be successfully defended, " part might be taken for 
the protection of the remainder, to be returned the instant 
the danger should subside." 

With Washington, Rufus King, Stephen Higginson, 
General Lincoln, Nathaniel Gorham, and other prominent 
Federalists, he kept up an active correspondence ; and 
in the letters which follow he describes vividly the state 



TROUBLES IN MASSACHUSETTS. 91 

of feeling in Massachusetts, during the period of Shays s 
insurrection, the formation of the Federal Constitution 
and its adoption by that State, a period of intense excite 
ment, especially to one possessing his ardent temper and 
strong convictions upon the great questions at issue. 

TO WASHINGTON. 

" NEW YORK, 23 Oct. 178G. 

..." I have lately been far eastward of Boston on private busi 
ness, and was no sooner returned here than the commotions in Mas 
sachusetts hurried me back to Boston on a public account. 

" Our political machine, composed of thirteen independent sover 
eignties, have been perpetually operating against each other and 
against the federal head ever since the peace. The powers of Con 
gress are totally inadequate to preserve the balance between the 
respective States, and oblige them to do those things which are 
essential for their own welfare or for the general good. The frame 
of mind in the local legislatures seems to be exerted to prevent the- 
federal constitution from having any good effect. The machine 
works inversely to the public good in all its parts : not only is State 
against State, and all against the federal head, but the States within 
themselves possess the name only without having the essential con 
comitant of government, the power of preserving the peace, the pro 
tection of the liberty and property of the citizens. On the very 
first impression of faction and licentiousness, the fine theoretic 
government of Massachusetts has given way, and its laws [are] 
trampled under foot. Men at a distance, who have admired our 
systems of government unfounded in nature, are apt to accuse the 
rulers, and say that taxes have been assessed too high and collected 
too rigidly. This is a deception equal to any that has been hitherto 
entertained. That taxes may be the ostensible cause is true, but 
that they are the true cause is as far remote from truth as light from 
darkness. The people who are the insurgents have never paid any or 
but very little taxes. But they see the weakness of government : they 
feel at once their own poverty compared with the opulent, and their 
own force, and they are determined to make use of the latter in 
order to remedy the former. 

" Their creed is, that the property of the United States has been 



92 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

protected from the confiscations of Britain by the joint exertions of 
all, and therefore ought to be the common property of all ; and he 
that attempts opposition to this creed is an enemy to equality and 
justice, and ought to be swept from the face of the earth. In a 
word, they are determined to annihilate all debts public arid private, 
and have agrarian laws, which are easily effected by the means of 
unfunded paper money, which shall be a tender in all cases what 
ever. The numbers of these people may amount, in Massachusetts, 
to one-fifth part of several populous counties ; and to them may be 
added the people of similar sentiments from the States of Rhode 
Island, Connecticut, and New Hampshire, so as to constitute a body 
of twelve or fifteen thousand desperate and unprincipled men. They 
are chiefly of the young and active part of the community, more 
easily collected than kept together afterwards. But they will prob 
ably commit overt acts of treason, which will compel them to embody 
for their own safety. Once embodied, they will be constrained to 
submit to discipline for the same reason. 

" Having proceeded to this length, for which they are now ripe, 
we shall have a formidable rebellion against reason, the principle of 
all government, and against the very name of liberty. 

" This dreadful situation, for which our government have made 
no adequate provision, has alarmed every man of principle and prop 
erty in New England. They start as from a dream, and ask what 
can have been the cause of our delusion ? What is to give us 
security against the violence of lawless men? Our government 
must be braced, changed, or altered to secure our lives and property. 
We imagined that the mildness of our government and the wishes 
of the people were so correspondent that we were not as other 
nations, requiring brutal force to support the laws. 

u But we find that we are men, actual men, possessing all the 
turbulent passions belonging to that animal, and that we must have 
a government proper and adequate for him. 

" The people of Massachusetts, for instance, are far advanced in 
this doctrine, and the men of property and the men of station and 
principle there are determined to endeavor to establish and protect 
them in their lawful pursuits ; and, what will be efficient in all cases 
of internal commotions or foreign invasions, they mean that lib 
erty shall form the basis, liberty resulting from an equal and firm 
administration of law. 



WANTED, A STRONG GOVERNMENT. 93 

" They wish for a general government of unity, as they see that 
the local legislatures must naturally and necessarily tend to retard 
the general government. We have arrived at that point of time in 
which we are forced to see our own humiliation, as a nation, and 
^that a progression in this line cannot be productive of happiness, 
private or public. Something is wanting, and something must be 
done, or we shall be involved in all the horror of failure, and civil 
war without a prospect of its termination^ Every friend to the 
liberty of his country is bound to reflect, and step forward to pre 
vent the dreadful consequences which shall result from a govern 
ment of events. Unless this is done, we shall be liable to be ruled 
by an arbitrary and capricious armed tyranny, whose word and will 
must be law. 

"The Indians on our frontiers are giving indisputable evidence of 
their hostile intentions. Congress, anxiously desirous of meeting 
the evils on the frontiers, have unanimously agreed to augment the 
troops now in service to a legionary corps of 2,040 men. This 
measure is important, and will tend to strengthen the principles of 
government, if necessary, as well as to defend the frontiers. I 
mention the idea of strengthening government as confidential. But 
the State of Massachusetts requires the greatest assistance, and 
Congress are fully impressed with the importance of supporting 
her with great exertions." 

TO STEPHEN HIGGINSON. 

" NEW YORK, 28th Jan. 1787. 

" The zeal of the people of Boston and the lower country in favor 
of government is a good sign, and will probably produce the results 
expected from it. But, supposing the present disorders quieted, 
some measures will be necessary to prevent a repetition of them. 
Although the patriotism of individuals may restore [to] government 
its former tone, some more certain principle than zeal will be re 
quisite to retain it. Massachusetts, by an exertion in the present 
instance, may even acquire a temporary vigor ; but the poor, poor 
federal government is sick almost unto death. 

" But one feeble sign of life for upwards of two, almost three 
months past. No Congress but for part of one day. How things 
are to be worked up so as to produce by its ordinary operations a 
remedy for the numerous existing disorders, or be made adequate to 

13 



94 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

the great purposes of a nation, which, considering its vast resources, 
ought to be a dignified one, it is difficult, if not impossible, to con 
jecture. 

" A convention is proposed by Virginia, and acceded to by Penn 
sylvania, Jersey, probably New York and South Carolina, to consult 
on some plan to prevent our utter ruin. Perhaps this convention 
originated, and has been imbued with ideas, far short of a radical 
reform. Let this have been the case, may it notwithstanding be 
turned to an excellent purpose ? Our views are limited in all things, 
we can only see from point to point at a time. If men great 
men are sent to the convention, might they not assist the vision of 
the Southern delegates in such a manner as to induce the adoption 
of some energetic plan, in the prosecution of which we might rise to 
national dignity and happiness ? 

" Should the convention agree on some continental constitution, 
and propose the great outlines, either through Congress, or directly 
to their constituents, the respective legislatures, with a request that 
State conventions might be assembled for the sole purpose of choos 
ing delegates to a continental convention in order to consider and 
decide upon a general government, and to publish it for general 
observance in the same manner as Congress formed and decided 
upon the articles of confederation and perpetual union, would not 
this, to all intents and purposes, be a government derived from the 
people and assented to by them as much as they assented to the 
confederation ? If it be not the best mode, is it not the best which 
is practicable ? If so, one would conclude that it ought to be em 
braced. 

" The Southern States are jealous enough already. If New Eng 
land, and particularly Massachusetts, should decline sending delegates 
to the convention, it will operate in a duplicate ratio to injure us by 
annihilating the rising desire in the Southern States of effecting 
a better national system, and by adding to their jealousies of the 
designs of New England. 

" I have dwelt on this subject to you, in order that if your senti 
ments should correspond with mine, that you should influence a 
choice of delegates of such characters as would possess the ability 
of pointing out the road to national glory and felicity." 



FEDERAL CONVENTION PROPOSED. 95 



TO GENERAL LINCOLN. 

"NEW YORK, 14 Feb. 1787. 

" While I thank you for your kind communication of the 5th 
inst., I most heartily congratulate you on the successful events con 
tained therein [the suppression of the Shays] insurrection. Were 
not your military reputation already highly established, your ma 
noeuvres would have elevated it ; but, circumstanced as you are in 
the opinion of your friends and the world, Shays s rebellion is not a 
field in which you could gather fresh laurels. It will be a sufficient 
satisfaction to you that you have dissipated a cloud that threatened 
a violent storm. 

"The convention proposed by the commercial convention last 
September, to meet in Philadelphia in May next, engrosses a great 
portion of the attention of the men of reflection. Some are for 
and some against it; but the preponderance of opinion is for it. 
None of the New England States have yet chosen, arid it appears 
quite problematical whether any will choose unless Massachusetts. 
The convention will be at liberty to consider more diffusively the 
defects of the present system than Congress can, who are the exec 
utors of a certain system. If what they should think proper to 
propose, after mature deliberation, should require the assent of the 
people of the respective States, which is supposed necessary in an 
original compact, the convention would recommend to the respective 
legislatures to call State conventions for the sole purpose of choos 
ing delegates to represent them in a continental convention, in order 
to consider and finally decide on a general constitution, and to pub 
lish the same for observance. If a differently constructed repub 
lican government should be the object, the shortest road to it will be 
found to be the convention. I hope, therefore, that Massachusetts 
will choose, and that you, Mr. King, and Mr. Higginson should be 
three of the delegates." 

TO RUFUS KING. 

"NEW YORK, 15th July, 1787. 

" I am happy the convention continue together without agitating 
the idea of adjournment. If their attempts should prove inadequate 
to effect capital alterations, yet experience will be gained, which may 
serve important purposes on another occasion. 



96 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

"The conduct of France in .establishing provincial assemblies is 
seized with great eagerness by the advocates for the State systems, 
as a reason against any alterations. But they do not bring into 
view the strong cement of the royal authority supported by 200,000 
soldiers. 

" The State systems are the accursed thing which will prevent our 
being a nation. The democracy might be managed, nay, it would 
remedy itself after being sufficiently fermented ; but the vile State 
governments are sources of pollution, which will contaminate the 
American name perhaps for ages. Machines that must produce ill, 
but cannot produce good, smite them in the name of God and 
the people. 

"Eight States in Congress, they yesterday passed with great 
unanimity a system of government for the western territory." 

TO LA FAYETTE. 

" NEW YORK, 24 Oct. 1787. 

" You will have received, long before this period, the result of 
the convention which assembled in Philadelphia during the month 
of May. These propositions being essentially different in many 
respects from the existing confederation, and which will probably 
produce different national effects, are contemplated by the public at 
large with an anxious attention. The discussions are commenced 
in the newspapers and in pamphlets, with all the freedom and liber 
ality which characterize a people who are searching, by their own 
experience, after a form of government most productive of hap 
piness. To speak decisively at this moment of the fate of the 
proposed constitution, characterizes effectually the person giving the 
opinion. Habituated as I have been for a long time to desire the con 
solidation of the powers of all parts of this country, as an indispen 
sable requisite to national character and national happiness, I receive 
the propositions as they are, and from my soul I wish them God 
speed ! The transition from wishing an event, to believing that it 
will happen, is easy indeed. I therefore am led to a strong per 
suasion that the proposed government will be generally or univer 
sally adopted in the course of twelve or fifteen months. 

" In desiring that the proposed government may be adopted, I 
would not have you believe that I think it all perfect. There are 
several things in it that I confess I could wish to see altered. But 



STATE OF PARTIES IN MASSACHUSETTS. 97 

I apprehend no alterations can he effected peaceably. All the 
States represented agreed to the constitution as it stands. There 
are substantial reasons to believe that such an agreement could not 
again be produced even by the same men." 

TO WASHINGTON. 

" NEW YORK, 14 Jan. 1788. 

"The Massachusetts convention were to meet on the 9th. The 
decision of Connecticut will influence, in a degree, their determi 
nation, and I have no doubt the constitution will be adopted ; but 
it is at this moment questionable whether with a large majority. 
There are three parties existing in that State at present, not exceed 
ingly different in their respective numbers, but greatly differing in 
wealth and ability. 

" The first is the commercial part of the State, to whom are added 
all the men of considerable property, the clergy, the lawyers, in 
cluding all the judges of all the courts; and all the officers of the 
late army, and the neighborhood of all the great towns, are of this 
party. Its strength in point of numbers may include three-sevenths 
of the whole State. This party are for the most vigorous govern 
ment. Perhaps many of them would have been more pleased with 
the new constitution, had it been still more analogous to the British 
Constitution,, 

" The second party are the Eastern part of the State, lying beyond 
New Hampshire, and formerly the province of Maine. This party 
are mostly looking toward the erection of a new State ; and the 
majority will adopt or reject the new constitution, as it may facilitate 
or retard their designs, without much regard to the great merits of 
the question. This party may not be far less than two-sevenths of 
the State. 

" The third party are the insurgents and their favorers, the great 
majority of whom are for an annihilation of debts, public and pri 
vate, and therefore cannot approve the new constitution. This 
party may be more than two-sevenths. 

" If the first and second party agree, as will be most probable, and 
also some of the party stated as in the insurgent interest, the con 
stitution will be adopted by a great majority, notwithstanding all 
exertions to the contrary. 

" Mr. Samuel Adams has declared that he will oppose it, to the 

I 



98 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

very great disgust of the people of Bos ton, his constituents. It is 
said Boston was about to take some spirited measures to prevent 
the effect of his opposition. It is probable the debates will be 
lengthy, and that the convention will sit one month before they 
decide." 

The following from Rufus King to Knox slieds new 
light on the history of the adoption of the Federal Con 
stitution in Massachusetts, which event took place on 
February 6th. By it we see that the Federalists in the 
Convention, under the able leadership of Rufus King and 
Theophilus Parsons, secured the support of Governor 
Hancock, who also presided over the deliberations of that 
body, by an adroit appeal to the special foible of the gov 
ernor, vanity. Upon such apparently trivial causes do 
the destinies of nations sometimes turn ! 

" BOSTON, 3 Feb. 1788. 

"DEAR GENERAL, Hancock has committed himself in our 
favor, and will not desert the cause. Saturday s Centinel will 
give you an idea of his plan. The Federalists are. united in that 
system ; and, as Adams has joined us on this plan, we are encour 
aged to think our success is probable. 

" Gerry keeps close at Cambridge, and his adherents have made 
no motion for his recall. Mr. Hancock s propositions were yester 
day committed to a committee of two members from each county : 
they meet to-day, and we hope favorably from their deliberations, 
a majority being Federalists. 

" The final question will probably be taken in five or six days. 
You will be astonished, when you see the list of names, that such a 
union of men has taken place on this question. Hancock will here 
after receive the universal support of Bowdoin s friends, and ice tell 
him that if Virginia does not unite, which is problematical, that he 
is considered as the only fair candidate for President." 

In a letter to La Fayette, dated New York, 26 April, 
1788, Knox, after reciting the facts and probabilities 
respecting the adoption of the Federal Constitution, goes 
on to say : 



EDUCATION OF GENERAL GREENE S SON. 99 

" As to Rhode Island, no little State of Greece ever exhibited 
greater turpitude than she does. Paper money and Tender Law 
engross her attention entirely : this is, in other words, plundering 
the orphan and widow by virtue of laws. 

" Mrs. Greene and her little family you so kindly inquire after 
are seated at Wethersfield in Connecticut, under the auspices of our 
friend,- Colonel Wadsworth. Mrs. Greene is most honorably and indus 
triously employed in the education of her children. Colonel Wads- 
worth is anxious George should be sent to France, to which Mrs. 
Greene consents. It is possible the young gentleman may be ad 
dressed to your care in the course of one or two packets hence." 

On the 15th of May, he writes to him again upon this 
subject, as follows : 

" Mr. Barlow of Connecticut, author of the poem entitled the 
Vision of Columbus, whom I recommend to your kindness, will 
deliver you this letter, and also he will present to you the son of 
our late esteemed friend, General Greene. 

"I am perfectly impressed with the belief that you will place 
him in such a situation as will at the same time impress the best 
morals and the most enlarged information. 

" The classics and modern languages, as being the work of mem 
ory, will probably constitute his first studies, together with learning 
the necessary personal exercises to form his manners. Mathematics, 
geography, astronomy, and the art of drawing will follow of 
course. 

" I natter myself that, by being entirely removed to a new sphere, 
he will necessarily imbibe the habits^which are in circulation there, 
and that he will be formed on such a* scale as to be an honor to the 
memory of his father, and the pride of his mother and his other 
friends. 

" His disposition is good, and in my opinion, with a proper edu 
cation, he promises to make a worthy character : certain I am that 
under your auspices he will possess the best chances for hap 
piness." 



100 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

One of his early playmates and friends, Rev. David 
McClure, writes as follows : 

" EAST WINDSOR, Dec. 22, 1788. 

"DEAR SIR, On the footing of that juvenile friendship and 
acquaintance with you with which I have been honored, and which 
was kept alive to our riper years, I now do myself the pleasure to 
address a line to you, to assure you of my respectful and affection 
ate remembrance of you, and of the satisfaction with which I some 
times call to mind those scenes of innocent amusement and play 
in which we were mutually engaged when we were boys. 

" I have often thought of our attempts to imitate the man who 
flew from the steeple of the North Church, by sliding down an oar 
from the small buildings in your father s house-yard at Wheeler s 
Point ; and by letting fly little wooden men from the garret win 
dow on strings. Have you forgotten that diversion ? 

" I have often rejoiced with gratitude that the Supreme Disposer 
of all events has preserved you through the dangers you have 
encountered, and made you so great a blessing to your country, for 
whose happiness and glory your labors have been directed. May 
you ever possess that increasing esteem and affection from your coun 
try which your services and merits entitle you to. 

" I am settled agreeably in this place, live miles from Hartford, 
in which I have lived more than two years, and to which I removed 
from my former parish in Hampton, New Hampshire." 

To which Knox replies : 

" NEW YORK, 25 Jan. 1789. 

"Mr DEAR SIR, Your esteemed favor of the 22d ult. gave 
me the most sensible pleasure. Our juvenile sports, and the joy 
ful sensations they excited, are fresh in my mind ; and what to me 
renders the remembrance peculiarly precious is, that I always flat 
tered myself that our hearts and minds were similarly constructed. 

" Our situations, however, have been widely different. You have 
been deeply exploring the natural and moral world, in order to im 
press on the minds of your fellow-mortals their relative connection 
with the great scale of intelligent being ; leading them by all the 
powers of persuasion to happiness and humble adoration of the 



MRS. KNOX A LEADER OF SOCIETY. 101 

Supreme Head of the universe ; while I have been but too much 
entangled with the little things of a little globe. But, as it is part 
of my belief that we are responsible only for the light we possess, 
I hope we have both acted our parts in such a manner as that a 
reflection on the past will give us more pleasure than pain, and that 
we shall possess a well-grounded hope of a happy immortality. 

" My brother William, who is with me, is the only one beside 
myself left of my father s family." * 

During Knox s career as Secretary of War, Mrs. Knox 
was one of the leaders of fashionable society at the seat 
of government, and as such attracted considerable notice. 
From the manuscript Journal of Dr. Manasseh Cutler, 
under date of July 7, 1787, we extract as follows. The 
worthy doctor was evidently unaccustomed to the coiffure 
of the fashionable lady of that day. 

" Dined with General Knox [at New York], introduced to his lady 
and a French nobleman, Marquis Lotbiniere. Several other gentle 
men dined with us. Our dinner was served in high style, much in 
the French taste. Mrs. Knox is very gross, but her manners are 
easy and agreeable. She is sociable, and would be agreeable, were 
it not for her affected singularity in dressing her hair. She seems 
to mimic the military style, which to me is very disgusting in a 
female. Her hair in front is craped at least a foot high, much in 
the form of a churn bottom upward, and topped off with a wire 
skeleton in the same form, covered with black gauze, which hangs 
in streamers down to her back. Her hair behind is a large braid, and 
confined with a monstrous crooked comb." 



* This brother writes from London (26 June, 1783): "I have a very- 
respectable set of acquaintances in this country as well as in France. 
Among the number here is the very respectable and venerable General 
Oglethorpe. I passed Sunday and Monday with his family at their country 
house. He desired me through you to make his very particular compliments 
to General Washington, of whose virtues and talents I have the pleasure to 
find he has the highest opinion." 

William Knox soon afterward became subject to occasional fits of derange 
ment, and died about 1797. 

14 



102 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 



"July 19. 

" Dined with General Knox ; about forty-four gentlemen, officers 
of the late continental army, and among them Baron Steuben. 
General Knox gave us an entertainment in the style of a prince. 
Every gentleman at the table was of the Cincinnati except my 
self, and wore his appropriate badge." 

Mrs. William S. Smith writes from New York in 1788 
to her mother, Mrs. John Adams : 

" General and Mrs. Knox have been very polite and attentive 
to us. Mrs. Knox is much altered from the character she used 
to have. She is neat in her dress, attentive to her family, and very 
fond of her children. But her size is enormous : I am frightened 
when I look at her ; I verily believe that her waist is as large as 
three of yours at least. The general is not half so fat as he was." 

From GriswolcTs " Republican Court " w r e take the fol 
lowing : 

" Mrs. Knox had been one of the heroines of the Revolution, 
nearly as well known in the camp as her husband. She and her 
husband were, perhaps, the largest couple in the city, and both were 
favorites, he for really brilliant conversation and unfailing good 
humor, and she as a lively and meddlesome but amiable leader of 
society, without whose co-operation it was believed by many be 
sides herself that nothing could be properly done in the drawing- 
room or the ball-room, or any place indeed where fashionable men 
and women sought enjoyment. The house of the Secretary was in 
Broadway, and it was the scene of a liberal and genial hospitality." 

Upon the formation of the new government in May, 
1789, Knox was continued in his post of War Secretary 
by Washington.* " To his past services and an unques 
tioned integrity," says Judge Marshall, "he was admitted 
to unite a sound understanding ; and the public judgment 
as well as that of the chief magistrate pronounced him in 

* His commission bears date Sept. 12, 1789. 



PLAN FOR A MILITIA. 103 

all respects competent to the station he filled." One of 
his first acts was to provide for his friend, General Lin 
coln, to whom, on August 4, he wrote as follows : " Al- 
thouoii I do not conceive the office of Collector to the 

o 

Port of Boston adequate to the merits of my friend, yet, 
as it is the best thing that can be offered at present, I 
sincerely congratulate you on the appointment." 

The framing of a militia sj^stem for the country received 
the early attention of the Secretary. He had, in April, 1783, 
communicated to Washington his ideas upon this subject, to 
the effect that there should be a uniform system and annual 
encampments ; each State to have an arsenal and a suffi 
cient quantity of arms and ammunition ; that the United 
States should have some troops for the security of the 
frontiers, and at West Point, " the key to America, which 
has been so advantageous in the defence of the United 

O 

States, and is still so important in that view, as well as of 
preserving the Union ; " that a complete system of military 
education should be formed and adopted ; that there 
should be three military academies where the United States 
arsenals are, one in the Northern, one in the Middle, and 
one in the Southern States ; and that a code of military 
laws should be framed and inspectors appointed by Con 
gress, who should annually examine the academies and 
report to Congress. 

Knox s " Plan for the General Arrangement of the 
Militia of the United States," reported to Congress 18 
March, 1786, provided for the embodiment of all male 
citizens from eighteen to sixty, into three classes, " The 
Advanced Corps," "The Main Corps," and "The Re 
served Corps ; " the form to be that of the legion ; each 
legion to consist of 153 commissioned officers and 2,880 
non-commissioned officers and privates, and to be com 
manded by a major-general. The failure of this plan is 



104 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

partly attributable to the unpropitious circumstances of 
the times. 

Of that prepared by him in January, 1790, similar in its 
general features to the preceding one, his friend, General 
Lincoln, gave him, at his request, this opinion : 

" Though it would make ours the strongest militia in the world, 
the people will not adopt it here, if I know Massachusetts. The ex 
pense, pay of officers, no pay of men, the burden on masters, calling 
the youth indiscriminately, disfranchisement for a time in certain 
cases, officers excluded from actual service, subjection to a draft for 
a service of three years, &c., will be magnified here, and damn the 
bill." 

Colonel Jackson also informed him that his plan was not 
very well received in Massachusetts. The opinion of mili 
tary men abroad seems to have been favorable to Knox s 
plan, as is seen in this extract from a letter from General 
Miranda, the South American patriot, whose acquaintance 
he had made in Boston in 1784 : * 

"LONDON, Feb. 2, 1791. 

" I thank you for your estimable letter of the 6th September, 17 JO, 
that your brother delivered to me here. I am very happy to see 
the flourishing state to which North America is grown, and wish 
that my own poor miserable country in the South could say the 
same. They can only answer : 

* Video meliora prorogue, deteriora sequor. 

" I have seen with great pleasure your plan for the establishment 
of a militia, &c. General Melville, and some other professional men 
here that have considered the same subject, admired it very much ; 
and I perfectly agree with you, that the form of the Roman Legion 

* Francisco de Miranda was born in Caracas about 1750. He travelled on 
foot through a great part of America and Europe ; was a general of division 
under Dumouriez, in 1792-93 ; was afterward engaged in abortive attempts 
to shake off the Spanish yoke from his native province, and having been 
betrayed by Bolivar to the Spaniards ended his days in a dungeon at Cadiz, 
in 1816. 



INDIAN AFFAIRS. 105 

is infinitely superior to any other organization or military arrange 
ment we know yet." 

The legionary formation was for a time adopted as the 
regular establishment of the United States; but the plan 
for the militia, though it had the approval of Washington, 
was not regarded with favor, and a system less onerous as 
well as less energetic was at length adopted. 

The policy to be pursued towards the various Indian 
tribes of the United States demanded a large share of 
Knox s attention, and in it he was guided by enlarged and 
liberal views. In the minutes which he furnished for the 
President s speech, in October, 1791, he advocates an impar 
tial administration of justice towards them, suggests that the 
mode of alienating their lands should be properly defined 
and regulated, and that the advantages of commerce and 
the blessings of civilization should be extended to them ; 
and that proper penalties should be provided for such law 
less persons as shall violate the treaties with them. "A 
system," he goes on to say, " producing the free operation 
of the mild principles of religion and benevolence towards 
an unenlightened race of men would at once be highly 
economical and honorable to the national character." 

A treaty with the Creek Nation of Indians was signed 
on Aug. 7, 1790, by Knox, as sole commissioner, in behalf 
of the United States ; and by Alexander McGillivray and 
twenty-three chiefs, in behalf of the Creek nation, by 
whom an extensive territory claimed by Georgia was re 
linquished to that State. McGillivray was at the same 
time commissioned a brigadier-general in the army of the 
United States. 

The unsuccessful expeditions of Harmar in 1790, and

were followed, in 1794, by the victorious campaign of 
Wayne, and by the treaty of Greenville in August, 1795,

by which peace was established, and the post of Detroit, 
together with a considerable tract of land, ceded to the 
United States. 

The friends of Jefferson then Secretary of State, and 
the partisans of the French Revolution, assailed with malig 
nant hostility the administration of Washington ; and Knox 
as its firm supporter, and while the operations against the 
Indians were yet unsuccessful, came in for a large share of 
vituperation and calumny. Among the many ardent and 
devoted friends of Knox was Major Samuel Shaw, a fel 
low-townsman, and his aide and secretary during the war, 
and who was deservedly held by him in the highest esteem. 
44 When Major Shaw returned [from a foreign voyage], 
in 1792," says his biographer, Hon. Josiah Quincy, " and 
witnessed the assaults party spirit was making upon his 
early patron and constant friend, a man he so loved and 
respected, his indignation, heightened by the sentiment of 
gratitude, was irrepressible, and on April 15th he wrote 
Knox as follows : - 

" What shall we say, my dear friend, to a certain publication, 
which, under the title of i Strictures, fyc.J fabricated in Boston, is 
now circulating here, and no doubt has made its appearance with 
you ? The shameful violation of decency and truth, the virulence 
and rancor of his remarks on the Secretary at War, show the 
wickedness and malice of the author of this production in such 
glowing colors, as must expose him to general contempt and de 
testation. Happy must you feel, thrice happy am I in the re 
flection, that so long as the American name shall last, yours will be 
handed down with distinction in the list of the * valued file ; and the 
artillery, which formed under your auspices equalled every exigence 
of war, will ever be regarded as the child of your genius. AVell do 
I remember the honorable testimony of the gallant La Fayette 
amidst the thunder of our batteries on the lines at Yorktown. We 
fire, exclaimed he, with a charming enthusiasm, better than the 
French (and faith we did too). To this I made a suitable objec 
tion. His reply was, Upon honor, I speak the truth ; and the

progress of your artillery is regarded by everybody as one of the 
wonders of the Revolution. Shame, then, to this infamous scrib 
bler ! and let his heart burst under the idea that your country has 
derived the most substantial benefit from your services ; that the 
good and wise acknowledge your merit ; and that Humphreys was 
not less just than poetical in characterizing by a single line the man 
to whose abilities he had been witness in the various events of a long 
and trying war : 

Ere Steuben brought the Prussian lore from far, 
And Knox created all the stores of war. " 

Under date of May 10, 1794, Knox writes to Jackson : 

..." I am extremely anxious that it * should be completed in 
the course of the year, although I have fears that I shall not be able 
to go there this summer. The new corps of artillery, the frigates, 
the fortifications, all new business added to my former employ 
ments, together with the incessant application indispensably required 
by the political state of affairs in which I have more share than I 
am well qualified for, form to a cloud which almost obscures my 
prospect of getting away in any thing like due season. I cannot 
leave my situation in this critical state of affairs. The services of 
my whole political life would serve, in the opinion of those who I 
esteem, in no degree to form a counterbalance to my quitting at 
this crisis. I therefore must stay until the storm shall have passed, 
or I be wrecked in the general catastrophe threatened by various 
causes. 

"You mention the commissary of military stores. This office 
Mr. Hodgdon has been possessed of in a different shape for several 
years, and has it now. I should hope something may occur which 
would be agreeable to you ; but my own opinion is, that neither you 
nor I ought to be in public life, but [should] make some exertions 
whereby we may better our fortunes. Whether I shall ever have

ished the next year, at a cost of not far from $15,000. Local tradition, usually 
unreliable, has greatly exaggerated this, as well as other facts connected with 
the mansion and its occupants. For instance, it said, among other things, 
that the house cost $50,000; that one hundred beds were made, an ox and 
twenty sheep often slaughtered in a week ; and that twenty saddle horses 
and corresponding carriages were kept to accommodate guests and sojourners. 



108 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

sufficient time to lay a practical scheme for such an undertaking I 
cannot tell, but certainly not while I remain in public life." 

Knox succeeded in procuring for his old friend the ap 
pointment of United States naval agent, and, as such, he 
superintended the building of the " Constitution," one of 
the six frigates the construction of which was ordered by 
the Act of 27 March, 1794. 

The outrages of the pirates of the Mediterranean on 
the persons and property of our citizens, together with the 
importance of providing defences for our extensive sea 
board, forcibly impressed Knox s mind with the necessity 
of a naval force. Jefferson and himself were the only sup 
porters in the cabinet of the establishment of a navy, but 
his endeavors were at length carried into effect by his san 
guine confidence in its success and his strenuous efforts for 
its accomplishment. The result soon vindicated the wis 
dom of the measure, and our navy has ever since been 
identified with the glory and prosperity of the country. 
Knox performed the duties of both departments with equal 
zeal and ability until the imperious claims of private in 
terest compelled him to turn his attention to the long- 
neglected concerns of his family. 

The expenses of his open hospitality far exceeded the 
limited compensation of his office, and he had for some 
time been determined to retire from public life. As early 
as in September, 1792, writing to his daughter Lucy re 
specting this subject, he says : 

" Having arrived, or nearly so, at the summit of human age and 
vigor, and being ere long to slope my down-hill course, objects 
appear exceedingly different to my view from what they used to 
do in my ascent. . . . All my life hitherto I have been pursuing 
illusive bubbles which burst on being grasped, and tis high time I 
should quit public life and attend to the solid interests of my family, 
so that they may not be left dependent on the cold hand of charity ; 



RESIGNS THE SECRETARYSHIP OF WAR. 109 

and in order to retire with reputation, it was indispensably neces 
sary that I should not afford subject for calumny to feed upon, by 
neglecting for a moment the services belonging to my station. I 
wish for ease, but in order to enjoy it I must make some exertions 
for pecuniary objects." 

The President had expressed a desire that he would re 
main with him till the close of his own official career, and 
had from time to time induced him to continue, but at 
length reluctantly accepted his resignation. The follow 
ing correspondence ensued : 

KNOX TO WASHINGTON. 

"PHILADELPHIA, 28 Dec. 1794. 

" SIR, In pursuance of the verbal communications heretofore 
submitted, it is with the utmost respect that I beg leave officially to 
request you will please to consider that, after the last day of the 
present month and year, my services as Secretary for the Depart 
ment of War will cease. 

" I have endeavored to place the business of the department in 
such a train that my successor may without much difficulty com 
mence the duties of his station. Any explanations or assistance 
which he may require shall be cordially afforded by me. 

"After having served my country nearly twenty years, the 
greatest portion of which under your immediate auspices, it is with 
extreme reluctance I find myself constrained to withdraw from so 
honorable a situation. 

" But the indispensable claims of a wife and a growing and 
numerous family of children, whose sole hopes of comfortable com 
petence rest upon my life and exertions, will no longer permit me 
to neglect duties so sacred. 

" But, in whatever situation I shall be, I shall recollect your con 
fidence and kindness with all the fervor and purity of affection of 
which a grateful heart can be susceptible."

WASHINGTON TO KNOX. 

" PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 30, 1794. 

SIK ? The considerations which you have often suggested to 
me, and are repeated in your letter of the 28th instant, as requiring 
your departure from your present office, are such as to preclude the 
possibility of my urging your continuance in it. 

" This being the case, I can only wish that it was otherwise. 
I cannot suffer you, however, to close your public service without 
uniting, with the satisfaction which must arise in your own mind 
from a conscious rectitude, my most perfect persuasion that you 
have deserved well of your country. My personal knowledge of your 
exertions, while it authorizes me to hold this language, justifies the 
sincere friendship which I have ever borne for you, and which will 
accompany you in every situation of life. Being, with affectionate 
regard, Always yours." 

Leaving Philadelphia on June 1, 1795, lie visited his 
native town, where, on the 12th, he was invited to a pub 
lic dinner by bis friends and fellow-citizens. Continuing 
his journey, he was publicly welcomed on the 22d by the 
people of Thomaston, where he bad fixed bis future resi 
dence. He at once applied himself to the cultivation and 
improvement of an extensive tract of land in the then dis 
trict of Maine, called the Muscongus or Waldo patent, 
part of which Mrs. Knox inherited from her grandfather, 
General Waldo, and the residue of which he had bought of 
the other heirs. . It lay between the Kennebec and Penob- 
scot rivers, included those of Muscongus and St. George, 
and comprised a large portion of what are now the counties 
of Lincoln, Waldo, and Penobscot. As much of this land 
was in the possession of squatters, it was a task of no little 
difficulty to quiet their pretensions ; but his firm yet con 
ciliatory course eventually overcame all obstacles. His 
liberality and beneficence, together with the improvements 



RESIDENCE AT MONTPELIER. Ill 

which he suggested and carried into effect, soon rendered 
his residence among them a blessing felt and acknowledged 
by all. 

Prior to his removal, a splendid mansion had been 
erected at the head of St. George s River, having a de 
lightful prospect in front, extending eight or ten miles 
down that river ; and in this charming spot, to which he 
gave the name of Montpelier,* in the society of his wife 
and children, and of the distinguished visitors who from 
time to time enjoyed his hospitality, Knox enjoyed a larger 
share of happiness than he had probably ever known 
before. His wife, who was truly his congenial spirit, was 
also well satisfied to retire from scenes of gayety and 
fashion to the privacy of domestic life and the loved society 
of her children. She is described as having been, even in 
her latter days, when upwards of sixty, a remarkably fiiie- 
looking woman, with brilliant black eyes, and a blooming 
complexion. Her style of dress, which was somewhat 
peculiar, and her dignified manners, gave her the appear 
ance of being taller than she really was. 

" Mrs. Knox," says the Duke de la Rochefoucauld 
Liancourt, " is a lady of whom you conceive a still higher 
opinion the longer you are acquainted with her. Seeing 
her in Philadelphia, you think of her only as a fortunate 
player at whist ; at her house in the country you discover 
that she possesses sprightliness, knowledge, a good heart, 
and an excellent understanding." Of her daughter (after 
ward Mrs. Thatcher), he says, that " at their house in 
Maine she lays aside her excessive timidity, and you 
admire alike her beauty, wit, and cheerfulness ; " and of 
the General, " he is one of the worthiest men I have ever 
known : lively, agreeable ; valuable equally as an excel-

pied by the station of the Knox and Lincoln Railway.

lent friend and as an engaging companion." Among his 
distinguished guests were Senator Bingham and his family, 
and several French refugees of celebrity, such as Louis 
Phillipe, Talleyrand, the Count de Beaumetz, and the 
Duke de Liancourt. The latter, whose wardrobe was re 
plenished by the munificence of Knox, is said to have ex 
claimed despondingly one day while here, as he struck his 
forehead with his hand, " I have three dukedoms on my 
head, and not one whole coat 011 my back." Knox wrote 
him as follows from Boston, in July, 1797, and the duke 
responded by again visiting him the next September : 

"Mr DEAR DUKE, I have received with peculiar sensibility 
your kind letter of the 2d of this month. Under every vicissitude 
of human affairs I shall love and esteem you as a brother. You 
are not truly informed of my having a hatred for the French nation. 
Their great qualities of gallantry and magnanimity are above, far 
above, my eulogy. But as it relates to this country, they are acting 
under a mistaken impression of our being attached to the British 
nation. I hope time and better information will lessen the resent 
ment of France against this country : it cannot be for their happi 
ness or ours that we should quarrel. ... I have been detained here 
by a variety of circumstances until this time, but more particularly 
in attending our legislature, who have unintentionally wronged me 
out of nearly 40,000 acres of my best land high up Penobscot River. 
I have succeeded with one branch, but could not quite succeed with 
the other ; but I shall finish the affair next session. I shall go [to 
St. George s] in five days. My affairs there flourish, but want my 
presence there for the summer. I cannot express how delighted 
and charmed I should be by having the happiness of receiving you 
there." 

Knox entered largely into brickmaking, and the manu 
facture of lime and lumber, and also carried on an exten 
sive mercantile business under the management of Captain 
Thomas Vose, a gallant officer of artillery, at first as clerk, 
and afterward as partner. These and other varied indus- 



PECUNIARY TROUBLES. 113 

tries which he carried on brought to the place and gave 
employment to large numbers of mechanics and other emi 
grants, who became permanent residents of Thomaston, 
and who stimulated the growth of the town. He also 
attempted to introduce improved breeds of cattle and 
sheep ; and as early as 1796 undertook the business of 
ship-building, and several coasters were launched and kept 
running in his employ. To facilitate his lumber opera 
tions, Knox purchased the right to improve the navigation 
of George s River, and completed locks of sufficient capac 
ity for the passage of rafts and gondolas at the several 
falls in Warren, opening the navigation of the river as far 
up as the mills in Union. His plans and projects of im 
provement were more suited to his expansive mind than 
to his actual resources, he being for the most part of the 
time while there greatly embarrassed by want of money ; 
and they consequently resulted more advantageously to 
others than to himself. These pecuniary troubles culmi 
nated in 1798, arid caused for a short time some distress to 
his indorsers, Generals Lincoln and Jackson, who were, how 
ever, amply secured from loss by assignments of valuable 
land. A few extracts from his later letters will afford some 
glimpses of passing events, and of his domestic life and 
feelings. Thus to his friend Jackson, under date of July 
9, 1795, only a few days after his arrival at St. George s, 
he writes, " We had a small company on the 4th of July 
of upwards of fixe hundred people ! " On this occasion 
a general invitation had been given to the people of the 
town and neighboring settlements to inspect the General s 
mansion and partake of its hospitalities. Tables were set 
in the piazzas, and " the house and grounds were vocal 
with music and conversation." 

To Washington, under date of Boston, 15 January, 1797, 
he writes : 



114 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

..." The loss of two lovely children on which you condole in your 
letter has been recently renewed and increased by the death of our 
son [Washington], of seven years old. Unfortunate, indeed, have 
we been in the loss of eight children, requiring the exercise of our 
whole stock of philosophy and religion. 

" We have lately come from St. George s to pass the winter in 
this town. Indeed, this is our general plan : we may, however, as 
we grow older, find it inconvenient. We are distant about two 
hundred miles by land, which we may easily ride in six days when 
the snow is on the ground ; or with wheels, with a very little im 
provement of a small part of the road. I am beginning to experi 
ence the good effects of my residence upon my lands. I may truly 
say that it is more than doubled in its value since I determined to 
make it my home. The only inconvenience we experience is the 
want of society : this will probably lessen daily. Our communica 
tion by water to this town is constant and cheap. We can obtain 
transportation here cheaper than the same article can be carted from 
my store to the vessel. This egotism would require an apology to 
any other than you." 

His last letter to Washington is dated 22d December, 
1799, eight days after that illustrious man had breathed his 
last : 

" I am here [Thomaston], and should be more happy in my 
pursuits than I have ever been, were some embarrassments entirely 
dissipated. But this will require time. My estate with indulgence 
is competent, and greatly more, to the discharge of every cent I owe. 
All who are here unite with me in presenting to Mrs. Washington 
our affectionate remembrance. I may not wish you the greatest 
blessing by wishing you a long life, because I believe that while you 
continue here you are detained from a much better condition. But 
I pray fervently that your days on earth may be days of felicity, 
without clouds, sickness, or sorrow." 

TO GENERAL DAVID COBB. 

" MOXTPELIER, 22 March, 1800. 

" Returning from Boston on the 14th, I found your letter. I per 
ceive no cause of regret at the departure of our old chief. He

exhibited a most glorious setting sun ; and the people of the United 
States have exhibited human nature in its brilliant attitudes by their 
gratitude. His death and the testimonials of respect will be an 
excellent stimulus to future patriotism. . . . 

" You mention that your spirits are not good. For God s sake 
bear up against the devil of Gloom. Put yourself in motion. 
Visit even me if you can find nothing better. Get Willich, a new 
author on diet and regimen ; but, above all, get on horseback. 

" I was in Boston twelve days. My affairs progress well. I shall 
have bright days yet. My daughter had been there for two months. 
She returned with me. Mrs. K. and Caroline stayed at home, 
which to me is, after all, the most agreeable place, provided I had 
you and a few other friends near me. 

" Bonaparte, what a glorious fellow ! how completely he has 
averted the monster anarchy and mad democracy ! I hope in God 
that no fanatic will assassinate him, which is to be dreaded." 

TO MRS. KNOX AT BOSTON. 

" MOXTPELIER, 20 Nov. 1801. 

" Whether your not getting a house is good or bad, I will not 
determine. With my habits, a lodging-house will be execrable, and 
yet feelings must give way to judgment. In either case we must be 
economists. Although our prospects will be greatly brightened by 
the revolution of our settlers, yet very little ready money at present. 
Therefore prenez garde as to expenses. Although the throng of 
our visitors have passed, yet we generally have eight or ten per day, 
and commonly from five to ten at night. Our son * is a cause of 
infinite solicitude. He is not here, nor have I received a line from 
him. At present the proposition of sending him to the East Indies 
or Canton appears like giving him a passport to eternity or to in 
finite misery." 

Upon the declaration of war with France, in 1T98, under 
the Presidency of John Adams, Washington, who was ap-

pointed lieutenant-general, named as his seconds Hamilton, 
C. C. Pinckney, and Knox, in the order mentioned. The 
latter was greatly mortified at being placed after those 
who, during the war, had been his juniors in rank, and 
declined to serve. He wrote to Washington a remon- 

O 

strance, which the latter sent to Hamilton, with a letter, 
delicately intimating a disposition favorable to Knox. 
Hamilton, in reply, reluctantly acquiesced in " any ar 
rangement which Washington might deem for the general 
good ; " and at a later period endeavored, in a letter to 
Knox, from which we make an extract, to throw the re 
sponsibility upon others. Warm-hearted and placable, 
Knox cherished no animosity against him, and when he 
heard of his death broke out into violent and uncontrol 
lable emotion. 

HAMILTON TO KNOX. 

" NEW YORK, March 14, 1799. 

" My judgment tells me I ought to be silent on a certain subject, 
but my heart advises otherwise, and my heart has always been the 
master of my judgment. Believe me, I have felt much pain at the 
idea that any circumstance personal to me should have deprived 
the public of your services or occasioned to you the smallest dis 
satisfaction. Be persuaded, also, that the views of others, not my 
own, have given shape to what has taken place, and that there has 
been a serious struggle between my respect and attachment for you 
and the impression of duty. This sounds, I know, like affectation, 
but it is nevertheless the truth. In a case in which such great 
public interests were concerned, it seemed to me the dictate of 
reason and propriety not to exercise an opinion of my own, but to 
leave that of others who would influence the issue to take a free 
course. In saying this much, my only motive is to preserve, if I 
may, a claim on your friendly disposition towards me, and to give 
you some evidence that my regard for you is unabated." 

Neither the absorbing nature of his private affairs nor 
the pecuniary and other obstacles which constantly im- 



PUBLIC DUTIES. DEATH. 117 

peded his extensive plans for the improvement and set 
tlement of the country around him, could prevent his 
performance of those public duties which his fellow-citi 
zens from time to time imposed upon him. We find him 
appointed, April 6, 1796, a commissioner for the United 
States for settling the Eastern boundary on the true river 
St. Croix ; from the year 1801 a member of the General 
Court; and on June 2, 1804, he was appointed one of the 
council of Governor Strong, by whom he was much con 
sulted in important affairs, and like whom he was inde 
pendent and firm in political sentiment, while at the same 
time conciliatory and tolerant. 

General Knox was exceedingly fond of the society of 
men of learning, talent, and wit, and had an extensive 
correspondence with many of the eminent men of his time 
both in Europe and America. At the time of his decease 
he had a handsome collection of not less than 1,585 vol 
umes, 364 of which were in the French language. Next 
to that of Benjamin Vaughan, Esq., of Hallowell, his was 
the largest and best private library in the district of Maine. 
He received the honorary degree of Master of Arts, from 
Dartmouth College, in 1793 ; and 16 December, 1805, was 
made a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and 
Sciences. 

We come now to the close of the career of this truly 
noble and estimable man. Had he been permitted to at 
tain the usual age of man, which his vigorous constitu 
tion seemed to render probable, the cloud that rested upon 
the latter part of his life would undoubtedly have been 
dispelled ; and the rise in the value of his property would 
have enabled him to realize all his anticipations, and to 
have left his family in opulence. It was otherwise or 
dained. A sudden and unlooked-for accident cut him off 
in the midst of his usefulness, to the sincere regret of all 

16 



118 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

who knew him. His neighbors mourned his loss as a 
public benefactor ; but to his immediate family the stroke 
was unexpected and overwhelming. 

The event occurred on Saturday, Oct. 25, 1806, after 
an illness of a few days. It was occasioned by his having 
swallowed a chicken bone, which caused a mortification, 
and was from its nature incurable. He was entombed 
on the following Tuesday with military honors, amid the 
largest concourse of citizens ever seen in that vicinity, and 
a eulogy was pronounced by the Hon. Samuel Thatcher. 
The House of Kepresentatives of Massachusetts, on Jan. 
10, 1807, unanimously passed resolutions of respect to his 
memory, which, with a letter of condolence from the 
speaker, Hon. Perez Morton, was sent to the widow. 

Mrs. Knox died June 20, 1824. Out of twelve chil 
dren, nine of whom died in childhood or infancy, only 
three survived their father: Lucy jP., b. 1776, d. 12 Oct. 
1854, who m. Ebenezer Thatcher (H. U. 1798) ; Henry 
JacJcson, b. 24 May, 1780, d. Thomaston, Me., 1830 ; and 
Caroline, who m., 1st, James Swan, of Dorchester; 2d, 
Hon. John Holmes, of Maine. Both the latter died with 
out issue. The surviving children of Mrs. Thatcher are 
Admiral Henry Knox Thatcher, and Caroline F., widow 
of Benjamin Smith, of Newburg, N.Y. 

The personal and mental characteristics of General Knox 
are thus described by William Sullivan in his " Familiar 
Letters: " 

" He was a large, full man, above middle stature ; his lower limbs 
inclined a very little outward, so that in walking his feet were nearly 
parallel. His hair was short in front, standing up, and powdered 
and queued. His forehead was low ; his face, large and full below ; 
his eyes, rather small, gray, and brilliant. The expression of his 
face altogether was a very fine one. 

" When moving along the street, he had an air of grandeur and 



PERSONAL HABITS AND TRAITS. 119 

self-complacency, but it wounded no man s self-love. He carried a 
large cane, not to aid his steps, but usually under his arm ; and 
sometimes, when he happened to stop and engage in conversation 
with his accustomed ardor, his cane was used to flourish with, in aid 
of his eloquence. He was usually dressed in black. In the summer, 
he commonly carried his light silk hat in his hand when walking in 
the shade. When engaged in conversation, he used to unwind and 
replace the black silk handkerchief which he wore wrapped around 
his mutilated hand, but not so as to show its disfigurement. 

" When thinking, he looked like one of his own heavy pieces, 
which would surely do execution when discharged ; when speaking, 
his face had a noble expression, and was capable of displaying the 
most benignant feeling. This was the true character of his heart. 
His voice was strong, and no one could hear it without feeling that 
it had been accustomed to command. The mind of Knox was 
powerful, rapid, and decisive, and he could employ it continuously 
and effectively. His natural propensity was highly social, and no 
man better enjoyed a hearty laugh. 

" He had a brilliant imagination, and no less brilliant modes of 
expression. His conceptions of the power and glory of the Creator 
of the universe were of an exalted character. The immortality of 
the soul was not with him a matter of induction, but a sentiment or 
fact, no more to be questioned than his own earthly existence. He 
said that he had through life left his bed at the dawn, and had been 
always a cheerful, happy man." 

Says Thacher in his " Military Journal," in speaking of 
Knox : 

" Long will he be remembered as the ornament of every circle 
in which he moved, as the amiable and enlightened companion, the 
generous friend, the man of feeling and benevolence. His conver 
sation was animated and cheerful, and he imparted an interest to 
every subject that he touched. In his gayest moments he never 
lost sight of dignity ; he invited confidence, but repelled familiarity. 
His conceptions were lofty, and no man ever possessed the power 
of embodying his thoughts in more vigorous language: when ar 
dently engaged, they were peculiarly bold and original, and you 
inevitably felt in his society that his intellect was not of the ordinary 



120 LIFE OF HENRY KNOX. 

class ; yet no man was more unassuming, none more delicately alive 
to the feelings of others. He had the peculiar talent of rendering 
all who were with him happy in themselves, and no one ever more 
feelingly enjoyed the happiness of those around him. His feelings 
were strong and exquisitely tender. In the domestic circle they 
shone with peculiar lustre ; and if at any time a cloud overshadowed 
his own spirit, he strove to prevent its influence from extending to 
those that were dear to him. He was frank, generous, and sincere, 
and in his intercourse with the world uniformly just." 

" The conversation of General Knox," says another 
writer, " was itself a feast. He was affable without 
familiarity, dignified without parade, imposing without ar 
rogance." 

His features were regular, his Grecian nose prominent, 
his complexion florid, his hair naturally dark, and his eyes 
sharp and penetrating, seldom failing to recognize a coun 
tenance they had once rested upon. His frame was well 
proportioned and muscular, inclining to corpulency ; and 
while at West Point, in August, 1783, he weighed 280 
pounds. 

A firm believer in the truths of Christianity, and a lib 
eral supporter of its institutions, he regarded the future 
as a progressive state of existence, and held in slight 
esteem the distinctions of creeds and sects; "for," says 
Dr. Thacher, " his charity was as diffusive as the globe, 
and extensive as the family of man." He could hear 
others praised without envy, and delighted to enumerate 
the good qualities of men in public life. 

His public spirit was displayed by encouraging schools, 
locating and repairing roads, promoting the erection of a 
place of public religious worship, and by exciting an at 
tention to agriculture among his neighbors. He gave the 
piece of land which is now the principal cemetery in 
Thomaston ; a large pulpit Bible, still in use by the Con-

gregational Church there ; and the first bell that ever 
called together the worshippers of that town, and which 
is still hanging in the First Baptist Church. 

Of his numerous private charities we record but one. 
On June 23, 1797, he drew up and headed with fifty 
dollars a subscription for the daughters of the French ad 
miral, Count de Grasse, who had been driven from their 
estates in the West Indies, and who were then in Boston 
in a state of destitution. It must be borne in mind that 
at this time he was himself in great distress for money. 

We have thus sketched, briefly and imperfectly it is 
true, the principal events and the leading characteristics in 
a career well worthy the study and imitation of mankind. 
One of its lessons is so especially applicable to our own 
tunes, that we commend it to those of our countrymen 
occupying stations of public trust. It is found in the letter 
to his brother William (ante, p. 61), in which he says: 
" You know my sentiments with respect to making any 
thing out of the public : I abominate the idea. I could not 
[otherwise] , at the end of the war, mix with my fellow- 
citizens with that conscious integrity, the felicity of which 
I often anticipate." 

Many have been as courageous in the field, many as wise 
and patriotic in council, but few have united to these the 
still rarer virtues, a spotless integrity, and a noble out 
spoken manliness of character, in a higher degree than 
the subject of this brief memoir.

Oliver as Secretary, 12 Nov. 1770 ; was made a Mandamus Councillor, 
9 Aug. 1774; left Boston for Halifax with other Tories in March, 1776; 
afterward went to London, where he was a member of the " Brompton 
Row Tory Club," or association of Loyalists, who met weekly for con 
versation and a dinner, and died there 16 Feb. 1783. His daughter 
Lucy (Mrs. Knox) writes to her husband on July 17, 1777 : " By a 
letter from Mrs. Tyng to Aunt Waldo, we learn that papa enjoys his 
300 a year as Secretary of the province. Droll, is it not? " In 1765, 
he was a member of a committee of the Council to consider and report 
what could be done to prevent difficulties in the proceedings of the courts 
of justice ; and, in 1768, he assisted in drafting an address of that body to 
the King.

PADDOCK S ARTILLERY COMPANY. 

Prior to the organization of this company by Captain David Mason in 
1763, the only military companies in Boston were "The Ancient and 
Honorable Artillery Company, 11 the first regularly organized company in 
America, instituted in 1G38; and the "Cadets, 11 instituted about 1754, 
called also the " Governor s Guards, 11 composed of the elite of the citi 
zens, and forming the escort on all occasions of ceremony or commem 
oration. The " Train, 11 as it was then called, was attached to the Boston 
regiment; and on Captain Mason s removal to New Gloucester, Me., its 
command passed, in 1768, to Lieut. Adino Paddock. The latter, who 
was a chair-maker on Common (now Tremont) Street, opposite the 
Granary, was a "complete artilleryman, 11 and made of his company a 
celebrated military school, which furnished many excellent officers to 
the Revolutionary army. It was composed chiefly of mechanics, was 
considered equal to any that afterward entered the service, and con 
tinued to a recent period, being latterly known as the "South End 11 
Artillery Company. 

" In the fall of 1760 a company of British artillery, 1 says Gen. Henry 
Burbeck, who was himself a member of Paddock s company, " bound to 
Quebec, was too late to enter the river St. Lawrence, and put into Bos 
ton, where they remained in the barracks at Castle William until the 
May following. From them Paddock s company derived instruction in 
the knowledge and science of field artillery. Major Paddock bought two 
light brass three-pounders. My father (Col. Wm. Burbeck) gave a plan 
or draft for the carriages, and supplied the company with every thing, 
such as ammunition, port-fires, and every appointment necessary for the 
field. I was a member of Paddock s company seven years before the 
war. 11 

Paddock attached to his company as pioneers, and to man the drag-

ropes, a number of German emigrants, whose uniform consisted in part 
of white frocks and hair caps, and who wore broadswords. The com 
pany was, for the purposes of manoeuvring, divided into two sections, 
each taking two field-pieces, and upon such occasions went through all 
the evolutions of an active engagement. 

** The fourth of June, 1768, being the king s birthday, was celebrated 
with much spirit. . . . The Governor s Troop of Guards, under Col. 
Phipps ; the regiment of the town, under Col. Jackson ; with the train of 
artillery, under Capt. Paddock, all mustered in King Street, where the 
troop and regiment fired three rounds, and the artillery responded with 
their new pieces." * These pieces were, on the breaking out of the Revo 
lutionary war, kept in a gun-house at the corner of West Street. A 
school-house was the next building ; and a yard, enclosed with a high 
fence, was common to both. Paddock, who was a Tory, had expressed 
fin intention of surrendering these guns to Governor Gage, who had 
begun to seize the military stores of the province and disarm the inhabi 
tants. His design was frustrated by a few patriotic young men, among 
whom were Abraham Holbrook, the school-master, Nathaniel Balch, 
Samuel Gore, Moses Grant, Jeremiah Gridley, and - Whiston, who, 
while the attention of the sentinel stationed at the door of the gun-house 
was taken off by roll-call, crossed the yard, entered the building, and, 
removing the guns from their carriages, concealed them in the school- 
house, whence they were subsequently conveyed in a boat to the Amer 
ican lines. The guns were in actual service during the whole war ; and 
in 1788 General Knox, while Secretary of War, caused a suitable inscrip 
tion to be placed upon them. They were named the " Hancock" and 
" Adams," and are now suspended in the chamber at the top of Bunker 
Hill Monument. 

The Committee of Safety, 23 Feb. 1775, voted that Dr. Joseph 
Warren ascertain how many of the men who had been under Paddock s 
command could " be depended on to form an artillery company when the 
Constitutional Army of the Province should take the field, and that 
report be made without loss of time." In March, 1776, Major Paddock 
embarked for Halifax with the Royal Army ; sailed for England in June ; 
and from 1781 until his decease, 25 March, 1804, aged seventy-six, 
resided on the Isle of Jersey, where for several years he held the office 
of Inspector of Artillery Stores, with the rank of Captain. 

The following list of members of Paddock s company is quite incom 
plete. Those starred were subsequently officers in the regiments of 
Gridley, Knox, or Crane, in the Revolutionary army : 

* Probably the brass three-pounders brought from London in the brigantine 
"Abigail," which arrived about Feb. 1. They had been cast for the town from two 
old cannon sent over by the General Court for that purpose. Upon them were 
engraved the arms of the Province. Drakt s History of Boston.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR HENRY KNOX, ESQ. 

You are immediately to examine into the state of the artillery of this 
army, and take an account of the cannon, mortars, shells, lead, and am 
munition that are wanting ; when you have done that, you are to pro 
ceed in the most expeditious manner to New York ; there apply to the

president of the Provincial Congress, and learn of him whether Col. 
Reed did any thing, or left any orders respecting these things, and get 
him to procure such of them as can possibly be had there. The presi 
dent, if he can, will have them immediately sent hither ; if he cannot, you 
must put them in a proper channel for being transported to this camp 
with despatch before you leave New York. After you have procured as 
many of these necessaries as you can there, you must go to Major-Gen 
eral Schuyler and get the remainder from Ticonderoga, Crown Point, or 
St. John s ; if it should be necessary, from Quebec, if in our hands. 
The want of them is so great, that no trouble or expense must be spared 
to obtain them. I have wrote to General Schuyler, he will give every 
necessary assistance, that they may be had and forwarded to this place 
with the utmost despatch. I have given you a warrant to the Paymaster- 
General of the Continental Army, for a thousand dollars, to defrav the 
expense attending your journey and procuring these articles, an account 
of which you are to keep and render upon your return. 

Given under my hand at head-quarters at Cambridge this 16th day

INTERVIEW W^ITH HOWE S ADJUTANT-GENERAL. 

KNOX TO HIS WIFE. 

"NEW YORK, July 15, 1776. 

"Lord Howe yesterday sent a fiig of truce up to the city. They 
came within about four miles of the city, and were met by some of Col. 
Tupper s people, who detained them until his Excellency s pleasure 
should be known. Accordingly, Col. Reed and myself went down in the 
barge to receive the message. Wh^n we came to them, the officer, who 
was, I believe, captain of the Eagle man-of-war, rose up and bowed, 
keeping his hat off: I have a letter, sir, from Lord Howe to Mr. Wash 
ington." Sir, says Col. Reed, we have no person in our army with 
that address. Sir, says the officer, will you look at the address. 
He then took out of his pocket [a letter] which was thus [addressed] 
" GEORGE WASHINGTON, Esq., 
" New York. 

" HOWE. 

* No sir, says Col. Reed, I cannot receive that letter. I am very 
sorry, says the officer, and so will be Lord Howe, that anv error in the 



132 INTERVIEW WITH HOWE S ADJUTANT-GENERAL. 

superscription should prevent the letter being received by General 
Washington. Why, sir, says Col. Reed, * I must obey orders. 1 * Oh, 
yes, sir ! you must obey orders, to be sure. Then, after giving him a 
letter from Col. Campbell to General Howe, and some other letters from 
prisoners to their friends, we stood off, after having saluted and bowed 
to each other. After we had got a little way, the officer put about his 
barge and stood for us, and asked by what particular title he chose to 
be addressed. Col. Reed said, You are sensible, sir, of the rank of 
General Washington in our army. Yes, sir, we are. I am sure my 
Lord Howe will lament exceedingly this affair, as the letter is quite of a 
civil nature, and not of a military one. He laments exceedingly that he 
was not here a little sooner ; which we supposed to allude to the decla 
ration of independence : upon which we bowed, and parted in the most 
genteel terms imaginable." 

"July 22, 1776. 

" On Saturday I wrote you we had a capital flag of truce, no less than 
the adjutant-general of General Howe s army. He had an interview 
with General Washington at our house. The purport of his message 
was in very elegant, polite strains, to endeavor to persuade General 
Washington to receive a letter directed to George Washington, Esq., 
&c., &c. In the course of his talk every other word was, May it please 
your Excellency, if your Excellency so please ; in short, no person 
could pay more respect than the said adjutant-general, whose name is 
Col. I aterson,* a person we do not know. He said the &c., &c. im 
plied every thing. It does so, said the General, and any thing. He 
said Lord and General Howe lamented exceedingly that any errors in the 
direction should interrupt that frequent intercourse between the two 
armies which might be necessary in the course of the service. That Lord 
Howe had come out with great powers. The General said he had heard 
that Lord Howe had come out with very great powers to pardon, but he 
had come to the wrong place : the Americans had not offended, therefore 
they needed no pardon. This confused him. After a considerable deal 
of talk about the good disposition of Lord and General Howe, he asked, 
lias your Excellency no particular commands with which you would 
please to honor me to Lord and General Howe ? Nothing, sir, but 
my particular compliments to both ; a good answer. General Wash 
ington was very handsomely dressed, and made a most elegant ap- 



* James Paterson was made lieutenant-colonel 63d foot, 15 June, 1763; colonel 
in the army, 20 Aug. 1777; major-general, 10 Nov. 1782; and does not appear in 
the army list after 1787. He was appointed adjutant-general in America, 11 Jtilv, 
1776; and was sent home with despatches after the battle of Monmotith.

pearance. Col. Patcrson appeared awe-struck, as if he was before 
something supernatural. Indeed, I don t wonder at it. He was before 
a very great man indeed. We had a cold collation provided, in which I 
lamented most exceedingly the absence of my Lucy. The General s ser 
vants did it tolerably well, though Mr. adjutant-general disappointed us. 
As it grew late, he even excused himself from drinking one glass of wine. 
He said Lord Howe and General Howe would wait for him, as they were 
to dine on board the Eagle man-of-war : he took his leave and went off."

hastening as a volunteer, on 11 Sept. 1777, to the battle of Brandywine, his horse,

to assist the fire of Billingsport. These galleys would be for this purpose 
preferable to the floating batteries, as they can be most easily moved in 
case of an accident to Billingsport. 

If much depends on the fire-ships, an enclosed battery ought to be con 
structed on some advantageous piece of ground near Derby s Creek, and 
something higher up the river than where the present defective battery 
is : this, in order to prevent any of the enemy s ships mooring at the 
mouth of the western channel, so as to prevent the fire-ships being sent 
round into the main ship-channel ; and between this western channel is 
thought to be most commodious for the free operation of the fire-ships, 
either in the channel leading to Billingsport or further down the river. 
The galleys ought also to lie in the western channel if their retreat is 
perfectly secure, as the commodore (Hazlewood) says, as well in order 
to protect the fire-ships as to annoy any of the enemy s frigates which 
may be opposed to Billingsport. But the two floating batteries, which 
from their unwieldiness cannot be easily moved, together with the frigates 
and xebeks, ought to lie behind the second row of cheveaux de frise upon 
a line with Fort Island. 

If there should be time enough, a strong enclosed work ought to be 
thrown up on Fort Island capable of containing 400 or 500 men, and 
advantage may be taken of part of the stone work already erected, and 
which in its present state would be infinitely detrimental to any body of 
men who may seek shelter from it. 

These sentiments are respectfully submitted by, sir, 

Your most obedient, humble servant, 

HENRY KNOX, 
His Excellency General WASHINGTON. Brigadier- Gen. 



OPINION AS TO THE FEASIBILITY OF TAKING PHILA 
DELPHIA BY STORM. 

In Answer to Washington s Queries, given^G Nov. 1777. 

SIR, I exceedingly lament my want of ability and experience to fill 
properly the important station in which I am, and am more particularly 
distressed when such important questions are referred to my decision as 
those which your Excellency gave us in charge last evening. The happi 
ness or misery of the people of America may be the consequence of a 
right or erroneous judgment. 

Much has lately been urged concerning the reputation of our arms, 
as if we had long been a warlike nation, whose existence, like the ancient 
Romans, depended on their military service. I confess I view the matter 
differently, and cannot bring myself to believe (how much soever I may 



PHILADELPHIA BY STORM. 137 

wish it) that we are upon a par in military knowledge and skill with our 
enemies. Indeed it is not possible, and the sensible part of mankind 
will know it. . . . 

The gentlemen who urge the desperate measure of attacking the ene 
my s lines, redoubts, and the city of Philadelphia, seem to forget the many 
principles laid down by people experienced in the art of war against our 
engaging in general actions upon equal terms ; against our risking our all 
on the event of single battles. In the beginning of the contest our friends 
in England urged the impropriety of such conduct, giving instances of 
numbers of States who lost their liberties by means of them. It is an 
invariable principle in war that it cannot be the interest at the same time 
of both parties to engage. It is also another fixed principle that the 
invaders of a country ought to bring the defenders of it to action as soon 
as possible. But I believe there is not a single maxim in war that will 
justify a number of undisciplined troops attacking an equal number of 
disciplined troops strongly posted in redoubts and having a strong city 
in their rear, such as Philadelphia. 

It is proposed to attack the enemy s redoubts without being perfectly 
acquainted with their number, strength, or situation, with troops of whom 
we have had the experience of two capital actions, that it was impossible 
to rally them after they were broken. By the mode of attack proposed 
we are to stake the liberties of America on a single attempt in which the 
probability of success is against us, and, if defeated, of sacrificing the 
happiness of posterity to what is called the reputation of our arms. 

It has been agreed that the enemy s force consists of 10,000 rank and 
file fit for duty. It is said Lord Cornwallis has taken with him from 1500 
to 3000, suppose the number 2500, which is 500 more than I believe 
he has, there remain 7500 rank and file fit for duty. Our returns are 
8000. I say 8000, because I hold the militia in case of an attack of this 
kind useless entirely, for we know they will not stand within the range 
of a cannon-ball. We are to attack 7500 strongly posted in redoubts, 
having batteries and a strong city in their rear. In this instance the idea 
that it is necessary among disciplined troops of having three to one to 
storm works is laid aside, not because our troops are better disciplined 
than their enemy s, but because from a concurrence of circumstances our 
affairs are in a desperate situation, and we must retrieve them or perish. 

Marshal Saxe says redoubts are the strongest and most excellent kind 
of field fortifications, and infinitely preferable to extended lines, because 
each redoubt requires a separate attack, one of which succeeding does 
not facilitate the reduction of the others. Charles XII., with the best 
troops in the world, was totally ruined in the attack of seven redoubts at 
Pultowa, although he succeeded in taking three of them. 

The character of the British troops in Europe is far above mediocritv, 
and the experience we have had of their discipline and valor proves them 



138 OPINION RELATIVE TO TAKING PHILADELPHIA. 

by no means contemptible. In the commencement of this war they 
stormed an unfinished work on Bunker s Hill, but the experience gained 
there has entirely prevented them from making any similar attempts. 
Indeed, the Germans lately made an attempt on Red Bank, the event of 
which will hardly give them a favorable opinion of the attack of redoubts 
by storm. 

The situation of the American army on Long Island, after the battle of 
August 27th, was exceedingly ineligible, and the enemy must have known 
it ; but they did not attempt to carry our redoubts by storm, although, 
had they succeeded in one instance, and made a sufficient opening for 
the introduction of a large column of troops, the greatest part of our 
army then on the island must have fallen a sacrifice, or have been taken 
prisoners. 

From the experience derived from reading and some little service and 
the knowledge of the strength of the enemy s works, my opinion is clearly, 
pointedly, and positively against an attack on the enemy s redoubts, 
because I am fully convinced a defeat would be certain and inevitable. 

My opinion is to draw our whole force together, take post at, and 
fortify Germantown, considering it as our winter quarters. When the 
works there are in a tolerable state of defence, I should be for taking our 
whole force (except one brigade to guard the works), and proceed upon 
the enemy s line, offering them battle, which, if they declined, would in 
the opinion of every rational man fully evince our superiority in point 
of strength. If they should come out, fight, and defeat us, we have a 
secure retreat and winter quarters. 

I have thus offered my sentiments to your Excellency with freedom ; 
but if a contrary disposition should take place, and an attack be resolved 
upon, I shall endeavor to execute the part that may be assigned me to 
the utmost of my ability. 

I am with the most profound respect your Excellency s most obedient, 
humble servant. H. Kxox, 

Briy.-Gen. Artillery. 
ARTILLERY PARK, CAMP WHITEMARSII. 26th Nov. 1777. 

His Excellency General WASHINGTON. 

The question was, whether it would be advisable to attack the enemy s 
redoubts and the city of Philadelphia by way of storm ; to throw twelve 
hundred troops into the city by the way of the Delaware, embarking 
them in boats at Dunx s Ferry, sixteen miles above the city.

DRAFT OF KNOX S ADDRESS TO WASHINGTON. 141 



"ROUGH DRAFT [BY KNOX] OF AN ADDRESS TO HIS 
EXCELLENCY GEN. WASHINGTON, 14 NOV. 1783." 

[See the Farewell Address, Washington s Writings, vol. viii. p. 491.] 

" All the officers of the part of the army remaining on the banks of the 
Hudson have received your Excellency s Serious and Farewell Address 
to the Armies of the United States. We beg your acceptance of our 
unfeigned thanks for the communication and your affectionate profes 
sions of inviolable attachment and friendship. If your attempts to insure 
them the just, the promised rewards of their long, severe, and dangerous 
services have failed of success, we believe it has arisen from causes not 
in your Excellency s power to control. With extreme regret do we 
reflect on the occasion which called for such endeavors. But, while we 
thank your Excellency for these exertions in favor of the troops you 
have so successfully commanded, we pray it may be believed that in 
this sentiment our own particular interests have but a secondary place; 
and that even the ultimate ingratitude of the people (were that possible) 
would not shake the patriotism of those who suffer by it. Still with 
pleasing wonder and with grateful joy shall we contemplate the glorious 
conclusion of our labors. To that merit in the Revolution which, under 
the auspices of Heaven, the army have displayed, posterity will do jus 
tice ; and the sons will blush whose fathers were their foes. Most gladly 
would we cast a veil on every act that sullies the reputation of our 
country. Never should the page of history be stained with its dishonor, 
even from our memories should the idea be erased. We lament the op 
position to those salutary measures which the wisdom of the Union has 
planned, measures which alone can recover and fix on a permanent 
basis the credit of the States, measures which are essential to the 
justice, the honor, and interest of the nation. While she was giving the 
noblest proofs of magnanimity, with conscious pride we saw her growing 
fame ; and, regardless of present sufferings, we looked forward to the 
end of our toils and dangers, to brighter scenes in prospect. There we 
beheld the Genius of our country dignified by sovereignty and independ 
ence, supported by Justice, and adorned with every liberal virtue. 
There we saw patient Husbandry fearless extend her cultured fields, and 
animated Commerce spread her sails to every wind that blows. There 
we beheld fair Science lift her head, with all the arts attending in her 
train. There, blest with Freedom, we saw the human mind expand ; and, 
throwing aside the restraints which confined us to the narrow bounds of 
country, it embraced the World. Such were our fond hopes ; and with 
such delightful prospects did they present us. Nor are we disappointed. 

19 



142 THANKS OF NEW YORK COUNCIL TO KNOX. 

Those animating prospects are now changed and changing to realities ; 
and actively to have contributed to their production is our pride, our 
glory. But JUSTICE alone can give them stability. In that JUSTICE we 
still believe. Still we hope that the prejudices of the misinformed will 
be removed, and the arts of false and selfish popularity, addressed to the 
feelings of avarice, defeated, or, in the worst event, the world, we hope, 
will mark the just distinction. We trust the disingenuousness of a few 
will not sully the reputation, the honor, and dignity of the great and re 
spectable majority of the States. 

" We are happy in the opportunity just presented of congratulating 
your Excellency on the certain conclusion of the definitive treaty of 
Peace. Relieved at length from long suspense, our warmest wish is to 
return to the bosom of our country, to resume the character of citizens ; 
and it will be our highest ambition to become useful ones. 

"To your Excellency, this great event must be peculiarly pleasing ; 
for while at the head of her armies, urged by patriot virtues and magna 
nimity, you steadily persevered, under the pressure of every possible 
difficulty and discouragement, in the pursuit of the great objects of the 
war, the freedom and safety of your country, your heart panted for 
the tranquil enjoyments of peace. We cordially rejoice with you that 
the period of indulging them has arrived so soon. In contemplating the 
blessings of liberty and independence, the rich prize of eight years 1 hardy 
adventure, past sufferings will be forgotten; or, if remembered, the rec 
ollection will serve to heighten the relish of present happiness. We 
sincerely pray GOD this happiness may long be yours ; and that when 
you quit the stage of human life you may receive from the UNERRING 
JUDGE the rewards of valor exerted to save the oppressed, of patriotism 
and disinterested virtue."

Resolved, That his Excellency the Governor be requested to present 
the thanks of this Council to Major-General Knox, and the officers and

have rendered to the inhabitants of this State, in common with the other 
citizens of America during the late long and arduous contest. 

JAMES M. HuoiiES, Sec y. 

The above was transmitted by Governor Clinton, with the following 
note : 

" SIR, It gives me great pleasure to find my sentiments of the services 
rendered by you and the officers and men under your command to the 
inhabitants of this State, expressed by the Council; and it is with pecu 
liar satisfaction that I obey their order in communicating the enclosed 
resolution to you, and through you to the officers arid privates who are 
also objects of it." 



LETTERS. 

KNOX TO LA FAYETTE. 

NEW YORK, 14th Dec. 1783. 

I have written to you, my dear Marquis, several times, expressing 
my affection for you, and informing you how dear you were to America in 
general. These sentiments you must not regard as compliments, but the 
language of sincerity. Our independence is now established, and we 
feel the warmest gratitude for all the means which have contributed to 
effect it. 

We have been flattered with the hope of your visiting us again, but in 
this we have not yet been gratified ; but in pursuance of the spirit which 
accompanied us through the war we still hope on. /The English have at 
last left us to ourselves with the full expectation that we shall not know 
how to govern the ship of state, and that we must apply to the steady 
and experienced pilots of Britain. Time, which matures all things, will 
explain this matter. 

Our much loved friend, the General, has gone from this city to Con 
gress, and from thence to Mount Vernon, attended with the entire bless 
ings of his country. How inexpressibly rich are his feelings ! Conscious 
of having done well and at the same time to have his conduct universally 
appreciated is a rare felicity. 

I send this note by the Chevalier Villefranche, who is going with Major 
Rochefontaine to France. They both are men of merit and deserve the 
protection of all good men, therefore I am certain of their receiving your 
countenance. 



144 LETTERS. 



TO LA FAYETTE. 

NEW YORK, 25 July, 1787. 

MY DEAR MARQUIS, I thank you for your highly esteemed favor of 
the 5th of May. The information is truly important [Knox here refers 
to the meeting of the assembly of notables] , and convinces me that the 
French nobility possess the true spirit of justice aid liberality. Go on ! 
you are on the right road, but remember that it is rough and full of dan 
gers. Integrity, intelligence, and perseverance will overcome, but you 
must neither sleep nor slumber politically. I feel so extremely interested, 
my dear Marquis, for your happiness, that I could not restrain the above 
caution : you will attribute it solely to my affection. I know your 
sagacity, and I also know your zeal. You have mighty difficulties to com 
bat : dissipate them, and you attain the summit of human fame. 

Our friend General Washington is anxiously engaged in the business 
of reforming the political machine. The Convention, in which is repre 
sented every State excepting Rhode Island, has been sitting upwards of 
two months, and will probably continue together for two months to come. 
They are secret in their councils, conceiving with great propriety that the 
people ought not to see only half the plan at a time. Whether the prop 
ositions of the Convention will be as useful as the occasion may require 
is a discovery only to be made by time. But from the characters who 
compose the Convention it may be fairly presumed that the result of their 
deliberations will be as wise as could be expected from men under the same 
circumstances. Many of the members without absorbing all the talents 
of the community are certainly men of the first abilities. 

General Washington s judgment is on this great occasion, as it always 
has been, the effect of great deliberation and reflection. It is mature 
and wise. His attendance in the Convention adds, in my opinion, new 
lustre to his character. Secure as he was in his fame, he has again com 
mitted it to the mercy of events. Nothing but the critical situation of 
his country would have induced him to so hazardous a conduct ; but, 
when its happiness is being endangered, he disregards all personal con 
siderations. 



WASHINGTON TO KNOX. 

MOUKT VERNON, 28 Feb. 1785. 

I thank you for the particular account which you have given me of 
the different rivers to which the British have given the name of St. Croix. 
I shall be much mistaken if they do not in other matters as well as this 
give us a good deal of trouble before we are done with them, and yet it 



LETTERS. 145 

does not appear to me that we have -wisdom or national policy enough to 
avert the evils which are impending. How should we, when contracted 
ideas, local pursuits, and absurd jealousies are continually leading us 
from those great and fundamental principles which are characteristic of 
wise and powerful nations, and without which we are no more than a 
rope of sand and shall as easily be broken ? 

In the course of your literary disputes at Boston (on the one side to 
drink tea in company and to be social and gay, on the [other] to impose 
restraints which at no time even were agreeable, and in these days of 
more liberty and indulgence never will be submitted to) , I perceived and 
was most interested by something which was said respecting the compo 
sition for a public walk, which also appears to be one of the exception 
able things. Now, as I am engaged in works of this kind, I would thank 
you if there is any art in the preparation to communicate it to me, 
whether designed for carriages or walking. My gardens have gravel 
walks (as you possibly may recollect), in the usual style, but if a better 
composition has been discovered for these I should gladly adopt it. The 
matter, however, which I wish principally to be informed in is whether 
your walks are designed for carriages, and, if so, how they are prepared 
to resist the pressure of the wheels. I am making a serpentine road to 
my door, and have doubts (which it may be in your power to remove) 
whether any thing short of solid pavement will answer." 



EXTRACTS FROM KNOX S LETTERS TO WASHINGTON RESPECTING THE 
FORMATION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. 

BOSTON, 31st Jan. 1785. 

Your remarks on the present situation of our country are indeed too 
just. The different States have not only different views of the same 
subject, but some of them have views that sooner or later must involve 
the country in all the horrors of civil war. If there is any good policy 
which pervades generally our public measures, it is too mysterious to be 
comprehended by people out of the cabinet. A neglect in every State 
of those principles which lead to union and national greatness, an 
adoption of local in preference to general measures, appear to actuate 
, the greater part of the State politicians. We are entirely destitute of 
(those traits which should stamp us one nation, and the Constitution of 
Congress does not promise any capital alteration for the better. Great 
measures will not be carried in Congress so much by the propriety, 
utility, and necessity of the thing, but as a matter of compromise for 
something else, which may be evil itself, or have a tendency to evil. This 
perhaps is not so much the fault of the members as a defect of the con- 



146 LETTERS. 

federation. Every State considers its representative in Congress not so 
much the legislator of the whole union as its own immediate agent or 
ambassador to negotiate, and to endeavor to create in Congress as great 
;an influence as possible to favor particular views, &c. With a constitu 
tion productive of such dispositions, is it possible that the Americans can 
ever rival the Roman name ? The operation of opening the navigation 
of the rivers so as to communicate with the Western States is truly noble ; 
and, if successful, of which I hope there is not a doubt, it must be fol 
lowed by the most extensively beneficial consequences, which will increase 
in exact proportion to the increase of the population of the country. I 
am pleased that you interest yourself so much in this great work. 

You are so good as to ask whether General Lincoln and myself had an 
agreeable tour to the eastward, and whether the State societies are mak 
ing moves towards obtaining charters. We went to the eastern line of 
this State, and found that the British had made excessive encroachments 
on our territories. There are three rivers in the Bay of Passamaquoddy, 
to which the British have within twenty years past, with a view to con 
found the business, given the name of St. Croix. But the ancient St. 
Croix is the eastern river. The British have settled and built a consid 
erable town called St. Andrews on the middle river, which has always 
sustained among the people in that country the Indian name Schudac. 
The proper St. Croix and the Schudac are only nine miles distant at their 
mouths. They run into the country about sixty miles, and they diverge 
from each other so much, that although at their mouths they are only 
nine miles apart, yet at their sources they are one hundred miles distant 
from each other ; and it is from the source the north line to the mountains 
is to begin. The mountains are distant from the source about 80 or 100 
miles ; so that the difference to this State is 100 miles square above the 
heads of the rivers and the land between the rivers, which must be 60 by 
50 miles square. Our legislature have transmitted the report we made 
on this business to Congress and the Governor of Nova Scotia. The 
matter has been involved designedly by the British in such a manner that 
it can now be settled only by commissioners mutually appointed for that 
purpose. I have seen a letter from Mr. John Adams, dated last October, 
which mentions that the river meant by the treaty of peace was decidedly 
the river next to St. John s River westward ; and there are plenty of proofs 
that the ancient St. Croix was the next to St. John s. I have been par 
ticular in this narration, that you may know the precise state of this affair, 
which it is probable will sooner or later occasion much conversation. 

As to the Cincinnati, the objections against it are apparently removed. 
But I believe none have yet applied for charters. Tn this State it is pretty 
evident from communicating with the members of the legislature that we 
should not succeed. However, we shall attempt it previous to our next 
meeting in July.

{Plan for a General Government.} 

NEW YORK, 14th Jan. 1787. 

. . . Notwithstanding the contrary opinions respecting the proposed 
Convention, were I to presume to give my own judgment it would be in 
favor of the Convention, and I sincerely hope that it may be generally 
attended. ... In my former letters I mentioned that men of reflection 
and principle were tired of the imbecilities of the present government, 
but I did not point out any substitute. It would be prudent to form the 
plan of a new house before we pull down the old one. The subject has 
not been sufficiently discussed as yet in public to decide precisely on the 
form of the edifice. It is out of all question that the foundation must 
be of republican principles, but so modified and wrought together that 
whatever shall be erected thereon should be durable and efficient. I speak 
entirely of the federal government, or, which would be better, one gov 
ernment instead of an association of governments. Were it possible to 
effect a general government of this kind, it might be constituted of an 
Assembly or Lower House, chosen for one, two, or three years ; a Senate, 
chosen for five, six, or seven years ; and the Executive, under the title 
of Governor-General, chosen by the Assembly and Senate for the term 
of seven years, but liable to an impeachment of the Lower House and 
triable by the Senate ; a Judiciary, to be appointed by the Governor- 
General during gdod behavior, but impeachable by the Lower House 
and triable by the Senate ; the laws passed by the general government 
to be obeyed by the local governments, and, if necessary, to be enforced 
by a body of armed men, to be kept for the purposes which should be 
designated ; all national objects to be designed and executed by the 
general government without any reference to the local governments. 
This rude sketch is considered as the government of the least possible 
powers to preserve the confederated governments. To attempt to estab 
lish less will be to hazard the existence of republicanism, and to subject 
us either to a division of the European powers, or to a despotism arising 
from high-handed commotions. 

I have thus, my dear sir, obeyed what seemed to be your desire, and 
given you the ideas which have presented themselves from reflection, and 
the opinion of others. May Heaven direct us to the best means for the 
dignity and happiness of the United States. 

NEW YORK, 19 March, 1787. 

As you have thought proper, my dear sir, to request my opinion 
respecting your attendance at the Convention, I shall give it with the 
utmost sincerity and frankness. 



148 LETTERS. 

I imagine that your own satisfaction or chagrin, and that of your 
friends, will depend entirely on the result of the Convention. For I 
take it for granted that, however reluctantly you may acquiesce, that you 
will be constrained to accept of the president s chair. Hence the pro 
ceedings of the Convention will more immediately be appropriated to 
you than to any other person. 

Were the Convention to propose only amendments and patchwork to 
the present defective confederation, your reputation would in a degree 
suffer. But, were an energetic and judicious system to be proposed with 
your signature, it would be a circumstance highly honorable to your fame 
in the judgment of the present and future ages ; and doubly entitle you 
to the glorious republican epithet, " The Father of your Country." 

But, the men generally chosen being of the first information, great 
reliance may be placed^ on the wisdom and vigor of their councils and 
judgments, and therefore the balance of my opinion preponderates greatly 
in favor of your attendance. 

I am persuaded that your name has had already great influence to 
induce the States to come into the measure ; that your attendance will 
be grateful and your non-attendance chagrining ; that your presence 
would confer on the assembly a national complexion, and that it would 
more than any other circumstance induce a compliance to the proposi 
tions of the Convention. 

I have never written to you concerning your intention of declining to 
accept again the presidency of the Cincinnati. I can only say that the 
idea afflicts me exceedingly. 

That the Society was formed with pure motives you well know. In 
the only instance in which it has had the least political operation the 
effects have been truly noble. I mean in Massachusetts, where the 
officers are still unpaid and extremely depressed in their private circum 
stances, but notwithstanding which the moment the government was in 
danger they unanimously pledged themselves for its support, while 
the few wretched officers who were against government were not of the 
Cincinnati. The clamor and prejudice which existed against it are no 
more. The men who have been most against it say that the Society is 
the only bar to lawless ambition and dreadful anarchy to which the im 
becility of government renders us so liable, and the same men express 
their apprehensions of your resignation. 

Could I have the happiness of a private conversation with you, I think 
I could offer you such reasons as to induce you to suspend your decision 
for another period of three years. Suffer me then, my dear sir, to 
entreat that you would come to Philadelphia one week earlier than you 
would in order te attend the Convention, and to cheer the hearts of your 
old military friends with your presence. This would rivet their affections, 



LETTERS. 149 

and entirely remove your embarrassment in this respect of attending the 
Convention. 

God, -who knows my heart, knows that I would not solicit this step, 
were I of opinion that your reputation would suffer the least injury by it. 
I fully believe that it would not. But I believe that should you attend 
the Convention, and not meet the Cincinnati, that it would sorely wound 
your sincere friends, and please those who dare not avow themselves 
your enemies. 



9 April, 1787. 

... It is the general wish that you should attend. It is conceived to be 
highly important to the success of the propositions of the Convention. 
The mass of the people feel the inconveniences of the present govern 
ment, and ardently wish for such alterations as would remedy them. The 
Convention appears the only means to effect the alterations peaceably. 
If that should be unattended by a proper weight of wisdom and character, 
so as to carry into execution its propositions, we are to look to events 
and force for a remedy. Were you not then to attend the Convention, 
slander and malice might suggest that force would be the most agreeable 
mode of recourse to you. When civil commotion rages, no purity of 
character and services, however exalted, can entirely shield from the 
shafts of calumny. 

On the other hand, the unbounded confidence the people have in your 
tried patriotism and wisdom would exceedingly facilitate the adoption of 
any important alterations that might be proposed by a Convention of 
which you were a member, and, as I before hinted, President. 

... I have a letter from the Marquis de la Fayette of the 7th of Feb 
ruary. He looks forward to military employment in this country for the 
reduction of the western posts and Canada. But one might venture to 
predict that no such operations will be undertaken until the government 
shall be radically amended : at present we are all imbecility. 



14th Aug. 1787. 

. . . Although I frankly confess that the existence of the state govern 
ments is an insuperable evil in a national point of view, yet I do not well 
see how in this stage of the business they could be annihilated ; and per 
haps, while they continue, the frame of government could not with pro 
priety be much higher toned than the one proposed. It is so infinitely 
preferable to the present constitution, and gives such a bias to a proper 
line of conduct in future, that I think all men anxious for a national gov 
ernment should zealously embrace it. 

The education, genius, and habits of men on this continent are so 

20 



150 LETTERS. 

various, and of consequence their views of the same subject so different, 
that I am satisfied with the result of the Convention, although it is short 
lof my wishes and of my judgment. But when I find men of the purest 
intentions concur in embracing a system which, on the highest delibera 
tion, seems to be the best which can be obtained under present circum 
stances, I am convinced of the propriety of its being strenuously supported 
by all those who have wished for a national republic of higher and more 
durable powers. 



3d Oct. 1787. 

. . . Every point of view in which I have been able to place the subject 
induces me to believe that the moment in which the Convention assembled 
and the result thereof are to be estimated among those fortunate circum 
stances in the affairs of men which give a decided influence to the happi 
ness of society for a long period of time. Hitherto every thing promises 
well. The new constitution is received with great joy by all the commer 
cial part of the community. The people of Boston are in raptures with 
it as it is, but would have liked it still better had it been higher toned. 

I trust in God that the foundation of a good national government is 
laid. A way is opened to such alterations and amendments from time to 
time as shall be judged necessary ; and the government, being subjected 
to a revision by the people, will not be so liable to abuse. The first 
legislature ought to be the ablest and most disinterested men of the com 
munity. Every well-founded objection which shall be stated in the course 
of the discussions on the subject should be; fairly considered, and such 
fundamental laws enacted as would tend to obviate them. 



NEW YOKK, 10th Feb. 1788. 

. . . The constitution has labored in Massachusetts exceedingly more 
than was expected. The opposition has not arisen from a consideration 
of the merits or demerits of the thing itsi-lf as a political machine, but 
from a deadly principle levelled at the existence of all government what 
ever. The principle of insurgency expanded, deriving fresh strength and 
life from the impunity with which the rebellion of last year was suffered 
to escape. It is a singular circumstance that in Massachusetts the prop 
erty, the ability, and the virtue of the State are almost solely in favor of 
the constitution. Opposed to it are the late insurgents and all those who 
abetted their designs, constituting four-fifths of the opposition. A few, 
very few indeed, well-meaning people are joined to them. The friends 
of the constitution in that State, without overrating their own importance, 
conceived that the decision of Massachusetts would most probably settle 
the late of the proposition. They therefore proceeded most cautiously,

and wisely debated every objection with the most guarded good nature 
and candor, but took no questions on the several paragraphs, and thereby 
prevented the establishment of parties. This conduct has been attended 
with the most beneficial consequences. It is now no secret that, on the 
opening of the Convention, a majority were prejudiced against it.

HON. HARRISON GRAY OTIS S REMINISCENCES OF KNOX. 

(Ex*, act from a Letter to lion. Charles S. D-iceis, 3 Nov. 1845.) 

" I first became acquainted with him when I was nine years old. He 
then kept the London Bookstore in (now) Washington Street, where 
Brewer & Co. now keep a large druggist establishment.* . . . The oppo 
sition of her (Miss Flucker s) family to the connection was no secret in 

* Xo. 02 Washington Street, where the " Globe " newspaper is now published. 



152 STRICTURES UPON GENERAL KNOX. 

Boston. I learnt it in my mother s family circle, which moved in the 
same clique with the Fluckers at times. 

" From 1801 to the end of his life, my acquaintance with him was upon 
the most intimate and cordial footing. . . . We were together in the 
legislature of Massachusetts. lie did not possess the talent of debate, 
but was unaffectedly diffident of his oratorical powers. He was never 
theless a iluent and effective speaker. He had the gift of natural 
eloquence ; his imagination was ardent, and his style sublimated perhaps 
to a fault. He often inscribed his notes upon the backs of cards ; a few 
of which he held in his lame hand, and shuffled them over as if sorting 
them for a game of whist ; and no man commanded more attention and 
respect than were willingly yielded by his auditors as a homage to his 
unquestioned sincerity, magnanimity, and grandeur of soul. But it was 
in familiar conversation with friends, and in the social, commercial, and 
polished circles of society that he figured to the best advantage. 

"As Knox s matrimonial connection was a love-match, and both par 
ties possessed great good sense and were proud of each other, it was 
understood by their friends that their mutual attachment had never 
waned. It was, however, well known that they frequently differed in 
opinion upon the current trifles of the day, and that the irce. amantium, 
though always followed by the inteyratio amor is, were not unfrequent ; 
and that in those pttty skirmishes our friend showed his generalship by 
a skilful retreat. On one occasion, at a very large dinner-party at their 
own house, the cloth having been removed, the General ordered the 
servants to take away also the woollen cover, which madam with an 
atidible voice prohibited. He then instantly, addressing the whole circle, 
observed: This subject of the under cloth is the only one on which 
Mrs. Knox and I have differed since our marriage. The archness and 
good humor of this appeal to the company were irresistible, and pro 
duced, as was intended, a general merriment." 



STRICTURES UPON GENERAL KNOX. 

Mr. Parton, in his paper upon Washington s cabinet in the " Atlantic 
Monthly " for Jan. 1873, does great injustice to the abilities of Knox. 

He asserts that Knox was acquainted with only one subject (war) ; 
that he was not a man of capacious or inquisitive mind ; that he was one 
who must take his opinions from another mind or not have any opinions ; 
that he was in the cabinet of Washington " the giant shadow of his 
diminutive friend Hamilton ; " and that his original remedy for the ills of 
the Confederacy was to extinguish the State governments and establish 
an imposing general government with plenty of soldiers to enforce its 
decrees. 



STRICTURES UPON GENERAL KNOX 153 

The question naturally arises, How came sueh a man in Washington 1 ! 

cabinet? Did Washington read men so badly that after a fourteen years 
intimacy in camp and council, having had frequent occasion to test his 
capacity not only as a soldier, but as a diplomatist in conferences with the 
French generals and admirals ; with Carleton the British commander ; in 
allaying the discontents of the army and in disbanding it ; and not only 
that, but having witnessed his career as War Secretary for four years 
preceding his presidency, that after all this experience he could have 
been so egregiously deceived ? How came he to retain him in a position 
for which, according to Mr. Parton, he was so signally unfit ? 

This problem admits, after all, of a simple explanation. It is found 
in the hostility of Mr. Jefferson to Knox, arising solely from political 
antagonism, and which Mr. Parton seems to have fully imbibed. This 
bias may still further be accounted for by a habit into which Mr. Parton 
has, perhaps unconsciously, fallen, of magnifying and overestimating his 
heroes, and by way of contrast of belittleing and depreciating the char 
acter and abilities of their political rivals or opponents. The fact that 
such an erroneous judgment could have been made shows conclusively 
the existence of a want which we have endeavored, in the present vol 
ume, in some slight degree to supply. 

The letters and papers of General Knox render it evident that he was 
well informed not only upon military matters, but that upon such subjects 
as politics, finance, and government, his opinions were sought and 
valued by many of the best minds of the time. If Mr. Parton is right, 
then Rufus King, Judge Marshall, Governor Strong, Alexander Hamil 
ton, and Washington were all wrong. As an illustration of the capacity 
and originality of Knox, we commend to Mr. Parton s examination his 
plan for a general government (ante, page 559). Many persons who 
read this paper for the first time will be surprised to leain that practically 
the leading outlines of this plan are embodied in our system of govern 
ment ; and they may also suspect that in those particulars wherein it 
varies from the present form, as in the length of the presidential term 
(seven years) and the choice of president by Congress, rather than by 
the present perverted electoral college system, this narrow-minded man 
of one idea saw nearly a century ago what we are now just beginning to 
see. 

That Hamilton and Knox, the two Federalists in the cabinet, should gen 
erally agree, is not at all strange ; nor is it strange that such agreement 
should occur with respect to measures to which Jefferson and his anti-federal 
colleague, Randolph, were hostile. That they did not always agree was 
evident upon the question whether the French Convention was a legiti 
mate body, and upon the more vital subject of the establishment of a 
navy, upon both of which questions Knox carried his point against Ham 
ilton s opposition. It is most certainly true that Knox, in common with 



154 STRICTURES UPON GENERAL KNOX. 

the great majority of the thinking men of the time, saw and deprecated 
the weakness and imbecility of the Confederation, and earnestly desired 
a government which could make itself respected at home and abroad, 
and which could develop the resources of the country, and promote 
national unity. To this end he labored assiduously ; and his letters, which 
are replete with sound and practical views upon these great questions, 
furnish a sufficient refutation of such ill-considered judgments as those 
we have pointed out.
