COMMUNICATIONS OF THE FRENCH MINISTER TO 

CONGRESS. 

In Congress, September 21st, 1781. 

The committee, to whom was referred the Memorial of 
the Minister Plenipotentiary of France, dated the 18th 
instant, requesting a conference, report, 

That they have this day h«ld a conference with the 
said Minister Plenipotentiary, and received the following 
communications contained in sundry despatches from 
Count de Vergennes, Minister for Foreign Affairs to his 
Most Christian Majesty, viz. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 5 

From a letter of the 19th of April. — That Count de 
Vergennes had transmitted to the Minister the details 
respecting the proposed mediation of the Courts of Vi- 
enna and Petersburg. The Minister observed, that this 
had already been communicated to Congress through a 
committee. He repeated, for our recollection, that the 
acceptance on the part of France of the proposed me- 
diation depended entirely, at that time, on the concurrence 
of the United States ; and that with respect to Spain, its 
conduct would be determined by the dissolution of the 
negotiation with Mr Cumberland. That the Court of 
Spain had informed the Court of London, on the first 
proposal of the mediation of the Imperial Courts, lhat as 
a direct negotiation with the King of Great Britain 
was opened through Mr Cumberland, a mediation was 
unnecessary. 

That affairs since that time had taken a different turn. 
Mr Cumberland has been recalled ; and the Catholic 
King, being now entirely at liberty, has accepted the me- 
diation of the two Imperial Courts. That the King, our 
ally, had done the same ; but that both Kings had de- 
clared at the same time to the two mediators, that the 
mediation could not possibly have any activity, without 
previously establishing some fundamental preliminaries. 
Of this observation the two mediating Courts had already 
felt the propriety. That France was then (viz. the 19th 
of April) expecting the effect, which this communication 
would produce on the Court of London. That the first 
question proposed by France, related to the admission 
of an American Plenipotentiary; and that the object of 
the second was to know, upon what footing the King of 
England intended to treat with the United States. The 



6 LUZERNE. 

Court of France, not knowing that the United States had 
agreed to accept the mediation, again invite us to it. 

The Minister here observed, that Congress would judge 
by the questions proposed to the mediating powers, by the 
King his master, of the principles, by which his Majesty 
was actuated with respect to the United States. He as- 
sured us, that his Majesty is invariably resolved to abide 
by those principles, and will enter into no negotiation what- 
ever before he shall receive a satisfactory solution of those 
two questions. He added, that the French Ministry 
trusted, that this conduct would more and more convince 
the United States, and would cause them to imitate the 
example of the King, and to feel that their honor and their 
interest call for their constant attachment, their friendship, 
and unreserved confidence towards him. 

The Count de Vergennes observes, that it is plain from 
these circumstances, that the negotiation for peace will be 
full of difficulties, and that it will probably be necessary, 
in pretensions as well as proceedings, to be very cautious, 
and to act so as to remove those difficulties, and every- 
thing, which might increase the acrimony, to which the 
English Plenipotentiaries may be naturally inclined. 

From another letter of the same date. — That when 
this letter was written, the Court had received informa- 
tion of the sentiments of the Court of London with re- 
spect to the United States. The Count de Vergennes 
mentions, that in the act, by which the Court of London 
accepts the mediation of Russia, and requests the me- 
diation of the Emperor, she declares, that she is ready 
to make peace, as soon as the league between France 
and her revolted subjects shall be dissolved. That this 
pretension had met from the Court of France the con- 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 7 

tempt which it deserved. She on her part has declared, 
that if this proposition contained the last determination of 
England, it would be in vain to think of peace ; and she 
has desired the English Ministry to give a positive answer 
on the two questions above mentioned. That this declara- 
tion had been exactly transmitted by the Court of Vienna 
to that of London ; and the result of the answer made by 
that Court to the Imperial Majesty is, "that in all points 
to be agitated in a future Congress, England will behave 
with great equity and condescension ; but the dependence 
of her rebel subjects in America must be pre-established, 
and that this matter must be left entirely to the care of 
Great Britain" That it is easily to be perceived, that 
while things remain in this situation there can be no possi- 
bility of a mediation or peace. 

The Count de Vergenr.es remarks, that Congress will 
be finally convinced, that it is only by arms and the most 
vigorous exertions, that our independence can be extorted 
from the Court of London, and not at all by negotiation 
or persuasion. That the Court of France will transmit to 
the Court of Vienna the sentiments of the King on the 
British answer. That if these sentiments should be for- 
warded to the Court of London without any commen- 
tary, it is probable they would make but a slight impres- 
sion ; but it may be hoped from the justice of his Impe- 
rial Majesty, that they will be so supported by such reflec- 
tions as to make a greater impression on the British Court; 
although it is not to be expected, that the Austrian Court 
will fully enter into the views of his Most Christian Maj- 
esty, until the matter shall be more perfectly explained. 
The Count, nevertheless, urges the necessity of sending 
forward proper instructions and powers for the mediation. 



g LUZERNE. 

From a letter of the 11th of May. — That the affair 
of the mediation has made no progress; and that it is 
very probable, that the mediators will not be soon ena- 
bled to begin the negotiation. That the admission of an 
American Plenipotentiary presents the greatest difficulties. 
That the Count, however, will take every measure in his 
power to have this admission decided in favor of the United 
States, before the regular, opening of the mediation. The 
Count urges the Chevalier de la Luzerne to observe to 
Congress, that the best manner of removing these obsta- 
cles would be a decisive victory, gained by the United 
States in the present campaign. 

From a letter of the 21ih of July. — Count de Vergennes 
observes on an opinion, which prevailed in America, re- 
specting the friendly disposition of the powers of Europe 
towards the United States, that as yet, not one Court had 
taken the least step, which manifests their disposition to- 
wards the United States. That the Courts of Vienna 
and Petersburg, having assumed the character of medi- 
ators, cannot be too reserved. For by a different conduct 
they would become obnoxious to one or other of the bel- 
ligerent powers, and lose the important and glorious part, 
with which they are intrusted. That it results from these 
observations, that the United States ought to look upon 
themselves as being still separated from all other powers ; 
and that they have but one professed friend, which is 
France ; and that the United States ought to rely princi- 
pally upon their own resources. 

The Count de Vergennes observes, that he has talked 
circumstantially with Mr Adams on these subjects, who 
appeared to be satisfied with what had been done in favor 
of his country. That he had communicated to Mr Adams 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. Q 

the preliminary overtures made by the two Imperial 
Courts, as well as the intended answer of his Most Chris- 
tian Majesty. That the great or only difficulty concerns 
America. That France will do all in her power to re- 
move that obstacle, upon which depends the activity of 
the mediation. That as soon as it shall be removed, or 
proved to be insurmountable, proper instructions will be 
forwarded to the Chevalier de la Luzerne, concerning the 
conduct, which the state of 'affairs will require from Con- 
gress. That the Court of France had received, with 
great satisfaction, information, that Congress were disposed 
to trust their interest to the two mediating powers. The 
Chevalier de la Luzerne is directed to inform Congress, 
that no use shall be made of this disposition, in the present 
state of affairs ; and that it shall be communicated only 
when it can be done consistently with the dignity of the 
United States. 

From a letter of the 19th of April. — That Mr Dana 
has communicated to Count de Vergennes his appointment, 
and requested his advice concerning the conduct, which 
circumstances demanded on his part. That it gave the 
Count great pleasure to observe this proof of the confi- 
dence, which Congress and their Ministers reposed in the 
friendship and advice of his Court. That the Count in- 
formed Mr Dana, that he would run the risk of exposing 
his person, and the dignity of the United States, if he as- 
sumed any character whatsoever in Russia, while the Em- 
press had not acknowledged the independence of the 
United States, and expected to act the part of a mediatrix, 
which demanded the most perfect impartiality. That 
Mr Dana felt the propriety of the observation ; and pro- 
posed to the Count, that he should appear in Russia in 

VOL. XI. 2 



10 LUZERNE. 

the character of a common traveller, keep his commission 
a secret, and avoid with the greatest care to speak of bus- 
iness, unless requested so to do by the Russian Ministry. 
That the Count fully approved of this prudent scheme ; 
and apprized Mr Dana of all the difficulties he would 
meet with. He had him recommended to the Marquis de 
Verac, Envoy Extraordinary at the Court of Petersburg ; 
and the Chevalier de la Luzerne is directed to assure 
Congress, that the Marquis de Verac would do all in his 
power for Mr Dana's best reception, and with pleasure 
assist him with his counsels, as often as he should have 
recourse to them. That the Marquis de Verac had com- 
municated to the Russian Ministry the resolution of Con- 
gress, concerning the principle of the declaration made 
by the Empress of Russia to the belligerent powers. 
That this Envoy informs the Count de Vergennes, that 
the contents of this resolulion had afforded great satis- 
faction to Count Panin, Minister of Foreign Affairs, who 
intended to submit it without delay to the perusal of the 
Empress. That the Marquis de Verac did not doubt, 
but that she would be pleased with the readiness of Con- 
gress to adopt that principle ; and that correspondent 
resolutions will have been taken respecting the navigation 
of the neutrals. 

From a letter of the 29th of June. — That the acces- 
sion of the State of Maryland to the general confederation, 
in the opinion of the Court of France, presents very great 
advantages ; among which is this, that Congress having 
at last acquired that power, which the act of confederation 
has assigned them, it is to be expected, that their orders 
will be fully and exactly executed, and that they will take 
advantage of the resources of their country, to give to 



A 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. \ \ 

American patriotism new energy. The Minister is directed 
to inform Congress of the satisfaction the King has re- 
ceived on that account, and to tell them at the same time, 
that there is the most pressing necessity to take more ef- 
fectual measures than heretofore to drive the British out 
of this continent. It is thought needless to enter into de- 
tails about the circumstances, which render this measure 
necessary. The King entreats the United States, as his 
friends, not to lose a moment in acting as vigorously as 
possible against the common enemy. That Congress can- 
not be particularly acquainted with the different burdens, 
which France has upon her hands. She wishes to be in 
a situation to continue as effectual assistance to tl e United 
States as at this moment ; but future events may happen 
in a manner different from what we may expect, though 
nothing can change her unalterable resolution to support 
the independence of her ally. Tiie Count de Vergennes 
observes, that he shall not speak any more of the non 
arrival of the second division, having reason to believe 
from orders given to Count de Grasse, that the delay will 
be judged of greater utility to the United States, than if 
the announced reinforcement had been sent in the time 
expected. He -adds, that the Chevalier de la Luzerne 
had been already informed of the causes, which had pre- 
vented a compliance with the expectation, which he had 
been authorised to give. 

From a letter of the Wth of May. — That the Count 
de Vergennes had been informed by the Due de la 
Vauguyon, Ambassador to the United Provinces, of the 
intention of Mr Adams to display his character as a Min- 
ister of the United States in Holland. That the Duke 
gave him no assistance on that occasion, knowing the ap- 




12 



LUZERNE, 



plication would have no favorable issue. The Chevalier 
de la Luzerne is directed to inform confidentially a com- 
mittee, or Congress themselves, of these circumstances, 
in order, that they may transmit to their said Minister 
Plenipotentiary such instructions as they may think proper. 
France is too much interested in the fate of the United 
States not to give them such counsels as would have for a 
principal object their advantage and their dignity. 



At a second conference, on the 24th of September, the 
following additional communications were made by the 
French Minister to the committee. 

From a letter of the 19th of April, 1781.— That Count 
de Vergennes remarks, that on the application of Chev- 
alier de la Luzerne, and his representation of the distresses 
of the United States, measures had been taken for our 
aid when Colonel Laurens arrived. That it being impos- 
sible for the King to comply with all Colonel Laurens's 
demands, he took the resolution to offer his guarantee for 
ten millions of livres tournois, to be borrowed in Holland, 
for account of the United States. That the King was 
sensible of the wants and distresses of Congress, and 
wished to relieve them ; but that it ought to be considered; 
that the French squadron and troops are in America for 
our immediate assistance. That Count de Grasse's ex- 
pedition to America will occasion great expense; and that 
all those things collected together, would go far beyond 
even the expectation of Congress. That the most essen- 
tial manner of showing the gratitude of the United States 
would be, by making all the exertions in their power, to 
co-operate in a gl rious and effectual mainer with the 
King's forces for their own speedy deliverance. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. Jg 

The Count de Vergennes observes, that a part of the 
six millions of livres would be employed in purchasing 
the different articles, contained in a list delivered by Mr 
Laurens. That three millions would be given by instal- 
ments to Dr Franklin, for the payment of bills of exchange 
drawn by Congress. That a fourth million would be re- 
served for unforeseen emergencies, and particularly to pay 
for the supplies embarked in the ship Lafayette. That 
Count de Vergennes had been Dr Franklin's security for 
a part of those supplies, amounting to four hundred and 
seventeen thousand livres. That he is unacquainted with 
the measures, which had been taken to effectuate the loan 
of ten millions in Holland, that affair being in the province 
of M. Necker, who probably would settle that matter with 
Mr Laurens, or with Mr Adams, who at that time was 
still in Holland to fill up a loan of a million florins, which 
lie had opened several months before. 

From a letter of the Wth of May. — That Count de 
Vergennes informs the Chevalier de la Luzerne, that or- 
ders had been given by the King to have the loan of 
ten millions, on account of the United States, negotiated ; 
that the Due de la Vauguyon had received orders to 
propose it to the States of Holland, but met with insu- 
perable difficulties, not only because the United States 
had no credit in Holland, but also because that Province 
was afraid of exposing itself; and that indeed granting 
a loan to the United States would be the same thing as 
countenancing their independence, which would be con- 
trary to the obligations entered into by the republic with 
the neutral powers ; that in order to remove this difficulty, 
the King had presented himself as a principal borrower, 
and as being alone accountable for the sums, which were 
to be furnished. 



14 LUZERNE. 

The Count adds, that he thinks these proceedings need 
no commentary ; and that a mere exposition of them will 
be sufficient to excite the gratitude of the United States, 
and to engage them at last to make all the exertions in 
their power. The Count flatters himself, that the meas- 
ures, which have been taken by his Court, will enable 
Congress to put their finances in the best order. That the 
Chevalier de la Luzerne had often written to him, that 
the most certain way to effectuate so happy an event 
would be, to put Congress for a while out of their dis- 
tressing situation, and to enable them, by an external re- 
lief, to take internal measures without precipitation, and 
with solidity. That these considerations determined the 
King ; and that from affection he has done more for his 
ally than mere prudence would, perhaps, have suggested 
to him. That the Council of the King have no doubt 
but this resolution will be productive of the good effects, 
which the Chevalier de la Luzerne had announced. The 
Count exhorts Congress to take hold of the present cir- 
cumstances for the common advantage. He thinks it his 
duty freely and openly to declare, that the moment is 
come not to spend the time in expectation, deliberation, 
and useless exhortations ; that though he would wish to 
avoid every disagreeable intimation, friendship and com- 
mon interest oblige France to speak without reserve, and 
with perfect sincerity. That the King has done on this 
occasion what he can do no more ; that Congress, if well 
informed of the situation of his Majesty's affairs, would 
be sensible that an exertion like the present cannot be 
repeated ; and that the Court would feel the deepest con- 
cern, if it was under the disagreeable but indispensable 
necessity of refusing the demands of an ally, whose cause 
is now become its own. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 15 

From a letter of the 14th of May. — That Count de 
Vergennes observes, that Colonel Laurens had taken leave 
of the King, and that he ought to be satisfied with the suc- 
cess of his mission, although he had not obtained all that 
he demanded. That the Court of France hopes these 
demands will not be renewed ; for how disagreeable soever 
to refuse allies whom the King sincerely loves, necessity 
would oblige him to reject pecuniary demands of any kind 
whatsoever. 

From a letter of the 27th of July. — That the Cheva- 
lier de la Luzerne observed, that in March last he inform- 
ed Congress, that the Court no longer pay the bills drawn 
upon France ; upon which declaration he believes Con- 
gress stopped all drafts on Dr Franklin. That he informed 
the Court of that resolution of Congress. The Court in 
the meantime had resolved to grant a subsidy of six mil- 
lions, to be employed in purchasing arms, ammunition, and 
clothing, to be sent from France to the United States ; and 
the remainder of the sum to be employed in paying the 
drafts of Congress, or of any person they might appoint. 
Mr Morris being appointed Superintendent, the Minister 
according to bis instructions authorised him to draw for half 
a million of livres, and informed M. Necker of this meas- 
ure ; accordingly funds were prepared for a regular pay- 
ment. The Chevalier de la Luzerne had agreed with the 
Superintendent, that he might draw in the whole for a 
million and a half, including the half million above men- 
tioned ; of all which he had informed Count de Vergennes. 
Colonel Laurens being in the meanwhile arrived in 
France, it was found from his representation, that the 
mode of drawing was prejudicial to Congress, and that 
if the specie was imported, there would be no loss; and 



j6 LUZERNE. 

it was agreed, that he should bring over two millions and 
a half, out of the six millions, in specie. In consequence 
of this measure, Count de Vergennes acquaints the Chev- 
alier de la Luzerne, that he hopes the Superintendent will 
not have drawn more than the before mentioned half mil- 
lion of livres. He wishes it the more earnestly, as bills 
for a greater sum would embarrass the finances of France 
in a great degree, the goods delivered to Colonel Laurens 
exceeding already the sum remaining out of the six mil- 
lions, and the goods taken on board the Marquis de La- 
fayette being not yet replaced. 

For a fuller explanation, the Chevalier de la Luzerne 
communicated to the Committee an account of the sums 
already furnished, and to be furnished from this time to 
the end of the present year for the service of the United 
States. That he had orders to take hold of this oppor- 
tunity to repeat to Congress, that the King for the next 
year cannot continue any supplies to the United States, 
even of a much less nature. That it is time for them to 
relieve his Majesty from the heavy burdens in a war, which 
he had undertaken and carries on for their sakes. That 
the Count de Vergennes expects, that Congress will not 
have drawn more bills of any kind after the 1st day of 
April last ; that firmly relying on this, he had engaged the 
King to procure the necessary sums to answer the bills 
drawn before that period, and desired Dr Franklin to ac- 
cept no more, if he had no other means of paying them ; 
that this resolution could not be altered by any circum- 
stances whatever. 

The Count de Vergennes proceeds to state, how far 
the abuse of the King's benevolence had been carried, he 
supposes against the will and instructions and without the 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. [•} 

knowledge of Congress. That the bills drawn upon Mr 
Jay, Mr Adams, and Mr Laurens, had been sent back to 
Dr Franklin, that is, in effect to the Court of France. 
That the Republic of Holland had been unwilling to hear 
of any loan, even under the guarantee of the King, when 
it was known that the money was intended for the use of 
the United States ; and that to remove this obstacle, as he 
had before observed, the King was induced to present 
himself as the principal borrower. The Court was still 
unacquainted with the effect of that proposition.

informs your Excellency, that In consequence of the arti- 
cles of capitulation granted to the troops and inhabitants 
of his Britannic Majesty at the reduction of Pensacola, by 
Don Bernardo de Galvez, commander in chief of the 
forces of his Catholic Majesty, permission was granted 
by the Governor of the place to Captain Jahleel Smith, 
with his vessel called the Sally, her crew and passengers 
contained in the passport, to go to New York, six of the 
passengers being prisoners on parole, to be exchanged for 
an equal number of Spanish prisoners; that in his pas- 
sage the said flag was captured by an American vessel, 
called the Betsy, Captain Enos, belonging to the Slate of 
Pennsylvania ; that in consequence thereof, the said J. 
Smith has presented to me a petition and an account,

CONGRESS TO THE MINISTER OF FRANCE. 

Philadelphia, September 25th, 1781. 
Sir, 

The United States in Congress assembled, ever desir- 
ous to observe good faith and maintain the rights of neu- 
trality, and sincerely disposed to cultivate the friendship 
of his Catholic Majesty, have referred the Memorial pre- 
sented by your Excellency, in favor of Jahleel Smith, 
master of the schooner Sally, to a committee of Congress, 
who now have it under consideration. 

To form a right judgment of the transaction it is con- 
ceived necessary, that an authentic copy of the capitula- 
tion granted by his Catholic Majesty's General to the 
British officer lately commanding at Pensacola, and re- 
ferred to in the Memorial of Don Francisco Rendon, 
residing in this city, Encargado de Negocios for the 
Court of Spain, should be communicated to the United 
States. In the meantime it requires no deliberation to 
assure your Excellency, that the laws of the land are com- 
petent for redressing every injury perpetrated by vessels 
of war commissioned by the United States, or under 
their authority, although the security for the good beha- 
viour of the officers and crews may not be adequate to 
the damages claimed.

the Sixteenth, King of France and Navarre. 

Great, Faithful and Beloved Friend and Ally, 

We feel an additional obligation to your Majesty, for 
your friendly reception of our late special Minister Lieu- 
tenant Colonel John Laurens. By him we received your 
Majesty's letter, containing new assurances of what the 
United States have been long convinced, your Majesty's 
affectionate patronage of American independence. His 
report, while it proves that our attachment has not been 
misplaced, will increase our gratitude. We have charged 
our Minister Plenipotentiary at your Court to render to 
your Majesty more particular acknowledgments for your 
zeal for the re-establishment of peace, upon principles co- 
inciding with the liberty and sovereignty of the United 
States, and for the important succors lately administered 
to our necessities. We shall also instruct him to inform 
your Majesty of the arrangements, which have taken place 
for calling forth the resources of the United States with 
decision and effect against the common enemy. 

We pray God, that he will keep your Majesty, our 
Great, Faithful and Beloved Friend and Ally, in his holy 
protection. 

Done at Philadelphia, the eighteenth of October, in the 
year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty-

show their sense of the exertions of their ally, and of 
the merit of the officers he employs. The confidence 
inspired by the first, and the esteem excited by the

effectuating the surrender.*

Philadelphia, November 4th, 1781. 
Sir, 

I have received the letter, with which you honored 
me on the 2d instant, with the resolutions of Congress 
of the 28th of October, which accompanied it. I have 
no doubt that they will be most agreeable to his 
Majesty, and that he will learn with great pleasure, 
that the remembrance of the success obtained by the 
allied arms is to be preserved by a column, on which 
a relation of this event will be inscribed, and mention 
made of the alliance. 

I shall be glad, before any farther resolutions are 
taken on this subject, to communicate to you some 
ideas relative to this monument. It is so honorable to 
the two nations, and so well adapted to perpetuate the 
remembrance of their union, that we ought to be 
mutually desirous of giving it all the solidit)' and dura- 
bility of which the works of man are susceptible.

usage Congress intends to adopt on this subject, in 
order that I may make it known to my Court.

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO M. DE LA LUZERNE. 

Office of Foreign Affairs, November 6th, 1781. 

Sir, 

Having been honored with your letter of the 4th 
instant, I remark with pleasure, that the mode in which 
Congress propose to perpetuate the success obtained 
by the allied armies at York, is such as will in your 
opinion be agreeable to his Most Christian Majesty. 
As Congress must concur with you in wishing to ren- 
der this monument of the alliance, and of the military 
virtues of the combined forces as lasting, if possible, as 
the advantages they may reasonably hope to reap from 
both, they will, without doubt, pay all due deference 
to any ideas you may think proper to suggest relative 
to the manner of carrying the resolutions of the 23th 
of October into effect. I shall receive, Sir, with 
pleasure, and submit to Congress any communications, 
that you will do me the honor to make on this subject. 

I am sorry to find, that you consider the order, in 
which the allied nations or their Sovereigns are placed 
in the resolutions, as anywise exceptionable. This 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 27 

mode of expression might perhaps be justified by the 
absolute equality established between sovereign pow- 
ers, and the common practice of independent nations 
to recognise no superior in acts to be executed by 
themselves, within their own limits. But, Sir, I am 
so well satisfied that Congress wish to avoid discus- 
sions, which must be treated with great delicacy by 
nations situated as ours are, where every demand on 
the one part, not strictly authorised by the law of 
nations, might derogate from the generous protection, 
which we make it our boast to have received, and the 
denial of just rights on the other subject us to the 
imputation of ingratitude, that I think you may safely 
rely upon their practice, when some future occasion 
shall present, to evince that the order in which the 
allied nations are mentioned did not originate in 
any settled rule, and above all, that no want of respect 
for his Most Christian Majesty dictated the resolution 
to which you object. Be persuaded, Sir, that regard- 
less as the United States are of form and ceremony, in 
matters that relate to themselves alone, they will think 
their endeavor to support France in the high rank 
which her extent, wealth, and power have given her, 
a small return for the wise and generous use she 
makes of these advantages. 

I have the honor to be, with sentiments of the 
greatest respect and esteem, &c.

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Office of Foreign Affairs, November 6th, 1781. 
Sir, 

I do myself the honor to submit to Congress a 
letter to the Minister of France, which covered 
their resolutions of the 2Sth of October, his answer 
thereto, and the draft of a letter in reply to his. 
As the last implies a promise on the part of 
Congress, I did not think myself authorised to send it 
without their approbation. 

Congress will observe, that I endeavor to wave a 
question, which perhaps it might have been imprudent 
to answer by a direct avowal of the propriety of the 
resolution, or in the present circumstances to yield in 
express terms. By seeming to slight matters of mere 
ceremony, we may avoid troublesome discussions in 
future, and teach the old world by the example of the 
new to get rid of a clog, which too often fetters the 
most important transactions. I take the liberty to 
submit to Congress the propriety of directing in the 
next vote, which they shall have occasion to pass, in 
which France and America, or their Sovereigns, are 
mentioned, the preference to be given to the first, and 
so that we may seem to have established no rule on a 
subject of so little moment as rank or precedence. 

I have the honor to be, &c.

property of such of the enemy's vessels as are taken 
by their mariners ; and being called by the letter, a 
copy of which I do myself the honor to enclose, to 
attend particularly to the case of Captain Jones and his 
crew, I must beg, Sir, that you will do me the favor

Commander in Chief of the French Leeward Islands, 
for whose use I enclose a certified copy of the above 
mentioned resolutions of Congress, presuming that the 
Court of Admiralty will pay some respect to them in 
their decisions, though they may not be strictly agree- 
able to the rules they have adopted, since it would be 
highly disadvantageous to both nations to have that 
considered as lawful prize in one port, which is not so 
in another. But should the Court think they are not 
warranted in condemning the vessel, she should at 
least be restored to Captain Jones or his agent, that 
she might, by being brought to a port of the United 
States, become lawful prize.

HEADS OF A VERBAL COMMUNICATION MADE TO THE 
SECRETARY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS BY THE MINISTER 
OF FRANCE. 

In Congress, November 23d, 1781. 

The Secretary of Foreign Affairs laid before Congress 
the following heads of a verbal communication made to 
him by the Minister of France. 

The Minister of France informed the Secretary of 
Foreign Affairs, that the Count de Vergennes, in a letter 
to him of the 7th of September, 1781, assured him that 
the King of France had received with great pleasure, an 
account of Mr Adams, Mr Franklin, and Mr Jay's ap- 
pointment to the place of Ministers for the negotiation of 
peace ; and after expressing favorable sentiments of them 
and of Mr Jefferson, from his general reputation, adds, that 
they have little reason to hope for the assistance of Mr Lau- 
rens, since the enemy will probably continue his captivity 
during the war. That the King accepted with pleasure 
the proofs, which Congress have given him of their con- 
fidence, when they intrusted to his care the interests of 
the United States. That he would use his influence and 
credit for the advantage of his allies, whenever a nego- 
tiation should render their interests a subject of discussion. 
That if he did not obtain for every State all they wished, 
they must attribute the sacrifice he might be compelled to 
make of his inclinations, to the tyrannic rule of necessity. 
That, however, he had no reason to believe, that the events 
of the campaign would make an unfavorable change in 
the situation of affairs ; and that from the present view of 
them, he had no cause to dread a disadvantageous peace. 

The Count adds, that he presumes Mr Adams has com- 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 31 

municated to Congress his Majesty's refusal to accede to 
the terms of the mediation of the Imperial Courts, until 
they should agree to acknowledge the American Plenipo- 
tentiaries in the manner most conformable to the dignity 
of the United States ; and observes thereon, that if the 
King was so attentive to a matter of form, though it might 
indeed in our present situation be considered as important, 
he would not be less tenacious of our more essential in- 
terests, which he will be zealous to promote, as far as cir- 
cumstances will allow. But that if notwithstanding this, 
Congress, or even a considerable part of its members, 
should regret the confidence they had placed in his Maj- 
esty, or wish to free their Ministers from this restraint, his 
Majesty would not disapprove the measure ; provided they 
made their Ministers answerable, as in justice they should 
be, in proportion to the powers, with which they invested 
them. He expresses his satisfaction at the extensive 
powers, with which the Ministers are invested as to the 
matter of boundary, and the truce, which he says, the 
interests of France as well as of us, require to be as long 
as possible. 

With respect to the statu quo, he says, that though from 
the number of their conquests it would be beneficial both 
to France and Spain, yet it has not entered into their sys- 
tem so far as it regards America, and that his Majesty 
accordingly refused to accede to the plan of negotiation 
proposed by the mediating powers, which held up that 
idea. He exhorts the Minister to recommend to Con- 
gress the most vigorous exertions, and to assure them, that 
the expulsion of the enemy from this continent depends 
in a great measure on the exertion of the United States ; 
that France would be able to afford us very little assist- 



32 LUZERNE. 

ance ; and that Britain, so far from discovering any in- 
clination to peace upon reasonable terms, absolutely re- 
fused the plan of negotiation proposed by the mediating 
powers; so that arms alone could compel her to it. 
He mentions, that the King being apprehensive, that 
the capture of the Marquis de Lafayette might reduce 
us to some difficulties, had ordered her cargo to be re- 
placed immediately ; and that in consequence of applica- 
tions from the States of Virginia and Maryland, he had 
ordered a number of arms and military stores to be ship- 
ped to them, subject however to the order of Congress. 
That this and the cargo designed to replace that of the 
Marquis de Lafayette, were to be paid for out of the loan 
negoliated in Holland, which he had occasion to think 
would be completed. He expresses a desire, that the 
plan for the appointment of Consuls should be digested 
and adopted, as the Court of France wished to make it 
the basis of some commercial arrangements between 
France and the United States. 

The Secretary for Foreign Affairs further informed 
Congress, that the Minister of France had communicated 
to him the following extract of a letter from the Count de 
Vergennes, which he had transmitted to the Superinten- 
dent of Finance. 

Extract of a letter from the Count de Vergennes, Sep- 
tember 7th, 1781. . 

"We think that since the arrival of Colonel Laurens, 
you have stopped the bills of Mr Morris on Messrs 
Le Couteulx. If the Superintendent has not followed 
your advice, he will cause us some embarrassment, as we

peremptorily declared to Dr Franklin, that we will not in 
future discharge any bills, that had not been drawn with 
your consent. As to you, Sir, we cannot but repeat our 
former instructions on this subject ; and we direct you to 
authorise no draft even for a small sum."

The Answer of his Most Christian Majesty to the Arti- 
cles proposed by the two Mediating Courts.* 

Translation. 

The mediators are too well satisfied of the moderation 
of the King, and his constant wish for the re-establishment 
of peace, not to be previously assured, that his Majesty 
will receive with as much gratitude as warmth the Pre- 
liminary Articles they have communicated. The King, 
the more fully to convince the two high mediators of his 
frankness and of the purity of his intentions, as well as of 
the unreserved confidence, that he places in the justice and 
impartiality of their High Imperial Majesties, believes he 
ought to make some confidential observations upon these 
Preliminary Articles. His Mrjesty flatters himself, that 
th is will be more acceptable to them as its sole objects are

peace about the beginning of the year 1781. Some particulars on 
this subject will be found in John tfdams's Correspondence, Vol. VI.

to prevent discussions, which are equally mischievous and 
complicated, and to facilitate the much wished for success 
of their generous interposition. 

"Article i. There shall be a negotiation at Vienna, 
by the united care of the two Imperial Courts, embracing 
all the objects for the re-establishment of peace, which the 
belligerent parties, who intrust them with the mediation, 
shall judge proper to be there proposed. A negotiation 
shall in the meantime be entered into between Great 
Britain and her Colonies for the re-establishment of peace 
in America, but without the intervention of either of the 
other belligerent parties, or even of the two Imperial 
Courts, unless their mediation shall be formally demanded 
and accorded for this object." 

According to the verbal observations, the expressions in 
the first part of this Article have been used merely to 
place the King of Spain in a situation to propose the ces- 
sion of Gibraltar, and this turn has been judged necessary 
because the Court of London had previously declared, that 
it ought to be made without reference to this cession, while 
the Catholic King demands it as a preliminary ; as this 
part of the Article immediately affects the Court of Mad- 
rid, the King cannot but refer himself to it for the answer 
that shall be made thereto. His Majesty is content to 
observe, that having united himself in the same cause with 
the King, his uncle, he neither can nor will separate his 
interests from those of that Prince, and that he regards the 
satisfaction he claims as a condition, without which he 
cannot personally treat of those matters. 

As to the second part of the Article, the two Imperial 
Courts cannot flatter themselves with the hopes of bring- 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 35 

ing their mediation (o a happy issue, if they do not pre- 
vent the subterfuges, the subtelties and false interpretations, 
which either of the belligerent powers may avail themselves 
of to explain according to their views the preliminary 
propositions, which will certainly happen if they do not 
previously ascertain the sense of the expressions, which 
relate to America. 

The Court of London will elude as much and as long 
as she possibly can, the direct or indirect acknowledge- 
ment of the independence of the United States, and will 
avail herself of the terms, that are used in speaking of 
them, to maintain, that she is not obliged to treat with her 
ancient Colonies as with a free and independent nation. 
That she is consequently not reduced to admit a Plenipo- 
tentiary on their part, and that she is at liberty to view the 
American representative as a deputy from a part of her 
subjects who demand a favor. From whence it will fol- 
low, that when the mediation is in force, and they shall 
be about to enter upon the negotiation, that they will dis- 
pute the character, in which the American Plenipotentiary 
shall be received. The King of England will consider 
him as his subject, while Congress will demand, that he 
shall be received as the representative of a free people, 
by means whereof the mediation will be stopped at the first 
outset. 

To prevent this inconvenience it should seem, that pre- 
vious to any other measure, the character of the American 
agent ought to be determined in the most precise and pos- 
itive manner, and Congress should be invited to confide its 
interests to the mediation. This invitation is so much the 
more interesting, as the negotiation relative to America 
should go hand in hand with that of the Courts of Madrid 



36 LUZERNE. 

and Versailles, and by consequence, the negotiations al- 
though separate should commence at the same time. 

But who will invite the Congress to treat with England ? 
The King cannot, since the First Article excludes him 
from the negotiation. This task then can only be executed 
by the mediators themselves ; all that the King can do, 
and that he will do with zeal and fidelity, is to invite the 
Americans to the peace, and to facilitate it by every means 
that they believe compatible with their essential interests. 
But that the King may take this step with safety, and the 
hopes of success, and with the certainty of not rendering 
himself suspected by the Americans, it is necessary that 
he should first know the determination of the mediators 
upon the observations now made to them, and that this 
determination should be such as to secure to the Ameri- 
can States their political existence. 

The two high mediators and their Ministers are too en- 
lightened not to perceive, that without this preliminary 
measure the Congress will send no person to Vienna, and 
that the King can make no attempts to engage them there- 
to, without incurring the danger of involving himself, by 
means whereof, and for the reasons already urged, the 
mediation will be stopped at its first outset. These reflec- 
tions appear to merit the most serious attention of the two 
mediating Courts. 

"Article ii. This separate peace cannot, however, be 
signed, except conjointly, and at the same time with that 
of the powers whose interests shall be treated by the medi- 
ating Courts. Although neither peace, notwithstanding 
thy are treated separately, shall be concluded without the 
other, yet care shall be taken to inform the mediators con- 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 37 

stantly of the progress of that, which regards Great Brit- 
ain and the Colonies, to the end, that the mediation may 
be able to regulate the measures intrusted to it according 
to the state of the negotiation relating to the Colonies, and 
both of the 'pacifications, which shall have been separately 
concluded at the same time, shall be solemnly guarantied 
by the mediating Courts, and by every other neutral 
power, whose guarantee the belligerent powers may think \> 
proper to claim." 

When the United States shall have been duly called to 
the Congress at Vienna, and shall have commenced their 
separate negotiation with England, this Article will make 
no difficulty with his Majesty. 

"Article hi. To render the negotiations of peace in- 
dependent of events of war, always uncertain, which may 
arrest, or at least retard their progress, there shall be a 
general armistice between the two parties, during the term 
of one year, reckoning from of the month of 

of the present year, or reckoning from the month of 
of the year 1782. Should it happen, that a general 
peace should not be re-established during the first term, or 
whilst the duration of either of these terms continues, 
everything shall remain in the same state, in which it 
shall be found at the signing of these preliminaries. ." 

This Article includes two objects equally important ; 
an armistice and a statu quo. The mediators have 
already acknowledged, that without this preliminary basis, 
they cannot enter upon a serious negotiation for a peace ; 
and, for still stronger reason, these preliminaries should be 
established before a truce can be spoken of. 



38 LUZERNE. 

The two mediating Courts are themselves of this 
opinion, since they do not propose the armistice, but in 
consequence of the acceptation of the first and second 
Preliminary Articles. The King thinks, that before they 
can agree to an armistice, it is necessary that the belliger- 
ent parties should have established preliminaries ; and it 
cannot be denied, that the basis, which the high mediators 
have proposed, may lead to a delay of those preliminaries, 
which should serve as the pledge and security for the 
re-establishment of peace, when, in fact, they really afford 
none. 

But when these preliminaries shall be invariably estab- 
lished, it may be of consequence to determine what dura- 
tion should be given to the suspension of arms. The plan 
of the mediators proposes one year ; but this term appears 
too short not to be illusory. In fact, it should be observed, 
that the fire of war being kindled in the four quarters of the 
world, one part of the year will hnve revolved before the 
orders can be received by the respective commanders ; 
so that tranquillity will be established in Europe, while 
hostilities continue in America and in the Indies. Be- 
sides, all the powers remaining armed, the slightest cir- 
cumstance may occasion a violation of the truce. 

In fine, it is in vain to flatter ourselves with the hope of 
concluding a definitive peace in the short space of one 
year; as, exclusive of the variety of subjects, that must 
necessarily be discussed, the two mediating Courts are at 
a great distance from each other; nor is there less between 
the belligerent powers ; and we should deceive ourselves, 
if we supposed, that all the propositions, which will be 
made on the one part, and on the other, will not give 
room for much debate and altercation ; or, that they will 
not, consequently, consume much time. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 39 

To these considerations we ought to add, that an armis- 
tice for one year would be very burdensome, because the 
powers at war will be obliged to remain in arms, to their 
manifest loss, as it will be impracticable to disarm, as well 
from the dispersion of the troops, as from the enormous 
expense, if, (which is highly probable) it should become 
necessary to renew hostilities. If, then, the mediators 
wish sincerely to establish the peace they propose, they 
should prefer a truce of many years to a simple armistice 
for one year. This expedient is better adapted to con- 
solidate their work, than a suspension of arms for a short 
time. But a truce will have the same inconveniences, 
and be equally dangerous with an armistice, if the bellig- 
erent powers remain under arms. Thus it seems neces- 
sary to agree at the same time reciprocally to disarm. 

But supposing these two points settled, there remains 
another equally important, that is the statu quo. Neither 
France nor Spain have any reason to reject it, so far as 
they are individually concerned. This is not the case 
with the Americans. To be satisfied of this, we need 
only cast our eyes upon the points, that the British troops 
actually occupy upon the continent of North America. 
The question, then, will be to obtain the consent of the 
United States, and this consent can only be demanded by 
the two Courts that offer their mediation, for the reasons 
that have already been urged. 

"Article iv. This flan of negotiation being adopted 
by all the parties, the belligerent powers shall request the 
mediators to open the conferences of the Congress, and 
shall without delay give their respective plenipotentiaries 
such fall powers and instructions, as they shall judge 
necessary for the success of the negotiation." 



40 LUZERNE. 

The King will conform himself, with as much pleasure 
as earnestness, to this Article, as soon as the preliminary 
basis shall be irrevocably established, agreeably to the 
observation above mentioned. And the King will then 
authorise his plenipotentiaries to treat immediately of the 
Preliminary Articles, which should lead to a cessation of 
hostilities ; and, as soon as these Articles shall have been 
agreed to, to labor with zeal and assiduity for the early 
conclusion of a definitive treaty. The high mediators 
may be assured, that his Majesty will facilitate this double 
task by every means, which he shall deem compatible with 
his dignity, with his interest, and with those of his allies ; 
and that as far as depends upon him, they will acquire the 
glory of having established, upon a solid and unalterable 
basis, the peace and tranquillity of every part of the world.

The Answer of the Court of London to the Preliminary 
Articles proposed by the Mediating Courts. 

I am authorised to return an answer to the paper, 
which, by order of your Court, you delivered me, and of 
which 1 have given an account to his Majesty. 

The answers marked A and B,* which I have the 
honor to submit to you, explain the unalterable sentiments 
of the King, upon points essential to his dignity, and 
demonstrate the reasons, that obliged his Majesty to de- 
cline the plan proposed, so far as it relates to his rebel- 
lious subjects. The King knows the justice and the im- 
partiality of the mediating Courts, and he considers the

DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 41 

plan with that spirit of conciliation which they give birth 
to. But his Majesty cannot but see it in a very different 
point of view, from that in which it appeared to the august 
mediators when they supposed it admissible in all points. 

The King persuades himself, that after having consid- 
ered it again, they will not entertain the same judgment 
relative thereto as heretofore ; and that they will even 
cease to wish that it should be admitted, since, from their 
intention, as well as from the principles, which they have 
laid down with so much wisdom, and which the King adopts 
altogether, it necessarily results, that ever) thing inconsistent 
with the dignity of his Majesty, the essential interests of 
his nation, and the rights of his crown, is inadmissible. 
A just and honorable peace with the belligerent powers, 
under the mediation of the two Imperial Courts, is the 
first object of his Majesty's wishes. The King knows, 
that the two august mediators will pursue the great work, 
that they have undertaken, with the same sentiments, 
which induced them to engage therein, the desire of 
being useful to the belligerent powers ; and his Majesty 
hopes, that their generous care will be crowned with 
success, and that they will serve to reconcile all the 
sovereigns at war, by a safe and honorable peace, which 
it shall be the interest of all parties to accept, and which 
shall not wound the dignity of either of them. 

The sincere desire of peace, the gratitude due to the 
august sovereigns, who have been willing to charge them- 
selves with the mediation of it, and the sentiments with 
which the King will always receive whatever shall be 
proposed to him by them, would dispose his Majesty to 
accept the proposed Articles, if that acceptation could be

reconciled to his dignity, the interests of the empire, and 
the rights of his crown. 

1st. On every occasion, in which there has heen a 
question of negotiation, since the commencement of the 
war with France, the King lias constantly declared, that 
he could never admit in any manner whatsoever, nor 
under any form, that there should be any interference 
between foreign powers and his rebellious subjects. 

2dly. The resolution of his Majesty upon this im- 
portant object is founded upon what the King owes to 
his own dignity, upon the essential . interests of his 
people, and upon the incontestible right, which every 
Sovereign has to determine at his pleasure, that which 
is clearly within his jurisdiction. This resolution is 
as immutable, as the foundation upon which it rests. 
From the application of this principle to the different 
points of the first, second, and third articles, results 
the melancholy, but indispensable necessity of declin- 
ing all that is proposed in these different articles rela- 
tive to the rebellious subjects of his Majesty. 

The King invariably entertains the desire, which he 
has so often manifested, of terminating the war in 
which he is engaged with the belligerent powers, by a 
just and honorable peace, under the mediation of the 
Imperial Courts, and for this purpose his Ministers 
shall be furnished with instructions and full powers, 
necessary to treat of all objects directly relative to the 
said powers. They shall be ordered to pursue the 
negotiation conformably to the principles explained 
therein, with all possible zeal, and to contribute on 
their part every suitable means to conduct it to a 
happy end. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 43 

No. 3. 

The verbal Ansiver of the King of Great Britain to the 
to the verbal Observations made by the Count de Bel- 
giojoso, Austrian Ambassador in London. 

Since the King finds himself under the necessity of 
declining a plan proposed by the two mediating 
Courts, he should think himself wanting in that respect, 
which is due to them on so many accounts, if he did 
not give some details of the reasons, which have ren- 
dered it indispensable for him to take this step. His 
Majesty is persuaded, that when the two august medi- 
ators shall have considered them with that spirit of 
justice and impartiality, which characterises them, 
they will become sensible of their weight. 

The King would derogate from his rights of sover- 
eignty, should he consent in any manner to the 
admission of any person whatever, delegated to the 
Congress by his rebel subjects ; this admission being 
absolutely incompatible with their quality of subjects. 
For the same reason, conciliatory measures employed 
to put an end to a rebellion, ought not to be inter- 
mixed, either in their commencement or in their con- 
clusion, with a negotiation between sovereign States. 

In consequence of the same principle, his Majesty 
can never enter into any engagements, nor adopt any 
plan, which may limit or suspend the incontestible 
right, which every Sovereign has, to employ all the 
means in his power to terminate a rebellion kindled in 
his dominions, either by the progress of his arms, or 
by conciliatory means employed in the country itself. 



44 LUZERNE. 

If, instead of taking advantage of the present disposi- 
tion of a great part of his rebellious subjects to return 
to their allegiance, he was to stop the effect and pro- 
gress of that disposition by stipulating a suspension of 
arms, he would retard the instant of that reconcilia- 
tion, which he wishes so much to hasten, and would 
furnish the leaders of the rebels with the means of 
fostering and strengthening their rebellion, and op- 
pressing the well-affected by the weight of their 
usurped authority ; he would put it in the power of 
his enemies to prolong the troubles, if he made the 
return of peace in America to depend on the success 
of a negotiation with a belligerent power, a negotiation 
which it would always be in their power to render 
fruitless. 

The favorable intentions of the King towards his 
rebellious subjects, and his desire to make them expe- 
rience the effects of his clemency, and restore to them 
the happiness, which they enjoyed before their rebel- 
lion, are generally known, but whatever may be the 
arrangements, which his Majesty will make to restore 
and ensure the quiet of his Colonies, and link the hap- 
piness of his American subjects to that of the metrop- 
olis, they will be in their nature as all things are, 
which are merely national, arrangements of internal 
policy, and as such, they cannot properly be the object 
of the mediation or guarantee of any foreign power. 
When the King availed himself of the dispositions of 
the two Imperial Courts and employed their medi- 
ation, his Majesty gave it plainly to be understood, 
that he aimed at the restoration of peace between the 
belligerent powers, to which alone it appeared to him 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 45 

that a mediation could be applied. Persisting inva- 
riably in the same sentiments, the King wishes that 
the mediation, at the same time that it confines itself 
to this particular object, may comprehend it in its full 
extent, and that the war between Great Britain and 
the Republic of Holland may be included in it. 

If the negotiation is opened, agreeably to these prin- 
ciples, and directed solely to this salutary end, if the 
other belligerent powers bring to it the same concilia- 
tory spirit which his Majesty will show, the generous 
care of the mediating powers will meet with a suc- 
cess the most complete, and the most conformable to 
their views.

The Courts of Versailles and Madrid having transmitted 
to the two Imperial Courts their respective answers* to 
the Articles proposed to serve as a basis to the negotiation, 
which had been communicated to them, as the Court of 
London had clone on the 15th of June last, the two Im- 
perial Courts think, that they must not delay to commu- 
nicate their reply reciprocally to the three respective 
Courts, as necessary to their mutual direction, and they 
have directed in consequence their Ambassadors and Min- 
isters with the said Courts, to present copies of them to 
their respective Ministers. 

Their Imperial Majesties have seen with the greatest

satisfaction, in that which was transmitted to them by his 
Most Christian Majesty, the assurance of the grateful sen- 
timents and real pleasure, with which his Majesty has re- 
ceived the said Articles, but they could not but be so 
much the more affected by the exposition of the motives, 
which have appeared to his Britannic Majesty sufficient to 
prevent his acceptation of them. It appears convenient 
to them in the actual state of things to refer to another 
time, and other circumstances the observations, which they 
might produce, and which it would probably be useless to 
expose in the present moment, but what cannot be so 
either at present or in future, is that the belligerent powers 
may see in their proper light the Articles, which have been 
proposed to them, and may in consequence appreciate 
them properly. 

The mediating powers could not allow themselves to 
make any propositions, which might wound the dignity or 
delicacy of either of the parties, or any of those, which 
might in the first instant have obliged them implicitly or 
explicitly to decisions, which can only be the result of a 
consent obtained by the way of negotiations. They must 
consequently have confined themselves to seeking and 
finding out some proper means to enable the belligerent 
powers to assemble their respective Plenipotentiaries, at 
the place where the Congress shall sit, to endeavor, under 
the mediation of the two Imperial Courts, to settle ami- 
cably all the differences, which are the causes of the pres- 
ent war, and when once they have met, and are provided 
with instructions for all possible cases, to be continually at 
hand, to seize one of those happy moments, which circum- 
stances sometimes bring on, and which are often lost for- 
ever, or at least for a great while, when one has not been 
at hand to take advantage of them. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 47 

They have found at the same time no other inconve- 
niency in this, but that perhaps the progress of the nego- 
tiation might not be altogether so rapid as it would 
undoubtedly be wished. The suspension of arms and of 
the statu quo by itself, independent of the remaining . part 
of the proposition, can either be adopted or rejected ; and 
after having weighed with the greatest impartiality the in- 
conveniencies and advantages, which may result from the 
acceptation of their propositions, it has consequently ap- 
peared to them, that nothing could better suit the respec- 
tive interests of the belligerent powers, as well as their 
general and particular circumstances. They still persist 
in that opinion, and from the sincere interest, which they 
take in the circumstances of all the belligerent parties, 
they cannot but wish, that they might still admit between 
themselves, with such modifications as they should think 
proper, the Articles, which have been proposed to them, 
and which, as his Most Christian Majesty well observes, 
are not Preliminary Articles, as in the nature of things 
they could not be such, but which can no less be the 
means, not only of bringing on at one moment or other 
the conclusion of a preliminary treaty, but perhaps even 
that of peace, a speedy return of which is so much to be 
wished for. 

The two Imperial Courts have thought, that in return 
for the confidence, with which his Most Christian Majesty 
has expressed himself in his answer, they ought to show 
as much in exposing to him the light, in which they have 
seen the step they have taken in proposing the Articles, 
which they have caused to be communicated to him, and 
which they still persist in holding out, that the belligerent 
parties may still be able to adopt what has been proposed 



48 LUZERNE. 

to them, or if not, to communicate some other idea, which 
may be productive of the same good effects, or of happier 
ones if possible. His Most Christian Majesty may be 
persuaded beforehand, that in that case they will with the 
greatest zeal make such use of it as they shall think most 
useful and convenient. Nothing can certainly add to the 
sincerity, with which they will take care to justify on every 
occasion the confidence, which the high belligerent parties 
have shown in accepting their mediation. 



No. 5. 

Answer of the Court of France to the Reply of the 

Mediators. 

Translation. 

The King has received, with equal sensibility and grati- 
tude, the answer of the two mediating Courts ; his Majesty 
regards it as a new proof of their friendship for him, of 
the just estimate which they form of his confidence in 
their impartiality, and of the true interest which they take 
in the prompt re-establishment of peace. 

The King has not changed, and will not change, in his 
desire to second views so salutary ; and the two high 
mediating powers may be assured, that so far as concerns 
his Majesty, it will not be owing to him, if they are not 
soon in a situation to give full scope to their beneficent 
zeal. 

But the Court of London deprives the King of every 
expedient and every hope, on this subject, by its inva- 
riable resolution to regard and treat the Americans as its 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 49 

subjects. Such a resolution renders abortive every exer- 
tion, that may be made for obtaining peace. Tt utterly 
destroys the plan of the two mediating powers, since it 
decides, in the most peremptory manner, the question 
which is the subject of dispute, and the direct or indirect 
decision of which should be the preliminary basis of the 
future pacification. 

In this state of things the King thinks, that the confer- 
ences, proposed by the two mediating Courts, would at 
present be without effect, and that the meeting of the 
respective plenipotentiaries would be but a vain pretence, 
which would not diminish nor abridge the horrors of war, 
and which might compromise the dignity of their Imperial 
Majesties. 

The King is truly sorry to see, that things have taken a 
direction so contrary to his wishes, and to the expectations 
of their Imperial Majesties; and, if it were in his power 
to change it, he would do it with an eagerness, which 
would show to them the purity of his intentions ; but his 
Majesty thinks it his duty to observe, that he has allies 
with whom he has inviolable engagements, that he should 
betray them by abandoning the American cause, and that 
he should betray this cause, if he consented to negotiate a 
peace separate from and independent of the United States. 
The high mediating powers have perceived the impos- 
sibility of such a proceeding, since they have themselves 
proposed to place the negotiation of the King, and that ol 
the United States, upon an equal footing. 

But even admitting, that the King should lay the affairs 

of America out of the question, that he should be content 

to act only for his own personal interest, and that he should 

jeave to the Americans the care of coming to an accom- 

VOL. xi. 7 



50 LUZERNE. 

modation with their mother country, what would be the 
result of this mode of proceeding ? 

The result would be, that the peace would be decep- 
tive ; that it would have a merely speculative existence. 
In fact, if, as appears from the strongest evidence to be 
probable, the Americans should persist in their refusal to 
return to their obedience to the British crown, the war 
between Britain and her former colonies would still 
continue. The King would then be obliged, as at present, 
to assist them ; the King of Spain, on his part, would be 
under the necessity of assisting his Majesty ; so that 
France and Spain, after the signature of their private 
treaty, would be in the same situation as they now are. 

These considerations seem to the King to be most 
forcible, and his Majesty has too just an idea of the 
wisdom and penetration of the two high mediating powers, 
not to be convinced, that they will regard them in the 
same point of view, and that they will wholly approve 
the cautious course which they oblige him to pursue. 

The King is earnestly desirous to be able to change this 
course, and it is in consequence of this desire, that he 
invites the high mediating powers to employ all their 
influence at the Court of London to induce that Court to 
show dispositions, which may convince us, that it is at last 
resolved to unite, in good faith, in a prompt and equitable 
peace. 

The King thinks, that he ought to inform the high medi- 
ating powers, that his Ambassador at Vienna is at present 
authorised to attend to all overtures and all expedients, 
which tend to this object, whether they come from 
the Court of London, or are proposed by their Imperial 
Majesties ; and he is also authorised to join in the Degotia-

CONGRESS TO THE KING OF FRANCE. 

The United States in Congress assembled to their 
Great, Faithful, and Beloved Friend and Ally, Lewis 
the Sixteenth, King of France and Navarre. 

Great, Faithful, and Beloved Friend and Ally, 
At a period so glorious to the arms of France, both 
by sea and land, and so favorable to the fortunes of 
America, it is with particular satisfaction that we con- 
gratulate the Monarch, whose wise counsels and gene- 
rous support have so largely contributed to events, 
illustrious in themselves, and promising consequences 
truly important. 



52 LUZERNE. 

We wish to convey to your Majesty our sense of 
the victory obtained by the Count de Grasse over the 
enemy's fleet on our coast, and the subsequent reduc- 
tion of the British armament in Virginia ; and we 
repeat our grateful acknowledgments for the various 
aids so seasonably extended to us. From the benev- 
olence and magnanimity, which has hitherto interested 
your Majesty in the welfare of these States, we are 
convinced, that you will on this occasion feel an 
equal pleasure with ourselves, whose immediate ad- 
vantage is the result of such fortunate exertions. 

We mention with great pleasure the zeal and ability 
manifested by the Count de Rochambeau, commanding 
your Majesty's forces in the allied arm)-. His con- 
duct, and that of his officers under him, merit our 
fullest approbation ; and we are made further happy 
by the perfect harmony and affection, which has sub- 
sisted between the troops of the two nations. 

The distress occasioned to the common enemy by 
combined operations will, we trust, point out to both 
nations the utility of similar measures in future; and 
whilst it induces your Majesty to supply that naval 
force, which the situation of our country renders ne- 
cessary, will urge the United States to every effort 
which their particular interests, added to their desire 
of seconding your Majesty's views, can call forth to 
ensure the complete success of attacks upon the 
enemy's strong holds. 

It is with great pleasure, that the United States 
continue to number some of your Majesty's subjects 
amongst their most able, spirited, and faithful officers. 
It affords the world a striking proof of the intimate 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 53 

connexion, which subsists between the allied nations, 
at the same time serves to cement the union which it 
manifests. 

Major General the Marquis de Lafayette has in this 
campaign so greatly added to the reputation he had 
before acquired, that we are desirous to obtain for him, 
on our behalf, even notice in addition to that favor- 
able reception, which his merits cannot fail to meet 
with from a generous and enlightened Sovereign ; 
and in that view, we have directed our Minister 
Plenipotentiary to present the Marquis to your 
Majesty. 

We pray God, Great, Faithful, and Beloved Friend 
and Ally, always to keep your Majesty in his holy 
protection. 

Done at Philadelphia, the twentyninth day of No- 
vember, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven 
hundred and eightyone, and in the sixth year of our 
independence. By the United States in Congress

Sir, 

I have the honor of sending you a copy of a memo- 
rial presented to the State of New Hampshire, and 
sent by that State to Congress, relative to a ship car- 
ried to Grenada by some American sailors, whom the 
English had compelled to serve on board of her. I do 
not know what are the rules or usages, to which the 
Admiralty of Grenada conform in such cases, I 
merely inform you, Sir, that by the laws of Congress, 
when insurgent sailors bring an English vessel into 
the ports of the United States, it is adjudged as a prize 
to them. The Admiralty of St Domingo, knowing 
these laws, have not hesitated, in a similar case, to 
restore the prize to the Americans, who had conducted 
it into port, after deducting the expenses of the pro- 
ceeding.

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO M. DE LA LUZERNE. 

Office of Foreign Affairs, December 21st, 1781. 

Sir, 
I do myself the honor to enclose an extract of my 
letter to Dr Franklin, on the subject of the late ordi- 
nance of Congress, relative to captures. Though in it 
I suggest a mode, by which the identity of goods 
captured and shipped may be authenticated, yet I have 
not thought it prudent to give it the preference to any 
other, which Dr Franklin, upon communicating with 
the Minister, may think more proper. I have only to 
request, that you will by your representations second 
his, and urge the Court of France to adopt the regu- 
lation above suggested, or any other that will best 
guard against this illicit commerce on the one hand, or 
the injury of innocent dealers on the other.

I do m j self the honor to enclose two letters from 
Mr Deane, which were delivered with his own hand 
to a Mr Marshal, who has sworn to their identity. 
These add so much weight to the suspicions already

Sir, 

I thank you for communicating to me Mr Deane's 
two letters. I shall transmit them to my Court. I 
am not at present, sending any express to the Chesa- 
peake, but I shall probably send one as soon as I shall 
have received the letters, which should have been 
brought by the Sybil. It is still possible that the 
Hermione may be charged with them. 

I proposed to have the honor, at the first opportu- 
nity, of conversing with you upon a circumstance, 
which it is desirable that Congress should alter. In 
the State of Massachusetts there is no Marshal of the 
Court of Admiralty. The custom in that State is, to 
put into the hands of the agent of the UlellatU the 
effects libelled, and the proceeds of their sale, if it has 
taken place. This practice has already been attended 
with great inconveniences, as it respects French mer- 
chants, and particularly as it respects a Spanish vessel, 
the owners of which, it is thought, have lost from 
twentyfive to thirty thousand pound? sterling, merely 
because the contested property had not been put into

these inconveniences may be remedied.

Franklin, might appear to the Count de Vergennes to 
betray a want of confidence in you, which I am per-

sider my not having received instructions to commu- 
nicate them as a mere accidental omission, and accord- 
ingly take upon me to enclose a copy of them. You

Sir, 

The undersigned, Minister Plenipotentiary of 
France to the United States, has the honor of inform- 
ing Congress that a great part of the loan of ten 
millions of livres tournois, opened in Holland on 
account of the United States, was taken up in October 
last, and that the interest on it has been fixed at 4 per 
centum. It is now proper that Congress should be 
pleased to send to Mr Franklin, the instructions and 
the authority necessary for performing the acts re- 
quired to bind the United States, in their engagements 
with his Majesty on account of this loan, as well as of 
the interest and expenses which it has occasioned. 
The undersigned has informed the Superintendent of 
the Finances, that after deducting the money advanced 
by his Majesty for this loan, there would remain about 
four millions of livres, at the disposal of the United 
States when the loan is entirely taken up.

THE SECRETARY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS TO THE PRES- 
IDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, January 29th, 1782. 
Sir, 

The Minister of France informed me, that he was 
desirous of making some communications from letters 
received by the Sibyl. Ten o'clock this day was ap- 
pointed to receive them. He accordingly came, and 
read to me passages of a letter of Count de Vergennes 
to him, dated October 17th, 17S1, which contained in 
substance, 

That France wished (as was evident, from her going 
into the war on our account) to obtain every advan- 
tage for us. That powers at war must often be 
governed by circumstances. That if events would 
enable her to command them, we might depend on 
everything she could obtain.' That her political sys- 
tem depended not only on America, but on the other 
powers at war. That if France should continue hostil- 
ities merely on account of America, after reasonable 
terms were offered, it was impossible to say what the 
event might be. That his Majesty was, however, at 
all events, determined to adhere to the true principles 
of the alliance, and would farther endeavor to obtain 
for us whatever we demanded, as far as events would 
justify. 

He observed, that people in America appeared to 
be greatly deceived with respect to the disposition of 
the belligerent and mediating powers, and to imagine 
that all were anxious for a peace ; that this was so far 
from being the case, that Great Britain had not yet 



50 " LUZERNE. 

returned any answer to the overtures of the Imperial 
Courts, nor had any reply been made by the latter to 
the answer given them by France, from which delay 
it might be easily imagined peace was far distant. 
That from the present situation of Spain, there was 
strong reason to suppose she could not spare us any 
money, her own operations requiring all she had. 
That he hoped France would not be called upon to 
make up her deficiencies, as they were in no situation 
to make new grants. Besides, that in order to rid us 
of our embarrassments, they had already made efforts 
in our behalf, which they had reason to believe ex- 
ceeded our expectations, and that what they had done 
for America this year, entitled them to an exemption 
from further demands. 

In a letter of October 20th, 1781, from the Count 
de Vergennes to the Minister of France, it is observed, 
that the United Provinces would not embarrass them- 
selves at present by an alliance with us ; that in this 
they will follow the example of Spain ; that, however, 
it will be prudent to keep an agent in Holland, and 
direct him to advise constantly with Dr Franklin, that 
we may observe some consistency in our politics. 
That he fears America founds hopes on the aid of 
Russia ; that nothing can be more groundless ; that 
though he believes she is not averse to the independ- 
ence of America, yet we ought not to expect that she 
will move a step in our favor ; that she has no partic- 
ular interest in terminating the war ; that as she means 
to assume the character of a mediator, she must pre- 
serve that of justice and impartiality; that nothing, 
therefore, can extort from her measures that are favor- 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. (jj 

able to us, but a conviction, that we cannot be brought 
back to the dominion of Great Britain. That this 
should lead us to think (a sentiment which he desires 
the Minister to inculcate) that our success depends 
upon our exertions, and upon our relinquishing the 
inactivity into which false hopes, excited by success, 
do sometimes plunge us. 

He repeated, that France could lend us no more 
money ; that the ten millions borrowed upon our ac- 
count in Holland, were greatly sunk by advances made 
in France; that no bills would be paid in France, 
which the Minister did not authorise us to draw ; that 
he hoped our officers would have too much prudence 
to risk the credit of the United States by drawing; 
that the negotiations are slill inactive, and will remain 
so, till events oblige one or other of the parties to sue 
for peace. That the success of the expedition against 
Portsmouth (that being the supposed post of Cornwal- 
lis) might possibly have some effect. That the great 
object of England is America ; that she will not cede 
it while she can carry on the war ; that she will cer- 
tainly make great exertions the ensuing campaign ; 
that equal exertions are therefore necessary on our 
part. That Spain and Holland view America as the 
great obstacle to a peace, from which consequences 
may flow, which people of judgment may easily 
foresee.

Instructions to Dr Franklin. 

In Congress, February 5th, 1782. 

On the Report of the Secretary of Foreign Affairs, to 
whom was referred the note (dated January 28) from the 
Minister of France, 

Resolved, That the following powers and instructions 
be given to the Minister Plenipotentiary oi the United 
States of America at the Court of Versailles. 

Whereas, the Minister of his Most Christian Majesty 
has informed the United States in Congress assembled, 
that the loan of ten millions of livres tournois, opened in 
Holland on account of these United States, was in a great 
measure completed in October last, and requested in con- 
sequence thereof, that full powers might be expedited to 
bind these United States to discharge the principal and 
interest of the said loan, agreeably to the terms thereof, 
with such expenses as might have accrued in making such 
loan ; you are, therefore, hereby authorised, directed, and 
empowered, to enter into such engagements with his Most 
Christian Majesty, with the States General of the United 
Provinces, with any particular State or Province, or with 
any man or body of men whatsoever, with whom you may 
find it necessary to enter into engagements, for the purpose 



64 LUZERNE. 

of binding these United States to discharge the said loan, 
with interest, agreeably to the terms thereof; and also for 
the re-payment of such expenses as have arisen, or may 
arise by reason of the said loan. And the said United 
States of America do hereby pledge their faith to confirm 
what you shall execute in pursuance of the above power. 

JOHN HANSON, President. 



RESOLVES OF CONGRESS RESPECTING THE COMMUNICA- 
TIONS MADE BY THE MINISTER OF FRANCE. 

In Congress, February 8th, 1782. 

On the Report of the Secretary of Foreign Affairs, to 
whom was referred the communication made to him by the 
Minister of France, (November 23d) containing, among 
other things, an opinion of Count de Vergennes, that his 
Catholic Majesty will not have it in his power to advance 
any money to the United States ; and expressing in 
strong terms the Count's hopes, that, the United States 
will not imagine that France should make up the sums 
they expected from Spain, after the assistance they have 
already derived from France ; 

Resolved, That Congress are fully sensible of the fre- 
quent, friendly and generous interposition of his Most 
Christian Majesty in their behalf, and are led from thence 
to hope a continuation of his assistance, since nothing has 
been wanting on their part, so to apply the aid he gener- 
ously affords, as to distress the common enemy, and lead 
to the great object of their alliance, a safe and honorable 
peace. 

Resolved, That Congress cannot, without injustice to 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 65 

themselves and their ally, withhold from him a knowledge 
of their present circumstances, or neglect to mention the 
ruinous consequences that may attend a refusal of those 
aids, which as well the friendly dispositions of his Most 
Christian Majesty, as the success that has attended his 
interposition in their hehalf, gave them reason to hope 
would be continued till the States, which have lately 
been ravaged by the enemy, had so far recovered their 
commerce and agriculture, as to be able more effectually 
to contribute to the general expense ; and that his Majesty 
may be assured, that their applications for this purpose 
shall not exceed what may be absolutely necessary for the 
support of the common cause. 

Resolved, That the Secretary of Foreign Affairs, con- 
sulting with the Superintendent of Finance, explain to 
the Minister of the United States at the Court of Ver- 
sailles, the extensive advantages, which have resulted from 
moneys supplied by his Most Christian Majesty to these 
United States, and the engagements, which have been 
entered into with a view to render the next campaign deci- 
sive, the consequence of failing in those engagements, and 
the little prospect there is of fulfilling them without an 
additional loan or subsidy, for the year 1782, of at least 
twelve millions of livres tournois, in order that the said 
minister may present a memorial on this subject to his 
Most Christian Majesty, and at the same time lay before 
him the several resolutions lately passed by the United 
States in Congress assembled, which evidence their unal- 
terable resolution to make every exertion, for a vigorous 
campaign, which their present situation will allow. 

Resolved, That the Minister Plenipotentiary of the 
United States of America at the Court of Versailles be, 

VOL.. XI. 9

and he is hereby instructed and empowered to borrow, on 
account of these United States, the sum of twelve millions 
of livres tournois, and to enter into engagements on the 
part of the United States for the repayment of the same, 
together with the interest, which is not to exceed the terms 
allowed or given on national security in Europe.

Philadelphia, February 18th, 1782. 
Sir, 

The Minister Plenipotentiary of France has the honor 
of communicating to Mr Livingston a letter from the 
Marquis de Bouille, commanding officer of the Windward 
Islands, and a memorial presented to that General by the 
Council and Assembly of the Island of Dominica. One 
of the two cases mentioned in them, that of the Dutch 
vessel, the Resolution, has been decided by the Court of 
Appeals, and the sentence of the Court of Admiralty of 
Philadelphia, has been amended in almost every point. 
The case of the Eeirsteu has been decided at Boston in 
the first instance, and recently by the Supreme Court of 
Appeals. As the annexed papers seem to contain means 
for the revision of the first case, and proofs, which were 
not known to the Judges when the decision was made, the 
undersigned has the honor of communicating them to Mr 
Livingston, and requests him to be pleased, after reading 
them, to send them back to him. 

The agent of the merchants at Dominica designs to 
solicit the said revision, with a view to have all the cargo, 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. (j7 

without exception, acquitted. The undersigned Minister 
Hatters himself, that Congress will be pleased to enable the 
said agent to avail himself of the new proofs, which he 
says that he lias obtained. The letter of the Marquis de 
Bouille, and the request of the Council and Assembly of 
Dominica, may hereafter serve to determine the true 
meaning of the capitulations of the English Islands, taken 
by the forces of his Majesty ; and it is for this reason also, 
that the undersigned requests that they may be laid before 
the Tribunal of Appeals. This letter and this request, 
leave no room to doubt, that the Ostend ship Eeirsten 
sailed under the faith of the capitulation, and that her 
owners ought to participate in the advantages secured by it 
to the capitulators. 

The undersigned Minister appeals to the justice of Con- 
gress, and of the American tribunals, in favor of those 
inhabitants or capitulators of the Island of Dominica, who 
are interested in the cargo of this ship, as subjects of the 
King, his master, and in favor of those people of Ostend 
who are interested, as subjects of his Imperial Majesty, 
who is allied to the King, his master, both by blood and 

by treaties.

from Carolina, by the American privateer Ariel, belong- 
ing to Messrs Robert Morris, Samuel Inglis, and William 
Bingham, brought into Philadelphia, and condemned there 
as a legal prize. 

This neutral ship, employed in the exportation of the 
produce of Dominica, by virtue of the proclamation of his 
Britannic Majesty in favor of neutral ships bound for the 
British Colonies, conquered by France in the course of 
this war, would not have been condemned as a legal prize, 
had it remained in the power of the British privateer, and 
been brought into a port belonging to his Britannic Majesty. 
She could not, then, be condemned by the Admiralty of 
Philadelphia, since that Court could not consider her 
otherwise than as a neutral vessel, sailing under the faith 
of his Britannic Majesty's proclamation, which the com- 
mander of the English privateer was no doubt ignorant of, 
and after which she could no longer be considered as a re- 
capture. 

This affair, Sir, deserves all your attention, and the 
particular protection which I request you to grant it, that 
the owners of this vessel may obtain, from the Council of 
Prizes of the United States the justice due to them. 

It is feared at Dominica, lest the Ostendian ship Eeir- 
sten, Captain Thomson, which sailed for the said Island, 
and was taken by an American privateer and brought 
into Boston, may likewise have been condemned ; and 
should this have been the case, I also request your inter- 
position in favor of the owners of the said vessel.

MEMORIAL OF THE COUNCIL OF DOMINICA. 

To his Excellency the Marquis de Bouille, Marshal of

Governor General, in and over the Islands of Martinico, 
Dominica, Grenada, and St Vincent, Tobago, he. he 

The Memorial of the Council and Assembly, represent- 
ing the capitulants of this Island. 

By virtue of the 17th Article of the capitulation signed 
by your Excellency, the capitulants of this Island were 
authorised to ship the produce of their estates, in neutral 
ships, to neutral ports in Europe, and to receive from them 
the necessary supplies of provisions and plantation stores. 

Annexed to the oaths of the respective shippers of pro- 
duce on neutral vessels, his Excellency the Marquis du 
Chilleau, his Majesty's Governor in this Island, granted to 
the master of each vessel his certificate, that such ship- 
pers were capitulants, and the produce laden in such ves- 
sel was the growth of their estates, and therein recom- 
mended those vessels and their cargoes to the protection 
of all his Majesty's subjects, those of his Most Catholic 
Majesty and to the Americans in alliance with France. 
These certificates were always respected till now, and in 
consequence such neutral vessels, although detained and 
examined at different times, arrived at their destined ports. 

To the infinite surprise of your memorialists, they have 
received advice from Philadelphia, that the Dutch ship, 
the Resolution, Captain Waterburg, was retaken from an 
English privateer, belonging to Carolina, by the Ariel, an 
American privateer, belonging to Messrs Robert Morris, 
Samuel Inglis, and William Bingham of Philadelphia, 
carried into that city, and was there condemned and 



70 LUZERNE. 

sold with her cargo, without respecting either the capitu- 
lation, or the certificate and recommendation of his Excel- 
lency the Marquis du Chilleau. This ship was loaded 
at Dominica and regularly cleared there for Amsterdam 
within the lime limited hy his Britannic Majesty's Procla- 
mation in favor of Dutch vessels, loading in the conquered 
Island, the commander of the Carolina privateer, unac- 
quainted with the Proclamation, had detained her as a 
Dutch ship. That this ship would certainly have been re- 
leased in Carolina cannot even be doubted, as she had 
before been carried into the Island of Nevis on the same 
voyage, and released with a compensation after her papers 
were examined. 

Your memorialists have received further advice, that 
another American privateer has taken and carried into 
Boston, the Ostend brig Eeirsten, Captain Thomson, 
bound from that port to this Island, and laden with pro- 
visions and plantation stores for the estates of your memo- 
rialists, where we fear she will have the same fate. 

If (he Americans should persist and be authorised to 
take and confiscate neutral vessels, loaded with the pro- 
duce of capitulants' estates under the authority of the 
French government, and those who in return are loaded 
with the provisions essentially necessary to them, what is 
the trade of this Island ? This must put an effectual end to 
it ; what resources are then left to us ? 

The inhabitants of this Island are capitulants, and they 
dare flatter themselves, that under their present govern- 
ment they have the merit of having constantly manifested 
the most uniform propriety of conduct ; the Americans 
should not only have respected, but protected their pro- 
perty. Bound to do so by their treaty of friendship with 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 71 

France, by the capitulation, and by the certificate and 
recommendation of the French Governor. 

Your memorialists do therefore most earnestly entreat, 
that your Excellency will be pleased to take this Memorial 
into consideration.

Office of Foreign Affairs, February 20th, 1782. 
Sir, 

I was yesterday honored with your note, covering the 

papers, which relate to the ship Resolution's cargo, and 

the brigantine Eeirsten's. With respect to the first, I believe 

there is little doubt, that that part of the cargo, which is 

condemned would be acquitted upon a rehearing, and 

proving, that it was the property of capitulants. The 

case of the brigantine is much more intricate, and carries

pay no other duty to his Most Christian Majesty, than they have 
paid to his Britannic Majesty, without any charge or imposts. The 
expenses attending the administration of justice, the Minister's sti- 
pends and other customary charges, shall be paid out of the reve- 
nue of his Most Christian Majesty in the same manner as under 
the government of his Britannic Majesty.

strong marks with it of a fraudulent design to protect 
British property, contrary to the spirit of the capitulation. 
One of the Judges who condemned this vessel assures me, 
that there was strong proof, that the cargo belonged to 
British owners, even after she parted from Ostend, nor 
was there any evidence that the bottom was neutral. 
The capitulation does not certainly tend to cover any other 
property of the capitulants, but that which should be ship- 
ped from the Island, or to the Island from a neutral port, 
otherwise its trade with Britain would stand upon the same 
footing as it did before the capture. However, I have not 
had such a view of facts, as will enable me to give an 
opinion upon the subject, and it I bad it would not fall 
within my department to determine upon it. 

The line in which justice will most speedily be done, 
will be for tbe parties who conceive themselves aggrieved 
to petition Congress for a rehearing. If, Sir, you shall 
approve it, I will lay before them your note, with the pa- 
pers annexed, and my opinion thereon. I doubt not, that 
they will readily adopt such measures as are most con- 
sistent with justice, and the respect they will feel for your 
recommendation.

shall be paid by the Colony.

to their address from all parts of the world, without their being con-

paying the customary duties paid in the French Islands.

Philadelphia, April 17th, 1788. 
Sir, 

I have repeatedly applied to the Department of War, to 
have a settlement made of the accounts of M. de la 
Radiere, an officer of Engineers, and General Baron de 
Kalb, both of whom died in the service of the United 
States. 

I have been answered, in the absence of General Lin- 
coln, that the demands, which I made by order of my 
Court, for the benefit of their heirs, were jr.st ; but as yet 
no money has been paid to me, and I therefore entreat 
you to be pleased to procure it as soon as possible. I

have received several letters from the family of Baron de 
Kalb, and I wish to be able to send them a satisfactory 
answer. General Lincoln having returned, I hope that 
these two affairs will suffer no delay. 

The Count de Barras also demanded, in the month of 
July of last year, the payment of the sums due to the 
volunteers, who have served on board the Ariel, Captain 
Paul Jones ; and on leaving the Chesapeake he has re- 
newed his demands, in order that this money may be sent to 
France, where it will be paid to those to whom it belongs. 
This debt amounts to four thousand one hundred and 
ninetyseven livres tournois, not including the sum of one 
thousand one hundred and fiftyone livres, which has been 
paid to Joseph Caron, Francois Marais de Tulipe, Joseph 
Powaruce, and Paterne Jean, who were on board the Her- 
mione. Congress, by a resolution, the date of which 1 
cannot recollect, last year ordered the whole of this sum 
to be paid. I entreat you, Sir, to be pleased to persuade 
the Board of Admiralty to bring this affair to a close, and 
to transmit this sum to his Majesty's Consul, that he may 
send it to those to whom it is due. 

I have the honor to be, &c.

Philadelphia, April 13th, 1782. 
Sir, 

I embrace the first moment after my return from Vir- 
ginia, to comply with the request of the principal officers 
of our army, in tendering you their sincere respects. 

I have already forwarded to your Excellency a letter 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 75 

from Count de Rochambeau ; on my return here, 1 found 
letters from my Court, dated in February last. They do 
not announce anything pacific, on the part of our enemies. 
No progress is made in the mediation of the Courts of 
Vienna and Petersburg, and the Court of London seems 
determined to risk the event of another campaign, in which 
they will employ all the strength they have left. The plan 
for the campaign was not yet finally decided, it depending 
on some arrangements, which were yet to be made with 
the Court of Madrid, and on some advices, which were 
expected from the Antilles. It nevertheless seemed to be 
the intention to act vigorously for the assistance of the 
United States, and though no particular assurances could 
be given me on this head, yet from what they write me, it 
is probable that New York or Charleston, or perhaps both, 
will be the object of their efforts next campaign. 

I think it, however, proper to inform you, that at the 
same time they announce to me their general views, they 
observe, that it is an unhappy circumstance, that the Amer- 
ican army is so weak as it is ; and they seem to fear, that 
it will not be in a condition to second their efforts, when it 
shall be necessary to strike a decisive stroke, or to under- 
take operations, in which such extensive means are re- 
quired as in a siege. 

I beg your Excellency would enable me to give my 
Court the necessary information on a matter so important 
as this is. I am not curious to know any of the particular 
details relative to your army, which it may be necessary to 
keep secret, but the military operations of France and 
America are so intimately connected, that it is indispensa- 
ble for us to know what is the actual force and means 
which you have, in order to calculate with any degree of 



76 LUZERNE 

probability what enterprises can be undertaken. Our igno- 
rance in this respect cannot but be very prejudicial to our 
affairs, because, if from false information we consider your 
army as weaker than it really is, it will prevent our forming 
plans, which it would be possible to execute ; and if, on 
the contrary, we are led to believe it stronger than it really 
is, we run the risk of forming plans impracticable in their 
execution. It is from these considerations, that I beg of 
you to confide to me such information on this head as 
you may think proper, both with respect to the actual 
force you have at the different parts of the continent, and 
what it will probably be in the course of the campaign. 
It is equally interesting to know the force of the enemy, 
both in regulars and militia. 1 beg you to rest assured of 
the discretion, with which I shall make use of these com- 
munications. 

I cannot refuse myself the pleasure of communicating to 
you the sentimems, with which our Court and the nation at 
large are inspired, from the reports of the French officers, 
respecting your Excellency, on their return to Versailles. 
Their testimony could add nothing to the universal opinion 
of the great services you have rendered your country, but 
to the esteem and admiration of the French are now 
added a sentiment of affection and attachment, which are 
the just return for that attention which our military expe- 
rienced from you, and the progress they made in their 
profession by serving under your orders. 
I have the honor to be, he.

DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 77 

COCNT DE ROCHAMBEAU TO M. DE LA LUZERNE. 

Williamsburgh, April 16th, 1782. 

I send you under a flying seal, my dear Chevalier, the 
letter I have written to M. de Guerny, commanding the 
Emerald frigate. You will observe, that I am yet in a 
state of ignorance, not having received my ministerial des- 
patches. It is of the greatest consequence, that this letter 
should be forwarded by a safe route, through the hands of 
General Washington, that it may be despatched as quick 
as possible. 

Our last news from Edenton is of the 8th of April, by a 
captain of a vessel, who left Georgetown the 25th of 
March. The enemy employ all the wagons ef Charles- 
ton in transporting their stores on board the empty vessels, 
which came from New York. 

I think General Washington would do well to have all 
the works levelled, which we made at Rhode Island round 
Newport, and even the fort on Butts' Hill, if he has not 
troops vigorous and firm to keep possession of it. 

The plans of the enemy seem to give their marine all 
the superiority they can in these seas. I think they must 
have it much at heart to re-occupy the port of Rhode 
Island. The port c f New York being precarious, the entry 
depending on the tides, they run the greatest risks in their 
naval combats, in not having a port where they can take 
refuge at all times. 

I have not time to translate this into English ; I beg you 
to transmit it to our General, as well as that for M. de 
Guerny, that he may forward it with the greatest despatch. 

I submit, with reason, all my reflections on Rhode Island 



78 LUZERNE. 

to him. I have always in mind Lord North's speech, and 
the news which seemed to follow, of the pretended evacu- 
ation of Charleston. 

Count Ferson sets off to meet my despatches ; he tells 
me that there is a detachment of about one hundred men, 
which might be employed jointly with the militia in level- 
ling the works.

Philadelphia. April 18th, 1782. 
Sir, 

On my return to this place, Count Beniowsky delivered 
to me a plan, which he wished to have communicated to 
your Excellency before your departure from Philadelphia, 
but as he was particularly recommended to me by my 
Court, he deferred taking that step till my arrival. He 
will not make any proposition to Congress without first 
consulting your Excellency and obtaining your approba- 
tion, and it is with this view he now goes to the army. 

I need not recall to your Excellency's mind, the ser- 
vices and actions, which have recommended Count Beni- 
owsky. His fervor you are acquainted with, and I am 
persuaded, that if you think he can be useful to the United 
States, no one will more sincerely support him in carrying 
into execution those views, which brought him to this con- 
tinent.

DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 79 

GEORGE WASHINGTON TO M. DE LA LUZERNE. 

Newburgh, April 28th, 1782, 
Sir, 

I receive with much gratitude the remembrance and 
compliments of the principal officers of the French army 
in Virginia, and thank your Excellency for the trouble of 
being the bearer of them to me, and the letter from Count 
de Rochambeau. 

With equal sensibility and pleasure, I received and do 
now acknowledge my obligations to your Excellency for 
the communications from your Court, which, though not 
decisive, are nevertheless important. The late instance of 
their generous aid, hinted at by your Excellency and par- 
ticularised by Mr Morris, is one among a variety of im- 
portant considerations, which ought to bind America to 
France in bonds of indelible friendship and gratitude, never 
I hope to be sundered. Induced by that entire confi- 
dence, which I repose in your Excellency, and a full con- 
viction, that a nation, who combines her force with ours, 
for purposes of all others most interesting to humanity, 
ought not to be deficient in any information I can give to 
point objects to means, that an accordance with them may 
be inseparable, I shall, without hesitation, give you the state 
of our present force, and my ideas of the increase of it by 
recruits, from the best view of it which is before me. 

It can scarcely be necessary to inform your Excellency, 
that our military establishment for the present year consists 
of one regiment of artillery, four legionary, and two parti- 
san corps, and fifty regiments of infantry, beside the corps 
of invalids ; or that Congress have called in pointed terms 
upon each State to complete its regiments to the establish- 



80 LUZERNE. 

ment, the aggregate of which, if complied with, would 
amount to thirtyfour thousand three hundred and eight 
men, exclusive of commissioned officers, sergeants, and 
music, Hazen's regiment, and the corps of invalids. Of 
this force, one legionary corps, two regiments of artillery, 
and twentytwo of infantry, besides Hazen's regiment and 
the invalids, compose the northern army ; but as Hazen's 
regiment is fostered by no State, discouraged from recruit- 
ing by all, and without funds if the case were otherwise, 
it must scon dwindle to nothing, being now very weak. 

The present totality of the rank and file, exclusive of 
sergeants, of those regiments which compose the northern 
army, amounts to nine thousand one hundred and fortysix. 
From this number the sick men, in different branches of 
the staff department, and such as are employed on other 
extra duies, which the peculiarity of our circumstances 
compels me to furnish from the army, being deducted, will 
reduce the efficient operating force of these corps to seven 
thousand five hundred and fiftythree rank and file, and I 
should be uncandid if I were not to acknowledge, that I 
do not expect it will be increased by recruits in the course 
of the campaign, to more than ten thousand fit for duty in 
the field. This, Sir, in my opinion will be the lull amount 
of the established regiments of the States east ol Pennsyl- 
vania. To ascertain the number of militia, who may be 
assembled for occasional offensive operations, is more than 
I can do. The general opinion is, that there will be no 
want of militia for any enterprise we can have in view. Be 
this as it may, this one thing is certain, that this class of 
men are not only slow in their movements, but undertaking 
to judge also of the propriety of them in point of amount, 
will wait till the necessity for it strikes them, which, in 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 81 

most cases, is as injurious to the service as inability or 
want of inclination ; disappointment being the consequence 
of delay. This observation I could not refrain from mak- 
ing, because in all combined operations, especially those 
which may depend upon the season or a limited period for 
their execution, it is of the utmost importance to be known. 
.The enclosed return, which is a copy of the last state of 
the force under the order of Major General Greene, which 
has come to my hands, will give your Excellency every 
information in my power, respecting the state and condition 
of that army ; which was to be augmented by the partisan 
corps of Colonel Armand, consisting of about two hundred 
horse and foot. Independent of those, there are two small 
regiments at Fort Pitt. One from the State of Pennsyl- 
vania, the other from Virginia, which are included in the 
general establishment of the army ; but no particular re- 
turn is here given of them. 

What measures are adopted by the States of Georgia 
and North and South Carolina, to recruit their battalions, 1 
know not. Virginia marched about four hundred men the 
latter end of February for the southern army ; and by an 
act of the legislature, passed at their last session, resolved 
to raise more ; but in what forwardness they are, or what 
is to be expected from the act, I am equally uninformed. 
Maryland and Pennsylvania depend upon voluntary enlist- 
ments, and are proceeding very slowly in the business of 
recruiting. 

This, Sir, is an accurate state of the force we have at 
present, and my expectation of what it may be, indepen- 
dent of militia. 

The enemy's force, from the best information I have 
been able to obtain of it, may stand thus at New York ; 
vol. xi. 1 1 



8 2 LUZERNE. 

Rank and File. 
Regulars, including their established corps 

of Provincials, 9,000 

Militia of the city, refugees, and indepen- 
dent companies, 4,000 
Sailors and marines, according to the num- 
ber of ships which may be in the harbor ; 
— this being uncertain no number is 
given, 
Now in New York, 13,000

established Provincials, 5,000 

Penobscot, about 500 

Halifax and its dependencies, uncertain, but 

say, 3,500 

In all, 26,000 

The above estimate, so far as it respects New York, 
Charleston, and Savannah, is, I believe, to be depended 
upon. The force of Canada by some accounts is more, 
by others less, than five thousand. The regular British 
and German troops in that country cannot exceed four 
thousand ; but in addition to these, are the corps of Sir 
John Johnson and others, which I am told have been con- 
siderably increased by the disaffected of this, and other 
States, who have fled to Canada. But it is to be observed, 
that this force, be it what it may, is employed in the occu- 
pation of posts from Quebec to Michillimackinac, and on 
Lake Champlain, through an extent of not less than seven 
or eight hundred miles, and that all these posts are depen- 
dent upon the former for provisions and supplies of every 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 83 

kind. I am less certain of the enemy's force in Nova 
Scotia than elsewhere. The number here given is not 
from recent intelligence, or strengthened according to cir- 
cumstances. Cumberland, Windsor, Annapolis, St John's 
River, &ic, are posts dependent upon Halifax, and included 
in the three thousand and five hundred men here men- 
tioned. 

If this state of matters can be satisfactory to your Ex- 
cellency, or useful in the formation of any plans against 
the common enemy, I shall be happy in having given it. 

Permit me now, Sir, to express the high sense I have 
of the honor you have done me, in communicating the 
favorable opinion entertained of my conduct by the Court 
and nation of France, and to acknowledge my obligations 
to those officers who have inspired these sentiments. To 
stand well in the eyes of a nation, which 1 view as one of 
the first in the world, and in the opinion of a Monarch, 
whom I consider as the supporter of the rights of human- 
ity, and to whom I am personally indebted for the com- 
mand he has been pleased to honor me with, is highly 
flattering to my vanity, at the same time it has a first claim 
to all my gratitude. 

It is unnecessary I hope to add fresh assurances of the 
respect and esteem, with which I have the honor to be, 
Sir, he

COMMUNICATION OF THE FRENCH MINISTER TO THE 
SECRETARY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS. 

In Congress, May 1st, 1782. 

The Secretary of Foreign Affairs having laid before 
Congress the following minutes of a communication, made 
to him the 28th of April, by the Minister of France, from 
letters of the Count de Vergennes, dated the 24th of De- 
cember and the 22d of January last, viz. 

"After expressing his satisfaction in the success of our 
arms in Virginia, he laments the weakness of our army, 
and the incapacity in which it leaves us of pursuing so im- 
portant a blow, before England can recover from it, he says, 
though the plan of the ensuing campaign is not yet deter- 
mined on, he has reason to believe, that means will be 
used to aid us in the exertions we shall make lo expel the 
enemy from this continent ; and he wishes that this con- 
sideration, and the obstinate adherence of the British to 
their plan ol subduing this country, evidenced by their 
answer to the mediators, may rouse the United States to 
an early and animated exertion. He observes, that the 
British are much embarrassed with respect to the measures 
they ought to pursue ; that they still continue to represent 
us as a weak and divided people, in the hope, that this 
may have some effect upon the powers of Europe, more 
particularly upon the mediators. He is of opinion, that 
England will endeavor to make proposals to the several 
States separately ; and though he does not apprehend, 
that they will succeed in their attempt to detach them 
from the alliance, yet he presumes, while the issue is 
unknown, that they will avail themselves of it to induce 
a belief, that they have a considerable interest in this 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 85 

country, and that the people at large wish to be connected 
with them. He hopes the wisdom of Congress will de- 
vise some means to frustrate this design. He expresses 
in strong terms the resolution of his Majesty to adhere to 
the principles of the alliance, and to form no treaty of 
peace, which does not secure to the United States the 
objects of it." 

And this communication having been referred to a com- 
mittee, and the committee having reported thereon, it was 

Resolved, That the Secretary of Foreign Affairs be, 
and he is hereby directed to make a confidential com- 
munication to the several States of the intelligence received 
by Congress on the 29th of April last through his depart- 
ment, in order that the States may be more fully im- 
pressed with the necessity of such united and determined 
exertions, as, with the co-operation of our generous ally, 
will expel the enemy from their remaining posts within 
the United States, and display to the world the falsehood 
of the assertions of the British Court, that the people of 
these States are neither united nor determined in support 
of their national independence. 



DECREE OF THE KING'S COUNCIL IN FRANCE. 

Translation. 

Decree of the King's Council of State, prescribing the 
formalities to be observed on the exportation, from the 
ports of the kingdom, of merchandise obtained from prizes. 

Extract from the records of the Council of State. 

"The King having been informed, that the facility 
granted by the Fourteenth Article of the decree of his 



86 LUZERNE. 

Council of the 27th of August, 1778, concerning mer- 
chandise obtained from prizes, has been abused, so that 
merchandise of English origin is taken on board, when 
under sail, or in foreign countries, and is imported under 
the character of merchandise taken as prize, into nations 
in alliance with his Majesty, he has thought proper to ex- 
plain his intentions. Wishing to remedy this evil, and 
having heard the report of M. Joly de Fleury, one of the 
Common Council of State, and of the Royal Council of 
Finance, the King in Council has commanded and com- 
mands, that all the merchandise named in the said Four- 
teenth Article of the regulation of August 27th, 177S, and 
the adjudication of which is made only upon condition of 
its re-exportation to a foreign country, cannot be exported 
from the ports of his kingdom, unless it be accompanied 
with the copy of the proces-verbal of the sale made by 
the Admiralty, or by the Intendant or the Director of the 
Marine, duly certified by the register, or by the Controller 
of the Marine, and examined by the Receiver and Con- 
troller of the Bureau des Fermes, which, conformably to the 
Eighteenth Article of the same decree, must mention, that 
the goods have actually been taken from the mart, and 
embarked on board of the vessel designated. His Maj- 
esty forbids the clerks and overseers of the Adjudicataire 
de ses Fermes, under penalty of being deprived of their 
offices, and subjected to the severest punishment if it 
should be done, to allow any of the merchandise in ques- 
tion to be exported, without the previous formalities hav- 
ing been observed.

there present, held at Versailles, the 4th of May, 1782.

has bestowed on your Majesty's family and kingdom. 
Nothing was wanting to the happiness of the first, hut 
a son to wear the honors, which the father had earned ; 
or, to the prosperity of the latter, but the prospect of 
seeing the Crown transmitted to an heir, who would 
find in the example of his parent, a powerful incite- 
ment to promote the happiness of his people. This 
example, we presume to hope, will also influence his 
future conduct towards these United States. When, 
in the history of the present day, he shall read your 
Majesty's generous interference in their behalf, their 
firm and affectionate attachment, and the blessings 
with which both were crowned, he will be studious to 
preserve to his kingdom and these States, the recipro- 
cal advantages of the alliance, which your Majesty has 
formed, and to emulate his ancestor in adding to his 
titles the glorious appellation of Protector of Mankind. 

We receive with the most lively pleasure your Ma-

suffer no diminution, when every day afforded us new

his departure, had adopted the annexed resolutions in 
relation to him ; but the departure of this officer took 
place before he could procure the execution of them, 
which he now solicits, Dr Franklin having told him 
that the settlement of this business belonged to Con- 
gress. The undersigned Minister, requests Mr Liv- 
ingston to be pleased to take measures to forward to 
this officer a decision of Congress, or of the Depart- 
ment of War. 

The Chevalier de la Luzerne takes the liberty of 
renewing his solicitations respecting the money to be 
paid to the heirs of Messrs De Kalb and De la Radiere, 
and also respecting the reasons, which have suspended 
the payment of the interest on different classes of 
certificates.

VERBAL COMMUNICATION OF THE FRENCH MINISTER TO 
THE SECRETARY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS. 

In Congress, May 28th, 1782. 

The Secretary of Foreign Affairs laid before Con- 
gress the following verbal communication made to Mr 
Livingston. 

Tl*e Minister of his Most Christian Majesty has the 
honor to inform Mr Livingston of several particulars rela- 
tive to the negotiation, that the Court of London appeared 
disposed to open in Europe. The first steps were taken 
under the former administration. This remark is essen- 
tial, because it is possible that the new Ministers may take 
others more decisive ; or it is equally possible, that they 
may entirely change the system, and continue the war still 
longer. 

Emissaries have been sent to Paris and to the Hague, 
to sound, on the one hand, Mr John Adams, in the hope 
that his connexion with some independent members might 
facilitate an accommodation; and, on the other side, in the 
hope that very advantageous offers might seduce his Maj- 
esty, and engage him to make a separate peace to aban- 
don his allies. The Chevalier de la Luzerne is not in- 
formed of the steps that have been taken at Madrid, or by 
the States General. 

The proposition made secretly to France tended to a 
partial peace. It offered France the possession of their 
conquests in the West Indies, the suppression of an Eng- 
lish Commissary at Dunkirk, and advantages in the East 
Indies. These offers were certainly satisfactory to his 
Majesty ; and he would have had no reason to reject them 



94 LUZERNE. 

if he had had no allies. But his engagements marked out 
another line of conduct. He replied, that how sincerely 
soever he was disposed to peace, he would commence no 
negotiations to this end without the participation of his 
allies. The emissary easily comprehended, that this 
answer related as well to the United States as to Spain ; 
and pretended that the condition was inadmissible ; that 
England, in treating upon this foundation, would acknowl- 
edge the independence of her colonies, which made no 
part of her system. The Minister of his Majesty replied, 
that their independence was considered by the King as 
an indispensable point, and that it made the basis of his 
system. 

The English Agent then demanded, if there were no 
means to avoid treating with us of the affairs of America. 
The Count de Vergennes replied, by referring him to the 
answer given to the first overtures of pacification made by 
the mediators, and communicated to Mr Livingston. 

It should be observed, that whether England treats of 
the affairs of the United States with the Court of Ver- 
sailles, or whether she opens a direct communication with 
the United States, she cannot avoid treating with the 
American negotiators sent by Congress. In either case 
she will be under the necessity of acknowledging that body. 

The conduct of his Majesty on this occasion being 
strictly conformable to justice and his engagements, his 
Minister confines himself to a simple communication of it 
to Mr Livingston. He confides also to him, that the 
Count de Vergennes, in declaring to the English Agent, 
that his Majesty could not listen to any negotiations of peace 
if the Court of London did not treat at the same time with 
his allies, added verbally, that the King did not attend to 
his own satisfaction till that of his allies was procured. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 95 

Besides this, the effects of these steps taken by the 
Court of London, have been to engage Fiance to pursue, 
with redoubled vigor, the measures that have given birth 
to these appearances of peace, but which would certainly 
not terminate in it, if England perceived that her enemies 
relaxed their efforts in any manner. It is above all things 
indispensable, that the United States should, in the course 
of this campaign, be in a situation toco-operate in vigorous 
enterprises, which may be formed. It appears that the 
design of the Court of London, pointed out by the debates 
in Parliament, is to reduce, by a defensive war, their ope- 
rations upon this continent. The Minister of his Most 
Christian Majesty has at present no information relative to 
the plans of the approaching campaign. Rut whatever 
they may be, it would be useful to be enabled to inform 
his Court, that the United States will not adopt an inac- 
tivity, which would be equivalent to the truce required. 
But that their design is to trouble the repose, that the 
enemy wish to deliver themselves to, and that the opera- 
tions, whether combined or separately undertaken by the 
United States, will be pushed with activity during the en- 
suing campaign. 

As to the place of the negotiations, Congress knew in 
1779, when they named a Plenipotentiary, and in 1781, 
when they gave him three Colleagues, that it could only 
be in Europe, and that this was the most effectual means 
of preventing delays and jealousy, and of maintaining the 
confidence and harmony, which has so happily subsisted 
hitherto between the allies. It would be important, that 
the Minister of his Majesty could inform his Court, that 
Congress persists in these dispositions; and, that in case 
Commissaries offer to treat upon this continent, they 



96 LUZERNE. 

should be referred to the Ministers of the United States, 
who are provided with instructions on this subject in Eu- 
rope ; that the Court of London should address itself to 
them ; and that it is impossible that the seat of negotiation 
should be in America. When these overtures were made 
to the Court of Versailles, the agent made no mention of 
those that were to be made in America, or to the Ameri- 
can Ministers in Europe. It is obvious, that the design of 
this conduct is to inspire reciprocal distrust ; and the 
Chevalier de la Luzerne conceives it can in no way more 
effectually be prevented, than by a full communication of 
every circumstance, which shall relate to the pacification 
and to the interests of the alliance, which shall come to his 
knowledge.

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO M. DE LA LUZERNE. 

Office of Foreign Affairs, June 7th, 1782. 
Sir, 

I have the honor to enclose you an account of the 
moneys received by Baron de Kalb and Lieutenant Colonel 
La Radiere, as extracted from the Paymaster's books. 
By this it will appear, that both have received more than 
the amount of their pay, even if the depreciation is 
allowed. If their friends have furnished you with vouch- 
ers to account for the expenditure of still further sums 
upon the public account, the whole, when stated, will be 
liquidated at the treasury offices, and the balance paid. 

I have applied to Congress for direction on the subject 
of the Baron de Holzendorff, though it would appear to 
me, that if he had received the thousand dollars directed 
to be paid him, there can be nothing further due to him, 
since the resolution itself implies, that there would proba- 
bly be a balance to be repaid in bills of exchange. You 
must see, Sir, the extreme difficulty of settling these ac- 
counts, unless the gentlemen, who have demands, will be at 
the trouble of stating their accounts precisely, and produce 
vouchers for the money, which has passed through their 
hands. This is never dispensed with in the case of our 
own citizens. I shall, however, do myself the honor to 
lay before you the determination of Congress in this case. 

I have written to Mr Morris on the subject of the inter- 
est due on the loan office certificates, and shall transmit 
to you his answer as soon as I shall receive it. 

I enclose for your perusal a very extraordinary letter 
from Mr Deane to Governor Trumbull, together with his 
reply, which was unanimously approved by the Legislature

meanwhile foreigners will not feel themselves hurt when 
we make no distinction between them and our own

Philadelphia, June 10th, 1782. 
Gentlemen, 

I shall transmit to his Majesty the address you have 
been pleased to send me on the birth of an heir to his 
crown. 

It will afford him infinite satisfaction to find with what 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 99 

joy this event has inspired you, and he will see with 
pleasure, that the same army which has given so many 
proofs of courage and patriotism, and which has in the 
most perfect harmony and concert with his own troops 
fought the common enemy, now hastens to show, that 
nothing which affects the French nation can be indifferent 
to them. 

The young Prince, whose birth is the object of your 
congratulations, will, from his infancy, hear recounted the 
glorious actions, by which you have effected the indepen- 
dence and happiness of a vast continent; and when there 
shall be cited to him examples of disinterestedness, con- 
stancy, courage, and every other military virtue, there will 
be repeated the names of illustrious chiefs. 

He is born at a moment when victory has crowned both 
our nations. This circumstance is a happy presage of his 
future glory, and promises, that he will one day be the 
support of your independence as well as of the alliance, 
which unites France with the Thirteen United States. 

The veneration that your actions and virtues have 
inspired me with, Gentlemen, augments the pleasure I 
have in conveying your sentiments to the King, my master. 

1 beg you to be persuaded, that no one is with more 
sincere respect, Gentlemen, your very humble and obe- 
dient servant.

Great, Faithful, and Beloved Friend and Ally, 
We learn with extreme grief, an event which has 
disturbed your Majesty's felicity, and unite with you 
in offering that tribute of sorrow to the memory of 
your most dear and beloved aunt, the Princess Sophia 
Philippina Elizabeth Justina of France, which is due, 
as well to the eminent virtues she possessed, as to the 
relation in which she stood to your Majesty. We 
trust that our sensibility on this occasion, will be con- 
sidered as a fresh proof of the interest we take in every 
event, which may affect your Majesty, and that our 
sincere condolence, when such afflictions as are the 
lot of humanity put it out of our power to offer more 
effectual consolation, will evince our earnest desire 
on every occasion to contribute to your Majesty's 
happiness. 

We pray God, Dear, Great, Faithful Friend and 
Ally, always to preserve and keep you under his holy 
protection. 

Done at Philadelphia, the 13th day of June, in the 
year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and 
eightytwo, and in the sixth year of our independence. 
By the United States in Congress assembled. Your 
Majesty's Faithful Friends and Allies.

TO COUNT UE ROCHAMBEAU.

Philadelphia, June 14th, 1782. 
My Dear General, 
I have just received your letter of the 8th of this 
month, and the packets which accompanied it. 1 have 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 101 

not now time to reply to it, as I profit by an express 
on the point of departure, and whom I cannot detain. 

The movements of the English troops at New 
York, indicate an intention of sending off detachments 
from that garrison. It is even possible, though not 
very probable, that they propose to evacuate that place, 
either to reinforce the English Islands, or to act offen- 
sively against the conquered Islands, which will not 
be in so good a state of defence as our ancient posses- 
sions. This last supposition cannot take place, unless 
they retain their superiority, and although I hope that 
this will not be the case, it is, however, but prudent 
to be in readiness against every event. 

The most sure means of preventing the enemy from 
making any detachment from New York, is to ap- 
proach that place, and to give a jealousy to General 
Carlton, of a combined attack. Congress regard the 
matter in this light, and think that General Wash- 
ington will make a movement towards New York, in 
case such a measure is agreeable to his designs, or to the 
intelligence he may have. I am ignorant what steps 
he will take in this conjuncture. It is possible that he 
may think it proper not to quit his present station, till 
he hears that you approach. In all cases the enemy 
will be cautious of weakening themselves, if they 
hear that you are on the march to form a junction. 

I submit these ideas to you, my Dear General, and 
am persuaded that you will take such measures as are 
most advantageous. 

We have news, which I have no reason to believe, 
that M. de la Motte Piquet is not far distant from 
these coasts. 

I have the honor to be, &c. LUZERNE.

GEORGE WASHINGTON TO M. DE LA LUZERNE. 

Head Quarters, Newburgh, June 24th, 1782. 
Sir, 
I was in the moment of sending off a despatch to 
Count de Rochambeau, of which I have the honor to 
enclose a copy, when your Excellency's letter of the 
14th instant arrived. 

I have only to refer you to my letter of the 20th of 
April, for a perfect statement of matters in this quarter; 
and as little alteration has taken place since that period, 
your Excellency will readily perceive the impractica- 
bility of the movement expected by Congress, (and 
mentioned in your letter io Count de Rochambeau,) 
especially too, when you consider how unprepared we 
are to encounter any expense, that can possibly be 
avoided. 

My ideas on this head, the removal of the French 
army in our present state of uncertainty, the conse- 
quent call of the militia to occupy the posts they 
would leave, and cover the stores, shipping, &c. which 
must necessarily remain, and on the general posture of 
our affairs, were communicated fully to the Secretary 
of War, when he was here, with a request that he 
would unfold them to your Excellency, as I could not 
commit them to paper without a cypher. 

The enemy, from the hest intelligence I get from 
New York, has made no detachment. Things remain 
there in statu quo. They seem to be suspended and 
are waiting for orders from their CoUrt, which 1 hear 
they anxiously expect. As I am just stepping into a 
boat for Albany, and dare not commit more to paper,

I have only to give a fresh testimony of the respect 
and esteem with which I have the honor to be, &c.

Philadelphia, July 3d, 1782. 
Sir, 

I received a letter yesterday from Count de Rocham- 
beau, dated on the 24th of last month, wherein he informs 
me, that he had come to a determination to move on the 
27th towards the head of the Bay, where he will be at 
hand to take such measures as you may judge proper, as 
soon as we receive news from Europe. He desires me 
to communicate this to your Excellency, till he can write 
you himself. As he does not go any distance from the 
Bay, and as he will always be ready to turn off to the 
southward if necessary, I hope it will meet your ap- 
probation. 

I wait his answer respecting the interview, which you 
have proposed to him, and which I sincerely desire may 
take place here. It seems to me impossible, that we 
should not have some news from France towards the mid- 
dle of this month. 

From the last intelligence from Europe, up to the 1st of 
May, we learn nothing important, except the general dispo- 
sition of the Dutch to ally themselves with the United 
States. But it is probable, that Mr Adams will open the 
negotiation by demanding the acknowledgment and guar- 
antee of your independence, and this circumstance may 



104 LUZERNE. 

prevent the conclusion of a treaty of commerce, which 

seems to be the point that has most influence with the 

States General. But as the inclination of ihe people seems 

absolutely towards the alliance, I hope the difficulties will 

be successively got over. 

I have the honor to be, &c.

COUNT DE VERGENNES TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Translation. 

Versailles, July 29th, 1782. 
Sir, 

It is not in quality of a King, the friend and ally of the 
United States, (though with the knowledge and consent of 
his Majesty,) that I now have the honor to write to your Ex- 
cellency. It is as a man of sensibility, and a tender father, 
who feels all the force of paternal love, that I take the lib- 
erty to address to your Excellency my earnest solicitations 
in favor of a mother and family in tears. Her situation 
seems the more worthy of notice, on our part, as it is to 
the humanity of a nation, at war with her own, that she has 
recourse, for what she ought to receive from the impar- 
tial justice o( her own Generals. 

J have the honor to enclose your Excellency a copy of 
a letter, which Lady Asgill has just wrote me. I am not 
known to her, nor was I acquainted that her son was the 
unhappy victim, destined by lot to expiate the odious crime 
that a formal denial of justice obliges you to revenge. 
Your Excellency will not read this letter without being ex- 
tremely affected ; it had that effect upon the King and 
Queen, to whom I communicated it. The goodness of 
their Majesties' hearts induces them to desire, that the in- 
quietudes of an unfortunate mother may be calmed, and 
her tenderness reassured. I felt, Sir, that there are cases 
where humanity itself exacts the most extreme rigor ; per- 
haps the one now in question may be of the number ; but 
allowing reprisals to be just, it is not less horrid to those 
who are the victims ; and the character of your Excellency 
VOL. xi. 14 



106 LUZERNE. 

is too well known, for me not to be persuaded that you de- 
sire nothing more than to be able to avoid the disagreeable 
necessity. 

There is one consideration, Sir, which, though it is not 
decisive, may have an influence on your resolution. Cap- 
tain Asgill is doubtless your prisoner, but he is among those 
whom the arms of the King contributed to put into your 
hands at Yorktown. Although this circumstance does not 
operate as a safeguard, it however justifies the interest 1 
permit myself to take in this affair. If it is in your power, 
Sir, to consider and have regard to it, you will do what is 
agreeable to their Majesties ; the danger of young Asgill, 
the tears, the despair of his mother, affect them sensibly ; 
and they will see with pleasure the hope of consolation 
shine out for those unfortunate people. 

In seeking to deliver Mr Asgill from the fate which 
threateus him, I am far from engaging you to seek another 
victim ; the pardon, to be perfectly satisfactory, must be 
entire. I do not imagine it can be productive of any bad 
consequences. If the English General has not been able 
to punish the horrible crime you complain of, in so exem- 
plarv a manner as he should, there is reason to think he 
will take the most efficacious measures to prevent the like 
in future. 

I sincerely wish, Sir, that my intercession may meet suc- 
cess ; the sentiment which dictates it, and which you have 
not ceased to manifest on every occasion, assures me, that 
you will not be indifferent to the prayers and to the tears of 
a family, which has recourse to your clemency through 
me. It is rendering homage to your virtue to implore it. 

I have the honor to be, with the most perfect considera- 
tion, Sir, yours, &ic.

LADY ASGILL. TO COUNT DE VERGENNE9. 

[Enclosed in the preceding.] 

London, July 18th, 1782. 
Sir, 

If the politeness of the French Court will permit an ap- 
plication of a stranger, there can be no doubt but one in 
which all the tender feelings of an individual can be inter- 
ested, will meet with a favorable reception from a noble- 
man whose character does honor, not only to his own coun- 
try, but to human nature. The subject, Sir, on which I 
presume to implore your assistance, is loo heart-piercing 
for me to dwell on ; and common fame has, most proba- 
bly, informed you of it ; it therefore renders the painful 
task unnecessary. 

My son, (an only son) as dear as he is brave, amiable 
as he is deserving to be so, only nineteen, a prisoner under 
the articles of capitulation of Yorktown, is now confined in 
America, an object of retaliation. Shall an innocent suffer 
for the guilty ? Represent to yourself, Sir, the situation of 
a family under these circumstances ; surrounded as I am 
by objects of distress, distracted with fear and grief, no 
words can express my feeling, or paint the scene. My 
husband given over by his physicians, a few hours before 
the news arrived, and not in a state to be informed of the 
misfortune ; my daughter seized with a (ever and delirium, 
raving about her brother, and without one interval of rea- 
son, save to hear heart-alleviating circumstances. 

Let your feelings, Sir, suggest and plead for my inex- 
pressible misery. A word from you, like a voice from 
Heaven, will save us from distraction and wretchedness. I 
am well informed General Washington reveres your char- 



108 LUZERNE 

acter ; say but to him you wish my son to be released, and 
he will restore him to his distracted family, and render him 
to happiness. My son's virtue and bravery will justify the 
deed. His honor, Sir, carried him to America. He was 
born to affluence, independence, and the happiest pros- 
pects. Let me again supplicate your goodness ; let me 
respectfully implore your high influence in behalf of inno- 
cence ; in the cause of justice, of humanity j that you 
would, Sir, despatch a letter to General Washington, from 
France, and favor me with a copy of it, to be sent from 
hence. 

I am sensible of the liberty I have taken in making this 
request ; but I am sensible, whether you comply with it or 
not, you will pity the distress that suggests it ; your hu- 
manity will drop a tear on the fault, and efface it. 1 will 
pray that Heaven may grant you may never want the com- 
fort it is in your power to bestow on

Sir, 

This letter will be handed you by M. de Cloisy, who 
will inform you particularly of the motives of his journey 
to the northward. 

I address myself with freedom to your Excellency, for 
a service, that no one has it more in their power to render 
than yourself, and which is of the greatest importance to 
the naval army commanded by M. de Vaudreuil. It is 
not to be doubted, that a large naval force will arrive at 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE 109 

New York, either from the West Indies or from Europe. 
It is essential that our naval commanders should have 
the most exact and most frequent intelligence in this re- 
spect, respecting the number of vessels, their names, their 
destination, the time of their arrival, of their departure, the 
number of troops they embark, or artillery ; in fact, not 
a single movement can be known with too much preci- 
sion. And I must request, that you will take the necessary 
measures to give M. de Vaudreuil regular information on 
all these points. It could be wished, that you would sta- 
tion regular expresses to facilitate the communication 
between you and him. 

I ought to be well convinced of your goodness to take 
so much liberty, but the object is of such importance to 
the common cause, that I have no doubt of your excus- 
ing me. 

If the communication between you and M. de Vaudreuil 
is regular and sure, you might, I should think, correspond 
without cypher; if not I must beg you to furnish M. de 
Vaudreuil with a cypher to make the matter more secure, 
and if your Excellency will from time to time give me the 
same information I shall be exceedingly obliged. 

The procuring of the necessary intelligence must be 
attended with extraordinary expense ; I must beg that 
your Excellency will charge some one to acquaint me of 
the sums necessary for the purpose, and to whom I shall 
pay it. These expenses being wholly for the service of 
our fleet, must be charged to the Department of the 
Marine, and I have taken the necessary measures that 
they may be exactly paid. 

By our last accounts from France the Due de Lauzun, 
and many other officers who had sailed, were obliged to

Philadelphia, August 14th, 1782 
Sir, 

A cartel will probably have arrived at Boston with 
American sailors from England. One is arrived here 
with two hundred and forty sailors, whom England has set 
at liberty. One of the Captains, with whom I have con- 
versed, tells me that a fleet of two hundred sail was to 
leave Portsmouth a few days after the cartels ; they were 
to separate into three divisions, one for Charleston, one 
for New York, and one for Quebec ; they are to be con- 
voyed by frigates only ; and they assure me the last divis- 
ion is the most important, having soldiers on board, and 
many articles necessary for the defence of Quebec, and 
for the subsistence of the inhabitants. 

From the different accounts I can collect, it seems to be 
the design of England to make a general peace, but the 
demands on one side and the other will render a conclu- 
sion extremely difficult, and in such a case, that power 
will spare nothing to effectuate a peace with the United 
States, and turn all her efforts against France. As to a 
separate peace with the United States it will not take 
place. I am certain that they will not make peace but in 
concert with France. 

I am, &tc.

Sir, 

The undersigned, Minister of France, has the honor of 
informing Congress, that he will transmit to his Court the 
resolution, by which Congress offers the ship of the line 
America, to replace the ship the Magnifique, which ran 
ashore at Boston, and which there is little hope of relieving. 
The Chevalier de la Luzerne cannot anticipate the deter- 
mination of his Majesty, with regard to this offer, out as the 
desire of Congress to substitute immediately the America 
for the Magnifique cannot be accomplished if the under- 
signed Minister waits for the orders of his Court on this 
subject, he will, without delay, inform the Marquis de 
Vaudreuil of the resolution adopted by Congress on the 4th 
instant. This General will judge for himself, whether the 
fleet of the King will be stationed on the coast long enough 
to allow time for launching this vessel, aiming her, and 
transporting on board of her the crew, artillery, and rigging 
of the Magnifique. In that case, the America will imme- 
diately join the fleet, in conformity with the wishes of 
Congress. 

But whether circumstances shall allow this vessel to join 
his Majesty's fleet, or render it impracticable, the under- 
signed Minister can assure Congress, that his Majesty will 
behold with great pleasure, the eagerness with which the 
United States, his allies, have made this offer, and that this 
new mark of their attachment and friendship will be infin- 
itely agreeable to him.

COMMLnlCATlc-' OF THE FRENCH MINISTER TO A COM- 
MITTEE OF CONGRESS. 

In Congress, September 24th, 1782. 

The committee appointed to hold a conference with the 
Chevalier de la Luzerne, Minister of France, in pursuance 
of his note to Congress of the 23d, report ; 

That yesterday your committee held a conference with 
the Minister of France, agreeably to the said appointment, 
the substance of which consisted in the communication of 
advices lately received by the said Minister of France, 
from his Excellency the Count de Vergennes, as follows. 



116 LUZERNE. 

The Minister informed the committee he had received 
several despatches from his Court, of which he thought it 
his duty to communicate an extract to Congress. 

The first was dated 9th April last. It expressed the 
opinion of the Count de Vergennes, that the Court of St 
James had formed a design to make a separate peace with 
one or more of the powers at war with it. That France 
was perfectly easy with respect to the disposition of Con- 
gress; and that the uniformity and steadfastness of their 
conduct did not leave the least doubt with regard to the 
part they would take in this circumstance. That the 
steps the King had taken on a similar occasion, and the 
disappointment of several British emissaries, was already 
known to Congress. That they had met with the same 
reception at Madrid ; and there was the greatest proba- 
bility, that their intrigues would not be more successful at 
the Hague. The Minister of France observed, that the 
glory and honor of the present confederacy, of which his 
Majesty was the centre, would be their having been inac- 
cessible to artifice ; and this extraordinary instance would 
be crowned with success, if the four powers persisted inva- 
riably in a firm attachment to their union, and if, on the 
one hand, making the greatest exertions to procure the 
completest satisfaction, they, on the other hand, confined 
themselves within such bounds of moderation as would 
give no umbrage to any one of the powers at war with 
Great Britain. 

That the King had, in different circumstances, taken 
the proper measures to deprive the enemy oi all hopes, 
which they might have formed of introducing dissensions 
between his Majesty and his allies. That it was to be 
wished, that the Court of London was fully convinced of 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. H7 

the impossibility of treating separately with America 
That this had always been the chimerical and favorite 
idea of England ; and that so long as it subsisted, there 
would perhaps be no possibility of treating seriously about 
the conditions of a peace. That their negotiations would 
only be an artifice to scatter divisions among the allies, 
and retard their exertions for continuing the war. That the 
shortest way to put a stop to their intrigues, would be to let 
it be known publicly in the most explicit manner, that the 
United States neither can nor will make any peace without 
the concurrence of their ally ; and that if England has any 
overtures of peace to make to them, the American Pleni- 
potentiaries are sufficiently empowered to receive them, 
and to negotiate a peace, if those overtures are admissible. 

That this peremptory language would free Congress 
from all the embarrassments, which the English Ministers 
could throw in the way ; that it would bring them to a 
sincere disposition to make peace ; put an end forever to 
their machinations with the mediating powers ; deprive 
them of the means of feeding the Parliament and people 
of England with the hopes of a separate peace ; and 
finally save the Americans from all the difficulties, which 
would infallibly take place if England were allowed to ne- 
gotiate in America. It would convince England, that the 
United States are not less attached to their engagements 
with their ally than sensible of the respect due to the 
Courts of Vienna and Petersburg, whose mediation Con- 
gress have accepted. 

The Minister added, that though the situation of the 
belligerent powers, the distance of America, and the slow- 
ness and difficulty of communication made it advantageous 
that the seat of negotiation should be in Europe, and that 



118 LUZERNE. 

the enemy should be informed of this resolution, yet Con- 
gress had the fullest liberty to follow the system which 
France had pointed out in her answer to the mediating 
powers, in consequence of which the American Ministers 
might negotiate immediately and directly, conformably to 
the instructions they had received from Congress ; but the 
negotiations of France and America would be carried on 
in an equal progression, a continual and reciprocal com- 
munication would be given, and the two treaties signed at 
the same time, and one be ineffectual without the other. 

The Count de Vergennes in the same despatch, gave 
information of the Dutch having acknowledged the inde- 
pendence of America, of which Congress are already 
informed. 

The letters of May 2d and June 28th, urged the same 
point of referring the British negotiators in America to the 
American Plenipotentiaries in Europe, with this addition in 
the letter of May 2d, that it was now evidently the object 
of Great Britain to lessen their exertions on this continent 
as much as in their power, and to adopt a defensive mode 
of carrying on the war ; that being unable to support a 
double war by land and by sea, she proposed to suspend 
the one in order to carry on the other more effectually ; 
and in case of success, to return against the United States 
with redoubled efforts. 

The Minister mentioned the attempts, that had been al- 
ternately made at the Court of Versailles, and with the 
American Plenipotentiaries, for a separate peace, and said, 
that Dr Franklin had communicated his and Mr Ad- 
ams's answers to the British emissaries ; that the King 
thought them firm and consistent with the principles of the 
alliance, and wished that Congress might be informed of 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. H9 

the satisfaction they afforded him. That to remove for- 
ever such expectations, it behooved the wisdom of Con- 
gress to declare, that no peace but a general one would be 
attended to ; that when negotiations are entered into with 
sincerity, the King would most readily employ his good 
offices in support of the United States, in all points relating 
to their prosperity ; that Congress were themselves sensi- 
ble of the distinction between the conditions of justice and 
rigor, and those of convenience and compliance, which de- 
pended on the good or bad situation of affairs ; that though 
the circumstances of the allies were very promising, such 
events might happen as might make it advisable to adopt 
the part of moderation. 

But the best way to obtain every possible advantage, 
was to preserve a perfect connexion, and to let them know, 
that the United States would not only reject a separate 
peace, but that they would continue the war against the 
common enemy by all manner of ways, until their allies 
should also conclude a peace ; that this declaration would 
convince the British Ministers, that they would not get rid 
of the Americans by merely acknowledging their inde- 
pendence ; and that though they removed their troops 
from the continent, they would be attacked wherever 
found. 

The despatch of the 28th of June dwelt chiefly on the 
negotiation ; and contained details, which the Count de 
Vergennes directed the Minister to make to Congress, 
but which have in a great measure been already trans- 
mitted to them by their Ministers in Europe. These de- 
tails related to the emissaries sent to Dr Franklin and 
Mr Adams, and their satisfactory answers. Mr Oswald, 
in an interview with the Count de Vergennes, hinted to 



120 LUZERNE. 

him the desire of the Court of London, and the necessity 
it was under to make peace ; and received for answer, 
that the King was equally disposed to make an honorable 
and solid peace. Mr Oswald went to London to carry 
this information ; returned soon, and was immediately 
followed by Mr Grenville, the intimate friend of Mr Fox. 

Mr Oswald repeated to Dr Franklin the assurances of 
the disposition of the Cabinet of St James ; and Mr Gren- 
ville, in answer to his overtures to the Count de Ver- 
gennes respecting the disposition of tbe King of Great 
Britain, was informed by the express order of the King, 
that his Majesty was disposed to negotiate for peace, 
provided it was a general one, and the allies and friends 
of his Majesty were satisfied. Tins answer was just 
given when the news of the action of the 12th of April 
reached Europe. Nevertheless, the King of Great Bri- 
tain sent full powers to Mr Grenville to negotiate the 
peace with his Majesty. In communicating them the 
English Agent declared, that the King of England, in 
order to facilitate peace, was disposed to treat of the inde- 
pendence of the United States with his Majesty, provided 
all other matters were put upon the footing of the treaty 
of 1763. 

To this the King answered, 1st. That the powers of 
Mr Grenville were insufficient, as they did not mention 
the allies of his Majesty. 2dly. That his Majesty could 
not himself negotiate for the interests of America, having 
no powers to this purpose ; and that it became the dignity 
of the King of England and of the United States to 
open a direct negotiation on this subject. 3dly. That in 
order to conclude a solid and lasting peace, it ought not 
to be founded upon the treaty of Paris, but upon justice, 
and the dignity of all the contracting powers. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. \2\ 

The British Ministry adopting these observations, sent 
new powers to Mr Grenville, authorising him to treat with 
all the belligerent powers. Mr Grenville presented to the 
Count de Vergennes a copy of these powers, and declared, 
that the King of England, being disposed to acknowledge 
and declare directly the independence of America, it would 
no longer be a conditional article of peace. And as to 
France, the English Plenipotentiary proposed to take the 
treaty of Paris for the basis, not of the peace itself, but of 
the negotiations ivhich were to be entered into. 

The Count de Vergennes, on the 21st of June, commu- 
nicated to Mr Grenville the answer of the King. In this 
communication his Majesty declared his wishes for the 
restoration of peace, and his satisfaction, that the King of 
Great Britain was disposed to treat with all the belligerent 
powers, and that he intended to make a direct acknowl- 
edgment and declaration of the independence of the 
United States of America, and that this point would no 
longer be a conditional Article of a general pacification. 
That the King consents to adopt, according to the proposi- 
tion of the King of England, the treaty of Paris for a 
basis of the negotiation, not as a confirmation of all its 
stipulations, but with exceptions and alterations respecting 
the East Indies, Africa, the fisheries of Newfoundland, and 
commercial regulations in Europe to mutual advantage. 
Restitution and compensation to be treated of, when the 
negotiation shall be established, with respect to which the 
King will be governed by the principles of justice and 
moderation, which are the basis of his policy. If these 
overtures are agreeable to the King of England, his Maj- 
esty will explain himself precisely on the different points. 
His Majesty expects, that his Britannic Majesty will make 
VOL. xi. 16 



122 LUZERNE. 

to all the belligerent powers and states, without delay, such 
overtures as he may think conducive to promote the nego- 
tiation as far as it respects their interests. That no doubt 
may be left with respect to his Majesty's sentiments, he 
declares anew, that he will neither treat nor terminate any 
negotiation, unless the interests of his allies and friends 
shall be conjointly discussed and determined, or sepa- 
rately, according to the wishes of his Britannic Majesty 
and the allied and friendly powers of his Most Christian 
Majesty. 

Such was the state of affairs on the 28th of June, at 
which time there appeared some obstructions to the nego- 
tiation, owing, as it was believed, to the misunderstanding 
which prevailed among the British Ministers. Tergiver- 
sations were discovered on the part of the British nego- 
tiator. The bill authorising the King of England to 
treat with the Colonies of America had not then passed. 
These uncertainties made it essential to guard against 
British emissaries on the continent of America ; and to 
prevent with all care their admission ; and to recommend 
the same measure to the several Legislatures. 

The Minister finished the conference by informing the 
committee of the fortitude of the King on receiving the 
news of the action of the 12th of April. He immediately 
gave orders for constructing twelve ships of the line, the 
greater part of the first rate. The city of Paris and seve- 
ral other cities and corporations had offered some others, 
and it was expected, that the King would, in the course of 
the next campaign, have twenty new ships to oppose the 
enemy. His Majesty was resolved not to make the least 
alterations in his plans for the future negotiation ; and he 
exhorted his allies to the same resolution and the same 
exertions.

REPORT OF A COMMITTEE OF CONGRESS ON COMMUNICA- 
TIONS MADE BY THE FRENCH MINISTER. 

In Congress, October 3d, 1782. 

The committee, to 1 whom were referred the notes of 
the communication made by the Minister of France 
to a committee of Congress, on the 24th of Sep- 
tember, brought in a report, which was agreed to, as 
follows ; 

That the Minister Plenipotentiary of his Most 
Christian Majesty be informed, that the communication 
made by the said Minister on the 24th of September 
last, is considered by Congress as an additional proof 
of his Majesty's magnanimity, and has confirmed those 
sentiments of affection and confidence, which his wise, 
steady, and liberal conduct in every stage of the war 
has so justly inspired. 

That his Most Christian Majesty's declaration to the 
British Minister at Paris, that he will neither treat 



J26 LUZERNE. 

nor terminate any negotiation unless the interests of 
his friends and allies shall be considered and deter- 
mined, is entirely correspondent to the part, which 
these United States are resolved to take in any nego- 
tiation for peace. 

That Congress, with the utmost satisfaction embrace 
this opportunity to renew their assurances, that in 
every event these United States will inviolably adhere 
to their alliance with his Most Christian Majesty, 
which they consider to be equally essential to their 
interest and their glory. 

That they will hearken to no propositions for peace, 
which shall not be discussed in confidence and in 
concert with his Most Christian Majesty, agreeably to 
the declaration made to his Minister Plenipotentiary 
on the 31st day of May last. 

That upon this principle, Congress did not hesitate 
a moment, to reject the proposition made by the 
British General and Admiral, as Commissioners of 
Peace, for admitting Mr Morgan, their Secretary, to 
an interview at Philadelphia. 

And that they are resolved to prosecute the war with 
vigor, until a general peace shall be obtained, in which 
their allies shall be comprehended. 

That Congress place the utmost confidence in his 
Majesty's assurances, that he will readily employ his 
good offices in support of the United States in all 
points relative to their prosperity ; and considering 
the territorial claims of these States as heretofore 
made, their participation of the fisheries, and of the 
free navigation of the Mississippi, not only as their 
indubitable rights, but as essential to their prosperity, 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 127 

they trust that his Majesty's efforts will be success- 
fully employed fo obtain a sufficient provision and 
security for those rights. Nor can they refrain from 
making known to his Majesty, that any claim of resti- 
tution or compensation for property confiscated in the 
several States, will meet with insuperable obstacles, 
not only on account of the sovereignty of the indi- 
vidual States, by which such confiscations have been 
made, but of the wanton devastations, which the citi- 
zens of these States have experienced from the enemy, 
and in many instances from the very persons in whose 
favor such claims may be urged. That Congress trust, 
that the circumstances of the allies at the negotiation 
for peace, will be so prosperous as to render these 
expectations consistent with the spirit of moderation 
recommended by his Majesty.

Philadelphia, October 28lh, 1782. 
Sir, 

The undersigned, Minister Plenipotentiary of his 
Most Christian Majesty, has had too frequent oppor- 
tunities of satisfying himself, that Congress fully per- 
ceives how intimately the interests of the two nations 
are connected, not to be convinced that they will learn 
with pain, that very considerable quantities of provis- 
ions have been sent by the Raritan to New York, and 
along the river opposite to Staten Island. The under- 
signed Minister cannot enter into the details of this 
proceeding, which he knows only by reports, though 
by reports upon which he has the strongest reasons for 
believing that he can depend. This trade is, more- 
over, carried on in the most open manner, and he is 
convinced, that by inquiries, instituted with prompt-

determine them exactly, and contents himself with 
observing, that the nineteen vessels thus supplied, will 
not, perhaps, depart immediately, and that it will be 
necessary to shut up the channels by which these pro- 
visions have reached them. 

There are, besides, eight other ships of the line at 
New York, which they intend to supply with provis- 
ions in the same way. Congress are aware how 
important it is to prevent the enemy from obtaining 
from the United States the means of putting to sea, 
and even of supplying the garrison. The undersigned 
also knows what efforts have been made by that body, 
on different occasions, to put a stop to those illegal 
operations, and how desirous it is effectually to guard 
against them. He also knows, that all the good citi- 
zens of the Jerseys grieve to see the enemy obtaining 
from their own State, supplies, which are employed 
against the allies of the United States, and he is con- 
vinced, that it is only necessary to point out the evil, 
in order that all may cordially unite in providing a 

remedy for it.

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON TO Mi DE LA LUZERNE. 

Office of Foreign Affairs, October 30th, 1782. 

Sir, 
The Secretary of the United States for the Department 
of Foreign Affairs has the honor to inform the Minister 
Plenipotentiary of his Most Christian Majesty, that a peti- 
tion has been presented in behalf of the owners and officers 
of the brig Laetitia, commanded by Robert Collins, and 
commissioned by the United States. That the said brig, 



132 LUZERNE. 

while at anchor in the road of Basseterre, on the 3d day of 
May last, near the Island of St Christophers, captured by 
her boat a brig called the Francis, belonging to the sub- 
jects of his British Majesty, bound from the port of Liver- 
pool in England to the Island of Tortola, and having on 
board a valuable cargo. 

That after the prize had been brought to anchov in the 
road of Basseterre, by the officers and mariners of the 
said brig Laetitia, the harbor master of the Island of St 
Christophers, aided by a guard, took possession of her, 
under pretence, that she was included in the capitulation, 
though the contrary appears from the affidavits annexed ; 
that the said prize was afterwards advertised and sold as 
a prize to the subjects of his Most Christian Majesty, with- 
out any condemnation in the Courts of Admiralty of the 
Island. As the sale of this prize fully demonstrates, that 
she could never have been included in the number of those 
vessels protected by the capitulation, it is not doubted, that 
the justice of his Most Christian Majesty's Ministers will 
induce them to direct, that the value of the prize be repaid 
to the legal captors, when the Chevalier de la Luzerne 
shall have submitted the above state of facts, and the an- 
nexed affidavits to their inspection, together with such 
observations as his own candor and equity will induce him 
to make thereon.

Philadelphia, November 4th, 1782'. 

Sir, 

Congress, in the year 1780, recommended to the dif- 
ferent States to pass laws analogous to the Thirteenth 
Article in our treaty of commerce. Some States have 
complied with this recommendation, others, among which 
is Pennsylvania, have neglected to do it. I know, that 
severa-1 Frenchmen, who have acquired funds in this State 
do not trust to the protection of prosecutions de Vechiquier 
general for want of a law of this nature. I entreat you, 
Sir, to be pleased to procure the passing of such a law, 
in case that you think, that the said Article of the treaty is 
not sufficient to secure to them the quiet possession of the 
funds, which they have acquired. 

I have the honor of sending you, Sir, a letter from the 
Count de Durat, Governor of Grenada, relative to an 
affair, concerning which I wrote to him, by your recom- 
mendation. It seems to me, agreeably to his answer, that 
those interested should for the future apply to Dr Frank- 
lin, to procure satisfaction. You will perhaps think proper 
to communicate to them the letter of M. de Durat. 

You will also find annexed, Sir, some papers relative to 
an affair, which concerns the United States, or the State 
of Georgia. Be pleased to let me know what answer I 
can send to those inhabitants of the Cape who are inter- 
ested. 

I am, Sir, with the greatest respect, &,c.

Sir, 

] duly received the letter your Excellency honored me 
with on the 25th ultimo, relative to Captain Asgill; it appears 
that Congress are favorably disposed respecting him, but 
they have not yet passed any resolution on that head. 
When they do, I doubt not it will be favorable. 

I have seen with much pleasure a Proclamation of the 
Governor of the State of New York, to prevent sending 
provisions to the enemy. The accounts I have recently 
received on that subject from the States of Jersey and 
Connecticut, give me more pain than I can express. They 
are positive, and from people who had ocular demonstra- 
tion ; they prove, that the enemy's fleet could not have 
quitted New York for some time, if they had not received 
immense quantities of provisions, living and dead. This 
commerce is carried on regularly and openly, as if it were 
peace, or as if the cattle were for your army. Your Ex- 
cellency knows how important the despatch or detention 
in fitting out fleets is, and I know the efforts you have 
made to put a stop to this destructive commerce. I must 
however entreat you, Sir, to use your influence with the 
Governors of Jersey and Connecticut, to adopt such meas- 
ures as may prove efficacious. I am sure there is not a 
single good citizen in America, who is not hurt at seeing 
the enemy thus furnished from this continent, and thereby 
enabled to distress us in the West Indies. 

I have the honor to be, &c.

my detention of the enclosed letters, which have been

Sir, than to myself. I have at various periods of the 
war written to Congress and to the States, endeavor-

most vigorous laws, to prevent the inhabitants from 
furnishing the enemy with provisions. I will write 
them again and will use every argument I am master 
of for that purpose. Tn all other nations, I believe, 
the persons guilty of that crime are punished with 
death, and unless the States on this continent will 
pass similar laws, I see no means of putting a stop to 
that destructive practice. Anything the military 
could do in that matter, would be in vain. To post as

undertake to say, but I think I may venture to assure 
your Excellency, that your generous interposition had 
no small degree of weight in procuring that decision 
in favor of Captain Asgill, which he had no right to 
expect from the very unsatisfactory measures, which 
had been taken by the British Commander in Chief to 
atone for a crime of the blackest dye, not to be justi- 
fied by the practices of war, and unknown to this day 
amongst civilized nations. I flatter myself, however, 
that our enemies have been brought to see this trans- 
action in its true light, and that we shall not experi-

SUBSTANCE OP A VERBAL COMMUNICATION FROM THE 
FRENCH MINISTER. 

Office of Foreign Affairs, December 30th, 1782. 

The substance of a verbal communication made to 
the Secretary for Foreign Affairs by the Minister of 
France, on the 30th and 31st of December, 17S2, 
offered to the consideration of Congress on the 1st of 
January, 1783, by the said Secretary. 

The Minister of France came this day agreeably to 
appointment, to the Office of Foreign Affairs, and 
read to Mr Livingston a letter from the Count de 
Verge nnes to him, dated the 12th of August last, 
which contained in substance ; that the negotiations 
begun by Mr Grenville and Mr Oswald were inter- 
rupted by the resignation of Mr Fox. That previous 
to that, the King of England appeared disposed to ac- 
knowledge the independency of America in express 
terms, without making it a condition of the peace; 
that Mr Grenville encouraged them to hope, that this 
object would be rendered complete by an act of Par- 
liament ; that they looked in vain for this act till they 
were apprised of the resignation of Mr Fox ; that the 
difference which arose between him and Lord Shel- 
burne led thern to suppose, that the design of the first 
was to recognise the independency of America and 
treat for a general peace upon fair and honorable 
terms; that Lord Shelburne's was, on the contrary, 
to endeavor to excite distrusts, and particularly to en- 
deavor to mislead the Americans ; that in pursuance 
of this system in the month of June last, at the very 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 147 

time that they opened their treaty in Europe, he pro- 
posed to offer the most advantageous terms to America 
upon condition that the Americans laid down their 
arms and left France to settle the dispute alone. This 
insidious conduct was pursued during Mr Grenville's 
negotiation. 

That Mr Fox's resignation suspended the negotia- 
tion, though the new Administration declared, that 
this event should occasion no change of measures ; 
that the Court of France expected the effect of this 
declaration, when a commission was expedited to Mr 
Oswald to treat with the American Plenipotentiaries, 
and another to authorise Mr Fitzherbert to resume the 
negotiation begun by Mr Grenville ; that he had pre- 
sented his credentials the 4th instant ; that Mr Os- 
wald had yet received only a copy of his, owing to 
the Chancellor's absence ; that Mr Fitzherbert had 
returned the answer of Great Britain to the counter 
proposition given by France ; that this contains full 
evidence of the unsteadiness of Lord Shelburne's con- 
duct, since, instead of making the independence of 
America a separate object, it proposes it as a condi- 
tion, and as the price of peace, and adds, that every 
other circumstance should be placed upon the basis of 
1763. 

He observes, that the Chevalier de la Luzerne will 
judge from this, that they affected much surprise at 
the counter propositions, and that they did not assent 
to them ; neither on the other hand, have they yet 
refused them, but confine themselves to demanding 
explanations. That this was then the state of their 
negotiations ; that Mr Oswald had presented his com- 



148 LUZERNE. 

mission, to which Mr Franklin and Mr Jay had yet 
given no reply, suspending it till they knew his (the 
Count de Vergennes's) sentiments; that as yet he had 
formed no opinion, waiting the result of a conference, 
which he was to have the next day with those Minis- 
ters ; that the commission was in the usual form, but 
speaks of the Americans as Colonies, without naming 
them rebels, or asserting any claims upon them. 

That he did not for his part believe, that Lord 
Shelburne would negotiate a general peace sincerely, 
till he lost all hopes of sowing dissensions and treating 
separately ; that they were convinced, that neither 
France nor Spain were to be deceived, and that he (the 
Count de Vergennes,) entertained the same sentiments 
with respect to the Americans, but that the British 
Ministry, deceiving themselves, may continue to tempt 
them till a peace is signed ; that the information they 
(the Court of France,) had received from him (the 
Minister of France,) had left them little doubt on that 
head, and that those doubts will be entirely removed 
when the States shall have respectively imitated the 
example of Maryland, Virginia, and New Jersey. 

That, however, good faith was not all that was re- 
quired of an ally ; that they must feel themselves in a 
situation to impose terms on the enemy ; that unhap- 
pily the Americans had neglected this ; that the 
Minister of France could not press this too closely 
upon us. 

He then proceeds to inform the Minister, that while 
the British had set on foot a direct negotiation, the 
Imperial Court renewed their instances with that of 
London to engage them to accept their mediation ; that 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 149 

this gave birth to an answer, in which his Britannic 
Majesty, without taking notice of the negotiation 
begun at Paris, declared, that he was ready to receive 
through them, every pacific overture, and even to 
admit the Dutch and the Americans to the negotiation. 
This answer was dated on the 29th of April, when Mr 
Oswald was already in Paris. That they continued 
their negotiations, and sent Mr Grenville powers, 
which were dated on the 21st of May ; that they did 
not conceal this from the Imperial Court, but pre- 
tended that it was at the instance of France. 

That this false accusation, and above all the fear of 
seeing the mediation vanish, had engaged the Imperial 
Court to communicate to the Court of Versailles and 
Madrid, the last Memorial of the Court of London, 
and to exhort them to establish a negotiation under 
their auspices; that it was easy to refute the unskilful 
accusation of the British, which he (the Count de 
Vergennes,) thinks they (the Court of France,) have 
done with success ; that the answer is transmitted ; 
that they had determined, without rejecting the medi- 
ation, to pursue the direct negotiation as long as it 
might be convenient to the Court of London ; that he 
had not seen the answer of the British, which could 
not, however, be very satisfactory, since they have 
expedited the commission to Mr Fitzherbert and Mr 
Oswald ; that he (the Count, de Vergennes,) was igno- 
rant of the part, that the Imperial Courts would take 
upon their declinatory answer. 

But that they had always been candid, clear, and 
open, and would have no objection to confide their 
interests with the mediators upon the established basis,

whenever the Court of London shall decline the direct 
negotiation she had begun; that the King did not 
doubt but that Congress would think with him on this 
subject, and that he would not hesitate, if circum- 
stances should require it, to give such assurances to 
the two Imperial Courts. In a postscript he adds, 
that he had seen Mr Jay and Mr Franklin, and that 
they had together discussed both the substance and 
form of the commission to Mr Oswald, and that in 
spite of his (Mr Oswald's) instances, they had agreed 
to decline entering into the matter with him, until he 
shall have produced the original of his commission.

December 31st, 1782. 
Sir, 

The undersigned, Minister Plenipotentiary of 
France, has had the honor of communicating to the 
Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs, sev- 
eral facts and circumstances relative to the negotiation 
for a general peace, which is now carried on at Paris, 
between the belligerent powers. That Minister will 
communicate them to Congress; but the undersigned 
Plenipotentiary, has received orders himself, to express 
to that Assembly, the satisfaction of the King, his 
master, at the conduct, which they have observed on 
occasion of the overtures, made by the English Com- 
missioners commanding at New York, at different

times, for establishing a particular negotiation with the 
United States, or with any one of them. 

The King has seen with pleasure the resolutions 
taken by his allies under these circumstances, and 
their perfect harmony with those, which he has taken 
himself. 

He has observed with equal satisfaction the unanim- 
ity, which has reigned in the different States of the 
Union, which have expressed their sentiments in rela- 
tion to the proposal for a separate peace ; their deter- 
mination honorably to reject every proposal of this 
kind, corresponds perfectly with the opinion formed 
by his Majesty, of their fidelity in the observance of 
their engagements, and of the wisdom which presides 
in their Councils. 

The communications made to the Secretary of the 
Department of Foreign Affairs, encourage the pre- 
sumption, that conduct, as prudent and advantageous 
as it is just and wise, will soon bring the allies to a 
happy conclusion of the present war. The British 
Minister showed a peaceable disposition ; he had rea- 
sonable fears respecting the fate of several naval ope- 
rations, which, on the contrary, have had a result 
much more favorable than the Court of London seemed 
to expect. Possibly these unexpected successes may 
change his disposition for peace, and on that supposi- 
tion, the undersigned Minister thinks, that it will be 
wise in the United States not to relax their efforts and 
their preparations for the ensuing campaign. Con- 
gress may be assured, that his Majesty will, on his 
part, hold himself in readiness to carry it on with 



152 LUZERNE. 

vigor, and that he will apply all his resources to that 

object.*

RESOLVES OF CONGRESS ON THE DEPARTURE OF THE 

FRENCH ARMY. 

In Congress, January 1st, 1783. 

On Report of the Secretary of Foreign Affairs, 
The Minister Plenipotentiary of his Most Christian Maj- 
esty having communicated to Congress, through the Secre- 
tary of Foreign Affairs, on the 7th instant, the resolution 
taken to embark the army under the command of the 
Count de Rochambeau, and on the 29th their having actu- 
ally embarked and sailed, together with his Majesty's in- 
tention to direct them to return, whenever an object should 
offer in which they might effectually co-operate with the 
troops of the United States ; 

Resolved, That the Secretary of Foreign Affairs inform 
the Minister of France, that though Congress cannot see

Foreign Affairs, to whom was referred the foregoing note, 

"Resolved, That the Secretary of Foreign Affairs inform the 
Minister of France, that Congress learn with great pleasure, that the 
steps taken by Congress and the respective States, their constituents, 
in opposition to the attempts of the British Court to bring about a 
partial negotiation, has been satisfactory to his Most Christian Ma- 
jesty. That his Majesty's conduct in the progress of the negotiations 
commenced in Europe, as it has been communicated to Congress, is 
sufficient to inspire a just abhorrence of every act derogatory to the 
principles of the alliance, and serves to fortify the resolutions, which 
his repeated acts of friendship, and a sense of their own houM an d 
dignity had dictated to the United States in Congress assembled, and 
the States they represent."

without regret, the departure of an army to whose bravery 
at:H good conduct they are so greatly indebted for the re- 
duction of the enemy's force in this country, yet, that they 
have too much confidence in the attention of his Majesty 
to the interests of the alliance, not to be persuaded, that 
the order for their departure was dictated by a conviction, 
that they could elsewhere be more usefully employed 
against the common enemy. That they wish him to make 
known to his Majesty the grateful sense they entertain of 
his attention to their immediate interest, manifested in the 
important aid thus long afforded them, and in his generous 
determination to direct his troops to return to this country, 
whenever circumstances will admit of an advantageous co- 
operation with the arms of the United States. That they 
desire through him to recommend in a particular manner 
the Count de Rochambeau, and the army under his com- 
mand, to the favor of his Majesty, having the highest rea- 
son to be satisfied with their bravery and good conduct, 
and with that strict discipline, to which they are indebted 
for the perfect harmony, which has so happily subsisted 
between them and the soldiers and citizens of the United 
States. 

Resolved, That the President make the acknowledge- 
ments of Congress, in a particular manner, to his Excel- 
lency the Count de Rochambeau, and signify to him the 
high sense they entertain of the distinguished talents dis- 
played by him, with so much advantage to these States, in 
the most important conjunctures, as well as of the strict 
and exemplary discipline, which has been uniformly con- 
spicuous in the troops under his command, and which 
has deservedly acquired the admiration and esteem of the 
citizens of these States, by whom his signal services, and

will ever be held in affectionate remembrance.

Philadelphia, January 10th, 1783. 

Sir, 

The undersigned, Minister Plenipotentiary of France, 
has made a seasonable report to his Court, of the incon- 
veniences, which might result from the advantageous capit- 
ulations granted to the Islands of St Christopher, Nevis, 
and Moniserrat, conquered by the forces of his Majesty. 
The term of six months, which had been granted to the 
capitulators for receiving the vessels, which they expected 
from England, and for sending them back under a neutral 
flag, even to the ports of Great Britain, expired some time 
ago, and thus no inconvenience can result from this stipu- 
lation. Some of the said capitulations gave power to the 
Governors to authorise by particular permissions, even 
after the expiration of the six months, exportations from 
these conquered Islands to the ports of the enemy. 

The undersigned has the honor of informing the Secre- 
tary of Foreign Affairs, that, in consequence of orders 
given to the Governor General of these Islands, these per- 
missions will not be given ; and, therefore, nothing will 
prevent the entire execution of the resolutions of Congress 
in relation to the importation of English merchandise into 
this country. Congress may be assured, that his Majesty 
will concur in all measures of this kind, which shall have 
for their object the prevention of commerce with Great 

Britain.

DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 155 

TO ROBERT MORRIS.

Translation. 

Philadelphia, March loth, 1783. 
Sir, 

I have ihe satisfaction of informing you, that his Majesty 
has procured for the United States, a loan of six millions, 
to be employed in the Department of War, during the 
course of the present year. In announcing to you, Sir, this 
new mark of the friendship of the King for the United 
States, I must enter into some details, which relate to 
your operations, and which will make you acquainted with 
the motives, which have induced his Majesty to make this 
new effort in favor of his allies. 

In the course of the last year, Sir, 1 gave an account to 
his Majesty's Minister* of the order, which seemed to me to 
be introduced into the department intrusted to you, of the 
re-establishment of the public credit, and of the economy, 
which attended your operations. I added, that I consid- 
ered the establishment of a public revenue, for the pay- 
ment of interest, and the progressive redemption of the 
capitals, as extremely probable, and as the delay and the 
difficulty of communication would not allow me to wait till 
this operation was completed by the different Legislatures, 
before I should explain what were the wants of the United 
States, I took it upon myself to write to the Count de Ver- 
gennes, that the disposition of the people to fulfil the en- 
gagements made, and to be made by Congress, appeared 
to me sufficiently favorable to induce his Majesty to lend a 
new sum of money to the United States, for this year, if 
the stale of his finances should allow it. These assur- 



156 LUZERNE, 

ances determined the loan of six millions ; but the event 
has proved, that I had deceived myself in the hopes, which 
I had thought myself authorised to give to my Court, and 
so far from the financial affairs being improved since the 
month of February, the time at which my letters on this 
subject were written, they have, on the contrary, taken a 
retrograde direction, and I see no certainty of the payment 
of the sums previously lent, and of that which has just 
heen lent. 

Thus, Sir, my hasty assurances have determined his 
Majesty to advance this money, and, at the moment in 
which I am informed of it, I am under the disagreeable 
necessity of acquainting his Minister, that the hopes, which 
I had given have vanished, and that my assurances were 
without foundation. 

I shall say nothing to you of the embarrassing situation, 
in which I am personally placed by these circumstances. 
But I shall take the liberty of observing to you, that in the 
present juncture, the best remedy is to take, as soon as 
possible, the measures which have not been taken within 
the time which I had announced. 

The Count de Vergennes, Sir, informs me, that the six 
millions are lent to the United States, in the same manner, 
and on the same conditions, as the sum which was lent last 
year ; that is to say, that they will be paid from month to 
month, at the rate ol five hundred thousand livres a month; 
but as it appeared, according to what you did me the 
honor of writing to me previously, that you had anticipated 
a part of this loan, I must entreat you to observe, that the 
first months of this year will serve for paying the money 
thus anticipated, and thus, that it is, accordingly, proper so 
to arrange the drawing of your bills, as that they may only 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 157 

be presented from month to month, and at the times when 
the money for paying them shall have been obtained. 

1 have had the honor to inform you, Sir, that this money 
was loaned to the United States in order to enable them to 
continue the war; the wisdom of Congress will determine, 
according to circumstances, the manner of effecting this 
important object, and by united efforts, of compelling the 
enemy to conclude a firm and lasting peace. 

It remains for me to inform you, Sir, that the King has 
not been able to make this last effort, without great diffi- 
culties. I have had the honor of communicating to you 
those, which prevent the success of loans of any considera- 
ble magnitude ; they are so great, that I am ordered to 
announce to you, in the most positive manner, that it will 
be impossible for the King, under any supposition what- 
ever, to procure new advances of money for Congress, for 
the next year. With regard to the resources, which you 
may seek in other places besides France, the letters, which 
I have had the honor of reading to you, do not allow any 
success to be looked for, until the United Slates shall have 
established a permanent public revenue ; and the delay 
and repugnance, with which they proceed in doing this, 
being known in Europe, the inclination for lending money 
to Congress, which may have existed, has disappeared j 
the lenders make other investments ; the speculations, 
which might have been directed towards the United States, 
go farther and farther from them, and it will certainly be 
difficult to bring them back. 

I refrain from repeating here the other parts of the des- 
patches of the Count de Vergennes, which 1 have had the 
honor of communicating to you, because the truths con- 
tained in them are well known to you, Sir, and because 



158 LUZERNE. 

they all may be reduced to this. Without the speedy es- 
tablishment of a substantial public revenue, and without 
the vigorous execution of the engagements entered into by 
Congress, the hope of obtaining loans in Europe must be 
given up. 

I am also ordered, Sir, to represent to Congress, that 
my Court relied upon final and satisfactory measures being 
taken to secure the payment of the interest, and of the 
debt contracted by the United States toward his Majesty. 
But I content myself with mentioning this circumstance to 
you, and before directly announcing it to Congress, 1 shall 
wait till their present embarrassments are diminished. 

You will judge, Sir, by these details, how impossible it 
is to draw bills upon your Plenipotentiaries, beyond that 
part of the six millions' loan of this year, which is unap- 
propriated. It is clearly shown, that these bills will not be 
paid by us, and it is with a full confidence in your regu- 
larity in this respect, that I shall inform die Count de Ver- 
gennes, that he may be assured, that no demand will be 
made for any sums whatever, beyond that sum, which has 
just been determined upon. 

1 have the honor to be, he.

TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Translation. 

Philadelphia, March 15th, 1783. 
Sir, 

Your Excellency will doubtless receive directly, a state 

of affairs in Europe. I thought, however, that it would be 

interesting to inform you of some particulars, which I am 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 1 59 

ordered not to make public, but which will also be commu- 
nicated to Congress. The British Minister has hastened 
to conclude an eventual treaty of peace with the United 
States, and to grant them in the utmost extent every ad- 
vantage they could desire. The malevolence with which 
that power has carried on the war in America, did not 
forebode this extreme facility in them, and it has been an 
agreeable surprise to the belligerent powers, and you will 
easily judge, Sir, that our satisfaction has been complete, 
and in seeing the great obstacle to peace put, as it were, 
on one side. 

We think we may hope, that the epocha of a general 
peace is not far distant. However, the English, though 
disposed to come to a conclusion with the Courts of Ver- 
sailles and Madrid, seem much more difficult in the nego- 
tiation carrying on with the States-General. But the 
King, who through the whole of this war, has refused to 
conclude a peace without obtaining for his allies a just and 
reasonable satisfaction, persists in these sentiments, and he 
doubts not that the United States will on their part fulfil 
their engagements by continuing the war till a definitive 
treaty is concluded, and thereby entirely disconcert the 
projects of the English, who flatter themselves, that by 
means of the eventual treaty, which they have concluded, 
they will be able to establish on the Continent a suspension 
of hostilities equal to a truce, written and signed. 

It is possible, that the firmness and resolution of his 
Majesty will determine England to make those restitutions, 
to which she shows so much repugnance ; but it is also 
possible, that the war will continue another year, and to 
put the United States in a situation to continue the war 
with vigor, his Majesty has lent them six millions of livres ; 



1G0 LUZERNE. 

six hundred thousand livres are arrived in the Washington, 
hut I have learnt with much pain that Mr Morris has, 
through want of means, been forced to anticipate the pecu- 
niary succors he hoped to receive, so that the six millions 
is not so considerable a help as was to have been desired. 

It remains to examine in what manner we can disturb 
and shut up the enemy during the next campaign. 1 shall 
not take the liberty to sound your Excellency on these 
points, but I beg you to permit me to say, that it will be 
serving the common cause essentially to slop those exces- 
sive exportations of subsistence to New York, and in case 
of an evacuation of that place, to prevent them as much as 
possible from proem ing subsistence from hence to carry on 
the campaign in the West Indies. 

The Due de Lauzun will confer with you on these 
points on bis return from the eastwarJ, and 1 beg you, Sir, 
to consider with him how to make the legion early useful ; 
it may be very usefully employed in the service above 
mentioned, and the Duke will be happy to act in any man- 
ner your Excellency may wish. 

In all cases, it cannot but be of service to hold ourselves 
in a hostile position. If the negotiations produce the happy 
effects we wish, I will lose no time in informing you, and 
knowing your humane disposition, I think I never shall an- 
nounce to you a more agreeable event than a general 
peace, honorable and safe to the allies. You are con- 
vinced how sincerely the King wishes it, and the sacrifices 
he has made to obtain it will prove this. 

If the treaty has been communicated to you, Sir, you 
will have seen that the King of England has reserved 
to himself the liberty to conclude, or not to conclude, the 
treaty of peace with America, so that the act signed the

merely conditional and eventual.

I am exceedingly obliged to your Excellency for your

that we should hold ourselves in a hostile position, prepared 
for either alternative, peace or war. 

I shall confer with the Due de la Lauzun on the objects 

you are pleased to mention ; and as I have ever viewed 

the practice of the States in supplying the enemy in New

announce a general peace, you cannot make a more pleas-

Persuaded of the pure and benevolent intentions, which

MINUTES OF A VERBAL COMMUNICATION FROM THE 
MINISTER OF FRANCE. 

Office of Foreign Affairs, March 22d, 1733. 

The Minister of France, waiting upon Mr Livingston at 
12 o'clock agreeable to appointment, communicated to him 
a letter from the Count de Vergennes, dated the 19th of 
November. 

This was wholly confined to matters of finance, and 
contained in substance nothing more than Congress have 
already seen in the letter, written by the Minister of France 
to Mr Morris. He then read to Mr Livingston a letter 
of the 22d of November, which related to the satisfaction 
the King, his master, had received in the testimony the 
United States had given of their friendship, in presenting 
to him the ship America. The substance of this letter has 
been inserted in the note sent to Congress the 28th instant. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 163 

The Minister also read to Mr Livingston, a letter of the 
19th of December, from the Count de Vergennes, in 
which he informs him, that their treaty was not so forward 
as that of the Americans. Though if his Majesty had 
wished it, he could have signed before the American Plen- 
ipotentiaries, as no essential difference existed between 
France and Great Britain. But that the King's delicacy 
induced him to wish, that all his allies should be first satis- 
fied, and he had accordingly resolved to continue the war, 
whatever advantages might be offered him, if Great Britain 
should bear hard upon any of them. That it still re- 
mained to reconcile the interest of Spain, and those of 
Holland. That he had reason to believe with relation to 
the first, that they would soon be fully settled. That the 
foundation was already laid, and that nothing now remained 
but to settle forms. That he was of opinion, that it was 
for the interest of the United States to facilitate a connex- 
ion with this power, which will be their neighbor. 

That it would become the wisdom of Congress to disco- 
ver moderation with respect to them. That he is persuaded 
England will see with pleasure, divisions introduced be- 
tween the United States and the Court of Madrid, and 
that it is probable, that they will even endeavor to animate 
them one against the other. That British emissaries have 
been employed to inspire Spain with apprehensions as to 
the ambitious views of America. But they will now avail 
themselves of this intimacy with the American Ministers, 
to render them suspicious of Spain, and even to excite 
their resentments against her. Congress will defeat this 
design by removing the difficulties, which now oppose 
themselves to a union with his Catholic Majesty. That 
the King wishes so much to see his allies enjoy a solid and 



164 LUZERNE. 

durable peace, that in exciting the Americans on one side 
to discover a more conciliatory spirit, he will spare nothing 
on the other to remove the difficulties, which may be 
raised by the Court of Spain. That he apprehends delays 
and embarrassments from Holland. That the British Ad- 
ministration appear very unfavorable to them. 

The Minister of France then read to Mr Livingston 
another letter from the Count de Vergennes, of the 20th 
of December, 1782, which contained in substance; that 
peace was not yet concluded ; that it was anxiously de- 
sired by the King. That his Majesty's obligations to his 
allies had not yet permitted him to pronounce with cer- 
tainty as to the termination of the war. That expecting 
peace, prudence required, that the allies should act as if 
the war was to continue. That Congress will judge of the 
manner in which they can most effectually contribute 
to distress the common enemy. That in the present 
state of things it would not be prudent to invite the Amer- 
icans to form any direct enterprise against the common 
enemy. That the Provisional Articles would, when ex- 
ecuted, at the general peace, put New York into the 
hands of the Americans, and that Congress could judge 
better than they could what part it would be expedient for 
them to take in the then state of things. That proposing 
nothing they leave everything to their discretion. That 
the Minister should however inform them, that he could 
not yet determine whether they were at the eve of the war 
or if another campaign must be opened. That in the 
latter case there were two essential objects, on which the 
Minister of France should impart to Congress the opinion 
of his Court, and the desires of his Majesty. 

That though if their towns were evacuated the 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 165 

Americans could not take an active part, yet they can 
compel the enemy to wish for peace, by excluding 
them from all connexion with them and prohibiting 
under very severe penalties, the consumption or im- 
portation of British manufactures. That a considera- 
ble party among the British wish to form commercial con- 
nexion with the United States. That when they shall be 
convinced, that they can reap no benefit therefrom, but by 
a solid definitive peace, conformable to the treaty already 
agreed upon, they will become more tractable, and con- 
clude the definitive treaty, which will give force and vigor 
to the provisional articles, and set the seal to the indepen- 
dence of America. That it would also be proper to state 
to Congress the necessity of providing means to prevent 
the sending provisions into New York, by which the Brit- 
ish armaments are amply supplied with fresh provisions of 
every kind. 

That the King persuades himself, that the Legislatures 
of the respective States will concur in measures for this 
salutary purpose, when they shall be informed of the injury 
occasioned to their ally by the want of the necessary 
precautions on this subject. That these precautions will 
not be unnecessary if the enemy are about to abandon 
New York, without which the enemy will carry with them 
the means of supplying the places to which they transport 
their troops. 

That he persuades himself, that Congress will perceive, 
that they are indebted to the harmony, that has subsisted 
between the King and them for the present happy state of 
their affairs. But that nothing being yet concluded, the 
present moment is precisely that in which it is of most im- 
portance to preserve the same system.

GEORGE WASHINGTON TO M. DE LA LUZERNE. 

Head Quarters, March 29th, 1783. 
Sir, 

The news of a general peace, which your Excellency 
has been so good as to announce to me, has filled my mind 
with inexpressible satisfaction j and permit me to add, that 
the joy I feel on this great event is doubly enhanced, by 
the very obliging manner in which you have been pleased 
to express your congratulations to me and the army on this 
happy occasion. 

The part your Excellency has acted in the cause of 
America, and the great and benevolent share you have 
taken in the establishment of her independence, are deeply 
impressed on my mind, and will not be effaced from my 
remembrance, or that of the citizens of America, but with 
the latest effects' of time. You will accept, Sir, my warm- 
est acknowledgements and congratulations, with assurances 
that I shall always participate, with the highest pleasure, in 
every event which may contribute to your happiness and 
satisfaction. 

The articles of a general treaty do not appear so favor- 
able to France, in point of territorial acquisitions, ?.s they 
do to the other powers ; but the magnanimous and disin- 
terested scale of action, which that great nation has ex- 
hibited to the world during this war, and at the conclusion 
of peace, will insure to the King and nation that reputa- 
tion, which will be of more consequence to them, than 
every other consideration. 

Mrs Washington begs your Excellency to accept her 
sincerest thanks for the joy you have communicated to her,

and to receive a return of her congratulations on this most 
happy of all events.

Sir, 

I have received the letter, with which you honored me 
on the 4th of this month, and the Memorial of Mr Durham, 
which accompanied it. I cannot form any opinion upon 
such a statement, and I shall be unable to know whether 
the complaints are just, before I learn the motives of tlve 
conduct, which he professes to have observed on his part. 
I have the honor of sending you a letter for the Marquis de 
Bouille, in relation to this affair, and I entreat you to have 
the kindness to send it to that individual, who will take 
care to send it to the commander. 

You have been informed, Sir, of the affair of Mr Gillon, 
or rather of the many affairs, which have been the subject 
of controversy between him and the subjects of the King. 
You will find a statement of it in a Memorial which I an- 
nex, requesting you to be pleased to return it when read ; 
I have addressed it to the State of South Carolina ; I re- 
quest you to be pleased to read the resolutions taken in 
consequence of it by the Assembly of that State, and the 
annexed copies of which you may keep. I have also the 
honor of sending you, Sir, some new demands against that 
officer, which I have lately received. I shall make no re- 
flection respecting the resolutions of Carolina; but I en- 
treat you to be pleased to point out the most proper course 
for obtaining justice, and to inform me whether it would 
seem to you proper, that I should lay this matter before 
Congress.

By this term, Sir, we mean a place to which all mer-

Philadelphia, September 17th, 1783. 
Sir, 

The undersigned Minister Plenipotentiary has the honor 

of communicating to Congress an extract from a letter of 

the Count de Vergennes, and a copy of a contract between 

the King and the Thirteen United States. He requests 

Congress to be pleased to send the ratification of it to their 

Minister at his Majesty's Court, in order that he may settle 

this business with the Count de Vergennes. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 171 

The undersigned received the papers, of which a copy is 
annexed, nearly four months ago. He had received orders, 
at the same time, to inform his Court of the measures, 
which the United States might have taken, for the accom- 
plishment of the different articles of the contract of the 
I6di of July, of last year. The undersigned has deferred 
till this time, the communications in question, in the hope 
that circumstances might become more favorable. As the 
peace has made these stipulations, which were only even- 
tual, executory, he can refrain no longer from requesting 
Congress to acquaint him with the arrangements which 
may have been made by the United States, or those which 
they propose to make, for the execution of the contract of 
the 16th of July, of last year, as well as with those to be 
made for the execution of the contract, of which a copy is

(Annexed to the note, sent on the 17th of September, 1783.) 

Translation. 

Versailles, March 10th, 17S3. 
Sir, 

Dr Franklin, in the month of February last, com- 
municated to me different decrees of the Congress of 
the United States of North America, passed on the 
14th and 23d of September, and several letters from 
Messrs Morris and Livingston, which not only author- 
ised that Minister, but even expressly ordered him to 
negotiate in Europe a loan of four millions of dollars, 



172 LUZERNE. 

amounting to about twenty millions of livres tournois, 
for the service of the United States during the present 
year, and under their warranty. It was at the same 
time enjoined on Dr Franklin, earnestly to solicit the 
continuance of the favors of the King, in the crisis in 
which Congress was then placed. 

In the enumeration of the motives, which the Su- 
perintendent of the finances alleged, in order to obtain 
a new loan of money from his Majesty, he did not 
deny, that the Minister of France might assign good 
reasons for declining to comply with this request, but 
he added, that, as it was the last of this kind, which 
Congress would have occasion to make, he hoped that 
it would not be rejected. 

Dr Franklin, on his part, in obedience to the orders 
of Congress, implored, in favor of the United States, 
the assistance of the King, and added to the reasons 
previously given, that, without this assistance the 
continental army could no longer be kept together, 
nor disbanded without danger. 

After having conferred on this subject with M. Joly 
de Fleury, I made a report upon it to the King. I 
informed his Majesty of the embarrassments of Con- 
gress, and of their inability to provide for their neces- 
sities by means of taxes, which the imperfections or 
the weakness of a rising Administration did not per- 
mit them to levy. The King had already, by great 
sacrifices, fulfilled in their behalf, the duties of a most 
tender father, during the continuance of their moral 
infancy. Since the nation reached the period of ma- 
turity, consecrated by its emancipation and political 
independence, it seemed that it ought to be sufficient 






DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 173 

for itself, and not to require new efforts of the gene- 
rosity of its ally; but without being prevented by 
these considerations, the King, faithful to his attach- 
ment to the United States, was pleased, under these 
circumstances, to give a new proof of it, and notwith- 
standing the difficulties, which his Majesty experi- 
enced in his own finances, he determined, according 
to my report of the 20ih of December last, to grant to 
Congress a new loan of six millions of livrcs tournois, 
for the service of the United States, during the course 
of the present year. He also authorised the advanc- 
ing of a sum of money previously granted, which Dr 
Franklin earnestly solicited. I informed that Minister 
of it, who, in his answer of January 25lh, gratefully 
accepted these new favors in the name of the United 
States. I informed him, moreover, that they could 
not be increased, and that his Majesty would in no 
case be a guarantee for other loans, which he might 
procure in Holland or elsewhere. 

I have thought proper to enter into these details 
with you, Sir, in order that you may be able to com- 
municate them to Congress, and that that body may 
be informed by you of the last financial arrangements, 
which his Majesty has been pleased to decide upon, in 
favor of the United Stales. I have since concerted 
with Dr Franklin, those measures, which were neces- 
sary for fixing the conditions and the terms of pay- 
ment of the loan of six millions of livres, of which I 
have been speaking. They were stipulated in a con- 
tract made on the 25th of February last, which we 
signed by virtue of our respective full powers, as we 
had done with regard to preceding advances, by a 



174 LUZERNE. 

contract previously made on the 16th of July, of last 
year, of which I informed you at the time, and of 
which we are now expecting the ratification on the 
part of Congress. Although I do not doubt that Dr 
Franklin has transmitted this new act to Congress, I 
have slill thought it proper to send the annexed copy 
of it to you. 

By the first article, you will see, Sir, that the King 
lends Congress the sum of six millions of livres, payable 
at the rate of five hundred thousand livres in each of 
the twelve months of the current year, on condition of 
the repayment of the capital with interest at five per 
cent per annum. 

The second article recapitulates and verifies the pre- 
ceding aids furnished by his Majesty, and divides 
them into three distinct classes. The first consisting 
of the sums loaned, amounting to eighteen millions of 
livres. The second, of a fund of ten millions, arising 
from a loan obtained in Holland for the service of the 
United States, and guaranteed by his Majesty. The 
third, of subsidies, gratuitously furnished, amounting 
to nine millions of livres, the gift of which to the 
United States is confirmed by his Majesty. 

The third Article fixes the repayment to the royal 
treasury, of the new loan of six millions, with the in- 
terest thereon, at six periods, fixed at the times most 
convenient for the financial operations of Congress. 

By the fourth Article, it has been agreed, that the 
interest on the last loan of six millions, shall not com- 
mence till the 1st of January, 17S4. The King being 
pleased to give and remit to Congress the partial inter- 
est on the capital for the present year. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 175 

The fifth and sixth Articles contain stipulations of 
usage and form. 

All attesting the sentiments of affection entertained 
by the King for the United States, and his tender 
anxiety to contribute to their prosperity. 

I desire you, Sir, to assure Congress, that these 
sentiments are deeply engraven on the heart of the 
King, that his Council feel them no less deeply ; and 
that his Majesty will never cease to take the most 
lively interest in the welfare of the United States, his 
allies. 

You will be pleased to inform me of the reception of 
this letter, and of the annexed paper.

Versailles, January 9th, 1784. 
Sir, 

I have communicated to the King the observations con- 
tained in the memoir, which you transmitted to me relative 
to the commerce of America, and those, which you made 
at our last conference. 

I am authorised to announce to you, that it is the in- 
tention of his Majesty, to grant to the United States the 
ports of L'Orient and Bayonne as free ports ; and besides 
these, that of Dunkirk and that of Marseilles, the first of 
which enjoys absolute freedom, and the other is restrained 
in the exercise of that freedom only with regard to tobacco, 
which is there subjected to a duty. The Americans may 
from this moment send their vessels to those four ports, 
where they will not meet with any kind of difficulty. 

You may, if necessary, explain what is meant by free 
ports, agreeably to the signification thereof given by M. 
de Vergennes, in his letter of the 29th of June last.* The 
Americans will find, above all at Dunkirk, all the facilities 
they can desire for the sale of their leaf tobacco, their rice, 
their timber, and other merchandise, as well as for the 
purchase of what they want ; such as linens, woollens, 
brandy, &c. It is proposed to establish stores and maga- 
zines there, which shall be well supplied, on terms very 
advantageous for their commerce. 

I have given orders to the Farmers-General to treat in 
preference, and at a reasonable price, for the purchase of 
the tobaccoes of North America. And, moreover, the 

* See above, p. 170.

United States will be as much favored in France, in mat- 
ters of commerce, as any oilier nation. The complaints, 
which they may make to you, or which Dr Franklin and 
the other American Ministers, whom 1 should be very glad 
to see, may transmit to me on their behalf, shall be exam- 
ined with great attention ; and government will not suffer 
them to experience any kind of vexations. Every pos- 
sible precaution will aiso be taken to prevent the sending 
out Lad merchandise, which if it has hitherto taken place, 
can only be attributed to the avarice of some merchants of 
the lowest order. 

I am going immediately to examine what relates to the 
customs and duties, which hurt commerce. This is an 
important subject, and requires great attention. In fine, 
Sir, you may rely, that I shall be always disposed, as well 
as the Marshal de Castries, and the Count de Vergennes, 
to receive and listen with attention to the demands and 
further representations, which you shall think proper to 
make in favor of the commerce of America.

merce between France and the United States, which I 
have also the honor of transmitting. With respect to this 
paper, I must pray leave to refer Congress to the caution 
contained in the letter to me, and pray their compliance 
with his intention. The masterly manner in which the 
Marquis has treated a subject, certainly foreign to his for- 
mer habits and views, merits great applause, and will I 
doubt not, procure that approbation from Congress, which 
will be to him a grateful reward for his zealous and dex-

I pray leave also to submit to Congress the enclosed 
extract from another letter of the Marquis de Lafayette, 
of the 10th of January, together with the copy of M. de

In the course of last summer I requested leave of his

packet, which conveyed the Minister's letter, lays me 
under the necessity of writing again on that subject. I

I cannot however depart, without entreating your Ex-

Sir, 

You will see by the subjoined letter of Mr Pierce, the 
situation of the Baron de Kalb will) regard to the United 
States, at the time when he was killed at Camden. The 
continental money which he had received must have been 
employed in subsisting the body of troops under his com- 
mand ; or, if any part of these funds remained in his 
hands, it must have been plundered and taken by the 
enemy, with all the baggage of this General. 

1 think, then, that Congress will be pleased to take 
these circumstances into consideration, and excuse the 
heirs of the B;uon de Kalb from producing vouchers, 
whirl) circumstances do not allow them to procure. I 
pray your Excellency to be pleased, also to induce Con- 
gress to determine whether the resolutions of the 15th of 
May, 1778, and the 24th of August, 17S0, extend to the 
widow and orphans of the Baron de Kalb. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDEN'CE. 187 

A difficulty has also arisen with regard to M. de Fleury, 
Lieutenant Colonel, and it can be removed only by a reso- 
lution, which I request your Excellency to solicit fioin the 
goodness of Congress in favor of this officer. He did not 
quit the American army without leave granted, and Con- 
gress, in consideration of his services ar I good conduct, 
has been pleased to consider him as * ' attached 

to the American army. It seems, then, right ia ask ti 
he should enjoy the same advantages as the other officers, 
and the rather, that he was attached to the French army, 
which served on this continent. General Lincoln, in 17S2, 
did not place him on the list of officers retained in the 
service; but this omission ought not to be prejudicial to 
the prior resolutions of Congress. He was, at this very 
time, detached to the Roanoke, with the troops of the 
French division, that he might support General Greene, in 
cas? the latter were attacked. Thus, ignorant of what 
was passing in Congress, as well as in the War Depart- 
ment, it was impossible for him to make any representa- 
tions on this subject. He was born without fortune, and if 
he did not, like the other officers, enjoy his pay to the 3d 
of November, 1783, his affairs would be found rather 
involved than meliorated by his residence in this continent. 
The payments, which Mr Morris has been authorised to 
make, have been claimed for the years 17S2 and 1783; 
and M. de Fleury would be found excluded, unless the 
justice of Congress should allow him the same treatment, 
which the other officers receive, and the advantages of the 
commutation. The third resolution of Congress of De- 
cember 31st, 1781, seems to protect the rights of M. de 
Fleury, and authorise the demand, which I pray you to 
present to Congress in his favor.

The different articles subjoined will enable Congress to 

judge of the justice of the demands, concerning which I 

beg you, Sir, to inform me of the intentions of that body.*

Pierce's letter is missing. 

Office of Accounts, April 19th, 1784. 
Sir. 

I have examined sundry papers relative to the claim of the Bar- 
oness de Kalb, for the pay of her husband, (the late Baron de Kalb, 
deceased) as a Major General in the service of the United Slates of 
America, and find, 

That from the 31st of July, 1777, the date of his ap- 
pointment, to the 19th of August, 1780, the day of his 
death, being thirtysix months and twenty days, his 
pay, at $166f per month, amounts to $6,111 10-90 

That per certificate of John Pierce, Paymaster General, it ap- 
pears he received sundry sums, in money of the old emissions, on 
account of his pay, which are extended to his debit in specie, by the 
Massachusetts scale, as follows, viz. 

1778, February, 830 dollars, at 464 per cent - - $173 79-90

That said certificate also includes a charge for $2000 
old emissions, advanced him in August, 1777, which 

at 238 per cent are equal to 840 30-90 

That he is also chargeable with the following sums, viz. 

Received from Silas Deane, in France, on the 22d

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.

Philadelphia, May Gth, 1784. 
Sir, 

The King having as yet made no appointment to the 

Consulate of Charleston, the intention of his Majesty was, 

that M. de la Forest, Vice-Consul at Savannah, should in 

the interim perform its duties. 1 have, consequently, 

transmitted to him, as well as to M. de Marbois, letters of 

recommendation, which we thought sufficient to induce the 

Governor and Council of South Carolina to recognise him 

in this provisional capacity. Our hopes with regard to this 

agreeable to a resolve of Congress of September 14, 

1777, at 5 livres 8 sols per dollar, equal to - - 1,171 10-90 

That on this account, there appears a balance of two 
thousand four hundred and thirtythree dollars and 
61-90 due to the estate of the Baron de Kalb - 2,433 61 -90 

$6,111 10-90 
Exclusive of the sums carried to the Baron's debit in the foregoing 
state, he is charged in the Paymaster General's books with the fol- 
lowing, in old emissions, viz. 

November 17th, 1777. Fifty dollars paid for transporting his 
baggage. Ifhewasin actual service at the time, and in such a 
situation as rendered extia means necessary for this purpose, I am of 
opinion that he ought not to be charged with this sum. 

May, 1780. Two hundred and twentysix thousand dollars, said to 
be for the purpose of defraying the expenses of the Maryland line, 
on their march to the southward, or for defraying the deficiencies of 
clothing due to the Maryland line. To oppose to this charge there is 
nothing yet produced. I therefore submit to consideration, the pro- 
priety of admitting to the credit of his estate the balance, which 
appeals due on account of his pay, as per the foregoing adjustment.

subject were built upon tiie second article of the draft of a 
contract for the establishment of Consuls ; and we thought 
that its provisional execution, presenting no inconveniences, 
would meet with no difficulty, although we are yet igno- 
rant whether this contract has been signed. 

As the interests of commerce render the actual estab- 
lishment of a Vice-Consul at Charleston of very urgent 
necessity, I pray your Excellency to propose to Congress, 
to p-iss a resolution for the provisional execution of this 
second article of the draft of the contract. This measure 
is so much the more necessary, as it is the only means of 
preventing the suspension of the Consular duties, which 
has often occurred in case of the absence or death of Con- 
suls or Vice-Consuls, and a year might sometimes pass be- 
fore the arrival of new appointments or commissions, and 
before resolutions should be passed by Congress. Such 
an interruption of the office of Consul would be attended 
with inconveniences, which Congress will easily perceive. 
Moreover, Sir, we ask nothing on this occasion, but what 
is customary in the other Consulates, and it is a power 
which will be readily allowed to Mr Barclay. 

I have the honor to be, &tc.

I pray you, Sir, to be pleased to inform Congress, that I

M. de Marhois, his Charge d'affaires to the United Slates. 
I repeat to your Excellency the request that you will be 
pleased to express for me to Congress, the regret with 
which I leave this continent, and the sentiments of respect, 
which I shall cherish through life towards that body. 

Permit me to recall to your mind, Sir, the business of 

M. de Fleury, and of the widow of the Baron de Kalb. I 

pray you, also, to be pleased to enable me to make known

CONGRESS TO M. DE LA LUZERNE. 

In Congress, May 17th, 1784. 
Sir, 

The United States in Congress assembled, are informed 
by the letter, which you were pleased to address to them, 
the 21st of April, that having the last year requested of 
his Majesty leave to return to France, you learn it has 
been granted, but that the official letter of the Minister 
being lost, you expect a duplicate, which will probably 
arrive in the recess of Congress. 

It is with great concern, Sir, that Congress receive this 
information, as it respects a Minister for whom they enter- 
tain the most perfect esteem. 



192 LUZERNE. 

From the time of your arrival in America, to the sign- 
ing of the provisional treaty, the conduct of the war has 
been attended with numerous difficulties and perils, to sur- 
mount which the joint efforts of the United States and 
of their great and good ally have been necessary. 

Congress consider it as a fortunate circumstance, that 
during that period the affairs of his Most Christian Majesty 
in this quarter have been under the direction of an able 
and faithful Minister, whose anxiety to promote the views 
and essential interests of his sovereign, has been ever at- 
tended with a laudable endeavor to reconcile them to those 
of his allies. Without such a disposition it is evident there 
could not have existed a concert of those measures, which 
by the smiles of Providence, have hastened the conclusion 
of the late distressing war. 

The abilities of the gentleman, who as you are informed, 
is to be charged with the affairs of your department, and 
his thorough knowledge of the principles, on which the 
a'liance was founded, will we doubt not, conspire to pro- 
duce on his part, such measures as will best promote the 
mutual interest of the two nations. 

We now, Sir, bid you an affeciionate adieu, with the 
fullest assurance, that you will be happy in the smiles and 
approbation of your royal sovereign ; and we sincerely 
wish, that you may be equally so in an interview with your 
friends, and in your future engagements.

Paris, (date uncertain) 1787 ? 
Sir, 

I dare not flatter myself, that your Excellency has any 
recol'ection of a man, who had the benefit of your ac- 
quaintance but a few days, and even at a time when he 
could not express himself in your language. 

I arrived in America, Sir, when, after having rendered 
the most important services to the confederacy, and sus- 
tained with the greatest distinction, the office of President 
of Congress, that body had intrusted you with the impor- 
tant care of conducting their affairs in Spain, and in the 
principal Courts of Europe. 

I have resided in America five years, as Minister Plen- 
ipotentiary of the Kin^ to Congress, and though indeed 
I cannot but be well satisfied with the kindness and the 
confidence, which that illustrious body have ever shown me, 
1 have always regretted, that you were not during that 
period one of its members. You departed from Europe 
when I returned to it. At that time I flattered myself, 
that 1 should again see you in America, and resume my 
duties there. But his Majesty has thought fit to give me 
another destination. Will you have the goodness to pre- 
sent to Congress my letters of recall, and to express to that 
body for me the high sentiments of respect and venera- 
tion, with which 1 have long regarded them. Allow me 
also to request your Excellency to accept the assurances 
of the attachment and consideration, with which 1 have 

the honor to be, &c.

THE 



CORRESPONDENCE 



OF 



ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON ; 



SECRETARY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS. 



For more than five years from the commencement 
of the Revolution, the foreign concerns of Congress 
were transacted through a committee, which was first 
appointed on the 2$lh of November, 1775, and called 
the Committee of Secret Correspondence. It was their 
duty to correspond with all the American Agents, 
Commissioners, and Ministers abroad, to report to 
Congress on these matters from time to time, and re- 
ceive such instructions from that body as occasion 
required. It is to be understood, however, that in this 
respect they acted only a subordinate part, for it was 
customary for the Ministers abroad to direct their 
letters to the President of Congress. After having 
been read in that Assembly, they were put into the 
hands of the Committee, whose business it was to 
answer them. On account of the absence of the mem- 
bers, the committee itself was frequently very thin, 
and sometimes for weeks together not more than one 
member was present at the seat of Government. 
Hence responsibility rested nowhere, and it is no 
wonder that delays, neglect, and ill management were 
the consequences. 

Various causes retarded the adoption of a better 



198 

system, but chiefly the warmth of party and internal 
jealousies, which prevailed within the walls of Con- 
gress for a long time, and too often defeated measures 
of essential importance, when there was a probability 
that they would throw a new weight of power into a 
scale of doubtful preponderance. To this state of cir- 
cumstances it is in a great degree to be attributed, that 
no plan for a regular Department of Foreign Affairs 
was resolved upon till the 10th of January, 1781, and 
that no person was appointed to fill the office thus 
created till seven months later. On the 10th of 
August, Robert R. Livingston was chosen Secretary 
of Foreign Affairs, but he did not enter upon the duties 
of the Department till the 20th of October. 

From this date a salutary change found its way into 
the management of Foreign Affairs. To abilities and 
other qualifications well suited to the station, Mr 
Livingston added energy, diligence, and promptitude, 
as his numerous letters on a great variety of topics 
abundantly testify. We hear no more complaints 
from the Ministers abroad, that their letters are for- 
gotten and unanswered, or that they receive no intel- 
ligence nor instructions from home. 

The details of the Department were so modified, 
after he accepted the appointment, as to embrace 
Domestic Affairs to a certain extent. He was to 
correspond with the President of Congress, the Gov- 
ernors of the States, the Commander in Chief, and 
generally with all persons on topics in any manner 
connected with the primary objects of his office. His 
letters to the American Ministers at Foreign Courts, 
and to the Freuch Ministers in this country, have 



199 

already been printed in the correspondence of those 
persons respectively. This order was thought pre- 
ferable, as the continuity of the subjects embraced in 
the different branches of correspondence would thus 
be more distinctly preserved. The letters, which 
follow, are chiefly to the President of Congress, and 
to other officers and persons, who were in the United 
States at the time they were written. 

Mr Livingston continued a little short of two years 
in the Department of Foreign Affairs. He resigned 
in June, 1783. 



THE 



CORRESPONDENCE 



OF 



ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

— QO©— 

ORGANIZATION OP A FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. 

In Congress, January 10th, 1781. 

Congress took into consideration the report of the 
committee appointed to consider and report a plan for 
the Department of Foreign Affairs, wherein they 
state, 

That the extent and the rising power of these 
United States, entitle them to a place among the great 
potentates of Europe, while our political and commer- 
cial interests point out the propriety of cultivating 
with them a friendly correspondence and connexion ; 

That to render such an intercourse advantageous, 
the necessity of a competent knowledge of the inte- 
rests, views, relations, and systems of those potentates, 
is obvious; 

That a knowledge, in its nature so comprehensive, 
vol. xi. 26 



202 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

is only to be acquired by a constant attention to the 
state of Europe, and an unremitted application to the 
means of acquiring well grounded information; 

That Congress are moreover called upon to main- 
tain with our Ministers at foreign Courts a regular 
correspondence, and to keep them fully informed of 
every circumstance and event, which regards the pub- 
lic honor, interest and safety ; 

That to answer those essential purposes, the com- 
mittee are of opinion, that a fixed and permanent office 
for the Department of Foreign Affairs ought forthwith 
to be established, as a remedy against the fluctuations, 
the delay and indecision to which the present mode of 
managing our foreign affairs must be exposed ; where- 
upon, 

Resolved, That an office be forthwith established for 
the Department of Foreign Affairs, to be kept always 
in the place where Congress shall reside; 

That there shall be a Secretary for the despatch of 
business of the said office, to be styled " Secretary of 
Foreign Affairs ;" 

That it shall be the duty of the said Secretary to 
keep and preserve all the books and papers belonging 
to the Department of Foreign Affairs; to receive and 
report the applications of all foreigners : to correspond 
with the Ministers of the United States at foreign 
Courts, and with the Ministers of foreign powers and 
other persons, for the purpose of obtaining the most 
extensive and useful information relative to foreign 
affairs, to be laid before Congress when required ; also 
to transmit such communications as Congress shall 
direct, to the Ministers of the United States and oth- 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 203 

ers at foreign Courts, and in foreign countries ; the 
said Secretary shall have liberty to attend Congress, 
that he may be better informed of the affairs of the 
United States, and have an opportunity of explaining 
his reports respecting his Department; he shall also 
be authorised to employ one, or, if necessary, more 
clerks to assist him in the business of his office; and 
the Secretary, as well as such clerks, shall, before the 
President of Congress, take an oath of fidelity to the 
United States, and an oath for the faithful execution of 
their respective trusts. 



APPOINTMENT OF A SECRETARY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS. 

In Congress, August 10th, 1781. 
Congress proceeded to the election of a Secretary of 
Foreign Affairs; and, the ballots being counted, Rob- 
ert R. Livingston was elected, having been previously 
nominated by Mr Floyd. 



TO MAJOR GENERAL NATHANIEL GREENE. 

Philadelphia, October 20th, 1781.* 
Dear Sir, 

Congress having clone me the honor to appoint me their 
Secretary of Foreign Affairs, and made it my duty to col- 
lect and transmit such intelligence as may be useful to our 
Ministers, I take the liberty to open a correspondence with 

* Although Mr Livingston was appointed Secretary of Foreign 
Affairs on the 10th of August, he did not enter on the duties of the 
office till this day. See his letter to John Adams, in Mr Adams's 
Correspondence, Vol. VI. p. 178- 



204 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

you. From the past, I have reason to hope, that your 
future operations will furnish the most agreeable and useful 
information at foreign Courts ; for nothing is more incon- 
trovertibly true, than that splendid victories and a wise 
Administration at home, are the best negotiators abroad. 

Give me leave, Sir, to congratulate you upon your suc- 
cess. We have reason to hope, that it will be attended 
with the most important consequences, more especially, if 
as we may expect, the Commander in Chief should be 
enabled to make a considerable addition to the brave corps 
you command. 

The enemy have sailed from New York with twentysix 
ships of the line, including three of fifty guns, having on 
board their ships of war five thousand lar.d forces, in order 
to attempt the relief of Cornwallis. For that, happily, they 
are too late j but as sympathising friends afford consolation 
to the distressed, he may possibly derive some comfort 
from their sharing, at least in part, his fate. 
I have the honor to be, &c. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



TO GOVERNOR GEORGE CLINTON OF NEW YORK.. 

Philadelphia, October 22d, 1781 

Dear Sir, 
Give me leave to congratulate your Excellency, and 
through you the Legislature of our State, on the success of 
our arms at the southward. Cornwallis surrendered his army 
on the 17th of October. Count de Grasse was employed 
on the 18th in taking his marines on board, which I hope, 
by the blessing of Heaven, will be the prelude to a second 
victory. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 205 

My removal being far from having in any manner less- 
ened my attachment to New York, I shall be anxious to 
hear that the present attempt of the enemy upon our fron- 
tiers, has only added to their disgrace, and enabled my 
countrymen to increase the reputation they have so 
justly acquired. Your Excellency will do me the honor 
to give me the earliest intelligence of the rnoveinents of the 
enemy. . 

I am, Sir, with the greatest respect and esteem, &ic. 
ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, October 29th, 1781. 
Sir, 

The business of the department in which Congress have 
been pleased to place me, rendering it necessary to have 
recourse to the Secret Journals, and other books and pa- 
pers in the possession of their Secretary, I take the liberty 
to request them by their order, to enable Mr Thomson to 
admit me to examine, and copy from such books of a se- 
cret nature in his possession, as may in anywise relate to 
the department of Foreign Affairs. 

I have the honor to be, &c. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



CIRCULAR TO THE GOVERNORS OP THE STATES. 

Philadelphia, November 12th, 1781. 
Sir, 

Congress some time since, called upon the different 

States to make returns of the damage done by the enemy 



206 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

within each of them, by the wanton destruction of prop- 
erty, and no measures, that I can learn, have as yet been 
taken to ascertain such damage, though as your Excel- 
lency will easily conceive, it may become an important ob- 
ject of inquiry, whenever a treaty shall be set on foot for a 
general pacification, or be made to answer valuable pur- 
poses during the war, by showing our enemies in their true 
light to the nations of Europe. 

In this view, I think it my duty to endeavor to collect 
them, and you will, Sir, I am persuaded, take the neces- 
sary measures to send as soon as possible, returns from the 
State over which you preside. I could wish to have the 
damages, (particularly that to real property,) ascertained 
by the affidavits of people of known characters, and dupli- 
cate copies of such affidavits transmitted to my officers, 
undpr the great seal of your State, and, if possible, accom- 
panied with a short recital of each transaction, so that it 
may at once appear, whether the injuries were such as the 
laws of war justified, or whether they originated only in 
the malice and cruelty of the enemy. 

Your Excellency will oblige me, and serve the public, 
by transmitting to me accounts of every occurrence, in 
which the United States are materially interested, which 
may arise within your government, or which you may de- 
rive from your correspondents abroad. 

I have the honor to be, with great respect and esteem, 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 207 

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, November 18th, 1781. 

Sir, 

The subject mentioned in the letters of Mr Adams, and 
their enclosures, requiring their express direction, I hum- 
bly submit to the consideration of Congress. 

In Dr Franklin's letter of the 6th of August to Mr Ad- 
ams, he informs him, "that he cannot depend on receiving 
any more money in Franre applicable to the support of the 
Ministers of Congress, and that what aids are thereafter 
granted, will probably be transmitted by the government 
directly to America." Congress need no arguments to 
convince them of the disgrace and danger of permitting 
their most confidential servants to be necessitous iu a 
foreign country. 

I will with their approbation, concert with the Superin- 
tendent of Finance, the means of supplying our Ministers, 
Agents, and Secretaries. But to facilitate these means, 
and convince the powers to whom we are indebted for 
money, that we know the value of their aids, I would hum- 
bly submit to Congress the propriety of practising the 
strictest economy, as far as it may be consistent with their 
honor, and the justice due to those they employ. That 
Congress may determine the more readily whether their 
establishment will admit of any reduction, or devise the 
most effectual means of defraying the expense of it, I take 
the liberty to lay before them the annual amount of the 
salaries of their servants now abroad. 

If I am well informed, it is usual to distinguish the allow- 
ances to Ministers by the expenses of the country in which 
they live, and the character they are obliged to support. 



208 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

Such a rule would be productive of great saving to us, 
whose policy it is to have agents without any acknowl- 
edged public characters, at Courts which refuse to receive 
our Ministers. How far so important a station as that of 
Secretary to an Embassy might be supplied by private 
secretaries with moderate salaries, at least till the existence 
of the Embassy was acknowledged, must be submitted to 
the wisdom of Congress. Certain it is, that foreigners 
who may not be acquainted with the dignified characters 
of those we employ abroad as secretaries, will be surprised 
to find their emoluments equal, if not exceeding those al- 
lowed by the richest potentates in Europe, and that too, 
when the great object of the mission is to represent our 
wants, and solicit supplies for civil and military establish- 
ments at home. 

Perhaps, too, from the ground on which the successful 
issue of this campaign has placed us, Congress may see it 
improper to solicit Courts, who are so little disposed to 
serve us as those of Petersburgh and Lisbon, or to expend 
additional sums of money on agencies to Russia or Poitu- 
gal. 

Another part of the despatches referred to me, are those 
that relate to John Temple, to which Congress alone are 
competent to give directions. The reports currently cir- 
culated in England relative to his first mission, his coming 
by way of New York, his return to England, his abode 
there, his present visit to America, render him an object of 
attention, not only to the people of this country, but to 
those of Europe, and give weight to those suspicions of 
attachment to England, which, as it is her policy to keep 
up, it should be ours on every occasion to discourage. 
Congress will judge how far it is proper to suggest any 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 209 

measures to the State of Massachusetts. I take the liberty 
to submit to them, whether at least it would not be expe- 
dient to adopt such resolutions as would leave the Execu- 
tive of that State uninfluenced in their conduct towards 
him, by his being the bearer of public despatches. Con- 
gress will observe, that I have no personal acquaintance 
with Mr Temple, nor any knowledge of facts, which would 
lead me to suspect his principles, other than the matters, 
which are above stated and publicly known. 
I have the honor to be, &c. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, November 25th, 1781. 
Sir, 

1 enclose to Congress the heads of the communication, 
which I had the honor to make to them on the 23d, as far 
as I could obtain permission from the Minister of France 
to reduce them to writing. There is but one omission, the 
reason of which was assigned at the time I made the ver- 
bal communication. I also enclose an extract of a letter 
from the Count de Vergennes to the Minister of France, 
as translated and communicated to me by him, which I 
have thought it necessary to submit to the perusal of the 
Superintendent of Finance. 

I am at a loss to judge whether Congress intended in 
their reference of General Duportail's letter, that I should 
report to them, or write to Dr Franklin on the subject my- 
self; supposing the latter to have been the case, I have 
accordingly written ; but lest I may have been mistaken, I

formable to I heir intentions, I beg to be honored with their 
further direction. 

I have tiie honor to be, &c.

GENERAL GREENE TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

Camp Round O, South Carolina, > 
December 1 3th, 1761. ) 
Dear Sir, 

Your A.vor of the 22d of October came to hand a day 
or two since. 

I shall be happy to communicate anything from this 
quarter, that may be useful to you, or to our affairs abroad, 
and I have the pleasure to inform you, that we have com- 
plete possession of all the Southern Slates, Charleston and 
Savannah excepted. 

Civil government is established in Georgia, and the As- 
sembly of South Carolina will set the 1st of next month, at 
Camden. We are making preparations for the siege of 
Charleston, and are not altogether without hopes of oblig- 
ing the enemy to abandon the place, even if our good ally 
should not be able to co-operate with us. The tyrant of 
Syracuse was never more odious than the British army in 
this country. Even the slaves rejoice, and feel a kind of 
freedom from oppression, in the return of their masters. 

I beg leave to congratulate yon upon our h.te glorious 
success in Virginia, and upon your own appointment of 
-Minister of Foreign Affairs. 

I have the honor to be, &c.

I do my«elf the honor to submit to the inspection of the 
United States, in Congress, an affidavit made by Mr Mar- 
shall on the subject ol Mr Deane's letter?, and have di- 
rected copies of the letters and affidavit to be made out for 
the Minister of his Most Christian Majesty, and the Super- 
intendent of Finance. Measures have long since been 
taken to put our Ministers upon their guard against Mr 
Deane. I shall add to them, as opportunities oner, the 
new proofs which these letters furnish of his defection. 
Copies will also be sent to the Governor of Connecticut, 
unless the Representatives of that State, in Congress, who 
propose to make them the ground of judicial proceedings, 
should prefer taking copies to be examined and compared 
with the original, by a person who could prove such exam- 
ination, or to authenticate them in any other way, which 
will ensure their being received as evidence conformably 
to the practice of their Courts. 

I had proposed to mention them in my correspondence 
with the first Magistrates of the respective States, as afford- 
ing proofs of the distant prospect of peace, and the neces- 
sity of relying only upon our own exertions to procure it, 
but am deterred from this measure, by the weight which it 
might possibly give to Mr Deane's illlounded assertions. 

I shall endeavor to conform to the views of the United 
States, in any further direction with which they may please 
to honor me. 

I have the honor to be, &ic. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.

TO GOVERNOR JONATHAN TRUMBULL OF CONNECTICUT. 

Philadelphia, January 22d, 1782. 
Sir, 

I do myself the honor to enclose certified copies of 
two letters from Silas Deane, which serve in some 
measure to authenticate those that have been published 
in his name, and strongly mark such a change in his 
sentiments and principles as is worthy of the attention 
of the State of which he is a citizen. The originals 
are lodged in this office, to which your Excellency 
may at any time apply, if such copies should be re- 
quired, as would amount to legal evidence ; I have also 
enclosed a copy of an affidavit of Mr Marshall to prove 
the identity of the letters, and his having received 
them from Silas Deane. 

I some time since did myself the honor to write to 
you, relative to the damage done by the enemy in 
your State, to that letter I have not been as yet 
favored with an answer. Your Excellency will easily 
see the propriety of keeping up a correspondence with 
this office, since there are so many inferior objects, 
which escape the general attention of Congress, which 
it may be extremely useful to detail in our negotiations. 
Such, for instance, as an authentic account of the cru- 
elties committed by the British at New Haven. Nor 
is it of less moment to be minutely informed by every 
State of the resources for carrying on the war, the 
means used to call out those resources, the temper and 
disposition of the people with respect to them. With 
a view of obtaining these from you at your leisure, I 
have taken the liberty to open this correspondence 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 213 

with your Excellency. I persuade myself you will 
not put the trouble it may give you in competition 
with the slightest advantage, that our country may 
obtain from it. I shall in return give you from time 
to time, such European news as we may receive here, 
which I conceive will contribute either to your 
amusement or the advantage of your State. 

And as I have nothing positive at present, let me 
inform you, what I would wish every Slate to know, 
that we have not as yet any intelligence, that leads to 
a speedy peace, so that we have every reason to expect 
another campaign, and a campaign too, that will call 
for our greatest exertions^ 

I have the honor to be, &c. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, January 25th, 1782. 
Sir, 

In the first organization of a new Department, some 
things are frequently omitted, which experience will 
show ought to be inserted, and many inserted which 
might be omitted ; it becomes the duty of those, who 
are placed at the head of such Departments, to mention 
the difficulties that may arise from these causes, and 
leave it to the wisdom of Congress to alter them, or to 
judge whether they can be changed without introduc- 
ing greater inconveniences. Upon this principle, Sir, 
I am induced to offer the following observations. 

The Secretary of Foreign Affairs is to correspond 
with the Ministers of the United States at foreign 



214 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

Courts, and with the Ministers of foreign powers. 
This correspondence must necessarily detail such sen- 
timents as the sovereign wishes to have known, and 
lead to such inquiries as they choose to make. An 
intimate knowledge of their sentiments is, therefore, 
absolutely necessary to a discharge of this duty ; and 
we accordingly find, that the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs is, in monarchical governments, considered as 
the most confidential servant of the Crown. In Re- 
publics, it is much more difficult to execute this task, 
as the sentiments of the sovereign sometimes change 
with the members, which compose the sovereignly. 
It is more frequently unknown, because no occasion 
offers, on which to call it forth. It is never perfectly 
expressed but by some public act. Wailing for this 
time, the advantages of embracing a favorable oppor- 
tunity are frequently lost. There are numberless mi- 
nutiae, upon which no act is formed, and about which, 
notwithstanding their sentiments should be known to 
their Ministers, there are even occasions, in which 
their Secretary should speak a sentiment, which it 
would be improper for (hem to declare by a public act. 
Congress, sensible of the inconveniencv, that the 
officer intrusted with the management of their foreign 
affairs must labor under in the execution of his duty, 
without a more perfect knowledge of their sentiments, 
than can be obtained from their public acts, have been 
pleased to admit him to attend Congress, that (as the 
ordinance expresses it,) he may be better informed of 
the affairs of the United States, and have an opportu- 
nity of explaining his reports respecting his Depart- 
ment ; but here it slops short, and does not say in 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 215 

what manner he is to gain the sentiments of Congress, 
when he does himself the honor to attend upon them. 
It is true they may in part be collected from an atten- 
tion to the debates, but it often so happens, that the 
debate does not take the turn that he would wish, in 
order to satisfy a doubt, and he goes away, after hear- 
ing a subject largely discussed, ignorant of the only 
point upon which he wishes to be informed, when 
perhaps by a single question, his doubt might be re- 
moved, or by a word of information, which he has 
the best means of acquiring, a debate might be short- 
ened. 

It is true the power of explaining his reports given 
by the ordinance, seems to imply a permission 1o offer 
his sentiments when they are under consideration, but 
as I do not wish to assume a liberty which is not ex- 
pressly given, I must beg the sentiments of Congress 
on this subject. The ordinance is also deficient, in not 
affording a power to the Secretary of Foreign Affairs 
to take order upon the application either of foreigners, 
or subjects, relative to matters not of sufficient moment 
to engage the attention of Congress; as for instance, 
applications for aid til procuring the release of an 
American, taken under particular circumstances in 
English ships, and confined in the French West In- 
dies or elsewhere; claims upon prizes carried into the 
French Islands, &c, which cases occur every day, and 
are attended with long memorials, which would lake 
up much of the time and attention of Congress. 

As I have hitherto taken the liberty to transact bus- 
iness of this kind with the Minister of his Most Chris- 
tian Majesty, and the Governors or Generals of the 



216 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

French Islands, I wish to be justified in so doing by 
the orders of Congress. As a check upon myself, I 
keep a book, though it is attended with much labor, 
in which all such applications, and the steps taken in 
consequence thereof, are inserted at length. 

Tiie organization of this office will, too, I presume, 
render some alteration necessary in matters of form 
and ceremony as heretofore settled by Congress in 
conformity to the practice of other nations, and to ena- 
ble us to avail ourselves of the advantages they some- 
times afford in creating useful delays, and concealing 
for political reasons the views of the sovereign. 

Congress having vested me with the power of ap- 
pointing clerks, I have appointed two gentlemen, in 
whose integrity and abilities I can confide. These 
are barely sufficient to do the running business of the 
office, which is much greater than I imagined it would 
be, five copies, besides the draft being necessary for 
every foreign letter or paper transmitted. To copy 
all the letters, which have hitherto been received, 
with the Secret Journals and other extracts from the 
books and files of Congress, though absolutely neces- 
sary, both for order and security, will be impossible, 
without further aid for at least one year. Congress 
have not, indeed, limited the number I may employ, 
nor have they fixed their salaries, upon both of which 
I could wish for their direction. An interpreter is so 
necessary, both for this Department and the Admi- 
ralty, that I cannot but recommend to Congress the 
appointment of one, from whom, if a man in whom I 
could confide, I might receive assistance as a Secretary 
when hurried with business. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 217 

It may possibly Le expected, Sir, that I should 
close this long letter by a report on the matters it 
contains, but as it is a delicate subject to point out a 
mode for extending my own powers, I only beg leave 
to recommend the enclosed resolve. 

I have the honor to be, &c. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



TO MAJOR GENERAL GREENE. 

Office of Foreign Affairs, Philadelphia, 
January 31st, 1782. 

Dear Sir, 

I was this day favored with yours of the 13th ultimo. 
I need not tell you, that the intelligence it conveyed, and 
the spirit in which it was written, afforded me the most 
sensible pleasure. The idea it holds forth of an attempt 
upon Charleston, and the prospect of success in it, is one 
that we dare not indulge here, more especially as troops 
have sailed from New York, and as we presume to 
Charleston, but you have taught us rather to measure 
your success- by your genius than by your means. 

I wish it were in my power to tell you, that our ac- 
counts from Europe were proportionate to our expecta- 
tions. The combined fleets, as you know, have returned 
and separated, without having effected anything. The 
British are again masters of the ocean. Gibraltar is a 
rock, on which all the exertions of Spain seem to split, 
and the siege of fort St Philip seems to be carried on in 
the most energetic manner. We have no prospect of 
forming an alliance, either with Spain or Holland, who 
both appear to sigh for peace. Our loan on the guarantee 
vol. xi. 28 



218 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

of France with the last, is nearly completed. But what 
ii siot -i little unsatisfactory, it is also nearly expended by 
advances, which France lias made us on the credit of it. 
From ?p;:i r i we are likely to get nothing. 

The negotiations for a peace are entirely at a stand ; 
the mediating powers have no interest in wishing it, and 
the belligerent nations are neither of them sufficiently 
weakened to request their interposition. The Count de 
Vergennes assures us, iljat Britain will still make the most 
vigorous exeriions. I mention these circumstances not 
only for your information, but that you may make the 
proper use of them in animating the exertions of the 
Southern States. It is the misfortune of America to pre- 
sume too much upon each dawning of success, and to 
believe that peace must tread upon the heels of every 
little advantage, instead of being taught by her own strug- 
gles and difficulties, that every nation has resources, that 
surpass the expectations of its enemies. 

Would to God that you could be enabled, by the ani- 
mated efforts of the Southern States, to expel the enemy 
from them without the aid of our allies. This would re- 
establish our character for activity in Europe, where I um 
sorry to say, it has for some time past been upon the de- 
cline, and I do sincerely believe, that co-operating with 
the brilliant successes of the last fall, it would incline the 
enemy to peace, without which I have no expectations of it. 
But I fear this is rather to be wished for than expected. 

Domestic news we have none, but what Colonel Ter- 
nant will give, or you may collect from the enclosed papers. 

If anything turns up worth your notice, you shall hear 
from me. I flatter myself that you will think with me, 
that our distance is too great to wait for the ceremony of 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 219 

answer and reply, and favor me with a line as occasion 
offers. 

I have tiie honor to be, Sir, &c. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



CIRCULAR LETTER TO TIIE GOVERNORS OF THE STATES. 

Philadelphia, February 18th, 1782. 
Sir, 

1 do myself the honor to transmit to your Excellency 
several resolutions ol Congress, which having a reference 
to the Department of Foreign Affairs, are in course to go 
through this office. The necessity o( carrying them into 
effect is too obvious to need observations. 

While we hold an intercourse with civilised nations, 
we must conform to law', which humanity has established, 
and which custom has consecrated among them. On this 
the rights, which the United States or their citizens may 
claim in foreign countries must be founded 

One of the resolutions passed Congress in consequence 
of a convention about to be concluded between his Most. 
Christian Majesty and the United Slates of America, which 
affords an additional reason for paying it the earliest atten- 
tion. Your Excellency and the Legislature will see the 
propriety of rendering the laws on these subjects as simple, 
and the execution of them as expeditious, as possible, 
since foreigners, who arc the great object of them, are 
easily disgusted at complex systems, which they find a 
difficulty in understanding, and the honor and peace of ;i 
nation are frequently as much wounded by a delay as by 
a denial of justice. 

Another resolution relates to your boundaries, and is 
designed as one means of ascertaining the territorial riehts 



220 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

of the United States collectively, which can only be accu- 
rately known by each State's exhibiting its claims, and 
the evidence on which they found them. Your Excel- 
lency will therefore be pleased to direct, authentic 
copies from your records of all grants, charters, maps, 
treaties with the natives, and other evidences, to be trans- 
mitted to this office, as soon as you can conveniently col- 
lect them. I could wish, that the copies might be proved, 
by having the great seal of your State annexed. 
1 have the honor to be, &c. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



TO GOVERNOR RUTLEGF. OF SOUTH CAROLINA. 

Office of Foreign Affairs, Philadelphia, ) 
February 19th, 1782. 5 

Dear Sir, 

1 wish to avail myself of the opportunity Colonel Ter- 
nant affords me, to convey the agreeable intelligence con- 
tained in the enclosed letter from Mr Harrison, our agent 
at Cadiz. Many other objects present themselves, on 
which I would write could I do it without detaining Co- 
lonel Ternant, who only waits for this. 

I propose to have the honor of writing more at large 
by the next safe conveyance. In the meanwhile, I should 
consider it as a favor, which might be rendered useful to 
the public, as well as agreeable to me, if your Excellency 
would open a correspondence with this office, in which an 
exact state of affairs in the government, over which you 
preside ought to be detailed, which could not fail to have 
some influence in the direction of our foreign affairs. 

I have the honor to be, &tc. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 






DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 221 

CIRCULAR LETTER TO THE GOVERNORS OF THE STATES. 

Philadelphia, February 19th, 1782. 
Sir, 

Where a Government is composed of independent States, 
united not by the power of a sovereign but by their common 
interest, the Executive Departments form a centre of com- 
munication between each State and their Chief Council, 
and are so far links of the chain, which should bind them 
together, as they render to each similar views of great 
national objects, and introduce uniformity in their measures 
for the establishment of general interests. A mistaken idea 
of our own importance to other nations, of their attachment 
to us, and of the weakness of our common enemy, having 
lulled us into a very imprudent security, I beg leave to 
state to your Excellency the information last received from 
Europe. Our success in this important wcr, under the 
favor of Heaven, must be built upon the weakness of our 
enemy, the strength and perseverance of her foes in Europe, 
and our own exertions. 

It is an undeniable fact, that Britain lias not, in the course 
of the last campaign, gained any advantage of her enemies, 
but, on the contrary, has seen their fleets ride triumphant 
in the seas, she proudly called her own, and an army, in 
which she placed her fondest hopes, made captive. But, 
on the other hand, we are compelled to admit,.that she has 
met with no such reverse of fortune as materially to debili- 
tate her, or weaken her resources for another campaign. 
Her trade has, for the most part, returned in safety. Her 
fleets have blocked up those of the Dutch, and, upon the 
separation of the combined fleets, recovered the superiority 
in the European seas. The army taken in America is only 



222 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

so far decidedly ruinous to her affairs here, as we know 
how to avail ourselves of the advantage it affords. 

That her pride is not humbled, that she did not wish for 
peace prior to this advantage, is obvious, 1st. From her 
refusing to make a separate treaty with the Dutch, who, 
under the mediation of the Empress of Russia, seemed 
anxiously to wish it ; 2dly. From her neglect to notice the 
last proposals of the mediating powers, which yet remain 
unanswered ; so that if any alteration is made in their senti- 
ments on this subject, they must originate in their ill success 
in America, for in every otber quarter their defensive war 
seems to have been supported with advantage. How far 
tins will operate admits of a doubt, which prudence directs 
us not to rely upon. Money, the great support of modern 
wars, has been raised with more facility in England, tban 
in any country in the world; and we find the minority last 
year censuring Lord North for giving the advantage of 
lending to his friends. Their losses may indeed render 
subscriptions more expensive to the public; but there is no 
well grounded room to suppose they will not fill up; and 
still less reason to believe, if the means for carrying on the 
war are attainable, that the vindictive spirit of the King and 
his ministry, and the overweening nride of the nation, will 
soon yield to make a peace, which involves their disgrace and 
humiliation. But as strength or weakness are mere com- 
parative terms, we can form no judgment of the measures 
of Britain but by attending to the lorce and disposition of 
her enemies. 

The United Provinces were evidently dragged into the 
war, and have prosecuted it as if they momentarily expected 
a peace. The Colonies in the West Indies have been taken, 
without being in a state to make the smallest resistance, 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 223 

and the active interposition of France alone saved those 
in the East from sharing the same fate. Our last letters 
from Holland place the distress of their commerce in a 
strong point of view. They are unhappily rent by parties, 
which clog the wheels of government; though it is said 
the party opposed to England are the most numerous and 
growing in strength, so that nt some future day we may 
reasonably hope they will assume the entire ascendency ; 
yet we can build very little on this, till the close of another 
year. This much is certain, they are not yet allied to us, 
nor have they given us reason to believe, that they intend 
to he so. They wish for peace, and will take no measures 
that can obstruct it. They have lent us no money, nor 
are they likely to do it ; from whence vvs may presume, 
either that they doubt our success, or do not much interest 
themselves in it. 

Our expectations from Spain are scarcely more flattering. 
Some little aids of money have been received after long 
solicitation, hardly so much as paid the expense of soliciting. 
Wo have reason to suppose that no more will be granted. 
They are still cold with regard to our alliance ; nothing but 
brilliant success can bring it to a conclusion. Nor have 
we the smallest reason to expect any pecuniary aid from 
her, even if she should confederate with us in time to be 
of use for the next campaign. She has at this moment very 
many and very expensive operations on hand ; and, till she 
has allied herself to us, we have no certainty that she will 
choose to continue the war for the attainment of our indepen- 
dence, if Britain should be sufficiently humbled to sacrifice 
to her the objects which led her into the war. 

To France, then, we turn, as the only enemy of Great 
Britain, who is at the same time our ally, who will perse- 



224 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

vere in the war for the attainment of our independence. 
She has already done so much for us, in order to afford us 
the means of doing something for ourselves, that she may 
reasonably hope to find the effects of her benevolence. 
Her fleets have protected our coasts, her armies have fought 
our battles ; she has made various efforts to restore our 
finances, by paying the interest of our loans, by obtaining 
credit in Europe on our account for clothing, arms, and 
necessaries ; by advancing money, and by opening and 
guaranteeing a loan for us, to a considerable amount in 
Holland, when, by the abolition of paper, our finances were 
totally deranged. These sums are nearly expended, and 
another campaign is about to be opened. France assures, 
that it is not in her power to make us any further grants of 
money, her ministers repeat this to us in every letter, in a 
tone that persuades us of their determination on that point. 
What then is to be done ? Are we to relinquish the 
hopes, which the present debility of the enemy affords us of 
expelling them by one decided effort, and compensating all 
our losses by the enjoyment of an active commerce? Are 
we to return to the wretched, oppressive system we have 
quitted ? Are we to csrry on a weak defensive war with an 
unpaid army, whose precarious subsistence must depend 
upon wiiat can be torn by violence from the industrious 
husbandman ? Shall we vainly, and I think disgracefully, 
supplicate all the powers of Europe for those means, which 
we have in our own hands, if we dare call them forth, and 
which, after all, must be called forth if we continue the war, 
(and upon that subject there can be no doubt, till the end 
for which we took up arms is attained.) The only question 
is, whether each State shall fairly and regularly contribute 
its quota, or whether that which happens to be the seat of 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 225 

war shall (as has too often been the case) bear the whole 
burden, and suffer more from the necessities of our own 
troops, than the ravages of tlje enemy. Whether we shall 
drive the enemy from their posts with a strong body of regu- 
lar troops, or whether we shall permit them to extend their 
devastations, while, with our ba'.talions and fluctuating corps 
of militia, we protract a weak defensive war, till our allies 
are discouraged, and some unfavorable change takes place 
in the system of Europe. 

Your Excellency, I am persuaded, will pardon the free- 
dom with which I write. You see the necessity which 
dictates my letter, and were it in my power to communi- 
cate all that our friends in Europe think of our inactivity, 
I am persuaded you would urge your State to exertion in 
much stronger terms than I dare venture to use. 

When Congress call upon a State for supplies, they are 
usually answered by pleas of disability, urged, too, by the 
State with good faith, and a firm persuasion that they 
speak their real situation, a recurrence to facts, that have 
passed under their own observation, will convince them that 
they are deceived. 

From the time that the depreciation of the Continental 
bills of credit began, till they were no longer current, the 
States that received them paid a tax equal to all the expen- 
ditures of the army, and a very considerable one beyond it; 
for if we suppose ten millions of dollars, in specie, a year, 
to be necessary for their support, then the expense, till the 
close of the campaign of 1779, must have amounted to 
upwards of fifty millions, exclusive of the supplies from 
Europe; and yet, in March, 1780, the whole national debt 
contracted in America did not, in fact, amount to five 
millions ; so that fortyfive millions were paid by the United 

vol. xi. 29 



226 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

States in those five years of the war, when they had the 
least commerce and agriculture, and when they were most 
distressed by the enemy ; and this tax, too, was the most 
unjust and partial that can be conceived, unless we except 
that, by which we have since raised much more from the 
people, without giving so much to the public ; I mean the 
laws for impressing, &c, which placed the greatest burden 
of the war upon the shoulders cf a particular order of men 
in particular States only. 

Now surely, if by partial and unjust measures, for which 
necessity alone can plead, we have been able to draw from 
every State, a tax more than equal to the present demand, 
no State can say, that it cannot afford its proportion of a 
more equitable tax. Those who have hitherto borne the 
weight of the war, must warmly espouse a measure, which 
is so greatly calculated for their relief. Ihose who have 
hitherto been eased from the burden, must be more able to 
take it up at this lime, when they have the most promising 
expectation of relinquishing it soon. 

It is certain, that if we put ourselves in a state to 
take advantage of circumstances early in the ensuing 
spring, we have the best grounded reason to hope, that 
a few months will remove the war from our doors. 
Whereas if we delay to enable Congress to say to their 
allies, "we are ready for an ctTeclual co-operation 
with any force you may send," they will turn their 
attention to other objects, and leave us to lament in 
vain the opportunities we have lost. Every motive 
then, national honor, national interest, public econ- 
omy, private ease, and that love of freedom, which 
pervades every Legislature on the Continent, call 
loudly not only for a compliance with the requisitions 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 227 

of Congress, but for so early a compliance as to render 
it effectual. 

It is true we are at present in such a situation as to 
have no apprehensions for the final establishment of 
our independence ; but surely it is a matter of some 
moment to us, whether we shall obtain it, or at least 
be freed from the ravages of the enemy and the bur- 
den of the war in the course of six months at the 
expense of eight millions of dollars, or whether we 
shall wait for it till a general and perhaps a distant 
peace, and be subject in the meanwhile to infinitely 
more expense, and all the distress that attends a coun- 
try which is the seat of war. 

But, Sir, it is time to dismiss a subject, which wants 
no arguments to illustrate it. I am confident that you 
will use every means to convince the State over which 
you preside, of the danger which will result from re- 
lying more upon the weakness of the enemy than 
their own strength, more upon the aid of their allies 
than their own exertions, more upon unjust, partial, 
hazardous, and expensive expedients, than upon an 
equal and regular support of the measures, which 
Congress, upon the most mature deliberation have 
recommended to their attention. 
1 have the honor to be, &c. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Office of Foreign Affairs, February 21st, 1782. 
Sir, 
I do myself the honor to lay before Congress the 
enclosed note from the Minister of France, a letter 



223 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

from the Marquis de Bouille wilh translations of both, 
and the proceedings of the Council of Assembly of 
Dominique; all of which relate to the case of the ship 
Resolution's cargo, part of which was adjudged lawful 
prize by the sentence of the Court of Appeals; and 
the case of the brigantine Eeirsten and her cargo, 
which was also adjudged lawful prize by the said 
Court.* 

The case of the ship Resolution, as far as I have 
been able to learn, was simply this, she was a Dutch 
vessel, freighted on account of capilulants at Domi- 
nique, and bound for Holland, agreeably to the seventh 
Article of the capitulation. She was taken by a 
British ship, retaken by one of our privateers, and 
condemned by the Court of Admiralty of this State, 
whose decree was reversed and the ship and cargo ac- 
quitted, except a small part of the latter, on the prin- 
ciple of its not being the property of capilulants, and 
because, as was alleged, it was not protected by the 
ordinances of Congress, approving the principles of 
the armed neutrality, Great Britain and Holland being 
at open war; from whence it was inferred by the 
Court, that the Dutch vessel could not be considered 
as sufficiently neutral to protect the property of an 
enemy. The papers referred to in the memorial of 
the Minister of France serve to show, that the whole 
cargo belonged to capitulants. 

The other vessel, the Eeirsten, was purchased in 
London by a company of Imperial subjects residing at 
Ostend, freighted in England wilh British property 

* See an account of these ships in M. de la Luzerne's Correspond- 
ence, above, pp. 66 — 72. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 229 

for the use of the capitulants at. Dominique. The ves- 
sel sailed from London, and on her way to Dominique 
touched at the port of Ostend, for the purpose of con- 
verting her English papers into German. In the pas- 
sage from Ostend to Dominique, this brigantine was 
taken by an American privateer, carried into Boston 
and acquitted, with her cargo; but the Judges of Ap- 
peals have condemned as lawful prize, both vessel and 
cargo. They consider the cargo as unprotected by the 
capitulation of Dominique. They consider the vessel 
as carrying on a trade advantageous to the enemy, in 
contravention to the seventeenth Article of the capitu- 
lation ; that she forfeited the right of neutrality by not 
showing an exact impartiality to the belligerent pow- 
ers ; and because she had false and colorable papers on 
board, with a view to give the cargo the appearance of 
neutral property. They allow, that a vessel under 
their circumstances is to be considered as an enemy's, 
and that by the law of nations, they should be subject 
to seizure and confiscation. They consider the carjro 
as unprotected by the laws of Congress, because (as 
they affirm) this vessel cannot be thought to be strict ly 
neutral, that Congress meant to pay a regard to right 
of neutralily, that the right of neutrality only extends 
protection to the effects and goods of an enemy in neu- 
tral bottoms, not engaged in the violation of this right. 
I have sent the seventh and seventeenth Articles of 
the capitulation for the information of Congress. 

From this statement Congress will judge of the ex- 
pediency of directing a re-hearing in both cases. In 
the first, it seems to be dictated by a regard for justice 
upon the new proofs. And in the second, the reason- 



230 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

ing, which determined Hie Court, does not nppear to 
be so conclusive as to render it improper in so intri- 
cate a case, more particularly as our situation wiih 
respect to the Emperor is peculiarly delicate: from 
which consideration, as well as from the respect which 
is due to the representation of the Minister of his 
Most Christian Majesty, I am humbly of opinion that 
a re-hearing ought to be granted, and that in the 
meanwhile the officers of the Court should be directed 
to retain in their hands the proceeds of the vessel and 
cargo.

REGULATIONS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN 

AFFAIRS. 

In Congress, February 22d, 1782. 

On the report of a committee, consisting of Mr Ellery, 
Mr Randolph, and Mr Eveleigh, to whom was referred a 
letter of the 25th of January, from the Secretary of 
Foreign Affairs respecting his department, 

Resolved, that the Department of Foreign Affairs be 
under the direction of such officer as the United States, in 
Congress assembled, have already for that purpose ap- 
pointed, or shall hereafter appoint, who shall be styled, 
"Secretary to the United States of America for the De- 
partment of Foreign Affairs," shall reside where Congress, 
or the Committee of the States, shall sit, and hold his 
office during the pleasure of Congress. 

That the books, records, and other papers of the United 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 231 

States that relate to this department, be committed to I:is 
custody, to which, and all other papers of his office, any 
member of Congress shall have access ; provided that no 
copy shall be taken of matters of a secret nature without 
the special leave of Congress. 

That the correspondence and communications with the 
Ministers, Consuls, and Agents of the United States in 
foreign countries, and with the Ministers and other officers 
of foreign powers with Congress, be carried on through 
the office of foreign affairs by the said Secretary, who is 
also empowered to correspond with all other persons from 
whom he may expect to receive useful information relative 
to his department ; provided always, that letters to Minis- 
ters of the United States, or Ministers of foreign powers, 
which have a direct reference to treaties or conventions 
proposed to be entered into, or instructions relative thereto, 
or other great national subjects, shall be submitted to the 
inspection, and receive the approbation of Congress before 
thev shall be transmitted. 

That the Secretary for the Department of Foreign 
Affairs correspond with the Governors or Presidents of all, 
or any of the United States, affording them such informa- 
tion from his department as may be useful to their States 
or to the United Slates, stating complaints that may have 
been urged against the government of any of the said 
States, or the subjects thereof, by the subjects of fore-gn 
powers, so that justice may be done agreeab'y to the lrws 
of such state, or the charge proved to be groundless, and 
the honor of the government vindicated. 

He shall receive the applications of all foreigners rela- 
tive to his department, which are designed to be submitted 
to Congress, and advise the mode in which the memorials 



232 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

and evidence shall be stated, in order to afford Congress 
the most comprehensive view of the subject ; and if he 
conceives it necessary, accompany such Memorial with his 
report thereon. 

He may concert measures with the Ministers or officers 
of foreign powers, amicably to procure the redress of pri- 
vate injuries, which any citizen of the United States may 
have received lrom a foreign power, or the subjects 
thereof, making minutes of all his transactions relative 
thereto, which have passed on such occasions. 

He shall report on all cases expressly referred to him 
for that purpose by Congress, and on all others touching 
his department, in which he may conceive it necessary. 
And that he may acquire that intimate knowledge of the 
sentiments of Congress, which is necessary for his direc- 
tion, he may at all times attend upon Congress; and shall 
particularly attend when summoned or ordered by the 
President. 

He may give information to Congress respecting his 
department, explain and answer objections to his reports 
when under consideration, if required by a member, and 
no objection be made by Congress. 

He shall answer to such inquiries respecting his depart- 
ment as may be put from the chair by order of Congress, 
and to questions stated in writing about matters of fact, 
which lie within his knowledge, when put by the Presi- 
dent at the request of a member, and not disapproved of 
by Congress. The answers to such questions may, at 
the option of the Secretary, be delivered by him in 
writing. 

He shall have free access to the papers and records of 
the United Slates in the custody of their Secretary, or in 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 233 

llie offices of finance and war and elsewhere. He may be 
furnished with copies, or take extracts therefrom, when lie 
shall find it necessary. 

He shall use means to obtain from the Ministers and 
agents of the United States in foreign countries, an abstract 
of their prtsent state, their commerce, finances, naval and 
military strength, and the characters of Sovereigns and 
Ministers, and every other political information, which may 
be uselnl to the United States. All letters to sovereign 
powers, letters of credence, plans of treaties, conventions, 
manifestoes, instructions, passports, safe conducts, and 
other acts of Congress relative to the Department of For- 
eign Affairs, when the substance thereof shall have been 
previously agreed to in Congress, shall be reduced to form 
in the office of foreign Affairs, and submitted to the opin- 
ion of Congress ; and when passed, signed, and attested, 
sent to the office of Foreign Affairs, to be countersigned 
and forwarded. If an original paper is of such a nature 
as cannot be safely transmitted without cyphers, a copy 
in cyphers, signed by the Secretary for the Department 
of Foreign Affairs, shall be considered as authentic, and 
the Ministers of the United States at foreign Courts may 
govern themselves thereby in the like manner as if the 
originals had been transmitted. And for the better execu- 
tion of the duties hereby assigned him, he is authorised to 
appoint a Secretary, and one, or if necessary more clerks, 
to assist him in the business of his office. 

Resolved, That the salaries annexed to this department 
shall be as follows ; 

To the Secretary of the United States for the Depart- 
ment of Foreign Affairs, the sum of four thousand dollars 
vol- xi. 30 



234 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

per annum, exclusive of office expenses, to commence 
from the first day of October last. 

To the Secretary, one thousand dollars per annum. 

To '.he clerl<-=, cru-li rive hundred dollars per annum. 

Resolved, Thai the Secretary for the Department of 
Foreign Affairs, and each of the persons employed under 
him, shall take an oath before a Judge of the Slate where 
Congress shall sit, for the faithful discharge of their respec- 
tive trusts, and an oath of fidelity to the United States, 
before they enter upon office. 

Resolved, Thai the act of the 10;h of January, 17S1, 
respecting the Department of Foreign Affairs, be and here- 
by is repealed. 



TO TIIF. PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Office of Foreign Affairs, February 23d, 1782. 
Sir, 

The resolution passed by Congress on the 22d of Feb- 
ruary, for the more perfect organization of the Department 
of Foreign Affairs, having no reference to the tune pas., in 
fixing the salaries of the secretaries or clerks, 1 am left 
without a rule for that purpose, but presume as I have had 
two gentlemen employed for some time, without any dis- 
tinction of rank, that no objection will lie to my giving them 
orders for the time that they have served at the rale of 
seven hundred and fifty dollars a year each. 

I am sorry to be the means of inking up a moment of 
the lime of Congress, but find myself embarrassed by their 
present arrangement, which fixes one secretary, and re- 
duces the other gentleman in the office to the rank of a 
common clerk. If no material objection should lie against 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 235 

the measure, I would propose, as the business of the office 
naturally divides itself into two branches, foreign and do- 
mestic, that instead of a secretary there should be two 
under secretaries, whose rank and pay shall be settled ac- 
cording to their merit and abilities by the Secretary of 
Foreign Affairs, provided that the pay of both taken to- 
gether shall not exceed the sum of fifteen hundred dollars ; 
this will not only be an incitement to diligence and atten- 
tion, but possibly enable me to procure two persons, in 
whose integrity and abilities I can confide, instead of a 
common clerk, without increasing the expense of the de- 
partment. 

1 have the honor to be, &:c. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Office of Foreign Affairs, February 2Gth, 1782. 
Sir, 

I am somewhat at a loss to determine upon what princi- 
ple the petition of John Jordan and others, was referred to 
me, but presume, that it was with a view to obtain from 
me such information relative to the distribution of the prize 
money arising from the prizes taken by the Bon Homme 
Richard, as the papers in this office can afford. 

There were no papers relative to this transaction in this 
office ; but among those of tin; Board of Admiralty, I find 
a letter from Dr Franklin to Francis Lewis, dated die I7th 
of March last, covering some inquiries on this subject, and 
a copy of a Concordat entered into by Joint Paul Jones, 
commanding the Bon Homme Richard ; Pierre Landais, 
captain of the Alliance ', DcmiH Nicolas Coitiusau, cap- 



236 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

tain of the Pallas; Joseph Varage, captain of the Cerf; 
and Philip Nicolas Ricot, captain of the Vengeance ; 
by which, among other things, they agree to divide their 
prizes, agreeably to the American regulations, as they 
sailed under American colors and commissions ; and con- 
stituted M. Chaumont their agent to receive ami distribute 
the prize money in behalf of the crew of each ship, and to 
be answerable for it in his own private name. 

From Dr Franklin's letter, it appears that the whole of 
the prizes belonged to the captors; that the King offered 
to purchase the ships of war they had taken, according to 
an established rate ; that the seamen objected to it, and 
chose they should be sold at vendue ; that this occasioned 
a delay in the sale ; that he does not know the amount of 
the value of the prizes, nor whether they were distributed, 
which he considers as a private transaction between the 
officers and crews of the ships and IW. Chaumont. 

From this state of facts, Congress will judge if anything 
more can be done relative to the claim of three of the pe- 
titioners to their share of the value of the prizes, (the fourth 
being out of the question) tli3n to assist them in the mode 
of authenticating the evidence of their being entitled there- 
to, and to forward it with powers of attorney to tie Consul 
of the United States in France. This I will readily do for 
them, and write to .Mr Barclay on the subject, without any 
express direction from Congress, when the petitioners shall 
call at this office. 

I have the honor to be, &c.

DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 237 

TO ROBERT SMITH, COMMERCIAL AGENT AT HAVANA. 

Philadelphia, February 2Clh, 1782. 
Sir, 

Your letter to the Superintendent of Finance wns re- 
ceived, and referred by Congress to this office, when upon 
mature deliberation it was determined for various political 
reasons, not to recommend the issuing of any commissions 
for letters of marque, or reprisals from any of the Spanish 
Islands. Congress having considered these reasons, came 
into this view, and passed the resolution, which 1 enclose 
in pursuance nf their orders. 

It is expected, that the several Consuls and agents of 
Congress, wherever settled, wilt keep up a regular and 
constant correspondence with me, in order that the United 
Stales, in Congress, may have the fullest Information of 
every transaction in which they may be materially con- 
cerned. This task I dare say you will readily impose 
upon yourself, when you reflect on the advantages that 
may result from it. The points on which I shall chiefly 
trouble you for information, are the naval and military 
strength of the Island at the time you write, not merely as 
to the number of ships and men, but their actual state of 
preparation for defensive or offensive operations, their sta- 
tions, their prospects and designs, as far as you can learn 
them. At your leisure, I wish to have an account of the 
population, militia, commerce, husbandry, and revenue of 
the Island, the sentiments of the people with respect to this 
war,'- and everything else you may deem curious or inter- 
esting. 

If a paper is printed at the Havana, yon will be p'eased 
to send it to me by every opportunity. I need not suggest 



23S ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

to you the necessity of preparing your letters:, so tint iliey 
may he sunk in ease of danger, when they contain anything 
which may he of use to the enemy. 
1 have the honor to be, &c. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



TO DON FRANCISCO RENDON.* 

Philadelphia, March Cth, 1782. 
Sir, 

I will wiih pleasure give you such information on the 
subjects you write upon, as 1 can with propriety mention 
to a gentleman of whose attachment 1 entertain no doubt, 
but who has, nevertheless, uiven me no reason to think, 
that his inquiries have any farther object than his personal 
satisfaction. 

I. In answer lo the fir?t question, I can only inform yon, 
that Congress have voted thinvsix thousand inlantrv, which, 
with the cavalry and artillery, will amount to about forty 
thousand men. It is not probable, however, that the whole 
of ll.ii number will be raised ; i think it would be; prudent to 
make a deduction of about one foiiith. But you have been 
too long in tlrs country to form any judgment of the strength 
of our army from the regular establishment, since it has 
been, and always will be increased (more particularly in the 
Northern Stales-) by large bodies of militia, when their 
apprehensions, or the hope of splendid advantages shall call 
them foith. Of this, the events of the year 1777, among 
others, afford the most striking evidence. 

* A Spanish gentleman residing in Philadelphia, and apparently 
intrusted with some kind of agency by the Spanish government. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 039 

2. It is not expected, that in the present sitnniion of the 
country, the whole sum of eight millions of dollars can he 
raised in time. What the deficiency will be, must depend 
on the motions and strength of our enemy early the next 
spring ; the success of our commerce ; the remittances that 
shall be made to this country by our allies, which, being 
expended here, may, by frequent taxes, be brought into the 
public treasury, and repeatedly applied to public use. 

3. The resources of the next campaign lay in taxation, 
in the strictest economy, and in the assistance which we 
may reasonably hope to receive from the enemies of Great 
Britain, while we are making every exertion in the common 
cause. We flatter ourselves, that those powers who wish 
for peace, and who see America as the great object in 
Britain, in canning on the war, will not suffer it to be 
lengthened out beyond the present year, when, by a mode- 
rate supply to us, they can terminate it in the course of one 
campaign. We form some expectations from the wisdom 
and generosity of Spain ; and as we know she has the 
means, so we cannot suppose she can want the inclination 
to promote i.er own interests, and insure the esteem and 
gratitude of a rising nation, whose commerce and alliance 
cannot but be important from the situation of her Colonies-. 

4. This question is answered above, only it may be 
proper to observe, that if, in this reasonable expectation, 
America should be disappointed, she will still find resources 
in herself, not indeed to expel the enemy, but to preclude 
them from extending their conquests, and to compel them 
(o offer her such terms as are necessary for her security, 
though perhaps short of her wishes. 

5. The commercial connexion between the United 
States and Spain, will naturally be very extensive, if it 



240 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

meets with the least encouragement. The Spanish Islands 
will be supplied with provisions from them, at such easy 
rates as must give them great advantages in the cultivation 
of sugars, for which America will afford a considerable 
market ; fish, lumber, and iron will also be exported to 
them if it should be permitted ; and salt, as well as sugar, 
brought back in return, if the duties should he lowered, or 
a drawback allowed on the exportation. Our trade with 
Spain will consist chiefly in naval stores, masts, iron, furs, 
fish, and tobacco; in return for which we shall take the 
produce and manufactures of Spain of almost every kind. 

G. It is impossible for the United States to use means to 
prevent an illicit commerce with the Spanish Colonies, 
without interfering in their internal regulations. All they can 
do, is, to crnsider the regulations made for that purpose as 
biniiins; upon their subjects, and not (o demand satisfaction 
if they suffer by the penalties, which the laws attempted to 
be infringed, may impose. To this they will not object, 
while the punishment is reasonable, and not confined to 
crimes committed within the jurisdiction of the power 
imposing it. If it is extended further, such further exten- 
sion must depend upon treaties between the United States 
and Spain, and will be the subject of discussion whenever 
such treaty shall be set on foot. 

7. Spain will be allowed, without the least difficulty, 
either to purchase vessels built in America, or to appoint 
agents of her own for building vessels of any kind, as well 
as for arming them, if she thinks proper, from the iron 
foundories, which are lately erected here, and which will 
continue to increase in proportion to the encouragement 
which shall be given them. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 241 

The last question must be referred to a general treaty, 
and is of such a nature as not to be properly answered 
here.* 

I am, with great regard and esteem, 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



TO JOHN PAUL JONES. 

Philadelphia, April 17th, 1782. 
Sir, 

I enclose an extract from a protest made by Captain 
A. de Neef, commanding the brigantine Berkenbosch, 
which has been transmitted to Congress, and by them to 
me, in order that I might inquire into the facts therein 
alleged. I must beg the favor of you to state them to me 
as far as they come within your knowledge, that measures 
may be taken to vindicate your reputation, and that of the 
American flag, if, as I presume, the charges are ili founded, 
or to repair any injury, which you may undesignedly have 
occasioned him. 

Complaints have been made to Congress by officers and 
men, who formerly belonged to the crew of the Bon Homme 
Richard, and the Alliance frigate, of their not having yet 
been able to obtain the share of prize money due to them ; 
in consequence of which Congress have directed me to 
draw a memorial to the Court of Fiance, praying its inter- 
position, in obtaining justice for them. As this whole 
business, as lar as I can collect from the Concordat entered

Congress in regard to the Southern boundaries of Georgia?"

into by you and the gentlemen commanding the other 
vessels under your command, appears to have been a private 
transaction, I am at a loss upon what to ground an appli- 
cation to the Court, more particularly as neither of the 
parties have as yet called upon this office with proof of 
their having applied to M. Chaumont, or been denied justice 
by him. You will oblige me by giving me all the light in 
your power upon this subject, if possible, by the next post. 
I have the honor to be, &c.

THOMAS S. LEE TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

Annapolis, in Council, April 19th, 1782. 
Sir, 
We have been duly honored with your several letters 
of the 12th of November, 1781, and the 18th and 19th of 
February, 17S2, which shall be laid before our Assembly, 
at their meeting the 25th of the present month, when, we 
doubt not, their very important contents will meet with the 
consideration they so well deserve. 

Whenever we are possessed of anything, in which the 
United Slates are materially interested, we shall with great 
pleasure communicate it. 

The document you require, in consequence of the reso- 
lution of Congress, enclosed in the letter of the ISth of

ROBERT MORRIS TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

Office of Finance, April 27th, 1782. 
Sir, 

His Excellency, the Minister of France, having in- 
formed on the part of his Court, that no extraordinary 
sums will be paid to the Ministers of the United States 
in Europe, I must request that you will furnish me 
with an account of their several salaries, payable to the 
foreign Ministers and their Secretaries, and I will 
make out bills in j'our favor on the banker of the Uni- 
ted States in Paris for the last quarter, commencing 
with the present year. I must at the same time pray, 
you will require of those gentlemen, the state of their 
several accounts with the public for salaries, that the 
whole may be adjusted, and all future expenses of that 
sort be classed under the proper head of the Depart- 
ment of Foreign Affairs. 

I have the honor to be, &c.

CIRCULAR LETTER TO THE GOVERNORS OF THE 

STATES. 

Office of Foreign Affairs, Philadelphia, > 
May 2d, 1762. 5 

Sir, 
The enclosed resolution of Congress will explain 
the cause of this letter. The information it refers to, 
is an assurance that Britain had absolutely declined 
any interference of- the mediating powers between 
them and what they call their rebel subjects. They 
persist on every occasion in representing us as a di- 



244 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

vided people, who anxiously wish to return to our con- 
nexion with England, In this they have two objects 
equally important to them. 1st. They encourage Eng- 
land to continue a war, which they expect to see ter- 
minated by our own weariness and languor; and 2dly. 
They put such a face upon their affairs as will entitle 
them on a negotiation to make demands at our ex- 
pense, which they would not presume to think of, if 
the mediators were acquainted with our firm resolu- 
tion never to return to our obedience to their Govern- 
ment. Besides which, they cast a degree of odium 
upon the conduct of France, representing it as the 
support of a discontented faction, rather than as the 
generous ally of an oppressed nation. 

There is reason to apprehend, that in order the 
better to secure the advantages of this deceitful policy 
to themselves, they will make proffers to each of the 
United States. If any of them should listen to them, 
(which cannot, however, be presumed,) they will urge 
this, as a proof of their assertions, even if they should 
decline receiving their proposals, and refer them to 
Congress, as from the nature of our Union they un- 
doubtedly must ; still as the result of the experiment 
cannot be known for some time in Europe, they will 
avail themselves of it in part, if negotiations should 
open. 

This artifice of the enemy may be counteracted in 
two ways, both of which deserve the serious attention 
of your Legislature. The first and most important is, 
by making such exertions to procure a respectable 
army early in the season, that the mediators casting 
their eyes upon the muster rolls, may there read a full 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 245 

refutation of all that British artifice can suggest. I 
need not observe, that this measure must go hand in 
handt with taxation, since an army without the means 
of supporting it, would only increase our evils. The 
second is to anticipate the attempt of Great Britain by 
such resolutions as the information contained in this 
letter suggests, resolutions which strongly mark a 
spirited determination in the Legislature of each State 
to listen to no negotiations, except through the inter- 
vention of Congress, which manifest their attachment 
to the independence of their country, and inviolable 
regard to the faith they have pledged to each other, 
and to their allies. These may either prevent the 
attempt I apprehend, or arrive in time to counteract 
this effect, which the false expectations built thereon 
might otherwise have in Europe. 

I mention this to your Excellency without any ex- 
press direction from Congress. It is more than prob- 
able, that your judgment, and the zeal ami wisdom of 
the Legislature, may improve these loose hints to the 
general advantage of the United States. I have the 
pleasure of assuring your Excellency and the Legisla- 
ture, that the fairest prospects are now before us of 
terminating the war by a single exertion, though I am 
not at. liberty to say, that the plan of the ensuing cam- 
paign is absolutely determined on, yet I have great 
reason to believe, that we shall receive such powerful 
military aid, as, with becoming exertions on our part, 
will free every State in the Union from the grasp of 
the enemy. 

Here, Sir, I might pause, and suffer my imagination 
to dwell upon the animating prospect before us j but 



246 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

reasoning from the past to the future, I dare not in- 
dulge the pleasing idea. We have at no period been 
in a situation to second fully the endeavors of our ally 
to serve us ; we either neglected to assemble our army 
in time, or to provide the means for supporting or 
moving them ; a feather would have turned the bal- 
ance last year, notwithstanding the powerful aid we 
received from abroad. Providence blinded our adver- 
saries ; to their temerity we owe our success. 

But, Sir, let me ask, whether any State did then, or 
has even now, done all in its power to enable our 
Generals to prosecute this victory? Or rather let me 
turn to what is more within our line, by observing, 
that the inferiority of our army in point of numbers 
to that of our ally while they acted at Yorktown, has 
been considered in Europe as a proof of the assertions 
of Britain, and has been urged as an argument of our 
weakness, our weariness of the war, or our internal 
divisions. A moment's reflection will show the ad- 
vantages, that this affords our antagonist in a negotia- 
tion. How much it weakens the claims we make, and 
how many important benefits may be lost forever by 
our appearing in Europe to receive our independence 
rather as a gift, than to have established it by our 
exertions ! 

But, Sir, it is still in our power to repair thess 
errors. Let us avail ourselves of this favorable mo- 
ment for expelling the enemy, and recovering our 
diminished credit among the nations of the earth. 

I make no apology for the liberty I take. Your 
Excellency, I am persuaded, is too sensible of the 
truth of these observations, to think they could be de- 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 247 

livered with less earnestness by one, who feels their 
importance, and I am confident that you will bring 
them before the Legislature of your State in such 
manner as will best serve to ensure them their at- 
tention. 

I have the honor to be, &c. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



TO ROBERT MORRIS. 

Philadelphia, May 8th, 1782. 

Dear Sir, 
I enclose the list of salaries you requested. The 
charges of those who act as secretaries to Dr Franklin 
and Mr Adams are not yet settled. I shall lay the 
list before Congress and make them some propositions 
on the subject. It will be necessary to afford a small 
sum to each of the Ministers to enable them to defray 
contingent expenses, which are continually happening, 
particularly to Dr Franklin, who is at the centre of all 
our communications. I will converse with you on 
this subject, and endeavor to form an estimate of what 
this ought to be. 

I am, Sir, he.

Sir, 

The enclosed account of the annual expense of the De- 
partment of Foreign Affairs, exclusive of contingent ex- 



248 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

penses, was made out at the request of the Superintendent 
of Finance, that measures might be taken to discharge the 
salaries of the gentlemen in Europe, who express great un- 
easiness on the subject ; but as it is incomplete till the 
allowance to the private secretaries of Dr Franklin and Mr 
Adams are ascertained, I have thought it proper to lay the 
whole before Congress, for their direction thereon. 

Congress were pleased to order by their resolution of 
the 2d of January last, that the Secretary of Foreign Af- 
fairs should lay before them an estimate of the expenses, 
which will probably be incurred by the foreign Ministers 
of the United States respectively, and their secretaries. I 
find myself under great embarrassments in preparing a re- 
port agreeably to their order, from not being able to enter 
fully into their views. I should presume, that the expense 
of foreign Ministers ought to be regulated by their sala- 
ries, though I feel that the desire of supporting the dignity 
of an office, to which the salary is incompetent, often urges 
men to quit the line, how much soever they may be em- 
barrassed thereby. Justice and policy suggest, that the 
salaries of officers, who are engaged in so delicate and diffi- 
cult a department as that of Foreign Affairs, should have 
such appointments as to free thsm from embarrassments 
with respect to their private affairs. I believe Congress 
had this in view when they settled those of their foreign 
Ministers, none of whom complain of their being inade- 
quate, unless it be Mr Jay, who has given us some reason 
to think his salary, in his opinion, is barely sufficient for his 
support, and that l/is manner of living is not equal to what 
he conceives the dignity of the United States requires. 
With respect to the salaries of the secretaries to the Em- 
bassies, it is in my opinion, (founded upon the practice of 
other nations) at least the double of what it ought to be. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 249 

If, as 1 presume, Congress intended Ly their resolution, 
that I should lay before them an account of the manner in 
which our foreign Ministers live at present, that they 
might themselves be enabled to judge of the proportion it 
bore to their appointments, 1 can only say, that the result 
of inquiries on this head must necessarily be extremely 
uncertain. I submit them as far as they have come to 
my knowledge. 

Dr Franklin has a part of M. Chnumont's house at 
Pussy ; he keeps a chariot and pair, and three or four ser- 
vants, and gives a dinner occasionally to the Americans 
and others ; his whole expense is, as far as 1 Can learn, 
very much within his income. 

]\lr Adams lives in lodgings, keeps a chariot and pair, 
and two men servants ; he has hitherto retained a private 
secretary in the absence of Mr Dana, who will, it is to be 
presumed, be paid by Congress. I have lately heard that 
Mr Adams was about to take a house. 

Mr Dana's salary, even if he should assume a public 
character, in a country where the relative value of money 
is so high, that, if I am weli informed, an elegant house 
may be had for fifteen guineas a year, is very ample. 

Of Mr Jay's mariner of living, I have been able to obtain 
no account, but should conclude from the price of the ne- 
cessaries of life, in the part of Spain in which he lives, 
from the port the Court and the people about it maintain, 
and above all, from its sitting in different parts of the king- 
dom, that to live in the same style with Dr Franklin or Mr 
Adams, his expenses must amount to nearly double of 
theirs. 

But as every conjecture of this kind must be very uncer^ 
tain, all 1 can do is to lay before Congress the relative ex- 
vol. xi. 32 



250 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

pense, as far as I can learn it, between the different places 
at which our Ministers reside,- taking Philadelphia for the 
common standard. 

Paris, if wine, clothing, and the wages of servants are 
included, is about twenty per cent cheaper than Philadel- 
phia ; Amsterdam ten, and at Madrid the expenses of a 
family are somewhat higher than at this place. But the 
unsettled state of those who follow the Court, their travel- 
ling equipage and charges must greatly enhance this ex- 
pense. 

Congress will make their own deductions from these 
facts, after allowing for their inaccuracy. 1 would, how- 
ever, lake the liberty to submit the enclosed resolutions to 
Congress; the first is founded upon the propriety of sup- 
plying Dr Franklin with a secretary, which his age and the 
dignity of his employment render necessary. As Mr Jay 
is not yet acknowledged, Mr CarmiehaePs services in 
Spain may be dispensed with. 

The second, third, fifth, and sixth, are designed to make 
a reform in the article of expense. 

The fourth to prevent the claim which any gentlemen, 
who may be appointed to any of the Northern Courts, may 
have to the salary settled by Congress on the 5th of Octo- 
ber, and to adapt the character to the allowance. 

The sixth to enable Congress, without injuring the dig- 
nity of their Ministers, to proportion the allowance to the 
expense of the Court they reside at, as well as to the port 
which th*y would wish them to maintain. 
I have the honor to be, kc.

May Oth, 1782. 
Sir, 

The United States in Congress assembled, having ap- 
pointed Monday, the 13th instant, at twelve o'clock, for 
giving a public audience to the Minister of Prance, and 
having resolved, that a place be assigned to the principals 
in the three Executive Departments under Congress, 

I have the honor to inform you, that the place assigned 
to those gentlemen, is within the bar to the right, and next 
to the members of Congress on the left of the chair. 

The United States in Congress assembled have further 
resolved, That the assistants and principal secretaries in 
each of the departments, be admitted without the bar of

TO THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF, AND MAJOR GENERAL 

GREENE. 

Philadelphia, May 13th, 1762. 
Sir, 

I have the honor to inform you, that the Minister Plen- 
ipotentiary of France this day announced to the United 
States in Congress :ssembled, at a public audience, the 
birth of a Dauphin, and that Congress received this an- 
nunciation of an event, in which the liapniness of their ally 
was so deeply engaged, with the most lively marks of sat- 
isfaction. It is their wish, that your Excellency, and the 
troops under your command should partake in this pleas- 
ure. 1 have their orders to inform you of this event, to 
the ciul, that you may cause the same to be published in 
the army, with such demonstrations of joy as you shall 
direct.* 

I have the honor to dp, &c. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, May I3th, 17S2. 
Sir, 

The late change in the measures and in the administra- 
tion of Great Britain, and the ails that are daily practised 

* The same intelligence was communicated in the same formal 
way to the Governois of the States, 



254 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

to infuse a belief in Europe, that the most perfect har- 
mony does not subsist beuveen tlie United Slates and their 
ally, induce me to wish, that Congress would embrace 
the opportunity, which this day's audience affords, to 
declare their attachment to the alliance in such terms, as 
will serve fully to defeat every expectation of sowing the 
seeds of division between the United Slates and France. 

For which purpose I humbly submit the following addi- 
tion to the answer proposed to be given to the address of 
the Minister Plenipotentiary of France. 

I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, 
ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



Office of Foreign Affairs, May 13th, 1762. 

The following addition to the answer to the address 
pro-osed lo be made by the Minister of France, is humbly 
submitted to the approbation of Congress, by the Secre- 
tary of Foreign Affairs. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

"A union, the mutual advantages of which become daily 
more conspicuous, and which has derived new lustre and 
additional force from every effort of the common enemy 
to dissolve it ; Congress do not enlarge upon the subject, 
but satisfy themselves with the representations, which your 
own observations will enable, and your regard to the in- 
terests of both countries will induce you to make of the 
affectionate attachment, which every rank of people within 
these United States manifest to your Sovereign, and of 
their inviolable fidelity to the principles of the alliance."

Philadelphia, May loth, 1782. 
Sir, 

In order to liave the sense of Congress upon Mr Jay's 

rcqrest, contained in his letter of the Gih of February last, 

I do myself the honor to submit the enclosed resolve ; for 

though I do not see any advantage, which would at present 

result from his leaving Madrid, yet as cases may arise, 

which would render it proper, it may safely he left to his 

discretion. 

I have the honor to he, 8cc.

Office of Foreign Affairs, May 15th, 1782. 

The following resolution is humbly submitted to the 
consideration of the United States in Congress, by the 
Secretary of Foreign Affairs. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

It having been represented to the United States in Con- 
gress, that certain circumstances might render it expedient 
to permit Mr Jay to leave the Court of Madrid, and repair 
either to the United Provinces or to Versailles, 

Resolved, that such permission be granted him, pro- 
vided he shall conceive, that such absence will be attended 
with important advantages to the United States, and that 
it does not exceed three months. 



25G ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

TO RICHARD HARRISON OF CADIZ. 

Philadelphia, May 21st, 1782. 
Sir, 

You have probably hoard of Colonel Living-ton's mis- 
fortune, which deprived me of ilie pleasure of hearing 
from you l<y him. Our ports have been so closely bloi ked 
up for some time past, that it is with great difficulty we 
tan <ii J t ariv vessels in or out. He shared the common 
f;ite, and was carried into New York, from whence he 
is come out with Mr Vaughan upon parole. He destroyed 
all his letters, and his parole closing this month, we have 
been able lo learn nothing of importance from him. 

The new system, which England seems to be about to 
adopt, with respect to America, has not yet discovered 
itself here, except in general professions, which the present 
Commander in Chief, Sir Guy Carloton, is continually 
making of his kmdness and the affection, that still subsists 
in England towards the people of this country. This has 
produced not the least effect here ; all ranks of people 
consider it rather a proof of their imbecility, than of their 
good will, and the Legislatures of the several States will 
I imagine enter into resolutions, similar to those passed 
by Maryland, which you will find in the enclosed papers. 
] direct them to you ; after you have read them, 1 wish 
you to enclose and send them to Mr Jay as soon as pos- 
sible. 1 commit to your particular care the several pack- 
ets, that go with this ; trusting that you will send them in 
such way as to escape inspection. They contain very 
important papers, as well those that go to Mr Adams as 
to Mr Jay. 

I have the honor to be, &c. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.

Philadelphia, May 21st, 1782. 
Sir, 

I have the honor to enclose for the inspection of Con- 
gress, the draft of a letter to Mr Dana, together with a 
quadruplicate copy of one written the 2d of March, that 
Congress by seeing both may judge whether any further 
directions are necessary. I must take the liberty, Sir, to 
request you to turn their attention to this subject, and to 
the draft, which I had the honor to lay before them, of a 
letter to the King, as soon as possible. Unless Congress 
decide upon them today, I shall lose a favorable opportu- 
nity of transmitting them to Europe. 
I have the honor to be, &c.

GEORGE WASHINGTON TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

Head Quarters, May 22d, 1782. 
Sir, 

I have been honored with your favor of the 13th, com- 
municating to me the formal annunciation to Congress, by 
the Minister of France, of the birth of a. Dauphin. 

Measures are ordered to convey to the army the news 
of this happy event, which will be celebrated with such 
demonstrations of joy as the occasion requires, and our 
circumstances will admit. 

This information will be transmitted to General Greene, 
that the army under his command may participate in the 
general joy. 

I have the honor to be, &c.

GOVERNOR TRUMBULL TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

Hartford, May 23d, 1782. 
Sir, 

1 do myself the honor to enclose you copies of a letter, 
which I received some time since from Mr Deane ; as he 
appears to be somewhat knowing in the counsels of Great 
Brkain,! thought it not improper to return him an answer; 
you will find copies of what I have written likewise en- 
closed, and it is my duty to acquaint you, that upon being 
laid before the General Assembly of the State, this answer 
was approved by both houses neminc coniradicente. 

You will be pleased to lay both papers before^Congress 
and the Minister of France, and you will judge of the 
propriety of sending a copy likewise to Dr Franklin, or 
our other Ministers in Europe. 

I beg leave also to recommend to your care for convey- 
ance, the letter covered for Mr Deane, and am, Sir, with 
the sincerest sentiments of esteem, he.

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Office of Foreign Affairs, June 5th, 1782. 
Sir, 

I have the honor to submit to Congress the enclosed 

letter from Mr Lee with his accounts. As Congress were 

pleased to give no directions- relative to the brigantine 

Berkenbosch, I presume it was their intention, that I 

should transmit to Dr Franklin a state of the information 

I had collected on that subject, which 1 have accordingly

done. If Congress have any further commands, I wish 
to be honored with them as soon as convenient. 
I am, Sir, with the highest respect, &c.

Sir, 
I have the honor to enclose the translation of a letter

peculiarly to your department, you will do me the honor

Memorial accompanying the letter from the Count, a trans- 
lation of which is also enclosed. You will be pleased to 
cause an inquiry to be made into the facts, and to favor 
me with such information, as will enable me either to 
show, that the complaint is ill founded, or that it will be 
treated with the attention it merits. 
I have the honor to be, he.

ROBERT MORRIS TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

Office of Finance, June 7th, 1782. 
Sir, 

I received this morning the letter you did me the 
honor to write on the 6th. Congress have asked from 
the several States a five per cent duty on goods im- 
ported, and on prizes and prize goods, as a fund for 
paying the principal and interest of their debts, this 
fund when granted will not be sufficient, and it is not 
yet granted by all. I expect, however, the requisition 
will speedily be complied with. I shall not cease 
urging it, and also such further revenues as may be 
sufficient for the purpose. When they shall have been 
obtained, they will be duly applied in liquidation of 
the public debts; but until that period arrives, neither 
the principal nor the interest of such debts can be 
paid. 

I have the honor to be, with very great respect, 

ROBERT MORRIS. 



TO GOVERNOR TRUMBULL.

Sir, 
I was honored with your letter of the 23d of May, 
with both the enclosures, which I laid* before Con- 
gress, and furnished copies to the Minister of France. 
The spirit in which your answer to Mr Deane's letter 
is written, is such as must bring him to some sense of 
the disgraceful and contemptible part he is acting, and 
awake in him that remorse, which is the severest pun-

ishment of guilt. I shall avail myself of the permis- 
sion you give me to transmit it to Dr Franklin, since 
I see that important advantages may result from de- 
claring to Europe your sense, and that of so reputable 
a body as the Legislature of Connecticut, upon the im- 
portant points it discusses. 

I have the honor to be, &c.

that if the gentlemen mentioned in that Memorial, or 
their representatives, have any claims against the 
United States, they must form accounts thereof, and 
state them in the usual manner to the Controller of 
the treasury, with the vouchers, who will cause them 
to be examined, according to the rules and regulations 
in that behalf established, and any balances which may 
appear due will be by him certified to me, at which

THE GOVERNOR OF NORTH CAROLINA TO ROBERT R. 

LIVINGSTON. 

North Carolina, June 34th, 1782. 
Sir, 
Your letters of the ISth and 19th of February, cov- 
ering the resolutions of Congress, dated November 
28th, January 25th, and February 11th, I was favored 
with in May last, which I did myself the honor to lay 
before the General Assembly. 

The important observations you are pleased to make 
relative to our affairs, our friends, allies, and enemies, 
have their just weight, which the Legislature are. very 
sensible of. To be prepared, therefore, for whatever 
measures the enemy may take, they have passed a law 
to draft every twentieth man in the State, to serve in 
our Continental battalions eighteen months ; as enlist- 
ments during the war cannot be obtained in this State, 
so as to answer any general purpose. I flatter myself, 
we shall have a respectable body of men soon in the 
field, under Major General Greene. In August they 
are to rendezvous. One hundred wagons, for the Con- 
tinental service, the State is also to furnish, in lieu of 
one hundred men. 

I have given directions for the damages, which the 
inhabitants of this State have received from the British, 
to be ascertained as nearly as may be^ agreeably to 
your request. 

The records of our Secretary's office being scattered 
in different parts, to prevent their falling into the hands 
of the enemy, during their incursions and marches 
through the State, I have been prevented from pro- 



264 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

curing you copies of the papers you mention ; but I 
have sent by Mr Blount, the bearer, and one of our 
Delegates, a map, or short sketch of the outlines of the 
State ; extending to the westward as far as Mississippi, 
the boundary formed by the treaty of Paris in 1763, 
which we consider ourselves not absolutely bound by, 
having a previous right by the charter of Charles the 
Second, which I shall shortly transmit to you. By 
this our territory extends from sea to sea, that is from 
the Atlantic to the Western ocean. 
I have the honor to be, &c.

GOVERNOR MARTIN TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

North Carolina, August 20th, 1782. 
Sir, 

Only a few days ago I was favored with your letter, of 
the 2d of May, 1782, covering a resolution of Congress of 
the 1st, on a report of a committee to whom was referred 
a communication of the Secretary of Foreign Affairs. 

However insidious the designs of the Court of Britain 
may be in representing us as a divided people to the seve- 
ral mediating European powers, the several great exertions 
making by the Continental Union, to prosecute the war 
with vigor against her, J make no doubt, will shortly unde- 
ceive them, and expose our enemy to the just contempt 
and ridicule he will draw upon himself by such false and 
illusive insinuations. 

Whilst the enemy held the important post of Wilming- 
ton, the above suggestion might be too true respecting its 
environs, and the disaffected settlements of this State, but 
since they have abandoned the same, our late revolted citi- 
vol. xi. 34

zens, conscious of their delusion, return with cheerfulness 
to their allegiance and duty in support of the common 
cause, and 1 flatter myself we shall soon be a reunited peo- 
ple, and join our efforts with more efficacy to those of our 
sister States, in terminating the war with honor to our 

arms. 

Sensible of the great attention paid to the several States 
by the Congress in this resolution, and the pertinent obser- 
vations you have made thereon, with a zeal becoming its 
importance, in putting our Legislature on their guard against 
any separate overtures that may be made to them by Bri- 
tain, without the intervention of Congress, I shall with 
pleasure do myself the honor to lay the same before them 
at their earliest meeting, which will be on the 1st of No- 
vember next, at Hillsborough. In the meanwhile, Sir, I 
can venture to pledge the faith of the State, that the Gene- 
ral Assemlly will listen to no negotiation, however flatter- 
ing, and apparently advantageous, but what is made 
through the great Council of the Continent. 

Yours of the I4lh of May, announcing the birth of the 
Dauphin of France, I have had the honor to receive, 
which joyful event as it concerns the happiness of our great 
and illustrious ally, and future welfare of his kingdom, I 
have communicated to the good citizens of this State. 

Enclosed you have a copy of the acts of our last Gene- 
ral Assembly, agreeably to your request, which by the de- 
lay of the printer could not reach you sooner. I hope my 
letter, accompanied with a map, has safely come to hand. 
1 have the honor to be, &.c.

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, August 23d, 1782. 
Sir, 

By a late arrangement of the Superintendent of Finance, 
he has directed that the salaries of the Ministers and their 
Secretaries be pair! here, and only one account opened with 
the office of Foreign Affairs; in consequence of which I 
have, at his request, stated th?ir accounts quarterly, and 
laid out the proceeds in the purchase of bills, which I have 
remitted to Dr Franklin, with direction to answer their 
several drafts to the amount of the money so reunited. 
But as these bills are endorsed by me, I by that means 
render myself responsible for their payment in my private 
character ; and as I am not authorised by Congress, or by 
the gentlemen in whose behalf the money is remitted, to 
act as their agent, I am liable to answer to them for the 
money received here, if they should disapprove of its 
having been laid out in the purchase of bills. I also render 
myself accountable to them severally, if the money remitted 
to Dr Franklin should, by neglect or other cause, be applied 
to some other use than that for which it was remitted. 

I have endeavored to obviate these inconveniences by 
writing to the Ministers and their Secretaries, informing 
them of this arrangement, and requesting them to appoint 
agents, who shall manage their business here. In the mean- 
while, 1 must request, for my justification, some resolutions 
of Congress, authorising me to act as their agent till they 
shall make such appointments. I have thought it reasonable 
to charge them the usual commission upon the purchase 
of bills, and shall continue to do so, till they appoint 
other agents. 

I have the honor to be, Sir, Sec.

TO WILLIAM MOORE, PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF 
PENNSYLVANIA. 

Office of Foreign Affairs, September 8th, 1782. 
Sir, 

The State of Pennsylvania not having as yet passed 
laws eonformat^y to the eleventh Article of the Treaty of 
Amity and Commerce between his Most Christian Majesty 
and these United States, agreeably to the requisition of 
Congress lo the several States, passed the 14th day of 
January, 17S0, a copy of which is enclosed, I find myself 
called upon by the Minister Plenipotentiary of his Most 
Christian Majesty, in behalf of such of the subjects of 
France, as in confidence thereof have purchased real 
property in this State, to solicit for them the security they 
are entitled to by this article. 

I have the honor, therefore, to request your Excellency 
to take measures for calling the attention of the Legislature 
to this stipulation in the Treaty, when at their earliest 
leisure from such business as they conceive requires more 
immediate despatch. I beg also to be informed, whether 
any, and what steps, have been taken to carry into effect 
the several resolutions of the United States in Congress 
assembled, contained in the letters I d : d myself the honor 
to write to your Excellency, of the following dates, 18th 
and 19th of February, and 2d of May, 1782. 
I have the honor to be, &:c.

DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 269 

TO GOVERNOR WEARE, OF NEW HAMPSHIRE. 

Office of Foreign Affairs, September 9th, 1782. 

Sir, 
I have the honor to enclose copies of letters, which have 
been received from the Governor of the Island of Granada, 
in consequence of letters written, on my application, by the 
Minister of France, and the state of Mr J\Ic Clintock's 
case, transmitted by me. 

From this answer, I think the justice of Mr Mc Clintock's 
claim is put out of doubt ; but, at the same time, redress 
will be rendered more difficult, by our being now obliged 
to seek it in another channel. I shall, however, direct a 
memorial to be presented on the subject to the Court of 
France, and send over authentic copies of the documents 
in my possession. It would greatly facilitate this business, 
if Mr Mc Clintock had an agent in Fiance, who would 
prosecute his claim, and to whom I would afford all the 
facilities in my power. I mention this matter to your 
Excellency, because the Legislature of New Hampshire, 
having interested themselves therein, I presumed that it 
would be agreeable to them to know that it was not 
neglected. 

I beg you to assure them, Sir, that I shall receive with 
pleasure any further instruction with which they may please 
to honor me, relative to this or any other subject, in which 
I may promote the views of the State, or the interest of 
its members. 

Not having been honored with answers to my several 
letters to your Excellency of the following dates, ISth and 
19th of February and 2d of May, 1782, I beg leave to 



270 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

ask, whether they have been received, and what measures 
have been taken in consequence of them. 
I have the honor to be, &ic. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Office of Foreign Affairs, September 9th, 1782. 
Sir, 
The situation of my affairs rendering my personal atten- 
tion necessary, I take the liberty to request your Excel- 
lency to communicate to Congress my design, (if it meets 
their approbation,) to visit the Slate of New York for a few 
weeks. I shall take measures to have the earliest commu- 
nication made to Congress of such intelligence as may be 
received in my absence, and for the general direction of 
the business of the department. Your Excellency will do 
me the honor to obtain the sense of Congress upon this 
subject, and to believe me, with the highest resppct, Sic.

TO GOVERNOR MARTIN, OF NORTH CAROLINA. 

Office of Foreign Affairs, September 9th, 1782. 
Sir, 

1 have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your 

Excellency's letter of the 24th of June, by Mr Blount, 

together with the map you were pleased to transmit. I 

shall expect, at your leisure, the other documents you 

mention as explanatory of your boundaries. Copies of the 

most westerly grants, that have been made by the Crown 

within your State, would tend greatly to elucidate your 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 271 



I 



claim, as would also copies of acts of the Legislature laying 
out the back country into counties or parishes, if any 
such exist. 

I receive, with great pleasure, the account you give of 
the exertion of your State in filling their line, though I think 
we have some reason to hope, that you will not be able to 
find employment for them near home. 

I could wish to have had it in my power to give your 
Excellency some account of our foreign negotiations, but 
by an extraordinary neglect, or, which is more probable, by 
some accident, we have had no official information either 
from our own Ministers, or through the Minister of France, 
for a very long time past. As to public news, it is not 
worth while to trouble you with it, as this letter will proba- 
bly lay some days before the gentleman, who has promised 
to charge himself with it, calls. I shall therefore direct, 
as the best means of giving the news of the day, that the 
latest papers of this place be sent with it, when he is just 
about to set out. 

I have the honor to be, Sir, &c.

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Office of Foreign Affairs, September 11th, 1782. 
Sir, 
I have the honor to lay before Congress a number 
of letters received last night Ly Captain Smedley, 
from Mr Adams, Mr Dana, and Mr Barclay. I have 
arranged and numbered them, and translated those of 
Mr Dumas. The compliment of the merchants of the 
town of Schiedam being very long, it is not yet trans- 



272 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

lated, when it is, it will be laid before Congress. Mr 
Dana has by some accident neglected to put up the 
first sheet of his letter, so that the subject is broken in 
upon, and we are ignorant of its date. 

I take the liberty to recommend that some attention 
be paid to Mr Adams's request with respect to Mr 
Dumas, who has certainly been a very assiduous ser- 
vant of the United States; I could wish at least to be 
enabled to inform him of the sense of Congress 
thereon. Perhaps it would be expedient to commit it 
to the committee appointed to consider the salaries of 
foreign Ministers, &c. Mr Adams has as yet received 
no answer to the letter on the subject of his purchase 
at the Hague. Should Congress approve the form, 
which Mr Adams proposes for the ratification of his 
agreement, I presume Mr Thomson will have their 
orders for endorsing it, and the agreement will be im- 
mediately returned to this office, so that Congress may 
avail themselves of the means, that now offer for trans- 
mitting it. 

I also lay before Congress a large packet, containing 
Mr Deane's accounts, which I shall deliver to the 
Office of Finance, unless Congress would choose to 
have it disposed of in some other way. I must beg, 
Sir, that the letters be returned to this office, as soon 
as Congress have examined them as I wish to avail 
myself of the present opportunity to answer them. 

I have the honor to be, &c. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Office of Foreign Affairs, September 12th, 17S2. 

Sir, 

I have the honor to lay before Congress two letters 
from Messrs de Neufville and Son, under cover of 
which last I received the enclosed letter, which con- 
tains what I suppose to be the first sheet of Mr Dana's 
letter, probably sent immediately after he had discov- 
ered bis mistake. I send the other parts with it. I 
also enclose for the perusal of Congress an act of the 
British Parliament for the exchange of American pris- 
oners, which, when returned to the office I shall have 
published. 

I find in a Lcydcn paper some account of Mr Grcn- 
ville's negotiation, and the alterations proposed by the 
committee of the States-General to the treaty submit- 
ted to their consideration by Mr Adams. These may 
be objects of curiosity, and as such I enclose them. 
They will be printed on Saturday if the papers are 
returned in time. 

A Dutch paper of the 13th of July, mentions that 
the Baron Viomenil, the Marquis de Lavall, and other 
officers, left Paris the beginning of July, in order to 
sail in the frigate ; that the Marquis dc 

Lafayette was not to accompany them, as it was pro- 
posed ; that he was waiting the issue of the negotia- 
tion in Paris. 

The Count D'Artois has obtained leave of the King 
of Spain to serve as a volunteer at the siege of Gibral-

tar. This may perhaps he concluded as an indication 
of their hope of success in the attempt to reduce it. 
I have the honor to be, k.c. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, September 12th, 1782. 
Sir, 

I have I lie honor to enclose two reports upon Mr 
Adams's letters. I would propose in addition to the 
firet to direct the suhstance of Mr Adams's letter of 
the 2.3d of April, containing his note, and the appoint- 
ment of a committee, to he printed as articles of intel- 
ligence, not under the express direction of Congress, 
since the business is not concluded. 

With respect to the second report, I am led to 
make it hy Mr Adams's recommendation, anil hy my 
sense of the zeal and diligence, which M. Dumas has 
so long testified in the cause of America, when it was 
very far from heing a popular one in Holland. 
Though I must confess I feel some reluctance in sec- 
ing any hut an American in the line, which ought to 
serve as a school for future Ministers. Hut this case 
has peculiar circumstances hy which it must he deter- 
mined. The commission of Charge d'affaires I should 
conceive too important a;ul too confidential to he 
placed in any hands, hut those of a citizen of the 
United Slates. There are other reasons, which will 
suggest themselves to Congress, against this measure, 
which it is unnecessary to mention. The salary I 
Jiave left blank, as that subject is under the considera- 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 275 

lion of a commiltee. The second resolution is to take 
away the necessity of making it greater than our cir- 
cumstances will allow. 

The merits of the other gentlemen mentioned by 
Mr Adams, together with his recommendation, might 
justly perhaps induce Congress to show them some 
marks of their attention, if the situation of their finan- 
ces would permit, but as neither of those gentlemen 
are in the service of Congress, it is to be presumed 
thr.t they will not choose to take any public notice of 
that part of his letter, till they are in circumstances to 
satisfy the just claims of those who have demands 
upon them. 

I have the honor to be, &c. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Office of Foreign Affairs ; September 12th, 1732. 
Sir, 

Having carefully examined Mr Laurens's letter,* I 
believe Congress will think with me, that the subjects 
of it arc such as I can in no other way report on, than 
by recommending it to be submitted to a special com- 
mittee. 

The two great points are his resignation and ex- 
change. The first of these Congress only are compe- 
tent to decide upon ; and the last, not relating in any 
way to my Department, is intimately connected with 
a subject already under the consideration of a commit- 

* See tliis letter in Henry Laurens's Correspondence, Vol. II. p. 
4C3. 



276 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

tee. With respect to his support, I believe that (here 
can be no doubt that Mr Laurens's salary is to be 
paid, till Congress determine to accept his resignation. 
I have considered it as a part of the expenses of this 
Department, and accordingly remitted the amount of 
two quarters' salary to Dr Franklin, commencing in 
January last, previous to which, that business was 
under the direction of Dr Franklin. I shall continue 
to include his salary in my drafts on Mr Morris, till I 
receive directions from Congress to discontinue it. 
Congress having empowered Mr Laurens to appoint 
a secretary, there can be no doubt about the pro- 
priety of discharging his salary. 

The enemy having published an account of Mr 
Laurens's petition for relief, &.c. which appears by his 
letter to have been without foundation, I b> g leave to 
submit to Congress the propriety of printing his own 
account of this transaction, since it evidences in con- 
tradiction to their reports, that he always acted with 
the dignity and firmness, which became his station 
and character. 

I have the honor to be, &:c.

they require, sending quadruplicate copies of them, under 
the seal of the Slate, to this office. I am sorry lo have 
reason to complain of the little attention that the recom- 
mendations of Congress, and my letter of the 12ih day of 
November, 1781, relative to a similar object, has met with 
from your State, since the want of those returns will, with- 
out doubt, be severely felt by our Ministers, whenever they 
shall commence the negotiations for a general peace.

Mr Adams, of the resolutions of their Hisdi Mightinesses 
the States General, to receive and acknowledge the said 
Mr Adams in quality of Minister Plenipotentiary of the 
United States of America, and to request your Excellency 
to cause this interesting event to be made public. 1 have 
the honor to enclose copies of the resolutions ol their High 
Mightinesses on this subject, and to inform you that the 
States General did, on the 23d day of April, appoint a Grand 
Committee to confer with Mr Adams, to whom, having 
been introduced in the usual forms by two noblemen, he 
laid before them the plan of a Treaty of Amity and Com- 
merce, which was immediately printed, and sent to the 
different members of the sovereignty.

GENERAL GREENE TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

Head Quarters, October 2d, 1782. 
Sir, 

Your letter of the 13th of May did not come to hand 
until some time in August, before the receipt of which 
his Excellency, General Washington, had communicated 
the agreeable information of the birth of a Dauphin, and 
directed that some public declaration of our feelings should 
be had upon the occasion. Accordingly, on the 4th of 
July, we filed a/eu dejoie. and gave every testimony in 
our power of the pleasure and happiness we felt upon an 
event so interesting to our good ally, and so intimately 
connected with the welfare of Amerirn ; and I beg you 
will communicate to the Minister in Philadelphia, how 
sincerely the officers of this army participate in the general 
joy, which this public blessing diffuses through France and 
America. 

It is with infinite satisfaction that I inform yon, that the 
enemy is making every preparation for the evacuation of 
Charleston, the last and only place they hold in any of the 
Southern United States. 

I hope a general peace will follow, and that America 
may long enjoy, without interruption, the blessings she has 
been so long contending for. 

1 have the honor to be, Sic

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, October 20th, 1782. 
Sir, 

I have the honor to enclose, for the insppclion of Con- 
gress, a letter from Mr Harrison. So much of it as relates 
to the slate of his accounts, has hecn sent to the Office of 
Finance. As this subject has before been strongly insisted 
upon by Mr Jay, 1 doubt not that Mr Morris will pay every 
attention to it, which the means in his hands will permit. 

Mr Harrison is so well spoken of by Mr Jay, and has 
manifested, on many occasions, watchful attention to the 
welfare of the United States, and discovered such disin- 
terestedness in every transaction which related to them, that 
I cannot but hope that Congress will think him worthy of 
some public notice. Should they be of opinion, that it 
would be improper to appoint him consul at a time when 
he could not be received in his public character, and when 
an attempt to display it might draw upon the United States 
new indignities, yet it would give me pleasure to be enabled 
to assure him from Congress, that they entertain a just 
sense of his services, that (hey wish him to continue to act 
under the authority he has received from Mr Jay, '.ill the 
politics of Spain shall render it proper to vest him with 
more ample powers. This earnest of the favor of Con- 
gress would stimulate him to merit further marks of their 
confidence. 

I have the honor to be, &,c.

Sir, 
I have ilie honor to transmit a resolution of Congress, 
appointing yon one of their Ministers Plenipotentiary for 
negotiating peace. I rejoice in this fresh proof of their 
confidence in your virtue and abilities. The sacrifices you 
have heretofore made to the interests of your conntiy, 
induce me to hope that you will suffer no personal consid- 
eration to prevent their being employed in its service upon 
this important occasion.

TO GOVERNOR MATTHEWS, OF SOUTH CAROLINA. 

Philadelphia, November 20th, 1782. 
Sir, 

I have the honor to transmit the copy of a letter from 
Count de Vergennes to Dr Franklin, accompanied with a 
memorial from Messrs Le Marque and Fabre, on the 
subject of debts contracted by Mr Gillon, as is said, in 
behalf of the State of South Carolina. 1 wish, Sir, you 
would enable me to afford such an answer to it as will 
exculpate the State from any censure which Mr Gillon may 
have deservedly incurred. If he was vested with such 
powers as enabled him to bind the State, they will doubt- 
less have the justice to direct that his engagements be made 
good, notwithstanding any loss they may incur thereby. If 
he had no such powers, they will embrace the earliest 
opportunity of disavowing them. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 281 

I shall trouble your Excellency to apprize me of the 
steps, that may be taken in consequence of this information, 
that I may embrace the earliest opportunity, by placing this 
matter in its true light, to do that justice to the integrity and 
good faith of the State, which they will undoubtedly merit.

Philadelphia, November 26th, 1782. 

Sir, 
I have the pleasure of transmitting a resolution of Con- 
gress, by which you are appointed a Commissioner for ad- 
justing their accounts in Europe. I flatter myself, that this 
fresh mark of their confidence in you will be highly ac- 
ceptable, and that you will take the earliest opportunity to 
enter upon the task assigned you, since not only the inter- 
est, but the honor of the United States, has greatly suffered 
by the delay, which this necessary business has heretofore 
experienced. 

I am, Dear Sir, he.

Sir,

been pleased to honor me, enclosing the resolution of Con- 
gress of the 12th instant, renewing my appointment as one 
of their Ministers Plenipotentiary for negotiating a peace, 
vol. xi. 36 



282 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON 

and beg leave through you to return my sincere thanks to 
that august body, for the confidence they are pleased to 
repose in me, and to tender the same to yourself for the 
obliging manner in which you have notified it. 

I will employ in this arduous charge, with diligence and 
integrity, the best of my poor talents, which I am conscious 
are far short of what it requires. This I hope will ensure 
to me from Congress a kind construction of all my transac- 
tions ; and it gives me no small pleasure, that my commu- 
nications will pass through the hands of a gentleman, with 
whom I have acted in the earlier stages of this contest, and 
whose discernment and candor 1 had the good fortune then 
to approve and esteem. 

Your letter finds me at a distance from home, attending 
on my family under inoculation. This will add to the de- 
lay which the arrangement of my particular affairs would 
necessarily occasion. I shall lose no moment, however, in 
preparing for my departure, and shall hope to pay my 
respects to Congress and to yourself some time between 
the 20th and the last of December. 
I have the honor to be, he. 

THOMAS JEFFERSON. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, December 2d, 1782. 
Sir, 

Having lately been informed, that the business of the 
Court of Chancery in the State of New York has increased 
so much as to demand more of my attention than is con- 
sistent with the duties of the place, which I have the honor 
to hold under the United States, I must pray your Excel- 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 283 

lency to lay before Congress my request to be permitted 
to resign the latter, and to assure them at the same time, 
of the grateful sense which I shall always retain, not only 
of the honor done me by the appointment, but of those dis- 
tinguished marks of confidence, which they have repeatedly 
shown me in the execution of my trust. 

That the business of this office may sustain no injury by 
my resignation, I shall, if Congress approve, continue to 
perform its duties till they shall be pleased to appoint a 
gentleman to succeed me, or direct some other mode for 
carrying it on, in confidence that they will make their ar- 
rangements as early as is consistent with the deliberation 
they may conceive them to require. 

I take the liberty to recommend to the protection of 
Congress, and the gentleman who is to succeed me, Mr 
Morris and M. Duponceau, my secretaries, having the 
greatest reason to confide in their fidelity and attention to 
the business intrusted to their care. The Reverend Mr 
Tetard, who is likewise employed in the office, has some 
claim to their attention ; he rendered essential services to 
our army in Canada, suffered many personal inconve- 
niences there, and finds himself reduced, at an advanced 
age, to absolute ruin by the enemy and our own army, both 
having contributed to lay waste his farm, destroy his build- 
ings, and pillage his property. For these facts, I take the 
liberty to refer Congress to his Memorial. 

As Congress in making a new appointment will probably 
wish to adapt the salary to the necessary expense of the 
department, of which they have heretofore had no oppor- 
tunity to be fully informed, it is a duty I owe to them, as 
well as to my successor, to assure them that my expenses, 
exclusive of purchase and wear, carriages, horses, and 



284 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

household furniture, have exceeded my allowance from 
Congress, upwards of three thousand dollars. As I have 
now no personal interest in mentioning this circumstance, 
Congress will, I am persuaded, attribute the liberty I have 
taken, to my desire of seeing a department, in which I 
have had the honor to preside, supported with dignity. 

Be pleased, Sir, to receive my thanks for your personal 
attention, and believe me to be, with the most respectful 
attachment and esteem, &.c. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



TO RICHARD HARRISON. 

Philadelphia, December 5th, 1782. 
Dear Sir, 

I have this moment learned that a vessel will sail for Ca- 
diz in an hour's time. I beg to recommend to your par- 
ticular care the letter for Mr Carmichael, which the captain 
will deliver to you. It contains a cypher, and must not 
therefore pass through the post office. 

Congress, as yet, have done nothing in your affair, 
though it has been particularly recommended to them, and 
now lies before them. One obstruction is the difficulty of 
appointing Consuls, till some treaty or convention between 
us and Spain shall authorise it. 

The season of the year admits of no military operations 
here ; and the packet of newspapers sent herewith, will 
give you the current news. You will find by them, that 
we are still in suspense with respect to the fate of Charles- 
ton, though it is generally believed, that it cannot be long 
ere the evacuation will be completed. The French fleet 
are still at Boston, though prepared to sail. Nothing 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 285 

astonishes us more, than the effrontery of the British pub- 
lications, which affirm boldly, that great tumults have 
been excited in the Eastern States, on account of their re- 
luctance to the war, when there is not the slightest founda- 
tion in fact for such an assertion. This I suppose, is cal- 
culated to give a momentary popularity to Lord Shelburne. 

I am, Sir, &tc. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Office of Foreign Affairs, December 9th, 1782. 

Sir, 
I have the honor to inform Congress, that the Minister 
Plenipotentiary of France communicated to me the con- 
tents of a letter, received on Saturday from Count de Ro- 
chambeau, by which he was apprized, that the Count, in 
pursuance of his instructions, had ordered the troops under 
his command to embark, and that they were to proceed 
with the fleet to the Islands. 

The legion, and a detachment of about six hundred 
men, together with the convalescents are to remain on the 
continent. The whole may amount to about sixteen hun- 
dred men. The Minister further informed me, that in 
consequence of his representations on the subject, he had 
received assurances, that such a force should be detached 
from the West Indies, as would be adequate to the pro- 
tection of the trade upon this coast during the winter. 

The enclosed extract of a letter from Boston, contains 
an account of the success of the British in relieving Gib- 
raltar. Though it is not official it is to be feared it is too 
well founded. 

I have the honor to be, &c. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



286 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

TO THE PRESIDENT OP CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, December 16th, 1782. 
Sir, 

I have the honor to enclose for the inspection of Con- 
gress a short letter from Mr Jay, which contains important 
information, and explains some passages in Dr Franklin's 
letters. Unless the commission given to Mr Fitzherbert 
on the 24th of July is revoked, it will be difficult to ac- 
count for Mr Oswald's being appointed to treat with the 
Thirteen United States, unless we suppose, either that his 
powers are more limited, or that the British Administration 
design to treat under the mediation of some neutral Prince, 
upon the plan proposed by the Imperial Courts, so as that 
the negotiations with America may be distinct from those 
with the other belligerent powers. 

Just as I was closing this, a private letter from Mr Jay 
was delivered of the 4th of September, which contains the 
following remarkable passage. "I am preparing a map to 
show you the line, which Count d'Aranda proposes for 
our western boundary. It will not be finished in time for 
this conveyance. I am persuaded it is best for us to take 
time. My further reasons shall be explained at large in 
a future letter, which I shall begin as soon as my health 
will permit." He adds, "that Spain has issued more bills, 
and that the depreciation has increased. 5 ' I delay report- 
ing on the passage in Dr Franklin's letter, relative to the 
demands of Spain, as there is no immediate opportunity 
of writing to Europe, and as I am in hourly expectation of 
receiving something more particular on this subject. 
I have the honor to be, &c.

, 1782. 5 



Dear Sir, 

The Southern States, so long oppressed by the weight 
of a destructive war, are now happily relieved by the evac- 
uation of Charleston, and the total departure of the Brit- 
ish troops from this country. This event, so very impor- 
tant to all America, took place on the 14th instant. 

The fleet, with the troops on board, fell down into Re- 
bellion Road, and on the 17th crossed the bar and went 
out to sea. The British regiments are said to be destined 
for the West Indies, and the German troops for New York. 
They took with them a great deal of property, and between 
five and six thousand negroes, the greater part of which 
they had once promised to deliver up. 

Governor Matthews, with all the officers of government 

are now in town ; and civil police fully established and 

supported. 

I am, &z.c. 

NATHANIEL GREENE. 



TO THE COMMITTEE OF CONGRESS APPOINTED TO 
REPAIR TO RHODE ISLAND. 

Philadelphia, December 20th, 1782. 
Gentlemen, 

I can only reply to your inquiries with respect to the 
probability of extending our loans in France, by informing 
you, that the general tenor of our public despatches dis- 
courages the idea, as will appear by the extracts of letters 
herewith sent you. To them I have added such official 



288 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

communications as I have received from time to time from 
the Minister of France. 

I might add to these the result of several private con- 
versations with him upon that subject, having frequently 
introduced it, to know how far we might in case of 
extreme necessity lean on France. He has always ex- 
pressed on these occasions a strong sense of our wants, 
and a wish to relieve them, accompanied with an appre- 
hension, that the heavy expense incurred by France, in 
creating and supporting a large marine, would render it 
highly imprudent to expect, that she should add anything 
to the liberal supplies already afforded us, and the main- 
tenance of an army in America on our account. Of late, 
too, the unproductiveness of our taxes, and the uneasiness 
of the public creditors in the United States, has not escaped 
his observation. His reflections on this subject are so 
obvious, that I need not repeat them. I am seriously 
alarmed for their effect on the loans we have already 
opened. A private letter from Mr Jay informs me, that 
the paper struck by Spain has greatly depreciated, so that 
had we needed any further assurances on that head, we 
must now be fully convinced, that we have nothing to ex- 
pect from that quarter. 

I have the honor to be, &c. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, December 22d, 1782. 

Sir, 
I have just received my despatches, which consist of 
duplicates from Dr Franklin and the enclosed, which have 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 289 

not yet been submitted to Congress, together with a copy 
of Mr Oswald's commission. 

Mr Jay has also written, but his letter is not yet decy- 
phered. A private letter from the Marquis de Lafayette 
to me, (the whole of which is not yet decyphered) contains 
much the same account of our negotiations, with that given 
by Dr Franklin, and the following passage from a letter of 
Mr Adams to him of the 29th of September ; 

"We have at length the consent of the Cities, States, 
and Provinces, and have adjusted and agreed upon every 
article, word, syllable, letter, and point, in the treaty of 
commerce, and clerks are employed in making out fair 
copies for signature, which will be done this week." 

By a paper of the 22d of October, I find the treaty was 
signed by seven deputies, one for each Province, and by 
Mr Adams on the 4th of October. 

The Marquis also mentions, that several accounts, but 
none official, say, that Madras has been taken by the 
French troops, that landed at Port Novo, in conjunction 
with those of Hyder Ally. He adds, that though this 
account is believed, yet it is not confirmed. 

I have the honor to be, with great respect, &c. 
ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



GOVERNOR MARTIN TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

North Carolina, December 23d, 1782. 
Sir, 

I am favored with your two letters of the 12th and 1 5th 
of September last, and your circular, in which you an- 
nounce the acknowledgment of the independence of the 
United States by the States of Holland ; an event that will 
vol. xi. 37 



290 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON, 

greatly add to the national importance of America, not 
only in the councils of Europe, but through the world. 

The resolution of Congress respecting damages, which 
the inhabitants of this State have received from the British 
enemy, I cannot carry into effect until I have an Act of 
Assembly for this purpose, to point out the particular 
mode in obtaining the same ; the account of which, as 
soon as it can be procured from the different parts of the 
State, shall be transmitted to you, without loss of time. 
I have the honor to be, &.c. 

ALEXANDER MARTIN. 



CIRCULAR TO THE GOVERNORS OF THE STATLa. 

Philadelphia, December 23d, 1782. 
Sir, 

The steps that may lead to so important an event as 
peace upon safe and honorable terms, are too interesting 
to be withheld from you ; I have the honor, therefore, to 
enclose a copy of Mr Oswald's commission to treat with 
the Thirteen United States of America, which will cer- 
tainly smooth the way to it, though the variety of interests 
to be adjusted at a general Congress (and, perhaps, too, 
the success of the British arms at Gibraltar) may place it 
further off than our wishes would otherwise lead us to 
imagine. 

Your Excellency will see the propriety of not suffering 
copies of this commission to be taken for the press, and 
of accompanying the communication you may think proper 
to make of it, with such recommendations to exertion and 
vigilance, as prudence and the critical state of our affairs 
may require, since on a review of the conduct of the en- 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 291 

emy, it will not appear extravagant to suppose, that this 
may be another of those artifices so often practised to 
deceive and put us off our guard. Though we have no 
official accounts, yet we have every reason to believe, that 
the treaty of commerce with the United Provinces was 
signed on the 7th of October. 
I have the honor to be, &c. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



TO WILLIAM GREENE, GOVERNOR OF RHODE ISLAND. 

Philadelphia, January 4th, 1783. 
Sir, 

Agreeably to the order of Congress, I have the honor 
to lay before your Excellency the enclosed copy of a mo- 
tion made by Mr Howel, and the resolutions of Congress 
thereon, together with the state of the applications for 
foreign loans, and the results thereof. 

Without troubling your Excellency with those inconsid- 
erable and secret aids, which we received at the begin- 
ning of the controversy, I shall take the applications and 
the grants, that were made in the year one thousand seven 
hundred and seventynine, and since. To begin with 

Spain. 

The 9th of September, 1779, Congress proposed to 
obtain a subsidy from Spain during the continuance of the 
war, which they offered to purchase by a very important 
cession. Spain having hitherto declined an alliance with 
the United States, no such subsidiary treaty took place. 

In the same month Mr Jay was instructed to borrow 
five millions of dollars. After long and continued solicita- 



292 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

tions, he obtained one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, 
and was compelled to protest bills of exchange drawn upon 
him by Congress, on the presumption, that Spain would 
certainly enable him to redeem them. This protest, which 
was made on the 16th of March last, was as follows ; 

"Mr Jay says, that when he accepted the bills hereunto 
annexed, he had good reason to expect to be supplied 
with funds necessary to pay them ; that he has been dis- 
appointed in the expectation he was encouraged to enter- 
tain on this subject, and that his endeavors to obtain 
money, both here and elsewhere, have been unsuccessful, 
although the bills which remain to be paid by him, together 
with his other engagements, do not exceed twentyfive thou- 
sand pounds sterling, but these disappointments being un- 
expected, he cannot for want of time have recourse to 
Congress, and therefore finds himself reduced to the mor- 
tifying necessity of permitting them to be protested." 
These bills were redeemed after the protest, by money 
borrowed in France. I have reason to believe, that no 
money has since been obtained on account of the United 
States in Spain ; so that the app'ication for five millions 
of dollars has only been answered by the grant of one hun- 
dred and fifty thousand dollars. 

Portugal. 

On the 11 til of January, 1782, Mr Jay was directed, in 
conjunction with the Superintendent of Finance, to under- 
take a loan in Spain or Portugal, without limiting the 
amount of such loan. And Mr Jay was directed to send 
Mr Carmichael to aid their endeavors. This power was 
restricted by a subsequent resolution, directing Mr Jay not 
to send Mr Carmichael, unless he had some prospect of 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 293 

succeeding. Not having sent him, it is to be presumed 
he had no prospect of succeeding. 

Holland. 

On the 26th of October, 1779, Mr Laurens, having 
been appointed a commissioner for that purpose, was 
directed to borrow a sum not exceeding ten millions 
of dollars. Mr Laurens having been captured, his 
place was supplied by Mr Adams, who had similar 
powers and instructions. He made several attempts 
to open a loan, but with so little success, that he never 
has transmitted an account of the amount, but has since 
informed me, that he had applied it in part of payment 
for a house purchased at the Hague. His salary has 
hitherto been paid by money drawn from France. 
A loan, however, has been opened with success in 
Holland on our account by his Most Christian Ma- 
jesty, and under his special guarantee for ten millions 
oflivres. Mr Adams informs Congress by a letter 
dated the 5th of July last, that he also has opened a 
loan in Holland on account of the United Slates for 
five millions of florins, but adds, that he does not 
expect to obtain that sum for a long time, that if he 
gets a million and a half by Christmas, it will be more 
than he expects. 

In a letter of the ISth of August, the last I have 
received from Mr Adams, he says, that "when he re- 
ceives the ratification of his treaty for a loan, there 
will be thirteen or fourteen hundred thousand guilders 
to be paid to the orders of Congress." This is con- 
firmed by a letter to the Marquis de Lafayette, of 
which he sends me an extract. 



294 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

As that ratification must have been received long 
since, we may set^he loans actually made in Holland 
on our credit, at 

Three millions of livres, 3,000,000 

Those made under the guarantee and on 

the credit of France, at 10,000,000 



Ten millions of livres, 13,000,000 

Our further prospects of borrowing arc too uncertain 
to be stated. As this is a private loan it is reasonable 
to suppose, that the clamors of the public creditors 
here, when heard in Holland, will have some effect 
upon our credit there. 

France. 

In France various applications were made, and sev- 
eral grants obtained previous to'the year 1779, though 
they are not clearly stated, from the irregular manner 
in which the books of the Secret Committee, and the 
Committee of Foreign Affairs were formerly kept. It 
appears, that the whole sum obtained from France pre- 
vious to the year 1780, exclusive of one million ob- 
tained on a contract for tobacco with the Farmers- 
General amounted to nine millions of livres. In 
November, 17S0, Congress applied to the Court of 
France for an aid of twentyfive millions of livres in 
money, exclusive of a considerable supply of arms, 
ammunition, and military stores, which they declared 
would fall short of their wants for the ensuing year 
without the greatest internal exertion. 

They sent Mr Laurens as a Minister on this special 
occasion, and in this year and the year 17S1, Congress 
received fourteen millions of livres, including the 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 295 

goods and military stores, without counting the loan 
opened for the United States in Holland, of which 
mention is made before. 

But as this sum fell very far short of our wants, Dr 
Franklin was instructed on the 8th of February, 1732, 
to borrow twelve millions of livres. In answer to 
which, that Minister, writing to me on the 25th of 
June, after acknowledging the receipt of my letters, 
one of which was written on the subject of the above 
instruction, says, "the second (the second letter) en- 
forces some resolutions of Congress sent me with it 
respecting a loan of twelve millions of livres to be 
demanded of France for the current year. I had al- 
ready received the promise of six millions, together 
with the clearest and most positive assurances, that it 
was all the King could spare us, that we must not 
expect more, that if drafts and demands came upon me 
beyond that sum, it behooved me to take care how I 
accepted them, or where I should find funds for the 
payment, since I could certainly not be further assisted 
out of the royal treasury. Under this declaration, 
with what face could I ask for another six millions? 
It would be saying, 'you are not to be believed, you 
can spare more, you are able to lend me twice the 
sum, if you were but willing.' If you read my letter 
to Mr Morris of this date, I think you will be con- 
vinced how improper any language capable of such a 
construction would be to such a friend. " 

On the 14th of September Congress were pleased to 
direct that four millions of dollars be borrowed in 
Europe, exclusive of the loan negotiating in Holland. 
A copy of which resolution is directed to be commu- 



296 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

nicated to his Most Christian Majesty, with directions 
to Dr Franklin to assure his Majesty of the high sense 
the United States in Congress entertain of his friend- 
ship and generous exertions, their reliance on a con- 
tinuance of them, and the necessity of applying on the 
present occasion to him. And on the 23d of Septem- 
ber Congress resolved further, in answer to the above 
letter from Dr Franklin, and one of a similar nature to 
the Superintendent of Finance of the same date, that, 
notwithstanding the information contained in those 
letters, it is the direction o£ Congress, that he use his 
utmost endeavors to effect the loan, which, by the re- 
solve of the 14th instant is to be negotiated. 

I should observe that in the above statement of the 
grants made to the United States, I have not distin- 
guished between loans and gifts, but included both in 
the gross sums above mentioned, though about eight 
millions of that granted by France has been given, 
without any expectation of being repaid. 

It is unnecessary to draw those inferences from the 
above facts, which they naturally suggest. They can- 
not escape your Excellency's observation. I can only 
wish, that the low state of our credit abroad may 
excite us to such internal exertions as must be its best 
support. Those only can borrow with dignity, who 
give unequivocal proofs of the design to repay their 
debts with honor. 

I have the honor to be, &c. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 297 

THOMAS JEFFERSON TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

Baltimore, February 7th, 1783. 
Sir, 
- I arrived here on the 30th of last month, and had a 
short interview the same evening with the Chevalier 
de Villc Brune, commander of the Romulus. There 
appeared at that time little apprehension, but that we 
might sail within a few days, but we were not very 
particular in our conference, as we expected so soon 
to see each other again ; the severity of the cold, 
however, which commenced that night, obliged the 
Chevalier de Ville Brune to fall twelve miles below 
this place, and excluded all correspondence with him 
till yesterday, when I found means to get through the 
ice on board his ship. He then communicated to me, 
by direction of his Excellency the Minister of France, 
intelligence as to the number and force of the cruisers 
now actually watching the Capes of the Chesapeake. 

I must acknowledge, that these appear such as to 
render a capture certain were we to hazard it. The 
Minister was pleased at the same time to submit the 
Guadeloupe to my wishes, if I chose to adventure. I 
take the liberty of troubling you with a copy of my 
letter to him on that subject. 

I should certainly be disposed to run very consid- 
erable risks myself to effect my passage, but I should 
think it an unfortunate introduction to an ally, who 
has already done so much for us, were I to add to his 
losses and disbursements, that of a valuable ship and 
crew. I wish that the present delay offered some 
period less distant than the lassitude of an avaricious 
vol. xi. 38 



293 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

enemy to watch for prey. Perhaps you may be able 
to put me on some more expeditious mode of passage 
than the one under which I am acquiescing at present. 
I shall be much pleased to adopt any such, which may 
come recommended from you, without regard to per- 
sonal risk or trouble. In the meantime, any intelli- 
gence which you can be able to collect, and will be 
pleased to give me as to the state of our coast, will be 
of utility in determining whether and when we shall 
depart hence. 

I have tbe honor to be, &c. 

THOMAS JEFFERSON. 



THOMAS JEFFERSON TO Bf. DE LA LUZERNE. 

Baltimore, February 7th, 1783. 
Sir, 

The Chevalier de Ville Brune was so kind as to 
communicate to me your Excellency's letter to him of 
January, together with the intelligence therein refer- 
red to. I feel myself bound to return you my thanks 
for your orders to the Gaudeloupe frigate to receive 
me. If I should think a passage should be hazarded 
under present circumstances, according to this infor- 
mation, (which is the most worthy of credit of any 
we have received here,) it would seem, that our cap- 
ture would be unavoidable were we to go out now. 
This then is a risk, to which I cannot think of ex- 
posing his Majesty's vessel and subjects, however I 
might be disposed to encounter personal hazards, from 
my anxiety to execute with all the promptitude in my 
power a service, which has been assigned to me. I 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 299 

shall, Iherefore, wait wilh patience the arrival of the 
moment, when the Chevalier de Ville Brune shall be 
of opinion, that the one or the other of the vessels 
may venture out without any greater risk, than he 
shall think proportioned to her proper object, inde- 
pendently of mine. 

It has been suggested to me this evening, that per- 
haps their safe departure might be greatly forwarded 
by their falling down to York or Hampton, there to 
be ready at a moment's warning, to avail themselves 
of those favorable circumstances, which the present 
season sometimes offers, but of this yourself will be 
the proper judge. 

I cannot close my letter without expressing to you 
my obligations to the Chevalier de Ville Brune for the 
particular attention he has shown to my accommoda- 
tion on board his ship. The apartments he has had 
constructed for me are ample and commodious, and 
his politeness and merit as an officer are an agreeable 
presage of everything, which shall depend on him. 

I have the honor to be, with the highest sentiments 
of esteem, &c. 

THOMAS JEFFERSON. 



TO GENERAL GREENE. 

Philadelphia, February 14th, 1783. 

Dear Sir, 

Receive my congratulations on the important event, 

you have announced in your favor by Major Burnet. 

The influence that the evacuation of Charleston will 

have on our affairs if the war continues is obvious. 



300 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON 

The southern States, by this means relieved from 
their burdens, will be capable of contributing largely 
to the general cause, and I doubt not when they have 
breathed a little, that they will be as willing as they 
are able. I feel, Sir, a personal interest in this great 
event from the distinguished honor it reflects upon 
you. In every other department our expectations 
have gone beyond our means of satisfying them. You 
have afforded the first instance of the contrary, and by 
creating the means have exceeded our most sanguine 
expectations. 

We have the highest reason to conclude, that the 
preliminaries of a peace are signed before this. I 
have reason to hope that the terms of peace will com- 
prize most of the great objects we have in view, and 
in some points almost exceed our expectations. The 
present policy of Britain is to make sacrifices to the 
Manes of the affection, which once subsisted between 
her and us. I have just put the last hand to our treaty 
of amity and commerce with the United Provinces by 
signing the ratification, which Congress have directed. 
I congratulate you upon this event, which adds not a 
little to our political importance. 

I have the honor to be, &c. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Philadelphia, February 14th, 1783. 

Sir, 
I have delayed answering your favor of the 7th instant, 
till I could obtain the sense of Congress on the matter it 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 301 

contains. I conceive it hardly possible, while the British 
cruisers retain their present station, for you to elude their 
vigilance, in either of the ships offered to your choice. 
This, concurring with the late advices from England, has 
induced Congress to pass the enclosed resolution. We 
have reason to conjecture that peace is already concluded, 
whether it is or not, a few days must determine. 

I transmit you the speech of His Britannic Majesty, 
which, with what you already know of the state of our 
negotiations, will enable you to form your opinion on the 
same ground that we do. 

I have the honor to be, &ic. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



TO THOMAS JEFFERSON. 

Philadelphia, February 18th, 1783. 
Sir, 
I was honored yesterday with your favor of the 14th, 
which I shall lay before Congress this morning. As you 
have by this time received their resolution, which I had the 
honor to send you by the last post, and again enclose, you 
will be relieved in some measure from your embarrassments, 
though not entirely from your suspense with respect to their 
final determination. But that cannot be long doubtful, 
since the negotiations have certainly arrived at such a crisis, 
as either to terminate soon in a peace, or a total rupture. 
In the latter case, you will necessarily be obliged to proceed 
on your voyage, as Congress seem anxious to avail them- 
selves of your abilities and information in the negotiations; 
unless they are fully assured that a speedy peace will pre- 
clude them from that advantage. 



302 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

I enclose a paper, which contains all that we have yet 
received on this interesting subject. It may, perhaps, be 
difficult to account for our Ministers having signed before 
those of Fiance. But if this letter is genuine, it serves, 
when compared with their instructions, to prove that the 
terms are acceptable to us, and not disagreeable to Fiance. 
I have the honor to be, Sir, he. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Office of Foreign Affairs, February 18th, 1783. 
Sir, 

I have the honor to lay before Congress, the enclosed 
letter from Mr Jefferson, upon which I presume they will 
not think it necessary at present to take any other resolution 
than that already transmitted to him. I also enclose an ex- 
tract from a letter of Mr William Lee to me, dated the 31st 
of March last, which merits attention, though, in the present 
state of our affair?, Congress may not think it advisable to 
pass any resolutions thereon, till they are more perfectly 
acquainted with the actual state of our affairs in Europe, 
and what alterations may be occasioned by a peace. 

I have lelters from Messrs De Neufville of the 27th 
of September and 24th of October ; but as they contain 
little more than a pressing request to have their accounts 
settled, and the balance paid, I shall not trouble Congress 
with them, but deliver copies to the Superintendent of 
Finance. 

I have the honor to be, Sir, he. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 303 

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, February 2Gth, 1783. 
Sir, 

I have the honor to lay before Congress a letter received 

yesterday from Mr Dana. I must confess, I am at a loss 

to discover any reason for detaining that gentleman longer 

at a Court, where it is, as he justly observes, improbable 

that he can be publicly acknowledged till Britain has no 

longer any objections to such acknowledgment. After 

which a treaty can be concluded, if necessary, here or at 

the Hague ; a commission for that purpose being sent to 

Mr Adams, with as much ease as at Petersburg. Congress 

will then judge whether it will be proper to have a Minister 

at the Court of St Petersburg, or whether a Resident, with 

consular powers, will not answer all their purposes, and 

save expense. 

The desire which Mr Dana expresses to return, takes 
from me the delicacy I before felt in staling this matter so 
fully to Congress. I also enclose, in obedience to the 
commands of Congress, a list of the names, titles, salaries, 
and places of residence, of the officers of the United States, 
employed in the Department of Foreign Affairs. 

I take the liberty to remind Congress that a variety of 
matters, which have been submitted by me, remain yet not 
acted upon ; and that the business of the office is very 
much obstructed as well by this delay, as by the detention 
of the letters and papers which refer to them. As this has 
probably been occasioned by a change in the Committees, 
I humbly submit to Congress the propriety of directing 
them to be fdled up. 

I have the honor to be, Sir, he. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



304 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Philadelphia, February 26th, 1783. 
Dear Sir, 

In compliai.ce with the directions of Congress, contained 
in the enclosed resolution, I have the honor to inform your 
Excellency, that our last despatches, dated in October, 
announce a disposition in the belligerent powers to terminate 
the war by a general peace. The Court of London, whose 
sincerity was most suspected, because it was to make the 
greatest sacrifices, appears to have smoothed the way by 
the commission to Mr Oswald (which your Excellency has 
seen,) empowering him to treat with the Thirteen United 
States of America; M. de Rayneval (brother to M.Gerard) 
having been sent from France to sound the intentions of 
the British Ministry, returned perfectly satisfied of their 
sincerity. 

A little before our despatches were closed, our Ministers 
had delivered their propositions to the Court of London. 
They consisted of three general heads, which comprised 
our right to the fisheries, the extent of our territories, and 
commercial objects. Though these propositions contained 
all we could ask under each of these heads, yet Mr Oswald 
gave our Ministers reason to conclude, that they would be 
granted ; which I am inclined to believe they have been, 
in their fullest extent, from the lead which our Ministers 
have taken in signing Provisional Articles. France, Spain, 
and Holland, had made their proposals ; so that the King 
of Great Britain was perfectly apprized of their demands 
before he met his Parliament ; there is little room, there- 
fore, to doubt, when these facts are compared with the 
speech of His Britannic Majesty, that unless some unfore- 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 305 

seen event should arise, a general peace will be concluded 
before the opening of the next campaign. 

I was honored with your letter of the 18th, and have 
delivered the one enclosed to Mr Jefferson, who is detained 
by order of Congress, till they receive more certain ad- 
vices as to the issue of the negotiation. I should also 
acknowledge ihe receipt of your favor of the 8th of January, 
which I lound here on my return from the country. I 
think, with you, that the British administration will choose 
to lake the advice of Parliament on the terms of peace, 
before they agree to them. Yet they have gone every 
length with respect to us. In this, however, they are per- 
fectly safe, as the opposition have all along dictated that 
measure, so that on this quarter they are secured from 
their attack. More circumspection will he necessary in 
adjusting the articles with the oilier belligerent powers. 
To this cause, we may probably attribute the delays that 
this business still seems to struggle with. 

He pleased to accept my compliments, and those of my 
family, who join me in returning our best respects to Mrs 
Washington. 

1 have the honor to be, Dear Sir, &.c. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Philadelphia, March 12th, 1783. 

Dear Sir, 

The Washington packet arrived this morning. I have 
not yet had leisure to read all my letters, but as an express 
is ready to go early tomorrow, I rather choose to relv upon 
your goodness to excuse a letter written in extreme haste, 

vol. xi. 39 



306 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

than to hold myself inexcusable, by not informing you of 
what we yet know of the state of our negotiations. None 
of my letters is of a later date than the 25th of December. 
All difficulties had then been removed with respect to us, 
and the preliminaries were signed ; they consist of nine 
articles. 

The Jirst acknowledges our Independence. 

The second describes our boundaries, which are as ex- 
tensive as we could wish. 

The third ascertains our rights as to the fisherv. and 
puis them upon the same fooling that they were before the 
war. 

The fourth provides that all British debts shall be paid. 

The fifth and sixth are enclosed for your perusal, as 
they are likely to be the least satisfactory here. 

The seventh stipulates that hostilities shall immediately 
cease, and that the British troops be withdrawn without 
carrying off any property, or dismantling fortifications ; 
that records and archives shall be restored. 

The eighth stipulates that the navigation of the Missis- 
sippi shall be open to us and Great Britain. 

The ninth, that all conquests made in America after the 
ratification shall be restored. 

These preliminaries are only provisional upon the deter- 
mination of a peace with France, whose negotiations have 
not made such progress as ours. I believe they find them- 
selves very much embarrassed by the demands of their 
other allies. 

The Count de Vergennes, in a letter of the 25th of De- 
cember, says, "I cannot foresee the issue, for difficulties 
arise from the disposition we have shown to remove them. 
It would be well, Sir, to prepare Congress for every event. 
I do not despair ; I rather hope ; but all is yet uncertain." 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 307 

But, Sir, whatever the event of the negotiations may be, 
1 persuade myself the enemy will leave these States. Mr 
Oswald Ins made some propositions to our Ministers upon 
tliis subject, proposing that they might be permitted to em- 
bark without molestation, and endeavor to recover West 
Florida from the Spaniards. This last communication, 
(which you will consider as confidential,) I thought might 
be important to your Excellency. By attending to their 
conduct, you will be able to judge if they mean to pursue 
this system, or if it was only thrown out to deceive. 

I enclose also for your perusal, extracts from the ad- 
dresses, not having time to have them copied at large. 
They are mere echoes to the speech. Supplies were voted, 
without one dissenting voice. 

I must pray your Excellency to send on the enclosed 
packets ; any expense it occasions will be paid by the 
Governor. 

I have the honor to be, &ic. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



TO GENERAL GREENE. 

Philadelphia, March 12lh, 1783. 
Dear Sir, 

The arrival of the Washington packet affords me an op- 
portunity of sending you the preliminary articles, agreed 
upon between our Ministers and those of Great Britain. 
In every point but one they are unexceptionable ; in that 
one I believe our Ministers have labored to obtain all that 
circumstances would admit, and by the reference of the 
lories to their respective States, they have made a very 
slender provision for the restitution they stipulate. 



308 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON, 

What it imports you more to know is, that though our 
principal difficulties are removed, yet many remain to re- 
tard the peace. Our allies do not appear to have made 
much progress in their negotiations, and Count de Ver- 
gennes, in a letter of the 25th of December, speaks with 
great uncertainty of the issue of his negotiations ; yet not 
so as to destroy our hopes of a happy conclusion ; at all 
events, I believe that the war will be removed from us, and 
directed to other objects in the spring. 

The British commissioners have made some propositions 
to ours about a convention fur permitting the army to de- 
part in peace ; but as nothing was concluded, some doubts 
may still remain on this head ; though you will find in Lord 
North's speech, in the enclosed paper, a passage that seems 
to take the evacuation for granted. As, however, I have 
reason to suppose, that they do not mean to rest contented 
with the loss of West Florida, and are apparently collecting 
a force for its •.eduction at Augustine, 1 should think it pru- 
dent to maintain so respectable a force in Georg'a and 
South Carolina, as would discourage any attempts upon 
them in case the negotiations should prove abortive. 

A treaty is now on foot between Sweden and us. The 
commission to bis Swedish Majesty's Minister, contains an 
ample and an honorable recognition of our independence. 

The committee charged with the arrangements for the 
establishment of a Minister from the United Provinces at 
this place, have reported to the Slates of Holland on bis 
salary and appointments, so that the Diplomatic Corps here 
will shortly be increased. 

The general news of this place, as well as what relates 
particularly to the arrangements made and now making for 
the army, you will learu from Major Burnet, who does me 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 309 

the favor to be the bearer of this. It will not be necessary, 
therefore, to lengthen this further than to declare the sin- 
cere esteem and respect, with which I have the honor to 

be, Sir, &tc. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Office of Foreign Affairs, March 13th, 1783. 

I have the honor to lay before Congress the enclosed 
letter from Mr Jefferson, who is wailing at this place their 
determination. As Major Burnet is now in town, and will 
be the bearer of despatches to General Greene, I take the 
liberty to request the earliest attention of Congress to those 
parts of the despatches submitted to them, that induce a 
belief that the enemy will turn their arms against West 
Florida, which the force they now have at Augustine ren- 
ders probable. Congress may, perhaps, think it advisable 
to order that the force in the Southern States should be so 
respectable as to discourage a second attempt upon them 
in case the failure of the negotiation should occasion any 
change in the British Cabinet. 
1 have the honor to be, &ic. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Office of Foreign Affairs, March 18th, 1783. 
Sir, 

The important matter contained in the despatches lately 
received, renders me unwilling to reply to them without 



310 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

being well satisfied of the sentiments of Congress. Bur, as 
ihe subjects on which I wish to be informed, are of too 
delicate a nature to be rendered formal acts, I shall submit 
to them the drafts of my reply to the joint letter of our 
Ministers, now at Pan's. Previous to this, it will be neces- 
sary that Congress come to some express determination 
upon points which arise out of the treaty, and which, if they 
see in the same light that I do, they will consider as the 
most embarrassing, as well as the most important that can 
claim their attention. 

Congress have hitherto, in all the'r acts, both of a public 
and private nature, manifested the utmost confidence in the 
Court of France. In answer to every communication, they 
have reiterated their resolutions on that subject, and so 
lately as the 4th of October last, resolved unanimously, 
"That they will not enter into the discussion of any over- 
tures of pacification but in confidence and in concert with 
his Moot Christian Majesty ;" and directed that a copy of 
the above resolution should not only be furnished to the 
Minister of Fiance, but be sent to all the Ministers of the 
United States in Europe, and published to the world. Yet, 
Sir, it has unfortunately so happened, that the Ministers of 
these States have imagined they had sufficient grounds to 
sus >ect tie sincerity of the Court of France, and have not 
only thought it prudent to agree upon and sign preliminaries 
with Great Britain, without communicating them, till after 
the signature, to the Ministers of his Most Christian Majes- 
ty, but have permitted a separate article to be inserted in 
their treaty, which they still conceal from the Court of 
Fiance. 

This reduces Congress to the disagreeable necessity, 
either of making themselves parties io this concealment, 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 31 1 

and thereby to contradict all their former professions of 
confidence in their ally, made not only to that ally, but to 
their own citizens, and to every Court at which they had a 
Minister, or of revealing it at the expense of the confidence 
they would wish to maintain between their Ministers and 
the Court of Fiance, and that, too, when those Ministers 
have obtained such terms from the Court of London, as 
does great honor to them, and at least equals our highest 
expectations. 

I feci the more pain on this subject, because, from the 
manner in which this treaty is drawn, as well as from the 
article itself, I am inclined to believe that England i.ad no 
other view in its insertion, but to be enabled to produce it as 
a mark of the confidence we reposed in them, and to detach 
us from our ally, if the nation could be brought to continue 
the war. 

The preamble, drawn by our Ministers, contained pro- 
fessions of attachment to the alliance, and declared that 
the treaty should not be obligatory till His Britannic Majesty 
shall have agreed to accept the terms of a peace between 
France and Britain, proposed or accepted by his Most 
Christian Majesty, and shall be ready to conclude with him 
such treaty. The preamble, agreed to, and, as there is 
reason to conclude, framed in England, is so expressed as 
to render it very doubtful whether our treaty does not take 
place the moment France and England have agreed on the 
terms of their treaty, though France should refuse to sign 
till her allies were satisfied. This construction is strongly 
supported in the House of Commons by the administration. 
The separate article is in itself an object of no moment; 
the territory it cedes is of little importance, and if, as out- 
Ministers assert, it made a part of West Florida previous 



312 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

to the war, it will, on the pence, be annexed to the nation 
that slmll retain that Colony; but it is extremely well cal- 
culated to sow the seeds of distrust and jealousy between 
the United States and their allies. It demonsti ates a 
marked preference for the English over the present pos- 
sessors, and seems to invite Britain to reconquer it. 
Though thij may promote our particular interest, it never 
can consist wi h our honor to prefer an open enemy to a 
nation engaged in the same cause with us, and closely con- 
nected to our al ! y. This article woidd, in my opinion, if 
avowed by the United States, fully justify Spsiu in making 
a separate peace without the least regard to our interest. 

But this, Sir, is an inconsiderable evil, compaied with 
those which may result from its having been concealed 
from the Court of Versailles. Mr Laurens informs Con- 
gress (and that too from letters of a late date from London,) 
"tJitftfhe people of England still retain the idea of our late 
Colonies and of reconciliation ; that Government gives 
every possible encouragement to this humor; that it has 
been their incessant endeavor to detach us from our ally, 
anil that it i> given out in London, that, by signing the 
late preliminaries, they have out-manceuvred the Court of 
France; that every engine had been set at work; that 
every degree of craft, under the mask of returning affec- 
tion, will be practised for creating jealousies between the 
States a::d their good and great ally." Mr Adams's letters 
of November, speak the same language. If, Sir, we sup- 
pose these gentlemen to have been Well informed, bow 
much reason have we to apprehend that this secret article 
will prove in the hands of Britain a most dangerous engine. 
They may reveal to the Court of France the jealousies 
our Ministers entertain, the confidence they repose in them. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE 313 

with such falsehoods and additions as will best serve their 
purposes, and, by producing this secret article, gain credit 
for all they advance. This line they certainly pursued with 
respect to France, revealing all that they learnt from the 
Count de Vergennes, relative to his opinion of the first 
commission ; nor is there room to doubt, that Marbois' 
letter was received through the same channel. And there 
is no reason to believe, if (as our Ministers suppose) the 
Court of France had put themselves more in their power, 
that they would neglect such promising means of increasing 
the suspicions our Plenipotentiaries already entertained. 

Add to this, that this article may be used in Parliament, 
and with the British nation at large, as a most powerful 
argument for continuing the war, adducing, from the resent- 
ment it discovers to Spain, and the distrnsis it manifests of 
France, that the quadruple knot is untied. 

But suppose, what may possibly be the ease, that the 
British administration are sincere, how is the honor c\\id 
good faith of the United States to be justified to their allies, 
and to the world, if by any of those causes which daily 
operate, this secret, which is now known to sixty or seventy 
people, should be discovered ? To tell the world that we 
suspected France, will not suffice, unless we can show- 
probable grounds for such suspicion. Our Ministers inform 
us, that when they communicated the articles of the treaty 
to Count de Vergennes, " ; he appeared surprised, but not 
displeased at their being so favorable lo us." Mr Laurens 
declares expressly, l; That, he sees no cause for entertaining 
more particular jealousy, than ought to be kept up against 
evety negotiating Court in the world, and not hall so much 
as should at this moment he upon the watch against every 
motion arising from our new half fr eiv 

VOL. XI. 40 



314 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

I confess, Sir, though my sentiments ore of little moment 

thai I am fully of this opinion, and that 1 tremble lest we 

should ;;t this hour he on the edge of a precipice, the more 

dangerous, as we have fixed our eyes on the fluttering 

prospect which lies beyond it. 3 am persuaded th. t the 

old maxim, " Honesty is the best policy," applies with as 

much force to Slates as to individuals. In that persuasion, 

I venture humbly to recommend, that such measures be 

adopted as to manifest, that repeated professions of fidelity 

to their engagements, and confidence in their ally, may not 

appear in have been made by Congress to mask deceit. 

The caution, which negotiations require, and the lijit in 

which objects have appeared to our Ministers, may justify 

them, and perhaps entitle them to credit for attempting to 

serve us at every personal hazard. 

But, Sir, it certainly cannot consist with the honor of 
these States, upon such slight grounds, to contradict their 
own resolutions, and forfeit the confidence of an ally, to 
whom it has been so much indebted, and whose aid it is at 
this moment supplicating for the means of carrying on 
another campaign. 

Under these impressions, I humbly submit these resolu- 
tion', namely ; 

'• That the Secretary of Foreign Affiirs be directed to 
communicate the Separate Article in the Provisional Pre- 
liminary Treaty with Great Britain, to the Minister of his 
Most Christian Majesty, in such manner as will best tend 
to remove any nnlavorablc impression it may make on the 
Court of France, of the sincerity of these Slates or their 
Ministers. 

"That the Ministers for negotiating be informed of 
this communication, and of the reasons which influenced 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPO.XDE.NXE. 3|5 

Congress to make it. Tint they i>e instructed to agree, 
tliai in whatever hands West Florida may remain at tlie 
conclusion of the war, the United States will he satisfied 
that the line of Northern boundary be as described in the 
said separate articles. 

" Thai it is the «ense of the United Slates in Congress, 
that the articles agreed upon between the .Ministers of these 
Slates, and those oi his Britannic Majesty, are not to take 
place until :: peace shall have been arm illy signed between 
tboir .Most Christian and British Majesties." 

Congress will easily believe, that I offer these sentiments 
with the utmost diffidence ; that I see many and powerful 
arguments that militate against litem ; that I feel extreme 
pain in advising a measure, which may hurt the feelings of 
Ministers, to whom we are indebted for their continued 
zeal and assiduity, all of whom 1 respect, and with one of 
whom I have had the closest and most intimate friendship 
from our earliest youth. But, Sir, it is a duty that my 
office requires; and I am h-mpy in reflecting that this duly 
is discharged, when I have proposed what 1 think right, 
and that the better judgment of Congress is to determine.* 

1 have the honor to be, Sir, ike,

Sir, 

Congress a few days since directed me to transmit 
to your Kxcellcncy a copy of the provisional treaty

for a peace between the United States and Great Brit- 
ain. I should have done it at an earlier day without 
any particular direction, had not an order passed in 
Congress for furnishing the Delegates of each State 
with a copy, that it might be transmitted through 
them. In conformity to the second direction I have 
the honor to enclose a copy, though I have no doubt 
that I have been already anticipated by that forwarded 
by the Delegates of your State. Yet, Sir, this letter 
may not be entirely useless when it assures you that 
the conclusion of the treaty is still very uncertain. 
My public letters are of such a nature as not to free 
me from apprehensions that Britain still seeks rather 
to divide her enemies than to be reconciled to them. 
Though this suspicion may not perhaps be well 
founded, yet such conduct is so conformable to the 
general tenor of British Councils, that it is at least the 
part of prudence to be upon our guard against it. But 
whatsoever their intentions may be, the peace must 
still depend upon so many contingencies that no pre- 
paration for another campaign should be omitted on 
our part. None is neglected by our antagonists. 
They have voted one hundred and ten thousand sea- 
men for the ensuing year. France continues her pre- 
parations, and will not close the war till she can obtain 
honorable terms for her allies. Little progress was 
made in their negotiations when my letters were writ- 
ten. Count de Vergennes has thought it prudent to 
advise Congress of this circumstance, that they might 
be prepared for every event. I communicate it to 
your Excellency with similar views. I doubt not 
you will avail yourself of this information to urge the 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDEJNCE. 317 

State in which you preside, to take such measures 
that they may not be found unprovided in case our 
hopes of peace should be frustrated. 

It would give me pleasure to learn the measures 
that have been adopted, in consequence of the requisi- 
tions made in my letters to your Excellency or your 
predecessors in office at different periods relative to 
my Department, and more particularly to receive the 
account so frequently called for of the damage done 
by the enemy in your State.* I have reason to think 
had it been furnished in time, it might have been of 
singular use to our Ministers, and perhaps have tended 
to obtain some relief for the sufferers. It may not 
yet come too late to be useful. Let me pray your 
Excellency to take measures for furnishing three au- 
thentic copies by the earliest opportunity. 
I have the honor to be, &c.

regard fur justice and fidelity to our engagements, are 
all that now remains to render us a happy people. 
The vessel that brought these despatches was sent out 
by the Count d'Estaing lo recall the French cruisers. 
As the Minister tells me he will forward the orders 
and passports to your Excellency, I will not detain the 
messenger lill I have mine copied. This should in 
my opinion be immediately sent cither by Congress or

by order of Count d'Estaing to recall the cruisers of 
his Most Christian Majesty, and to prevent the further 
effusion of hlood at sea. A copy of the order is en-

Congress have been pleased lo pass the enclosed reso- 
lution. 



320 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

The vessel which brought these orders did not sail 
with express design to come to the port of Philadel-

that I have it not in my power to afford you any fur- 
ther information as to the terms of a general peace,

further addition, that the Bahama Islands are restored 
to Great Britain. 

Mr Morris, one of my Secretaries, will have the 
honor to deliver this to your Excellency, and may be

DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 321 

SIR GUY CARLETON TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

New York, March 26th, 1783. 
Sir, 

I have received your letter of the 24th instant, en- 
closing a resolution of Congress of the same date, taken 
in consequence of the arrival of the cutter, Triomphe, 
commanded by Lieutenant du Quesne, with orders of the 
10th of February last, given at Cadiz by Vice Admiral 
d'Estaing, for him to put to sea and cruize on such stations 
as he shall judge most likely to meet with ships of his 
nation, and inform them of the happy reconciliation of the 
belligerent powers, and to order all their ships of war to 
cease hostilities against those of Great Britain ; the Pre- 
liminary Articles of a general peace being signed the 20th 
of January. You thereupon are pleased to express your 
expectation that T would think this information thus con- 
veyed, "sufficiently authentic to justify my taking imme- 
diate measures to stop the further effusion of blood." 

For my own part, I have hitherto abstained from all 
hostilities, and this conduct 1 meant to continue so far as 
our own security would permit ; but how great soever my 
desire is to put an entire stop to the calamities of war, and 
whatever respect this information may deserve, yet I. do 
not find myself thereby justified in recommending measures 
that might give facility to the fleets and armies menacing 
any part of the King's possessions, \n carry their hostilities 
into execution. 

To adopt a measure of this importance, it is necessary I 

should receive orders from home, which I may reasonably 

expect every hour, as a cruiser sent out on other purposes 

is already arrived at Philadelphia ; and I assure you, Sir, 

VOL. xi. 41 



322 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

I only wait the official certainty of this great event, to 
assume \\u> language, and the spirit too, of the most perfect 
conciliation and peace. 

I perceive, Sir, by the resolution enclosed in your letter, 
that Congress have thought fit to consider this information 
as authentic, and, thereupon, have taken one considerable 
step towards carrying the terms of peace into immediate 
execution. 

Another, not less important, I presume, has been taken, 

or is taking. With the cessation of hostilities, I perceive, 

is connected in the seventh Article of the provisional treaty 

an engagement, that "all prisoners on both sides shall be 

set at liberty ;" of this event, therefore, 1 hope likewise 

speedily to receive the very necessary and welcome notice, 

as I shall find the highest satisfaction in seeing released on 

all sides, men upon whom the evils and calamities of war 

have more peculiarly fallen.

Guy Carleton, but, as I have as yet received no official 
accounts from England, I must wait till you, on your side,

you, 1 so much wish. There can be no reason for detain- 
ing our prisoners one moment, as Congress must suppose

TO THE PRESIDENT OP CONGRESS. 

Office of Foreign Affairs, March 28th, 1783. 
Sir, 

There remains in my hands the sum of thirtyeight 
thousand three hundred and thirtytwo livres, equal on ex- 
change at par to about seven thousand three hundred and 
ten dollars, arising from the excess on the payment of the 
salaries of the Ministers of the United States in Europe, 
occasioned by the course of exchange during the last year, 
which Congress have been pleased to direct that 1 should 
pass to the account of the United States. In this I have 
not calculated six hundred and eightyeight livres excess 
upon M. Dumas's account, being too inconsiderable to 
make a deduction worth attention. 

Desirous of settling all my accounts on the 1st of April, 
previous to my leaving the department, I pray Congress to 
pass some order relative to the disposition of the money, 
so tha$ I may discharge myself of it. As Congress may 
be led to suppose, from a passage in Mr Laurens's letter, 
that I have charged a commission on this transaction, I 
take the liberty to inform them, that though this is an 
extra service attended with some trouble and risk, I once 
had it in view, if our Ministers compelled me to be their 
agent, to charge a commission while the exchange was in 
their favor, yet not having then done it, I cannot think it 



324 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

would be reasonable to deduct a commission from the re- 
duced sum that is now paid them. 
I have honor to be, &c.

they consider the object of your appointment as so far ad- 
vanced, as to render it unnecessary for you to pursue your 
voyage ; and that Congress are well satisfied with the 
readiness you have shown in undertaking a service, which 
from the present situation of affairs, they apprehend can 
be dispensed with." 

I have caused your account to be settled to the 1st of 
April, and hope to be able to send you the warrant for the 
amount tomorrow. If you please, I will apply for such 
further sum as you may think proper to charge for the 
time that may be necessary to carry you home, as 1 think 
that within the spirit of the resolution of Congress. 
I have the honor to be, &.c.

regularly laid before the Legislature of this State, (Mary- 
land) and we are very .sorry to find that the early attention 
which their importance merited has not been paid to them. 
The Assembly at their last session, passed an act di-

upon oath the damages done by the enemy within their 
respective counties, and to report the same to this Board. 
As soon as we are furnished with their returns, you may

SIR GUY CARLETON TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

New York, April 6th, 1783. 
Sir, 

A packet from England arrived at this port last night, 
by which I have despatches from Mr Tovvnshend, one of 
his Majesty's principal Secretaries of State, communicating 
official intelligence, that Preliminary Articles of Peace 
with France and Spain were signed at Paris, on the 20th 
of January last, and that the ratifications have been since 
exchanged at the same place. 

The King, Sir, has been pleased, in consequence of 
these events, to order a Proclamation to be published, de- 
claring a cessation of arms,* as well by sea as land, and 
his Majesty's pleasure signified, that I should cause the 
same to be published in all places under my command, in 

* See this Proclamation in the Correspondence of the Commission- 
ers for Peace, Vol. X. p. 124. 



326 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

order, thnt bis Majesty *S subjects may pay immediate 
and clue obedience thereto, and sucb Proclamation I shall 
accordingly cause to be made on Tuesday next, the 8ih 
instant. 

In consequence thereof, and in conformity to the Arti- 
cles of peace, all our prisoners of war are to be set at 
liberty and restored, with all convenient despatch ; enter- 
taining no doubt, but that similar measures will be taken 
on the part of the United States of America. In like 
manner no doubt can be entertained, but that Congress, in 
conformity to the fifth Article of the provisional treaty, will 
lose no time in earnestly recommending to the Legislatures 
, of the respective States, to provide for the restitution of 
confiscated estates, and to reconsider and revise all laws 
of confiscation, that they may be rendered perfectly con- 
sistent, not only with justice and equity, but with that 
spirit of conciliation, which on the return of the blessings 
of peace should universally prevail. 

And I am further to inform you, Sir, that an instrument 
of accession to the suspension of hostilities, by the States 
General of the United Piovinces, having been received 
in England, a cessation of arms with those Stales has been 
thereupon included in the Proclamation. 

Upon this great occasion, Sir, I am to offer my strong- 
est assurances, that during the short period of my com- 
mand here, I shall be ready and earnest to cultivate that 
spirit of perfect good will, which bel\ve,en the United 
States of America, and the King of Great Britain, and the 
subjects and the citizens of both countries, will I trust 
always remain. 

I am, with much consideration, Sir, he.

ADMIRAL DIGBY TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

Lion, off New Yoik, April Gth, 1763. 
Sir, 
I have lliis moment received the enclosed Proclamation 
from his Majesty's Secretary of State, and shall immedi- 
ately despatch one of the sloops of war to withdraw all 
my cruisers upon this coast, and shall also release all the 
prisoners as quickly as I can dispose of them in the most 
convenient way to themselves. 

I am, Sir, Sic. 

ROBERT DIGBY. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONCRESS. 

Office of Foreign Affairs, April 10th, 1783. 
Sir, 

I have the honor of laying before Congress two letters, 
received yesterday by express from New York, the one 
from General Carleton and the other from Rear Admiral 
Digby. Both covered copies of his Britannic Majesty's 
Proclamation for a cessation of hostilities. I presume 
Congress will consider this advice as sufficiently authentic 
to justify the discharge of their prisoners, who are now a 
useless expense, though not so much so as to render it 
proper to proceed to the measures directed by the fifth 
Article of the provisional treaty, till that treaty is officially 
communicated and ratifications exchanged. 

I am at a loss to determine when hostilities are of right 
to cease between the United States and Great Britain. 
If, as the Proclamation asserts, the times therein mentioned 
were agreed between ihe Ministers of the several powers 



328 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

at war, to take effect upon their respective ratifications, 
then hostilities have not yet ceased between us and Great 
Britain, except so far as the King of Great Britain has 
thought proper to shorten the term by his special act. If 
no such ratification was necessary on our part, then hos- 
tilities ceased immediately after ratifications were ex- 
changed between France and England. If the same 
term has been fixed for the cessation of hostilities between 
Great Britain and the United States, as that agreed upon 
between France and Great Britain, then it becomes a 
question, what is meant by "as far as the Western Islands?" 
If it refers to the latitude, then all prizes made after the 
3d of March, on the greater part of our coast, must be re- 
stored. As much property may depend upon the decision 
of these questions, 1 presume Congress will do do act, 
which shall lead to a determination of it, till we receive 
further advices from our own Ministers. 

I shall be pardoned when I take the liberty to request, 
that the enclosed letters may not find their way into the 
papers, unless Congress shall determine, that this publica- 
tion may answer some useful purposes. 
I have the honor to be, Sir, See. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, April 10th, 1783. 
Sir, 

I do myself the honor to enclose the draft of a Procla- 
mation for the suspension of hostilities between the United 
States and Great Britain, and the resolution for the dis- 
charge of prisoners, together with one for referring a part 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 329 

of Mr Adams's letters, which is all that it is necessary to 
report upon the letters referred to me. 
I have the honor to be, &tc. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



TO GENERAL GREENE. 

Philadelphia, April 12th, 1783. 
Dear Sir, 

I am now to congratulate you on the return of peace, 
and a cessation from your labor. I some time since sent 
you the Provisional Treaty between Great Britain and the 
United States. On Wednesday last, Sir Guy Carleton 
sent me the enclosed Proclamation of his Britannic Majes- 
ty, and informed me, that he had directed a similar 
Proclamation to issue at New York, and proposed to dis- 
charge a'l our prisoners. I had a letter from Admiral 
Digby to the same effect ; the next day I received advices 
of the agrefrnent of the cessation ol hostilities, from our 
Ministers. Congress, in consequence of these advices, 
yesterday issued the enclosed Proclamation. 

I reported to them on the propriety of releasing their 
prisoners. The report is to be considered today, and I 
doubt not that it will be agreed to. The British Parlia- 
ment appear to be extremely dissatisfied at the terms of 
peace ; a majority, headed by Lord North, has been 
obtained against the Administration, so that I think Lord 
Shelburne has little prospect of continuing in the Adminis- 
tration ; but this is of no consequence to us, unless we are 
bound to like ?.n Administration that has served us against 
their will. As doubts may arise with respect to the resti- 
vol. xi. 42 



330 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

tution of prizes taken after the epoch fixed by the Proclama- 
tion, it may not be improper for me to mention to you, 
that we conceive, that hostilities ceased in those parts of 
the Atlantic Ocean, which lay in the same latitude with the 
Canaries, on the 3d of March. 

I am, Sir, &c. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



TO SIR GUr CARLETON. 

Philadelphia, April 12th, 1783. 
Sir, 

I received your letter of the 6th instant, informing me 
of the arrival of a Packet, by which you hare official 
intelligence, that the Preliminary Articles of Peace with 
Fiance and Spain were signed at Paris on the 20th of 
January last ; that the ratifications have been since ex- 
changed, and that his Britannic Majesty has ordered a 
cessation of arms to be proclaimed, as well by sea as by 
land ; and that you propose, agreeably to J#s orders, to 
issue a similar Proclamation, and to set at liberty your 
prisoners of war. 

This interesting intelligence was communicated to the 
United States in Congress, who, though they had yet re- 
ceived no official accounts, would immediately have made 
it the basis of pacific measures, without entertaining doubts 
of its authenticity, or yielding to suspicions which would 
tend to prolong the calamities of war; but while these 
measures were under consideration, they received from 
their Ministers official advices of the agreement between 
them and the Court of Great Britain relative to a cessa- 
tion of hostilities, on which they have founded the enclosed 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 331 

Proclamation.* They have likewise under consideration 
measures for the discharge of their prisoners ; these 
measures will he carried into effect as soon as possible 
after they are determined on. 

It cannot be doubted, Sir, as you justly observe, that 
Congress will embrace the earliest opportunity to perform 
the stipulations contained in the fifth, as well as every other 
of the Provisional Articles, immediately after the same shall 
have been ratified. In the meanwhile, it must be obvious 
to your Excellency that a recommendation to restore to 
the loyalists the estates they have forfeited, will come 
with less weight before Legislatures composed of men, 
whose property is still withheld from them by the con- 
tinuance of his Britannic Majesty's fleets and armies in this 
country, than it will do when peace and the full enjoyment 
of their rights shall have worn down those asperities, which 
have grown out of eight years' war. This reflection will, 
I doubt not, induce you to give every facility in your power 
to the execution of the seventh Article of the Provisional 
Treaty, and to fix as early a day for the evacuation of 
New York, and its dependencies, as may consist with 
your orders. 

I give the fullest credit, Sir, to your assurances, that you 
are ready to cultivate the spirit of harmony and good will 
between the subjects and citizens of his Britannic Majesty 
and these Stales, since I find them warranted by the 
humanity which has uniformly distinguished your command 
in America. But, Sir, time only, with liberality in those 
that govern in both countries, can entirely efface the 
remembrance of what has passed, and produce that per- 

* See this Proclamation in the Correspondence, of the Commissioners 
for Peace, Vol. X. p. 133. 



332 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

feet good will, which I sincerely concur with you in wishing 

to cultivate. 

1 am, Sir, &ic. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



TO REAR ADMIRAL DIGBY. 

Philadelphia, April 12th, 1783. 
Sir, 

I received your letter, enclosing a Proclamation for the 
suspension of hostilities, and informing me of your design 
to recall your cruisers and release your prisoners. In re- 
turn, Sir, I have the pleasure to enclose a Proclamation by 
the United States of America for a suspension of hostilities. 
Congress have the measures necessary for the return of 
their prisoners under consideration ; I shall acquaint you 
with those they adopt. 

The resolution transmitted in my last, Ins already in- 
formed you, that the humanity of Congress induced them, 
on the first intimation of the cessation of hostilities, to recall 
their cruisers. It is to be hoped, Sir, that no difficulties 
will arise on either side as to the restitution of such vessels 
as may have been taken after the epoch mentioned in the 
Proclamations of his Britannic Majesty and the United 
States. For though this may be of no great moment 
when considered in a national light, yst it becomes impor- 
tant, from the number of captures made on this coast within 
the latitude of the Canaries, since the 3d of March last, 
as well as from the presages, which the first steps may 
furnish, of the respect that will in future be paid to the 
stipulations in the treaty. 

The gentleman, who delivered me your letter, will in- 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 333 

form you, that it came open to my hands from a mistake 
in the direction. I am so fully persuaded, Sir, that I do 
not deceive myself, when I impute this rather to mistake, 
than to the principle followed, in some instances, in an 
early period of the late war, that I should not have noticed 
it now but to prevent, in future, the inconveniences, with 
which it has been in this instance attended. 
I am, iic. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Philadelphia, April 12th, 1783. 
Dear Sir, 

I congratulate your Excellency most sincerely upon 
the cessation of hostilities, which you will learn from the 
enclosed Proclamation. You will doubtless have heard 
directly from General Carleton on the subject, so that it 
will not be necessary to trouble you with the substance of 
his letter to me. 

Congress will this day, upon my report, take into con- 
sideration the propriety of discharging the prisoners, and 
the manner in which it is to be done. Sir Guy Carleion 
presses hard in his letter for the execution of the fifth of 
the Preliminary Articles. I have replied, that it cannot 
be executed till the treaty is ratified ; and in the mean 
time endeavored to convince him, that the recommendation 
of Congress will be received with much more respect, 
when the persons, who compose our Legislatures, have 
returned to their respective homes, and the asperities occa- 
sioned by the war shall be a little worn down by the 
enjoyment of peace. It is a very capital omission in our 



334 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

treaty, that no time has been fixed for the evacuation of 
New York. 

It were to be wished, that General Carleton's intentions 
on this head could be sounded by your Excellency. 
I have the honor to be, Dear Sir, he. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



CIRCULAR TO THE GOVERNORS OF THE STATES. 

Philadelphia, April 12th, 1783. 
Sir, 

Permit me to offer you my congratulations on the im- 
portant event announced by the United States, in Congress, 
in the enclosed Proclamation for the cessation of hostilities ; 
an event, which is not only pleasing, as it relieves us from 
the accumulated distresses of war in the bowels of our 
country, but as it affords the fairest and most flattering 
prospects of its future greatness and prosperity. I need 
not, I am persuaded, Sir, use any arguments to urge your 
Excellency and the Slate over which you preside, to the 
most scrupulous attention to the execution of every stipula- 
tion in our treaty, which may depend on you or them. A 
national character is now to be acquired. I venture to 
hope, that it will be worthy of the struggles by which we 
became a n.ition. 

I have the honor to be, &c. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 335 

SIR GUY CARLETON TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

New York, April 14th, 1783. 
Sir, 
As I observe in the seventh article of the Provisional 
Treaty it is agreed, after stipulating that "all prisoners on 
both sides shall be set at liberty," that "his Britannic Ma- 
jesty shall with all convenient speed, and without causing 
any destruction, or carrying away any negroes, or other 
property of the American inhabitants, withdraw all his 
armies, garrisons, and fleets from the United Slate?, and 
from every port, place, and harbor within the same, he. ;" 
and as embarkations of persons and property are on the 
point of being made, I am to request that Congress would 
be pleased to empower any person or persons, on behalf of 
the United States, to be present at New York, and to assist 
such persons as shall be appointed by me to inspect and 
superintend all embarkations, which the evacuation of this 
place may require ; and they will he pleased to represent 
to me every infraction of the letter or spirit of the treaty, 
that redress may be immediately ordered. 

I am, Sir, &.c. 

GUY CARLETON. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OP CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, April 21st, 1783. 
Sir, 

I have the honor to enclose a letter, just received from 
Mr Dana. I am much surprised to find that such consid- 
erable sums as he mentions are necessary on the signature 
of a treaty with Russia, since I cannot learn that money is 
demanded of right on similar occasions by any civilized 



33G ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

nation in Europe ; though it is usual among them to pre- 
sent gratifications to the Ministers on hoth sides, which be- 
ing for the most part of equal value, the account is bal- 
anced. As I do not conceive, that we are under the least 
necessity of buying a treaty with Russia, 1 think it would 
be well for Mr Dana, (if he should not have been misin- 
formed) to declare to the Court of St Petersburg, that the 
Ministers of the United States are restrained from receiv- 
ing presents, that to make them in such circumstances, 
would be either to arrogate a superiority to which they 
were not entitled, or to acknowledge that they were so far 
the inferior of those with whom they treated, as to be com- 
pelled to purchase a connexion, which should be founded 
in equality and mutual advantage. That he therefore 
found himself compelled in the one case, by respect for the 
Empress, in the other by a regard to the United States, 
rather to break off the treaty, than to take a step which 
might be supposed to derogate fiom either. After all, I 
apprehend, that Mr Dana has not received his information 
on this subject through the best channel, and that he must 
have mistaken a particular case for a general custom. 
I have the honor to be, &c. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



GEORGE WASHINGTON TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

Head Quarters, April 22d, ]783. 
Sir, 
I hive been honored with your two favors, dated the 
12th and 15th instant. 

In consequence of the resolutions of Congress on the 
15th instant, and the express declarations of the Secretary 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 337 

at War, respecting the sense and expectations of Congress, 
arrangements have been agreed upon between him and 
me, for an immediate liberation of all land prisoners; and I 
have yesterday given this information to Sir Guy Carleton. 
The particulars of the arrangement, with the opinion given 
the British Commander in Chief, you will obtain through 
the Minister at War. 

In order to obtain the sense of Sir Guy Carleton upon 
the matters, contained in the resolution of the 15th, 1 Ifave 
proposed a personal interview with him at an early day. 
The result of this meeting, if acceded to, will probably lead 
us to a decision upon some questions, which are more 
doubtful, and that with greater decision and despatch, than 
couid otherwise be procured. 
1 have the honor to be, &c. 

GEORGE WASHINGTON. 



GEORGE WASHINGTON TO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

Head Quarters, May 13th, 1783 
Sir, 

Your favor of the 3d came to hand by the last post. 
Before this time you will have seen the report I made 
to Congress of the interview with Sir Guy Carleton. I 
am very sorry its result proved so indecisive. That this 
arises from the cause you mention I am not fully per- 
suaded. I believe a want of information from his Com t, 
which had been for some time without any administration, 
has been a great embarrassment to him. 

The civil jurisdiction of West Chester County Sir Guy 
Carleton appeared very willing, in his conversation, to re- 
linquish to the State ; but what reply he will make to the 
vol. xi. 43 



333 



ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



Governor, when lie conies to reduce it to writing;, I know 
not. Long Island he seemed to think could not be so easily 
delivered up. It would be attended with many inconven- 
iences, and he mentioned particularly the facility it would 
give to cteser ion?, and the necessity of holding it for the 
accommodation of those people, who must eventually be 
obliged to leave the country. Staten Island was also 
necessary for his convenience. 

1 have had no reply from Si 1- Guy since his return to 
New York, nor, I presume, lias Governor Clinton heard 
anything from him. 

I have the honor to be, &c.

TO THE CHAIRMAN OF A COMMITTEE OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, May 10th, 1783. 
Sir, 
Ths inquiries that the committee were pleased to do 
me the honor to make this morning, relative to my continu- 
ing to exercise the office of Secretary of Foreign Affairs, 
were extremely embarrassing to me, because, on the one 
hand, I find it impossible to continue it) the office on the 
present establishment, without material injury to my pri- 
vate affairs, and, on the other, to propose the terms on 
which I would stay would be to overrate my own im- 
portance, and to suppose that others could not be had 
upon such conditions as Congress have been pleased to 
consider as sufficient. Having given my whole time, and 
a considerable part .of my property to the public during 
the war, I see, with pleasure, that the affairs of the United 
Slates are not now in such a situation as to render the 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDE^ T CE. 339 

contributions of an individual necessary. It is my wish to 
endeavor to repair the injuries my estate lias sustained by 
the ravages of the enemy, and my own neglect, by the 
offices i have held. N 

From my former letter, Congress will be ab'e to judge 
how far my expenses in the office exceed the salary. But 
as it by no means follows, that another by greater economy 
and humbler, but, perhaps, more just ideas of the im- 
portance of this office, could not live at less expense, I do 
not think that mine should be any reason to induce Con- 
gress to make other changes, than such as they shall of 
themspives deem necessary. And in this view, 1 re- 
quested the committee, that called upon me last winter, to 
keep the matter of emoluments entirely out of sight in their 
report, as I then considered my stay only as a temporary 
inconvenience. 

At present, Sir, I must choose between the office I 
have been honored with from Congress and an important 
State office. If I continue in the first, I must suppose it 
the business of years, and lose sight of all other objects in 
my own State, where 1 have something to hope from my 
connexions and the favor of my countrymen, and where I 
possess an estate, the value of which depends in a great 
measure upon my attention to it. Under these circum- 
stances, I flatter myself that the committee will not think 
me blamable, when 1 assure them, that though I am willing 
to give my time and services to the public if they should 
be deemed necessary, yet I cannot in justice to myself or 
my family, add to this gift that of such a portion of my 
property as I find absolutely necessary to support the 
effice 1 hold. ' 

Permit me, Gentlemen, to add, that having no wishes 



340 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

upon this subject, T am sincerely desirous that personal con- 
siderations may not enter into the arrangements that Con- 
gress make thereon. 1 feel myself extremely honored hy 
the attention they have shown me in directing you to con- 
fer with me on this subject ; and I reflect with great 
pleasure on the reasons I have had to he satisfied with 
their conduct towards me since 1 have been honored with 
the office. 

I am, Gentlemen, Sic. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



TO JOSEPH NOURSE. 

Philadelphia, May 2Glh, 1783. 
Sir, 
In compliance with your request, I have collected from 
the papers in my office the following account of the 
moneys received by loans, or otherwise, from Hulland, 
Fiance, and Spain. • 

The first loan that was opened in Holland on our ac- 
count with success, was opened by His Most Christian 
Majesty, and under his special guarantee, for ten millions of 
l.vres. Since that, another loan was contracted hy Mr 
Adams with private banking houses, to the amount of five 
millions of florins. 

These houses, in a letter directed to me of the IGtli of 
August last, write that they had at that time in cash by 
them, one million four hundred and eightyfour thousand 
florins, of which the interest ran as follows ; 
1,314,000 florins, from the 1st of June, 
170,000 florins, from the 1st of July. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 34 I 

They sdd, that they had already paid to the order of 
Mr Adams, in favor of sundry individuals, the sum of two 
thousand nine hundred and two florins, and that that Min- 
ister had hinted to them, that it would be necessary to 
pay some drafts of Mr Laurens's when arrived, and a few 
other unavoidable expenses, which woidd amount to about 
two hundred thousand florins. By a letter of the iSth 
of November last, they have acknowledged the receipt 
of the contract duly ratified, so that the money they 
had on hand has been since that time at the disposal of 
Congress. 

The moneys received from France before the year 
17S0, cannot be very accurately stated, for the want of 
order in the books kept by the Committee of Foreign 
Affairs. By the best estimate I have been able to make, 
the amount of, such moneys appears to be about nine 
millions of livres, exclusive of one million received from 
the Farmers-Central on a particular contract. To this, 
must be added the grants obtained by Colonel Laurens, 
which, including military stores, amount to fourteen mil- 
lions of livres. So that the whole of the money received 
from France, amounts to about four and twenty millions 
tournois. I should observe, that I hare not here made 
any distinction between loans and gifts, though about eight 
millions of the above sum have been granted by France 
without any expectation of being repaid. 

From Spain we have only icceived one hundred and 
fifty thousand dollars, which were granted to Mr Jay in 
the beginning of the year 17S0. 

1 have not mentioned the engagement, which France 
has lately entered into to supply the United States with 
six millions of livres, as you may find everything that 



342 ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 

relates to it in the appendix to the address of Congress to 
the States. 

I have the honor to be, &c. 

ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON. 



TO THE PBESIDENT OP CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, June 2d, 1783. 
Sir, 

I have the honor to submit to Congress a letter from 
M. Dumas, willi several papers relative to a negotiation, 
which appears to have been commenced hy the Slates of 
Holland w'uh our Ministers. As ihis subject may be very 
important m its consequences, it is to he presumed, that 
thev would wish to have the direction of Congress. I 
would therefore take the liberty to suggest, that these pa- 
pens he commuted to a special committee. 

As my stay in town will not admit of my executing the 
commission, which M. Van Berckel requites, I must pray 
Congress also to give some direction therein. 
1 have the honor to be, &.c

CORRESPONDENCE 



OF 



ROBERT MORRIS, 



SUPERINTENDENT OF FINANCE. 



During the first years of the Revolution the finan- 
cial concerns of Congress were managed by a Com- 
mittee, under the general supervision of that body. 
Disorder and confusion were the gradual results of 
such a system. It was at length resolved to put this 
Department into the hands of a responsible individual, 
and Robert Morris was unanimously chosen Super- 
intendent of Finance, on the 20th of February, 1781. 
Various reasons prevented his engaging in the duties 
of the office till the May following. 

The high expectations of Congress, and of the 
country, were fully answered by the ability and suc- 
cess with which Mr Morris administered the affairs of 
this new Department. Funds were provided, and 
public credit restored. He remained in office till 
November 1st, 1784. 

Nothing can afford a stronger proof of his zeal, assi- 
duity, and unwearied labor, than the correspondence 
which he has left respecting the transactions of his 
office. The letters here published are a selection only 
from the large mass, which has been preserved. They 
pertain chiefly to the foreign relations of the United 
States, either as effected by European loans, or by the 
agency of the internal resources of the country. In 
fact, all the financial operations of Congress were more 
or less connected with their Foreign Affairs, since 
loans from abroad were necessary, and these could be 
procured only on the strength of public credit and the 
means of sustaining it at home,

THE 



CORRESPONDENCE 



OF 



ROBERT MORRIS. 



ORGANIZATION OF THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT. 

In Congress, February 7th, 1781 . 

Congress resumed the consideration of the plan for 
the arrangement of the civil executive departments of 
the United States ; and thereupon, 

Resolved, That there be a Superintendent of Fi- 
nance, a Secretary at War, and a Secretary of Marine ; 

That it shall be the duty of the Superintendent of 
Finance, to examine into the state of the public debts, 
the public expenditures, and the public revenue; to 
digest and report plans for improving and regulating 
the finances, and for establishing order and economy 
in the expenditure of the public money ; to direct the 
execution of all plans, which shall be adopted by Con- 
gress respecting revenue and expenditure ; to superin- 
tend and control the settlement of all public accounts; 
to direct and control all persons employed in procur-

ing supplies for the public service, and in the expen- 
diture of public money; to obtain accounts of all the 
issues of the specific supplies furnished by the several 
States; to compel the payment of all moneys due to 
the United States, and in his official character, or in 
such manner as the laws of the respective States shall 
direct, to prosecute in behalf of the United States, for 
all delinquencies respecting the public revenue and 
expenditures ; to report to Congress the officers who 
shall be necessary for assisting him in the various 
branches of his Department. 

In Congress, February 20th. Congress proceeded to 
the election of a Superintendent of Finance; and the 
ballots being taken, Robert Morris was unanimously 
elected. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, March 13th, 1781. 
Sir, 

I had the honor to receive yor.r Excellency's letter of 
the 21st of last month, enclosing the Act of Congress of 
the 20th. whereby I am appointed, by a unanimous elec- 
tion of that honorable body, to the important office of 
Superintendent of Finance. Perfectly sensible of 
the houor done me by this strong mark of confidence from 
the sovereign authority of the United States, I feel myself 
bound to make the acknowledgments due, by pursuing 
a conduct formed to answer the expectations of Congress, 
and promote the public welfare. Were my abilities equal 
to my desire of serving America, I should have given an 
immediate determination after this appointment was made ; 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 349 

but conscious of my own deficiencies, time for considera- 
tion was absolutely necessary. Little, however, of that 
time, which has elapsed have I been able to devote to this 
object, as the business before the Legislature of Pennsyl- 
vania, wherein I have the honor of a seat, has demanded 
and continues to demand my constant attendance. 

So far as the station of Superintendent of Finance, or 
indeed any other public station or office, applies to myself 
I should without the least hesitation have declined an ac- 
ceptance ; for after upwards of twenty years assiduous 
application to business as a merchant, I find myself at that 
period when my mind, body, and inclination combine to 
seek for relaxation and ease. Providence had so far 
smiled on my endeavors as to enable me to prepare for the 
indulgence of these feelings, in such a manner as would 
be least injurious to the interest of my family. If, there- 
fore, 1 accept this appointment, a sacrifice of that ease, of 
much social and domestic enjoyment, and of every mate- 
rial interest, must be the inevitable consequence ; and as 
my ambition was entirely gratified by my present situation 
and character in life, no motive of that kind can stimulate 
me to the acceptance. 

Putting myself out of the question, the sole motive is 
the public good 5 and this motive I confess comes home to 
my feelings. The contest we are engaged in appeared 
to me, in the first instance, just and necessary ; therefore 
I took an active part in it. As it became dangerous, I 
thought it the more glorious, and was stimulated to the 
greatest exertions in my power, when the affairs of Amer- 
ica were at the worst. Sensible of the want of arrange- 
ment in our monied affairs, the same considerations impel 
me to this undertaking, which I would embark in without 



350 ROBERT MORRIS. 

hesitation, could I believe myself equal thereto ; but fear- 
ing this may not be the case, it becomes indispensably 
necessary to make such stipulations, as may give ease 
to my feelings, aid my exertions, and tend to procure 
ample support to my conduct in office, so long as it is 
founded in and guided by a regard to the public prosperity. 

In the first place then, I am to inform Congress, that 
the preparatory steps I had taken to procure to myself 
relaxation from business, with least injury to the interests 
of my family, were by engaging in certain commercial 
establishments with persons, in whom I had perfect con- 
fidence as to their integrity, honor, and abilities. These 
establishments I am bound in honor and by contracts to 
support to the extent agreed on. If, therefore, it be in 
the idea cf Congress, that the office of Superintendent of 
Finance is incompatible with commercial concerns and 
connexions, the point is settled ; for I cannot on any con- 
sideration consent to violate engagements or depart from 
those principles of honor, which it is my pride to be gov- 
erned by. If, on the contrary, Congress have elected me 
to this office under the expectation, that my mercantile 
connexions and engagements were to continue, an express 
declaration of their sentiments should appear on the 
minutes, that no doubt may arise or reflections be cast 
on this score hereafter. 

I also think it indispensably necessary, that the appoint- 
ment of all persons who are to act in my office, under the 
same roof, or in immediate connexion with, should be made 
by myself; Congress first agreeing, that such secretaries, 
clerks, or officers, so to be appointed are necessary, and 
fixing ihe salaries for each. I conceive, that it will be 
impossible to execute the duties of this office with effect, 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 351 

unless the absolute power of dismissing from office or em- 
ployment all persons whatever, that are concerned in the 
official expenditure of public moneys, be committed to 
the Superintendent of Finance. For unless this power can 
be exercised without control, I have little hopes of effi- 
cacy in the business of reformation, which is probably the 
most essential part of the duty. 

These being the only positive stipulations that occur to 
me at this time, the determination of Congress thereon 
will enable me to determine whether to accept or decline 
the appointment. I must, however, observe that the act 
of Congress of the 7th of February, describing the 
duties of the Superintendent of Finance, requires the ex- 
ecution of many things, for which adequate powers are not 
provided, and it cannot be expected, that your officer can 
in such case be responsible. These however may be the 
subjects of future discussions. 

With sentiments of the highest respect, for you and 
Congress, I have the honor to subscribe myself, your 
Excellency's most obedient and most humble servant. 

ROBERT MORRIS.* 

* During the whole period in which Mr Morris held the office of 
Superintendent of Finance, he kept a Diary, in which he entered 
daily the principal transactions of his department. The following 
is an extract from the Diary. 

"On the 21st of February I received a letter from the President of 
Congress, enclosing the resolves of the 20th, whereby I was unani- 
mously elected the Superintendent of Finance of the United States. 
This appointment wa6 unsought, unsolicited, and dangerous to ac- 
cept, as it was evidently contrary to my private interest, and if ac- 
cepted must deprive me of those enjoyments, social and domestic, 
which my time of life required, and to which my circumstances enti- 
tled me ; and a vigorous execution of the duties must inevitably ex- 
pose me to the resentment of disappointed and designing men, and to

PROCEEDINGS IN CONGRESS. 

March 20th. A letter of the 13th instant from Robert 
Morris was taken into consideration, and it was 

Resolved, that the United States in Congress assembled 
do not require him to dissolve the commercial connexions 
referred to in the said letter. 

March 21 st. The consideration of the letter of the 
13th instant, from Robert Morris being resumed, a motion 
was made, and it was 

Resolved, that the Superintendent of Finance be, and 
he is hereby empowered to appoint and remove at his 
pleasure, his assistants in his peculiar office or chamber of 
business in immediate connexion with him ; it being first 
determined by the United States in Congress assembled, 
that such assistants so to be appointed are necessary, and 
what the salary of each shall be. 

Ordered, that the remainder of Mr Morris's letter be 
referred to a committee of three. The members sppointed 
were Messrs Houston, Burke, and Wolcott. 

the calumny and detraction of the envious and malicious. 1 was 
therefore determined not to engage in so arduous an undertaking. 
Butthe solicitations of my friends, acquaintance, and fellow citizens, 
a full conviction of the necessity, that some person should commence 
the work of reformation in our public affairs, by an attempt to in- 
troduce system and economy, and the persuasion, that a refusal on 
my part, would probably deter others from attempting this work, so 
absolutely necessary to the safety of our country ; these consider- 
ations, after much reflection and consultation with friends, induced 
me to write a letter to the President of Congress, dated the 13th 
of March, 1781." 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 353 

TO THOMAS BURKE, WILLIAM HOUSTON, AND OLIVER 
WOLCOTT, COMMITTEE OF CONGRESS. 

Date Uncertain. 
Gentlemen, 

When I had the honor of a visit from you on the 
subject of my interview with Congress, it was agreed 
that I should make out and deliver you a list of the 
several officers concerned in the expenditure of public 
money, over whom I judged it necessary for the Su- 
perintendent of Finance to have the uncontrolled 
power of dismission. But on reflection I found it was 
not in my power to render such a list, because I do 
not know the several degrees of officers now in em- 
ployment, and even if I did, 'such a list would not 
answer the end, because others may hereafter be crea- 
ted, who should also be subjected to the power of the 
Financier, and it would be very troublesome for Con- 
gress on every such appointment to pass a resolution 
for the purpose. There will also be appointments 
made occasionally by the Commander in Chief, the 
Heads of Department, and by other officers, in which 
the expenditure of public moneys will be involved, and 
of course such appointments must also be subject to 
the same authority. For these reascns, it seems 
proper that the power of the Minister of Finance, with 
respect to the control and dismission from office of all 
persons concerned in the expenditure of public prop- 
erty, should be denned in one Act of Congress, vesting 
him with that authority. 

To me it appears absolutely necessary, that this 
power should be vested in the Financier to enable him 
vol, xi. 45 



354 ROBERT MORRIS. 

to remedy and prevent public abuses; and the extent 
should be measured by the necessity and the use. As 
to myself, I am far from desiring power for the sake 
of power. Indeed I think it is generally more dan- 
gerous to the possessor than to the objects of it. 
Consequently I cannot have a wish to extend it be- 
yond the necessity and utility mentioned. 

Th3 whole business of finance may be described in 
two short but comprehensive sentences, if I have 
proper notions on the subject. It is to raise the public 
revenues, by such modes as may be most easy and most 
equal to the people ; and to expend them in the most fru- 
gal, fair, and honest manner. In our case the first part 
must ever be the business of Congress, and the Legis- 
latures of the respective States: because the powers of 
taxation cannot be delegated. The second I take to 
be the most essential part of the duty of the Superin- 
tendent of Finance. He must ever have it in view to 
reduce the expenditures as nearly as possible to what 
injustice and in reason they ought to be; and to do 
this, he must be vested with power to dismiss from 
employment those officers he shall find unnecessary, 
unequal to their stations, inattentive to their duty, or 
dishonest in the exercise of it. 

In a monarchy this power need not be ofTicially 
vested in a Minister, because he can have constant in- 
tercourse with the Sovereign, and by that means he is 
in the daily exercise pf.it, Where the sovereignty is 
vested in a public body of men, such an intercourse is 
impracticable; and I am persuaded that a Minister 
who would venture tfi execute the duties of his office 
with vigor, without possessing uncontrolled the power 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPOADEiNCE. 355 

of dismission, would in a few months put it out of his 
power to proceed in his business, and Congress would 
have full employment to hear and determine between 
him and suspended officers. On the contrary, if a 
dismissed officer can have no appeal but to the laws of 
the land, Congress will not be troubled, business may 
be conducted with decision, and the very knowledge 
that such a power exists, will have a tendency to pre- 
vent the frequent exercise of it, after the first reforms 
are effected. 

I have been told, that some gentlemen considered the 
expressions in my letter to Congress on this subject so 
general as that they might be construed to compre- 
hend the Commander in Chief, Heads of Department, 
&c. But this cannot be. The Commander in Chief 
is not concerned himself, but employs others in the 
expenditure of public money, to whom he grants war- 
rants or drafts on the military chest; and the persons 
so employed ought to be accountable, and subject to 
dismission. I suppose officers of the army may fre- 
quently be so employed, and in that case it cannot be 
supposed, that the power of the Financier extends to 
the military commission, for it certainly must be con- 
fined to the money matters. There is one exception 
with respect to what I have said of the Commander in 
Chief, and that is the expenditures for secret service, 
and in this respect I think he should be responsible to 
the Sovereign only. 

The Quarter Master General, having a military as 
well as a civil duty, he cannot be under the control of 
the Financier, for the first, although he certainly 
ought to be the last, which has great connexion with 



356 ROBERT MORRIS. 

heavy expense, and perhaps it would be best, that he 
should execute all the business of expenditures by one 
or more deputies, which would exonerate him from 
that power, which they must be subjected to. The 
Commissary General, and every person employed 
under him, are the immediate objects of this power. 
The Paymaster General, may be considered as a chan- 
nel of conveyance, through which money passes from 
the treasury to the army, and as he is subjected to the 
law military, the Minister of Finance needs no other 
authority over him and his officers, than the power of 
putting under arrest and suspending for mal-conduct 
in office. 

All persons employed as Commissaries of military 
stores, of clothing, or any other denomination, wherein 
the expenditure of public money or property is con- 
nected, ought to be subjected to this authority. The 
expenses in the medical department are said to havo 
exceeded thoce of the like kind in any other country. 
It is, therefore, evident that the Purveyors, Commis- 
saries, &c. in this department should be suhjcct to the 
same immediate control as others; and although the 
Financier cannot judge of the medical skill of the Di- 
rector General and his officers, yet if any waste or 
misapplication of public property in their department 
should come to his knowledge, he should have author- 
ity to bring offenders to a Court Martial. 

There is no possibility of introducing public econ- 
omy without the frequent adjustment of accounts ; and 
the more various these may be, the greater is the ne- 
cessity of constant attention to liquidate them speedily 
and well. The Financier ought, therefore, to have 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 357 

the power of removing any of the officers, whose busi- 
ness it is to examine and settle the public accounts, 
that so he may be enabled to obtain a proper. anil early 
settlement, and prevent the dangerous effects of inat- 
tention or corruption on one hand, or of delay, inso- 
lence, and tyranny to individuals concerned in such 
accounts, on the other. And on account of this power 
the Financier should have no accounts with the public 
himself, but wherever expenditures are nec< ssary in 
his department, he should employ proper persons 
therein, subject to the same powers and modes of ac- 
counting with every other person employed in 
expending public property ; or if of necessity he shall 
at any time have accounts with the public, Congress 
can appoint a committee, or special board, to examine 
and settle his accounts. 

From what I have already said, I think it is evident, 
that the power I have stipulated for is absolutely ne- 
cessary ; and although it is not possible to enumerate 
every object of that power, yet the general lines 
within which they may be comprehended can be 
drawn from the observations I have made, although I 
have said our foreign departments, as these may be 
brought into consideration hereafter when it shall 
appear necessary. 

Whoever contemplates the extent of the United 
States, and the vast amount of their present expenses, 
while at the same time all our operations languish, 
must certainly be convinced that some immediate rem- 
edy ought to be applied. The office of Superintendent 
of Finance I suppose is meant as one means of restor- 
ing economy and vigor; and nothing will keep up in 



358 ROBERT MORRIS. 

the minds of the public servants such a constant sense 
of their duly, as a knowledge of the power to remove 
them in the hands of a person of vigilant and decisive 
character. Whether I shdll have sufficient courage 
and perseverance to act up to that character, and 
whether my small abilities, supported by application 
and attention, will enable me to render essential ser- 
vice in the execution of this office, is become an object 
of great consideration, that fills my mind with much 
apprehension, and induces me to wish I had declined 
this arduous undertaking in the first instance. 
I have the honor to be, &c. 

ROBERT MORRIS. 



PROCEEDINGS IN CONGRESS. 

April 2\$t. On a report of the committee, to whom 
was referred Mr Morris's letter of the 13th of March, 

Resolved, That the Superintendent of Finance be 
and he is hereby authorised, to remove from office or 
employment, for incapacity, negligence, dishonesty or 
other misbehavior, such persons, not immediately 
appointed by the United Slates in Congress assem- 
bled, as are or may be officially intrusted with, and 
immediately employed in the expenditure of the pub- 
lic supplies, stores, and other property; in stating, 
examining and passing the public accounts, or in the 
receipt of the continental revenues of the United 
States, and such of the said persons as are or may be 
in his judgment unnecessary, reporting to such author- 
ity, board, minister, or office, to whom it may belong 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 359 

to supply the vacancy, the respective names of the 
persons so removed. 

That he be authorised to suspend from office or em- 
ployment, for similar causes, persons officially em- 
ployed and intrusted as aforesaid, immediately 
appointed by the United Slates in Congress assembled, 
reporting forthwith their names and the reason of 
suspension. 

Provided, that in all cases where any of the persons 
aforesaid, arc or may be amenable to the law martial, 
the Superintendent be, and he is hereby authorised 
and directed, if he shall deem it most expedient for 
the public service, to put them in arrest by order in 
writing, and to apply to the officer whose duty it may 
be, to order a court martial ; and such officer is hereby 
directed to order proceedings on the arrest accord- 
ingly. 

That in every case of suspension, all pay and emol- 
uments cease from the date thereof, unless the persons 
suspended be, upon trial, acquitted and restored ; and 
the Superintendent shall have power to supply the 
place when it may be necessary, b}' a temporary ap- 
pointment, to continue until the person suspended be 
restored or dismissed. 

That the aforesaid powers shall not be construed to 
interfere with the rank, commission, or military duty 
of any officer in the line of the army, or those who 
may be duly intrusted with money for secret services 
by Congress, or the Commander in Chief of the army, 
or commanding officer of a separate department. 

That the powers aforesaid be exercised during the 
pleasure of Congress, but not to extend beyond the 
duration of the war. 



360 ROBERT MORRIS. 

April 27th. On a further report of the committee 
on Mr Morris's letter of the 13th ultimo, 

Resolved, that in order that the Superintendent of 
Finance may be at liberty to devote his time and at- 
tention to the more immediate duties of his office, he 
be, and hereby is authorised, to appoint by letter of 
attorney, or otherwise, such person or persons, as he 
may think proper, to prosecute or defend for him, in 
his official capacity, or in behalf of the United Statc3, 
in all places where the same may be necessary. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS, 

Philadelphia, May 14th, 1781. 
Sir, 

The ho:;or conferred by Congress in appointing me 
Superintendent of Finance, their several resolutions of the 
20(h of March, and the 21st and 27th of April, which 
your Excellency has been pleased to transmit, and a 
serious conviction of that duty, which every citizen owes to 
his country, especially in limes of public calamity, will no 
longer permit me to hesitate about the acceptance of that 
office, although 1 must again repeat, that I have the fullest 
sense of my own inability. 1 shall, however, strive to find 
such assistance as will enable me, in some measure, to 
answer the reasonable expectations of Congress, to whom 
I can promise for myself nothing more than honest industry. 

You will readily perceive, that much time must be con- 
sumed in procuring proper officers ; fixing on men for 
assistants, whose abilities and integrity may be depended 
on ; in laying plans for obtaining money with the greatest 
ease to the people, and expending it with the greatest 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE, 3GI 

advantage to the public; forming arrangements necessary 
to cany these plans into execution ; and obtaining infor- 
mation as to the present state of things, in order that abuses 
may be, if possible, speedily and effectually remedied. 

Besides this, it will be necessary that I should confer 
with the Commander in Chief, on the various expenditures 
of the war, and the means of retrenching swell as .are 
unnecessary. Let me add, that the accounts of my piivate 
business must be adjusted, so as that all my affairs may be 
put into the hands of other persons, and subjected to their 
management. My necessary commercial connexions, not- 
withstanding the decided sense of Congress, expressed in 
their resolution of the 20th of March, might, if the business 
were transacted by myself, give rise to illiberal reflections, 
equally painful to me and injurious to the public. This 
reason alone would deserve great attention ; but, further, 
I expect that my whole time, study, and attention wiil 
be necessarily devoted to the various business of my 
department. 

Having thus stated some of the causes, which will pre- 
vent me from immediately entering on the arduous task 
assigned me, I pray leave to call the attention of Congress 
to the advanced season, and then I am persuaded their 
own good sense will render it unnecessary for me to 
observe, that very little can be expected from my exer- 
tions during the present campaign ; they will, therefore, 
easily perceive the propriety of the request 1 am to make, 
that the business may go on according to the present 
arrangements, or such other as Congress may devise, until 
1 can take it up, which 1 promise to do as speedily as 
possible. By this means, 1 may be enabled so to dispose 
of the several members of my department, as to form them 
vol. xi. 4G 



362 ROBERT MORRIS. 

into a regular system ; whereas, by throwing the whole 
immediately upon me, [ shall be inevitably involved in a 
labyrinth of confusion, from which no human efforts can 
ever afterwards extricate me. 

Another consideration of great magnitude, to which I 
must also pray the attention of Congress, is the present 
public debts. I am sure no gentleman can hope that these 
should be immediately paid out of an empty treasury. If 
I am to receive and consider the applications on that sub- 
ject, if I am to be made responsible, that alone will, I fear, 
be full employment for the life of one man, and some ether 
must be chosen to attend to the present and provide for the 
future. But this not all ; if from that, or any other cause, 
I am forced to commit a breach of faith, or even to incur 
the appearance of it, from that moment my utility ceases. 
In accepting the office bestowed on me, I sacrifice much 
of my interest, my ease, my domestic enjoyments, and 
internal tranquillity. If 1 know my own heart, I make 
these sacrifices with a disinterested view to the service of 
my country. I am ready to go still further; and the 
United States may command everything I have, except my 
integrity, and the loss of that would effectually disable me 
from serving them more. What I have to pray, then, is, 
that the adjustment of all past transactions, and of all that 
relates to the present system, may be completed by the 
means already adopted, that whatever remains unpaid may 
become a funded debt, and that it may in that form be 
committed to me, to provide for the yearly interest and for 
the eventual discharge of the principal. This task I will 
cheerfully undertake ; and if, in the progress of things, I 
am enabled to go further, with equal cheerfulness it shall 
be done ; but 1 must again repeat my serious conviction, 
that the least breach of faith must ruin us forever. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 363 

It is not from vanity that I mention the expectations, 
which the public seem to have formed from my appoint- 
ment. On the contrary, I am persuaded, they are raised 
on a weak foundation, and I must lament them, because I 
foresee they must be disappointed. I must, therefore, 
entreat that no flattering prospect of immediate relief may 
be raised. 

Congress will know that the public credit cannot be 
restored without method, economy, and punctual per- 
formance of contracts. Time is necessary to each ; and 
therefore the removal of those evils we labor under can be 
expected from time only. To hold out a different idea 
would deceive the people, and consequently injure the 
public service. 

I am sure it is unnecessary to add, before I close this 
letter, that 1 confidently expect my measures will meet 
with the fullest support from Congress, so long as they are 
honestly directed to the general welfare. In this convic- 
tion, and with every sentiment of respectful atten'ion, I 

have the honor to be, &tc. 

ROBERT MORRIS.* 

* May L4th. Wrote a letter to the President, promising- to accept 
the office. At this time, however, various reasons occurred to prevent 
an immediate acceptance of the Commission ; but particularly it was 
necessary to retain my seat in the Assembly of Pennsylvania, in 
order to lay a foundation for such measures as might tend to their 
support of me in pursuing the public good, not doubting but their 
example would have proper influence on the Legislatures of the 
other States, especially in their determination upon general points, 
such as their repealing those tender and penal laws, which in their 
operation had destroyed all public and private confidence and credit; 
in passing effective tax bills, that might yield substantial aid to the 
United States for calling in the paper money, that had lost its credit; 
and in adopting plans of reviving and establishing the credit of

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, May 17th, 1781. 
Sir, 

I beg leave to submit the enclosed plan for 3stabli.«hing 
a National Bank in these United States, and the Observa- 
tions on it, to the perusal and consideration ol Congress. 

Anticipation of taxes and funds is all that ought to be 
expected from any system of paper credit. This seems 
as likely to rise into a fabric equal to the weight, as any I 
have yet seen or thought of J and I submit whether it 
may not be necessary and proper, that Congress should 
make immediate application to the several Slates, to invest 
them wit!) the powers of incorporating a bank, and for 
prohibiting all other brinks, or bankers, in these States, at 
least during the war.* 

1 have the honor to be, &:c. 

ROBERT MORRIS. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, May 23d, 1781. 
Sir, 

As I have heard in times past, that the treasury has fre- 
quently been in want of hard money, to comply with en- 
gagements made with the approbation ol Congress, and 
sometimes obliged to obtain it on terms inconsistent with 

such as had been injured in some degree, but which, being neces- 
sary in circulation, and originally issued on funds sufficient for its 
redemption, ought not to be given up to ruin, if possible to prevent 
it. Diaiy.

Observations on it, in John Jay's Correspondence, Vol. VII. p. 444. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 3G5 

die dignity of government, and not very consonant to the 
public interest, I would wish to guard against the like in- 
conveniences by importing from foreign countries a supply at 
least sufficient to pay rents of the houses and offices neces- 
sarily employed for tl.e Continental service ; also to answer, 
as far as may be, the calls for secret service. And even 
if I could devise the means of obtaining it, I should sup- 
pose it would be agieeable to bring such sums as may an- 
swer other valuable purposes; but as it cannot be imported 
but at the risk of being captured by the enemy, and the 
danger of the elements, you will perceive the necessity of 
my being authorised by Congress to enter on and execute 
this business at the risk, and for account of the Continent, 
en the best terms in my power. 

The sum may be limited if thought needful ; although I 
should suppose it is not possible in our circumstances to 
obtain too much ; yet the stun to be risked in any one bot- 
tom may very properly not exceed a certain amount in a 
lino of battle ship, or frigate, and a smaller in any one mer- 
chant vessel. Should Congress think proper to authorise 
these measures, as I hope they will, the private journals 
will be most proper to insert the proceedings in; as a want 
of secrecy may endanger the money.

TO ALEXANDER HAMILTON. 

Philadelphia, May 2Cth, 1781. 

Sir, 
It is some time sir.ee I received your performance, dated 
the 30ih of April last. 1 have read it with that attention, 



366 ROBERT MORRIS. 

which it justly deserves, and finding many parts of it to 
coincide with my own opinions on the subject, it naturally 
strengthened that confidence, which every man ought to 
possess to a certain degree in his own judgment. 

You will very soon see the plan of a bank published, 
and subscriptions opened for its establishment, having al- 
ready met with the approbation of Congress. It only re- 
mains for individuals to do their part, and a foundation will 
be laid for the anticipation of taxes and funds, by a paper 
credit that cannot depreciate. The capital proposed fell 
far short of your idea ; and, indeed, far short of what it 
ought to be ; but I am confident if this is once accom- 
plished, the capital may afterwards be increased to almost 
any amount. To propose a large sum in the outset, and 
fail in the attempt to raise it, would be fatal. To begin 
with what is clearly within our power to accomplish, and 
on that beginning to establish the credit, that will inevitably 
command the future increase of capital, seems the most 
certain road to success. 

1 have thought much about interweaving a security^pntb 
the capital of this bank, but am apprehensive it would 
convey to the public mind an idea- of paper being circulated 
on that credit, and that the bank in consequence must fail 
in its payments, in case of any considerable run on it ; and 
we must expect, that its ruin will be attempted by external 
and internal foes. I have, therefore, left that point to the 
future deliberations of the Directors of this bank, to whom 
in due time, I shall communicate your address. 

I esteem myself much your debtor for this piece, not 
merely on account of the persona] respect you have been 
pleased to express, but chiefly on account of your good 
intentions ; and for these, and the pains you have taken, I 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 367 

not only think, but on all proper occasions shall say, the 
public are also indebted to you. 

IVJy office is new, and I am young in the execution of it. 
Communications from men of genius and abilities, will 
always be acceptable, and yours will ever command the 
attention of, Sir, your obedient humble servant,

TO MAJOR GENERAL PHILIP SCHUYLER. 

Philadelphia, May 29th, 1781. 
Dear Sir, 

You will probably have heard that Congress have done 
me the honor to bestow their confidence, by appointing me 
to the important station of Superintendent of Finance of 
North America ; a station that makes me tremble when I 
think of it, and which nothing could tempt me to accept, 
but a gleam of hope, that my exertions may possibly re- 
trieve this poor distressed country from the ruin with which 
it is now threatened, merely for want of system and econ- 
omy in spending, and vigor in raising the public moneys. 
Pressed by all my friends, acquaintances, and fellow citi- 
zens, and still more pressed by the necessity, the absolute 
necessity, of a change in our monied system, to work salva- 
tion, I have yielded, and taken a load on my shoulders, 
which it is impossible to get clear of without the faithful 
support and assistance of those good citizens, who not only 
wish, but will promote the service of their country. In 
this light I now make application to you, Sir, whose abili- 
ties I know, and whose zeal I have every reason to believe. 
The object, however, before me, is not of such magnitude 
as to require any great exertion of either at present, al- 






36S ROBERT MORRIS. 

though it is of sufficient importance 10 induce the invoca- 
tion. 

General Washington is distressed for want of an imme- 
diate supply of flour, and as 1 am not even yet fairly en- 
tered on the execution of my office, and when I do, have 
to meet an empty treasury, and a totally exhausted credit, 
it must he some time hefore lunds can be created or mo- 
ney be commanded for any purpose whatsoever ; and as I 
do not know any gentleman of such resources as General 
Schuyler, he seems the most lil<ely of all men to give as- 
sistance under the present circumstances. 1 must, theie- 
fore, request that you will lake the most speedy anil effec- 
tual measures to deliver to the order of his Excellency, 
General Washington, one thousand barrels of flour, which 
1 am sure you will purchase and cause to be transported 
on the most reasonable terms that are practicable. No 
lime must be lost, but the flour must be sent down in the 
parcels as f.isl as procured. The Pennsylvania Bank had 
all the flour they supplied to the army, secured with out- 
side lining hoops on each head of every barrel, and the 
weight and tare marked on each cask. If you were to 
cause this to be done, and add to the mark your name, it 
would save a waste of flour, oblige the Issuing Commissary 
to take notice of an account f~r the weights as well as bar- 
rels, and teach the army to think that they are indebted to 
your exertions for a seasonable supply. 

I have the means of raising hard money to pay for this 
flour, and the charges on il ; but the longer time I am al- 
lowed to do it, the more 1 can consult the public interest. 
1 take it for granted, that you can, upon your own credit 
and engagements, either borrow the money for a few 
mouths, necessary to accomplish this business j or that you 



w 

DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 369 

can make the purchases on such credit, without giving 
higher prices ; and for your reimbursement, you may either 
take me as a public or a private man, for I pledge myself 
to repay you with hard money wholly, if required, or part 
hard and part paper, if you so transact the business. In 
short, I promise, and you may rely, that no consideration 
whatever, shall induce me to make a promise, that I do 
not see my capability to perform, that I will enable you to 
fulfil your engagements for this supply of flour. If you 
find it convenient, you may draw on me for hard money or 
paper, payable in such sums, and at such times, as you can 
conceive may not be inconvenient, judging by what I have 
said on this subject. #hould good bills on France be 
wanted, at about hard money your currency, for five 

livres tournois, I will furnish them, drawn or endorsed by 
myself, for the whole, or any part of this purchase. 

I hope we shall hereafter supply our army by contracts, 
and your information and observations on this subject would 
be very obliging. Perhaps if you are not fully employed 
otherwise, you might start some worthy man under your 
patronage, that might render essential service to the public, 
with proper advantage to himself and connexions in this 
line. 

I am, Dear Sir, yours, &c. 

ROBERT MORRIS. 

P. S. Remember, that I put absolute dependence on 
you for this one thousand barrels of flour, and it must be 
sent to the army directly.

TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, June 4th, 1781. 
Sir, 

Having been informed by several members of Congress, 
as also by bis Excellency, tbe Chevalier de la Luzerne, 
that it was determined to put the management of the 
moneys lately granted by bis Most Christian Majesty under 
my direction, in order that they might be punctually ap- 
plied to the purposes for which the grant was made, viz. 
a vigorous prosecution of the present campaign ; 1 had, in 
conjunction with the Minister of France, formed some ar- 
rangements for drawing part of this money into immediate 
use; but, on applying to the Secretary of Congress, I do 
not find that any act has been passed giving me authority 
over the moneys so granted ; consequently, all proceedings 
must stop until the previous steps are taken by Congress. 
I have, the honor to be, he. 

ROBERT MORRIS. 



TO B. FRANKLIN. 

Philadelphia, June 8th, 1781. 
Dear Sir, 

In a private letter, which I did myself the honor to 
write you on the 6th instant, F announced the appointment 
I have received from the honorable Congress, to the office 
of Superintendent of the Finances of the United States of 
North America ; and I now beg leave to address you in 
my official character. 

Congress have thought proper to commit to me the dis- 
position and management of the money granted to the 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 371 

United States by his Most Christian Majesty, in aid, of our 
operations for the present campaign, in order that the same 
may be solely applied to that use ; and for this reason, I 
have found it necessary to keep the whole sum of this 
grant separate and distinct from any other, so that its ap- 
plication may at any time be clearly seen. Instead, there- 
fore, of drawing upon your Excellency, who have many 
other bills running upon you, I have judged it expedient to 
name Messrs Le Couteulx &t Co., bankers in Paris, to 
receive the money from his Majesty's Ministers, so that 
they may be able to honor my bills with acceptance when- 
ever they appear, and punctually to acquit them as they 
fall due. I have written to Messrs Le Couteulx, that you 
would join and support them in any application that may 
become needful to his Majesty or his Ministers, whLh I 
hope you will readily do. 

And, on the other hand, your attention to the interest of 
this country will lead you to inform yourself whether the 
house of Le Couteulx and Company, are as perfectly safe 
and rich as they ought to be, to entitle them to this trust. 
They are represented to me as one of the safest and most 
prudent banking houses in Europe ; and his Excellency, 
the Minister of France at this place, now writes to have 
five hundred thousand livres tournois deposited with them, 
on account of the United States, subject to my drafts or 
orders. Should their credit not entitle them to this trust, 
you will please to interfere, and consult with M. Necker 
what banker to employ in such case, directing those you 
do employ, to accept and pay my drafts. However, I 
imagine these gentlemen will be found sufficiently safe. 

Should it be more agreeable to M. Necker that any 
other banker be made use of, give me the name and write 



372 ROBERT MORRIS. 

me the propriety of such alteration, and I shall acquiesce 

in such change immediately on the receipt of your letter, 

for I have no partiality in public business. All I wish is 

to act with security, and to the best advantage. 

If you think "it proper to inquire into the terms on which 

the bankers will receive and pay this money, and settle 

their commissions on the most reasonable footing, ] shall 

be happy in your doing so. I do not, however, wish to 

give you any trouble that is not proper and necessary ; 

being, with the highest respect, your Excellency's most 

obedient, humble servant, 

ROBERT MORRIS. 



TO MESSRS LE COUTEULX &£ CO., BANKERS IN PARIS. 

Philadelphia, June 8th, 1781. 

Gentlemen, 

In a private letter, 1 have already informed you of my 
appointment, by the honorable Congress, to the office of 
Superintendent of the Finances of the United States of 
North America ; and in that character I now address you. 

His Most Christian Majesty having been graciously 
pleased to grant an aid of money for the purpose of in- 
vigorating our operations during the present campaign, I 
find it convenient to make use of your house as bankers to 
receive from his Majesty's Ministers such sums as they 
may have occasion to deposit, in order that you may 
accept and pay my drafts on you as fast as they shall 
appear. His Excellency, the Minister Plenipotentiary of 
France at this place, now writes to his Court, at my re- 
quest, desiring that five hundred thousand livres tournois 
may be placed in your hands thirty days after the receipt 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 373 

of his letter, the said sum to be subject to my drafts or 
orders, and I shall proceed to draw upon you as fast as 
purchasers offer for the bills; therefore, I beg you will be 
prepared to honor my bills, drawn as Superintendent of 
Finance, whenever they offer ; for I would not, on any 
account, that there should be the least demur ; and I am 
confident, that his Most Christian Majesty's Minister of 
Finance will enable you punctually to make payment as 
they fall due. I shall communicate this matter to his 
Excellency, Benjamin Franklin, Minister Plenipotentiary 
from these States to the Court of Versailles, who will join 
you in any application chat may become necessary in this 
business ; which, however, I expect will be conducted 
much to your satisfaction. And as it may become im- 
portant, I hope your attention to it can be relied on, and 
that you will render the charges as moderate as possible. 
I have the honor to be, he. 

ROBERT MORRIS. 



TO M. DE LA LUZERNE, MINISTER OF FRANCE. 

Philadelphia, June 8th, 1781. 

Sir, 
The honorable Congress having thought proper to invest 
me with the power, disposition, and management of the 
moneys granted by his Most Christum Majesty to the United 
States, for the purpose of assisting them to carry on the 
present campaign with vigor, I have, with your concur- 
rence, taken some arrangements for drawing it into the 
uses for which the grant has been made ; and in conformity 
with your promise, 1 pray you to write immediately to his 
Majesty's Ministers, that they cause the sum of five hun- 



374 ROBERT MORRIS. 

dred thousand livres tournois to be deposited with Messrs 
Le Couteulx & Co., bankers in Paris, for account of 
the United States of North America, and subject to my 
drafts or orders as Superintendent of Finance of the said 
United States. 

This deposit I hope may, without inconvenience, be 
made in thirty days after the receipt of your letter; and I 
shall proceed to draw on Messrs Le Couteulx & Co. in 
full confidence thereof, until my bills on them shall amount 
to the said sum of five hundred thousand livres tournois, 
when I will give you timely notice, that another deposit 
may be made for the like purpose, and by this means I 
hope we shall occasion as little trouble to his Majesty's 
Minister of Finance as the nature of this transaction will 
admit of. 

With great respect and esteem, &o. 

ROBERT MORRIS. 



CIRCULAR RESPECTING THE NATIONAL BANK. 

Philadelphia, June lllh, 1781. 
Sir, 

No doubt you have seen in the public papers, the plan 
for establishing a National Bank, the necessity of which 
everybody sees, that allows himself the least time for 
reflection on the present state of public credit. All the 
public bodies in America have, more or less, lost the 
confidence of the world as to money matters, by trying 
projects and applying expedients to stop a course of depre- 
ciation, which original errors had fixed too deeply to admit 
of any radical cure. 

It is in vain to think of carrying on war any longer by 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 375 

means of such a depreciating medium, and at the same 
time an efficient circulation of paper that cannot depre- 
ciate, is absolutely necessary to anticipate the revenues of 
America. A National Bank is not only the most certain, 
but will prove the most useful and economical mode of 
doing so. It is, therefore, of the utmost importance that 
this first essay, confined as it is in point of capital, should 
be brought into aciion with the greatest expedition. I am 
sensible that plans of public utility, however promising and 
pleasing they may be on their first appearance, soon grow 
languid, unless it be the particular busi.iess of some man, 
or set of men, to urge them forward ; this may be said to 
be my duty in the present instance. But as I cannot be 
everywhere, I must apply for support to gentlemen of your 
character and zeal for the service of their country, request- 
ing in the most earnest manner, that you will urge your 
friends and fellow citizens to become proprietors of this 
bank stock. 

Every subscriber will find his own interest benefited in 
proportion to the capital he deposits, and I dare say few 
will find the other parts of their fortunes to yield them so 
large or so certain an income as the stock they may have 
in the bank ; and at the same time they will have the satis- 
faction to be considered forever as the promoters of an 
institution that has been found beneficial to other countries, 
and inevitably must be so in the highest degree to this ; an 
institution, that most probably will continue as long as the 
United States, and that will become as useful to commerce 
and agriculture in the days of peace, as it must be to 
government during the war. 

The capital proposed is but small, when the extent and 
riches of the United States are considered ; but when put 






376 ROBERT MORRIS. 

in motion, the benefits flowing from it will be so percep- 
tible, that all difficulty about increasing the capital or 
securing its credit, will vanish, and we shall only have to 
appeal to the interest of mankind, which, in most cases, 
will do more than their patriotism ; but there have been, 
and will continue to be, many instances, where interest is 
sacrificed to patriotism ; and in that belief, I ask you to 
devote some of your time to this infant plan, which, as it 
gathers strength, may in the end prove the means of saving 
the liberties, lives, and property of the virtuous part of 
America. My good opinion of you is an excuse for giving 
you this interruption. 

I am, Sir, yours, &tc. 

ROBERT MORRIS. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Philadelphia, June 21st, 1781. 
Sir, 

I find that the new payment of the moneys due to the 

subscribers to the Pennsylvania Bank materially injures 

and impedes the subscription to the National Bank. At 

the same time, I am informed, that Congress are unwilling 

to dispose of the bills lodged as a security, lest the Minister 

of the United States at Madrid should be incommoded by 

it. I have the honor to observe to your Excellency, that 

if these bills shall be submitted to my disposal, 1 think I 

can pay the debts above mentioned, and cause the greater 

part of the money to be subscribed to the National Bank, 

thereby rescuing, in some measure, the public credit and 

forwarding the service, while, at the same time, I shall put 

the bills in such a train of negotiation, that at least a very 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE 377 

considerable time must elapse before they can be pre- 
sented, and probably they may not be presented at all. 
1 have the honor to be, &tc. 

ROBERT MORRIS.* 



TO B. FRANKLIN. 

Philadelphia, July 13th, 1781. 
Sir, 

The unanimous appointment to the Superintendency of 
our Finances, with which Congress have honored me, and 
my conviction of the necessity that some one person should 
endeavor to introduce method and economy into the admin- 
istration of affairs, have induced me, thorgh with reluc- 
tance, to accept that office. Mr Jay will receive by this 
conveyance, and forward to you, copies of those resolutions 
and letters which may be necessary to explain my appoint- 
ment and powers. 

I wish I could as readily effect, as I most ardently desire, 
the accomplishment of all proper arrangements. Thorough- 
ly convinced that no country is truly independent, until, 
with her own credit and resources, she is able to defend 
herself and correct her enemies, it shall be my constant 
endeavor to establish our credit and draw out our resources 

* July 4th. I met the Directors of the Pennsylvania Bank, and a 
number of the subscribers to that bank called, at my desire; and 
I proposed that they should transfer their subscriptions from the 
Pennsylvania to the National Bank, and deliver up to me the bills 
of exchange deposited by Congress with the Directors as security ; 
and I undertook to place the amount of what remained due to them 
from Congress, in the hands of Messrs Clymer & Nixon, in pay- 
ment of such transferred subscriptions to the National Bank ; which 
all that were present agreed to. Diary. 

vol. xi. 48 



578 ROBERT MORRIS. 

in such manner, that we may Le little burdensome, and 
essential'}' u-efu! to our friends. 

I a:n sure I need not mention to you the importrnce of 
collecting a revenue with ease, and expending it with 
economy. As little need I detail the time, the authority, 
the ability, the favorable circumstances, that must combine 
for these purposes. But I think that J may* assert, that 
the situation of a country just emerging from dependence 
and struggling for existence, is peculiarly unfavorable ; and 
I may add, that this country, by relying loo much on paper, 
is in a condition of peculiar disorder and debility. To 
rescue and restore her, is an object equal to my warmest 
wishes, though probably beyond the stretch of my abilities. 

Success will greatly depend on the pecuniary aid we 

may obtain from abroad ; because money is necessary to 

introduce economy, while, at the same time, economy is 

necessary to obtain money ; besides that a greater plenty 

of solid circulating medium is required to support those 

operations, which must give stability to our credit, fruitful- 

ness to our revenue, and activity to our operations. Among 

those things, which, after the experience and example of 

other ages and nations, I have been induced to adopt, is 

that of a national bank, the plan of which I enclose. I 

mean to render this a principal pillar of American credit, 

so as to obtain the money of individuals for the benefit of 

the Union, and thereby bind those individuals more strongly 

to the general cause by the ties of private interest. To 

the efficacy of this plan, as well as to the establishment of 

a Mint, which would also be cf use, a considerable sum 

of money is necessary, and, indeed, it is indispensably so 

for many other purposes. 

He not alarmed, Sir, from what I have said, with the 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 579 

apprehension that I am abir.H to direct solicitat'ons to the 
Court of Versailles ; which, after the repeated favors they 
have conferred, must he peculiarly disagreeable. On the 
contrary, as I am convinced that the moneys of France 
will all be usefully employed in the vigorous prosecution of 
the war, hv her own fleets and armies, I lament every sum 
wh'ch is diverted from them. Our necessities have indeed 
called for her aid, and perhaps they may continue to do so. 
Those calls have i.itherto been favorably attended to, and 
the pressure of our necessities has been generously alle- 
viated ; nor do I at all doubt that future exigencies will 
excite the same dispositions in our favor, and that those 
dispositions will be followed with correspondent effects. 
But I again repeat my wish, at once to render America 
independent of, and useful to her Iriends. 

With these views, I have directed Mr Jay to ask a con- 
siderable sum from the Court of Madrid, to be advanced 
us at the Havana, and brought thence by us, if it cannot 
conveniently be landed here from Spanish men-of-war.* 
I say a considerable sum, because, as I have declared to 
him, I do not wish to labor under the weight of obligation 
without deriving from it any real benefit; and because I 
consider the advance of small sums rather as a temporary 
palliation than a radical remedy. Our disorders are sue!), 
that the former can be of no use, and it would be better to 
desist in a desultory defence, than to put on the delusive 
appearances of a vigor we do not feel ; for this lulls the 
people into a dangerous secmity, and softens those hopes 
of the enemy, which give duration and extent to the war. 
It is the disorder of our finances, winch have prevented us 

* See a letter from Mr Morris, in John Jay's Correspondence, Vol. 
VII. p. 42J. 



380 ROBERT MORRIS 

from a powerful co-operation with our allies, and which 
have enabled the enemy to linger on our coasts with the 
dregs of a force once formidable ; and it is from this 
cause that they have been permitted to extend the theatre, 
and multiply the victims of their ambition. 

America alone will not derive benefit from the advances 
which Spain may make to her. All the associates in the 
war will feel the consequential advantages. The expense 
of the American war now hangs a heavy weight about the 
neck of Britain, and enfeebles her on that element, which 
she called her own. An increase of that expense, or the 
loss of her posts here, must necessarily follow from ad- 
ditional efforts on our part, and either of these must be a 
consequential bendit to those who are opposed to her. 
France will derive a small immediate benefit from it, as 
she will thereby get more money here for her bills of ex- 
change, than she can at present procure. But it is not so 
much from any advantage, which may be expected to that 
kingdom, or from any motives of interest, as from the gen- 
erosity and magnanimity of the Prince, that we hope for 
support. 1 will not doubt a moment, that at your instance, 
his Majesty will make pressing representations in support 
of Mr Jay's application, and I hope that the authority of 
so great a Sovereign, and the arguments of his able Min- 
istry, will shed auspicious influence on our negotiations at 
Madrid. 

From the best returns 1 have been able to collect, and 
which are in some measure imperfect, from the confusions 
and disasters of the Southern States, I find that there are 
about seven millions two hundred thousand dollars due on 
certificates, which bear an interest of six percent, payable 
in France, at the rate of five livres for every dollar. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 381 

Many causes have conspired to depreciate the certificates, 
notwithstanding the interest is so well secured, and has 
been punctually paid. This depreciation is so great, that 
they are daily offered for sale at a very considerable dis- 
count, which is attended with two pernicious conse- 
quences ; one, that a considerable expense is unneces- 
sarily incurred, and the other, that the public credit is un- 
necessarily impaired. If I bad ihe means, therefore, I 
would remove this evil by purchasing in the certificates; 
and to procure the means, I am to pray that you would 
state this matter fully to the Ministers of his Most Christian 
Majesty. The interest being guarantied by the Court of 
France, they now pay for this purpose, two millions one 
hundred and sixty thousand livres annually ; a sum, which 
in less than ten years, would pay a debt of fifteen millions 
of livres at five per cent interest. With fifteen millions of 
livres, however, prudently managed, the whole of these 
certificates might be paid. I am sure it is unnecessary to 
dwell on the advantages, which would result from making 
such a loan for this purpose, and, I trust, that if this matter 
is stated to M. Necker, that enlightened Minister will co- 
operate in the plan, to the utmost of his ability. I again 
repeat, that I do not wish to lay any burdens on France ; 
but this proposal is calculated to relieve us both ; and, in 
any case, the expense to France will be the same. 
Should it be adopted, I must request the earliest notice, 
that my operations may commence ; and, in any case, I 
hope that secrecy will be observed, for the most evident 
reasons. 

I am sorry to inform you, that we have as yet no satis- 
factory news of the ship Lafayette ; but, en the contrary, 
her long delay occasions the most alarming apprehensions. 



3S2 ROBERT MORRIS, 

If, as but loo probable, that ship is lost, yon will more 
easily conceive llian 1 can describe what will be the situ- 
ation of our troops next winter. 

1 could wish, as soon as possible, to have a slate of 
all the public, accounts transmitted, to the end ihyt moneys 
due to the United Stales may be paid, and measures 
taken to provide for such sums as they stand indebted in 
to others. Your Excellency will, I (hue say, send ihem 
as s"on as may be convenient ; and I hope the public 
aflVrs will hereafter be conducted in such a nnn»er as to 
give you much less of that unnecessary trouble, which you 
have hitherto experienced, and whit h could not but have 
harassed you exceedingly, and, perhaps, taken up time, 
which would otherwise have been devoted to more im- 
portant objects. 

I shall, probably, have frequent occasion to address yon, 
and shall always be happy to hear from you; but the mis- 
chiefs, which aiise from having letters intercepted, are 
great and alarming. I have, therefore, enclosed you a 
cypher, and in the duplicate of my letters, I shall enclose 
another. If both anive, you will use one, and, in case of 
your absence, leave the other with such person as may 
supply your place. Let me know, however, which cypher 
you use. 

The bearer of this letter, Maj~>r Franks, formerly an 
Aid-de-camp to Genera! Arnold, and honorably acquitted 
of all connexion with him, after a full and impartial in- 
quiry, will be able to give you our public news more par- 
ticularly than I could relate them. He sails hence for 
Cadiz, and on his arrival will proceed to Madrid, where 
having delivered my letters to .Mr Jay, he will take his 
orders for you. He will then wait your orders, and, 1 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 333 

hope, will soon after meet a safe opportunity of coming to 

America. 

With the most perfect esteem ami regard, I have the 

honor to be, Sic. 

ROBERT MORRIS. 



TO B. FRANKLIN. 

Philadelphia, July 14th, 1731. 
Dear Sir, 

If Mh {or Franks had departed yesterday, as was ex- 
ppcted. he would have left the enclosed cypher behind. 
It was supposed to have been will) the plans of the in- 
tended hank, but was left out by accident. I wish yon 
would, when leisure and opportunity will permit, con- 
verse with some of the eminent bankers in Paris on this 
plan, and ask whether a correspondence and connexion 
with the directors will be agreeable, and whether they 
would establish a credit for this bank, and to what amount, 
to be replaced again by remittances in other bills within 
such lime as they may limit. Or, if they decline giving 
such credit, then the terms on which they will receive re- 
mittances and pay drafts of the bank. 

An American bank must deal largely in bills of ex- 
change. It will thereby rule the price of bills so as to 
keep it pretty steady, by passing most of the bills drawn 
on the continent through their channel, so as to leave a 
certain moderate profit. And the use of a credit in En- 
rope will be, to have paid for their honor such bills as may 
be protested on account of the drawers; by which means 
the bank will secure the damages of twenty per cent, and 
pay only interest for advance and commission for nego-

tiating. Occasion may also offer, when the bank, by 
drawing on Europe, shall get a high price for bills, and in 
a few months replace them much cheaper. 

I do not wish to give you trouble on this occasion ; but, 
if opportunities offer, you can mention the subject, and if 
any of the bankers will write me proposals, I will lay them 
before the directors. You will tell them, that although the 
very moderate sum of four hundred thousand dollars is 
proposed as the first capital, I intend to increase it gradu- 
ally to ten times that sum. The only difficulty is to get it 
into action now that people have but little money and 
less confidence. I should be glad to see your name in 
the list of subscribers to an institution, that 1 believe will 
be permanent. 

I ever am, Dear Sir, yours, &ic. 

ROBERT MORRIS. 



TO THE GOVERNOR OF HAVANA. 

Philadelphia, July 17th, 1781. 
Sir, 

The favorable attention shown to me by your Excel- 
lency in my private character, has excited those sentiments 
of esteem and respect, which now impel me to ask your 
assistance for my country. 

The United States of North America, are at the present 
moment, possessed of more strength in men, arms, and 
ammunition, than when they first ventured to wage war 
with Great Britain. The means of subsistence are abun- 
dantly equal to our own wants, and will essentially contri- 
bute to the relief of our friends. A variety of causes, too 
numerous to be detailed in the compass of a letter, have 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 335 

combined to destroy the credit of that paper money, which 
has enabled us hitherto to support the war. It has there- 
fore become necessary to provide the means for paying 
the expenses to be incurred hereafter. Our people are 
not yet inured to taxation, neither has the revenue, which 
this country is capable of affording, been drawn fairly or 
fully into use. The derangement of our credit and finances, 
consequent upon the loss of faith in our paper, rendered 
it necessary for Congress to create a Superintendent of 
the Finances of the United States, in order, that he might 
regulate and settle the present debts, point out new funds, 
with the best means of collecting them, and superintend 
the public expenditures, so as to prevent as much as pos- 
sible all excess or abuse. This arduous task is assigned 
to me, by a unanimous choice of that honorable body ; and 
nothing couJd have induced me to undertake it, but my 
perfect conviction, that it is necessary that some person 
should undertake the work of reformation and economy. 
I have engaged in this business with the sole view of sav- 
ing my country, and therefore think myself entitled to 
seek support from all who are really friends to her inde- 
pendency, and particularly from those nations, which have 
become parties in the war. 

I have commenced my administration with a proposal 
to establish a National Bank ; the plan of which I take the 
liberty to enclose. The subscriptions to it are going on, 
and I expect the very moderate sum therein proposed will 
soon be completed. When that is done, the directors will 
be chosen, incorporated, and proceed on their business. 
As the bank notes are intended to be made use of by 
government in anticipation of the revenues of this country, 
vol. xi. 49 



386 ROBERT MORRIS. 

you will easily perceive, lhat the sum proposed is far 
short of the object, which it is intended to accomplish. 
My present pursuit, therefore, is to obtain such additional 
sums as will, when deposited in the bank, not only facil- 
itate the anticipations above mentioned, but induce further 
subscriptions among our own countrymen. For when 
they see and feel the use of an institution, which they are 
yet unacquainted with, they will cheerfully and liberally 
support it. 

It is to your Excellency that I apply for foreign aid. 
The vicinity of your situation, the frequent intercourse 
between your port and this, and your ability to comply 
With what I shall request, all point out the propriety of 
that application. Your friendly disposition towards thes^ 
Uu'it d Sum s, and above all your strong attachment to 
the interests <>: yu wr own country, will dispose. you to yield 
me every assistance in your power. The United States 
have already received very considerable aid from the 
Court of Madrid. .Much more, however is expected,* 
and in time to come these services will be repaid with 
honor, as they now are acknowledged with gratitude. 

Our distresses induced Congress to order certain bills 
of exchange to be drawn on their Ministers at the Courts 
of Versailles and Madrid. The former have been all ne- 
gotiated and paid off by the assistance of that Court. 
Many of the latter have also been negotiated, and those 
that have appeared for payment have been discharged. 
There is every reason to believe, that this would still hap- 
pen ; but we learn that the advance of money in Europe 

*This anticipation was never realized, as the whole amount of 
the Spanish loan to the United States during the war, was no more 
than one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 387 

is rendered inconvenient during the war, by the imped- 
iments, which it occasions to the usual course of remit- 
tances from his Majesty's American territories. We 
have desisted, therefore, from the further sale of those 
bills, especially as we have reason to expect, that in con- 
sequence of measures adopted here, Mr Jay will obtain 
from your country a much larger sum than we had before 
asked for ; and that the greater part, if not the whole of 
it, will be paid to us at your port. However this may be, 
my present view is to obtain from Havana, as expedi- 
tiously as possible, four hundred thousand Mexican dollars, 
in order to deposit them in the bank, and thereby doubling 
the capital, give its operations such force as will draw the 
attention of our own citizens, and induce them to afford it 
such assistance as will reduce our necessities, and place 
us in a situation to be less troublesome to our allies and 
friends in the common cause. 

His Excellency the Chevalier de la Luzerne, Minister 
of France at this place, in consequence nf orders from his 
Court, has authorised me to draw bill* of exchange on 
Paris to a very considerable amount ; and being sensible? 
of the propriety of my proceedings, he will give you assur- 
ances, that they shall be punctually paid. I transmit a 
bill for five hundred thousand iivres to Robert Smith, now 
appointed agent for these United States at your port, in 
order that he may negotiate it, and ship the money back 
to my address. Should it in any manner promote the 
interest of your Court he will certainly give your Excel- 
lency a preference in the purchase; and I am confident, 
that if this should not be convenient to you, you will coun- 
tenance and promote his negotiations with private persons. 
I have also transmitted to Mr Smith certain bills, drawn 



388 ROBERT MORRIS. 

some time past by order of Congress, on his Excellency 
John Jay, to the amount of one hundred and twenty thou- 
sand, three hundred and eightyone dollars. 1 am to re- 
quest, and have strong hopes, that when Mr Smith shall 
have deposited these bills with you, your Excellency will 
advance that sum, so that he may immediately ship it to 
my address. 

We are convinced that these bills, if sent, forward, 
would have been paid by your Court ; but as such a 
negotiation would bring no money into the treasury, I 
propose that you keep them in your possession until 
the pleasure of the Court shall be known. I will 
write very fully to Mr Jay on this subject, and obtain 
the earliest information. But lest the Court should 
not choose that these bills be finally accepted by you 
in discharge of the moneys advanced on them, I have 
empowered Mr Smith for your perfect security lo 
enter into conditional stipulations to repay your Ex- 
cellency that money by a delivery of flour to the 
amount, at such price as you and he may agree for ; 
the payment to commence as soon after the pleasure of 
the Court shall be known as circumstances will admit. 

I hope, Sir, you will find it agreeable to your incli- 
nations, and perfectly consistent with the duties of 
your station to gratify my desires. They are very 
moderate considering the necessities of this country, 
and your ability to minister to its relief. Besides, 
your Excellency's good sense will readily perceive, 
that money granted to invigorate the operations of 
America will weaken and distress the common enemy 
much more than the same sums expended in Europe, 
because the enemy must prosecute the war here at 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 389 

more than four times the expense at which it must be 
carried on there. 

Assuring myself of assistance from your Excellency 
I have ordered one of the continental frigates to pro- 
ceed with these despatches for Havana. She will take 
with her some flour, which I have ordered returns for 
in dollars. 

There are two most cogent, reasons why this frigate 
should be despatched instantly from your port with 
the money. The first is, because we are much in want 
of it ; and the second is, to prevent our enemies from 
the possibility of receiving any advice of her. We 
have so contrived things here, that everybody be- 
lieves she is going to join the French fleet at Rhode 
Island, and to carry the flour for their use. 

On the whole, I most earnestly entreat your Excel- 
lency, that if it be at all convenient and consistent with 
your duty, you will advance the whole of the four 
hundred thousand dollars in question to Mr Smith, so 
that the frigate may immediately return. 

I am sensible that there are certain duties payable 
to his Majesty on the exportation of money from your 
port; but as this which I apply for, is to be expended 
in carrying on the war against his Majesty's enemies, 
I hope it may be dispensed with; if not, our Minister 
at Madrid will be directed to make application to the 
Court on that subject, so that the duty being charged 
to us in the first instance, may, if not remitted, be 
added to the general sum. The same observations will 
apply to the flour on board this frigate, which is also 
public property. 

I hope it is not necessary to add anything more to 



390 ROBERT MORRIS. 

induce a full compliance with my requests. But his 
Excellency the Chevalier de la Luzerne, Minister of 
France, and Don Francisco Rendon, your own Agent 
here, will also write you on the subject of this appli- 
cation. 

I have the honor to remain, with sentiments of the 
highest esteem and respect, &c* 

ROBERT MORRIS. 



TO ROBERT SMITH, AGENT FOR THE UNITED STATES 

IN CUBA. 

Philadelphia, July 17th, 1781. 
Sir, 

Upon a proper representation of your character, sit- 
uation, and attachments to your country and its cause, 
the Congress of the United States of America have 
thought proper to appoint you their Agent at the port 
of Havana and Island of Cuba. I take much pleasure 
ia transmitting your commission, which you will find 
enclosed herein ; because my knowledge of yon leads 
me to expect every exertion, which your situation and 
the ciicumstances attending it will admit of, in favor 
of your country. 

You will not find any salary annexed to your ap- 
pointment for this plain reason, that we cannot aflbrd 
any. It is our present business to reduce salaries 
heietofore given, and not to creale new ones. This 
appointment, however, may be attended with pecuni- 

*For several letters from Mr Morris to Mr Jay, on the subject of 
loans in Spain, and the National Bank, see John Jays Correspond- 
ence, Vol. VII. pp. 421—449. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 391 

ary advantages, because a public cbaraetcr may, and 
no doubt will, point you out to American merchants 
as tbe proper person to intrust with their commercial 
affairs. Continental prizes and other objects may oc- 
casionally turn up, which will leave a reasonable com- 
mission behind ; and you will have the pleasure of 
serving Congress when necessary, and the citizens and 
commerce of your country, as often as opportunities 
for so doing may occur. 

I shall now put your talents to the proof. You will 
find enclosed a letter I have written for his Excellency 
Governor Navarro (or should he be gone, for his suc- 
cessor) which will unfold to you very fully my 
intentions. You will find enclosed in it for him, as in 
this letter for you, the plan of a National Bank, which 
I have proposed to establish for many valuable pur- 
poses. You will observe that the sum proposed as a 
capital is far short of what it ought to be; but I was 
afraid of attempting too much at first, and must now 
endeavor to increase it by other means. If any of 
your acquaintances in the Havana have a mind to 
speculate in the American funds, I think they cannot 
place their money on a more secure or profitable 
establishment. This Bank will, I believe, exist for 
ages to come; and I am persuaded the annual divi- 
dends will not be less than from eight to ten per cent. 
They may also have the honor and pleasure of seeing 
their names enrolled among the first promoters of this 
useful institution, on which the salvation of our coun- 
try in some measure depends. Should any of them 
incline to subscribe, they must send hither money at 
their own risk ; consigning it to whomsoever they 



392 ROBERT MORRIS. 

please, with power to act for them. I hope you will 
promote this business, and in order that you may be 
able to show the profits arising from it, I am to ob- 
serve, that when once, by punctual payment, the notes 
of the bank have obtained full credit, the sum in spe- 
cie, which will be deposited, will be such, that the 
bank will have the interest of a stock two or three 
times larger than that which it really possesses. 
Should M. Miralles, or any of the family be so 
inclined, I will put any part of their money into the 
bank, which they may think proper. 

By captain James Nicholson, commanding the frigate 
Trumbull, I send a bill of lading and invoice of five hun- 
dred barrels of flour, which is all fresh and good, and a 
considerable part of it superfine. This flour I have caused 
to be shipped to your address, on account and risk of the 
United States of North America. Be pleased to receive 
it as quickly as may be from the ship, make the most ad- 
vantageous sale of it, which you can, and remit the net 
proceeds in Mexican dollars, consigned to my order, for 
account and at the risk of the United States. I evpect 
you will not charge more than five per cent for transacting 
the business, that is, two and a half per cent on the sales, 
and the same on the returns. 

I have also enclosed a bill of exchange, drawn by my- 
self on Messrs Le Couteulx &; Co. bankers in Paris, to the 
amount of five hundred thousand livres tournois ; this bill is 
at sixty days' sight, and you may depend it will be punctually 
paid, for I have the authority of the Court of Versailles to 
draw it, and every assurance I could wish. You will ob- 
serve, by my letter to the Governor, that he is to have the 
refusal of this bill ; you will therefore offer it to him in the 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 303 

first instance. When I consider the risk, which must at- 
tend sending money from Havana to Cadiz, and the remit- 
tances, as well private as public, which are to be made 
from one place to the other, I cannot but persuade myself, 
that unless the government and the people are alike blind 
to their interests, good bills must sell at a very considera- 
ble advance. Should the Governor decline taking the bill 
on Paris, as it is not probable that any one private person 
would purchase it, you may either remit it to the House of 
Le Couteulx h Co. in Paris, or to the House of Messrs. 
J. L. & L. Le Couteulx St Co. at Cadiz, as may be most 
convenient for your operations. You will then draw on 
the House to whom you remit the bill, and sell your bills 
to the same amount. Should you remit to the House in 
Cadiz, let me know it, that I may write and apprize them 
of it ; but this I shall do provisionally, beforehand, so that 
they may be prepared for you. 

1 have also, as you will perceive, written to his Excel- 
lency on the subject of certain other bills of exchange, 
drawn on Mr Jay. You will endeavor to get the money 
for these, if possible ; and in case it is required, you will 
enter the stipulations there mentioned, as to the shipment 
of flour, in this last case, get the flour fixed at as high a 
rale as possible, and let me have due notice, so that I may 
punctually cause to be fulGlled, whatever contracts you 
shall, on the part of the public, have entered into. 

Should his Excellency be inclined to make those ad- 
vances of money, which I have so earnestly pressed upon 
him, you will be able the sooner to despatch the frigate, 
which I hope will be done without delay. But as there is 
a risk in placing large sums on board of any one vessel, I 
am to observe, that if there should be any fast sailing ves- 
vol. xi 50 



394 ROBERT MORRIS. 

sels about to leave the Havana at the same time, and if in 
consideration of convoy, they will take the public money 
freight free, you will then prudently distribute it anion"- 
them, and direct Captain Nicholson to give them signals, 
and to take them under his convoy. But I must caution 
you, that on no consideration is any private property to be 
covered as belonging to the public, either to save the du- 
ties or for any other purpose. You will, therefore, use all 
proper vigilance to prevent everything of this sort, should 
it he attempted. If there are not such vessels as Captain 
Nicholson and ycu shall approve of ready to sail, then ship 
the whole money in the frigate ; for the risk of being way- 
laid by the enemy in consequence of any unnecessary de- 
lay, is greater than that of being otherwise intercepted. 

It is unnecessary for me to mention to you, that we want 
money exceedingly. This very measure must convince 
you of it. Exert yourself therefore to get it, and you will 
merit much at the hands of your country. Should you not 
succeed in getting the whole sum I have asked for, get as 
much as you possibly ran ; and if the Governor should de- 
cline advancing any money on the bills drawn by order of 
Congress on Mr Jay, perhaps the Intendant may accept 
your contract for flour, and take these bills in security, or 
you may possibly borrow on their credit from individuals, 
to be repaid when I shall send you shipments of flour, 
which I will cause to be done so soon as I shall hear from 
you to this effect. 

I have forbidden Captain Nicholson to cruise, but should 
fortune enable him to bring a good prize into Havana, the 
Continent has one half, and yon must send that half to me 
in dollars. Whatever supplies the frig; te is absolutely in 
need of, you must let her have ; but I entreat, that the 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 395 

expenses may be as moderate as possible, and the best 
way to secure this is to despatch her quickly, for the mo- 
ment they get clear of the salt waxer air, and feel their land 
tacks on board, every soul of them will try to get his hands 
into your pockets ; but take care. 

1 have desired Captain Nicholson to consult with and 
obey you whilst in Havana, and to push off whenever you 
say the word. I shall send you flour by private vessels, 
for the sake of getting money back, and write you further, 
as occasion may require. 

I am, Dear Sir, he. 

ROBERT MORRIS. 



TO B. FRANKLIN. 

Philadelphia, July 19th, 1781. 
Sir, 

The foregoing r.re duplicates of my letters of the several 
dates there mentioned, by Major Franks, who has sailed 
for Cadiz. I now enclose to you duplicate copies of the 
letters and resolutions, referred to in mine of the thirteenth. 

I do not write to Colonel Laurens, because I know not 
whether he is still in France, and because I am confident 
you will make to him all necessary communications. I 
pray you, if he is still with you, to present my compliments 
to him, and inform him of the reasons of my silence. 
Colonel Laurens's letter of the 9th of April last, from 
Versailles, has been received, and I am induced to hope, 
that the ten millions of livres mentioned in it, to be bor- 
rowed in Holland, will be, as he says he shall request, 
advanced from the treasury of France. 

He mentions also a promise of the Marquis de Castries 



396 ROBERT MORRIS. 

to make immediate arrangements for the safe transporta- 
tion of the pecuniary and other succors destined hither. 
It would be well that the money, or as much of it cs pos- 
sible, were in heavy half Johannes. Whether this letter 
may arrive in time I know not, but if it should, you will, 
I hope, be able to effect my views. 

If the fifteen millions of livres I mentioned in my letter 
of the 1 3th, can.be obtained, it will be best that they should 
be retained in France, provided the ten millions be sent to 
America ; for in that case, the exchange may, I believe, 
be put upon such a footing as to answer every valuable 
purpose. Of consequence the risk will be saved to 
America, and France will not suffer by the exportation of 
so much coin. To this it may be added, that a loan will 
probably be more easily obtained, if the days of payment 
of the money by the subscribers to it be somewhat distant, 
which will answer very well for bills of exchange, though 
not quite so well for the exportation of money. 

I have the honor to be, &tc. 

ROBERT MORRIS. 



TO B. FRANKLIN. 

Philadelphia, July 21st, 1781. 

Sir, 
I have now to inform you, that the State of Pennsylvania 
had emitted five hundred thousand pounds in bills of credit, 
funded in such manner, that there could be no reasonable 
doubt of their redemption. But the public confidence had 
been so impaired, that these bills, soon after they came 
out, rapidly depreciated, notwithstanding the solidity of the 
funds by which they had been secured. The executive 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESrpNDEPJCE. 397 

authority of ^Government, therefore, declined issuing more 
of them than were then in circulation (being one hun- 
dred and thirty thousand pounds), and called together the 
Legislature. The Assembly, at their late meeting, took 
measures for the collection of a very considerable tax, 
sufficient to absorb all the paper then in circulation, and 
which was receivable in taxes, as also a considerable 
balance in specie. It is therefore evident, that if the lax 
has time to operate before any more of the paper be issued, 
it must necessarily rise in value. 

The Assembly did me the honor to commit this sum of 
five hundred thousand pounds to my care, for the purpose 
of paying to Congress a balance due on the resolutions of 
that honorable body, of the ISih of March, 1780, and 
of procuring the specific supplies which had been called 
lor, the greater part of which had been unpaid. In this 
situation, it has been my study to effect both these objects, 
without making any new issues of the paper money. I 
cannot easily describe to you the good consequences which 
would follow from the appreciation of it. You will paitly 
conceive them, when I inform you, that it is now at five 
for one, and that my expectation of specific supplies, or 
rather of furnishing rations to the amount of them, is very 
much founded upon the rise of its value. 

Finding, however, that the balance of money due to the 
United States has been already drawn for by them, and 
that the holders of those drafts are very clamorous for 
payment, 1 must put money into the hands of the proper 
officer immediately. To accomplish this, I have fallen 
upon an expedient, which, while it answers that purpose, 
will be productive of another very considerable advantage. 
To explain which, I must previously inform you, that 1 



39S ROBERT MORRIS. 

have lately refused to draw bills on Messrs Le Couteulx h 
Co. for any other than specie; so that the paper will no 
longer answer the purpose of procuring a remittance to 
Europe. I shall, at the same time, borrow such of it as I 
can discover to have been hoarded, and by paying it to the 
holders of the drafts drawn by Congress, throw it again into 
circulation. 1 shall then draw bills on you for four bundled 
thousand Hires, payable at six months' sight or more, for 
which I expect to get four hundred thousand paper dollars ; 
a sum sufficient to satisfy the demand. I shall draw on 
Messrs Le Couteulx St Co. in your favor, to this amot.nt, 
payable at sixty days' sight, which will probably leave four 
months for my operations ; but at any rate, it will leave 
three monihs, which will be amply sufficient ; anil, there- 
fore, in three months afier I shall have drawn on you, 1 
shall remit you my drafts on Messrs Le Couteulx &. Co. 
If in that period this money can he appreciated, it will be a 
gain to the United Stales of the difference, which you will 
clearly see to be very considerable. By this means, also, 
1 shall so economise the funds placed in my hands, that I 
can make them productive of ihe supplies from this State. 
In mentioning these supplies, it occurs to me, also, to 
make mention of what has passed, relative to the contract 
you entered into for a part of them, to the amount of four 
hundred thousand dolbrs. Colonel Mennonville spoke to 
me on this subject, from the Count de Rochambeare, 
shortly after my appointment. Upon considering the very 
slender situation of our revenue, or rather the total want of 
it, and that the several States had omitted furnishing the 
specific supplies demanded of them, I told Colonel Men- 
nonville, ami told him tru'y, that I had but little prospect 
of complying with your promise. It is not easy to convey 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 399 

to your mind an idea of the pain I suffered from being 
obliged to make this declaration. I lelt for you, for Con- 
gress, for America. There is no man in the world more 
deeply impressed than myself with the importance of ful- 
filling every compact made by a proper authority. All my 
reasonings, my feelings, and my experience, have con- 
curred in producing a thorough conviction, that it is essen- 
tial according to the principles of justice, from a regard 
to our national honor, and for the sake of our general 
interests. I shall, therefore, notwithstanding what Iras 
passed between Colonel Mennonville r.nd myself, assidu- 
ously endeavor to perform your promise, and I am happy 
to add, that I am not without hopes of success. 

With respect to the bills I intend to draw on you, I 
must apologize for the trouble they will give you, 
which I hope will be but little. It will be only ne- 
cessary to accept them, and direct the holders what 
banker to apply to for payment. That banker will be 
enabled to make payment, by the bill I shall draw on 
Messrs Le Couteulx, & Co. in your favor. Perhaps 
it may be most convenient to send the bill holders to 
them, but this you will be the best judge of. It is 
unnecessary to state any reasons to you for accepting 
these bills, as I cannot suppose you will have the least 
hesitation on that subject. 1 take this opportunity, 
however, of pledging myself to you, that you shall 
suffer no inconvenience from honoring them with your 
acceptance, as I shall most certainly remit in time the 
bills sufficient to discharge all I draw on you. My 
reason for drawing them on you at all arises from this 
circumstance, that I am desirous of keeping the trans- 
action entirely distinct, and that many inconveniences 



400 ROBERT MORRIS. 

would follow from drawing bills on Messrs Le Cou- 
teulx, & Co. at six months' sight for paper, while I 
draw others at sixty days' sight for specie, especially 
after my refusal to draw on them except for specie, 
which refusal was, as you will perceive, a N necessary 
part of my plan. Add to this, also, that the arrange- 
ments I had made with the Minister of his Most 
Christian Majesty would not permit it. When this 
transaction shall be finished, that is, when my remit- 
tances to you and my drafts on you are all paid, be 
pleased to send me copies of the bankers' accounts. 
I have the honor to be, &c. 

ROBERT MORRIS. 



CIRCULAR TO THE GOVERNORS OF THE STATES. 

Philadelphia, July 25th, 1781. 
Sir, 

I had the honor to write to you on the instant, 

enclosing a certified copy of the account of your State, 
as it stands in the treasury books of the United States. 
I now pray leave to recall your attention to it. 

It gives me great pain to learn, that there is a per- 
nicious idea prevalent among some of the Stales that 
their accounts are not to be adjusted with the conti- 
nent. Such an idea cannot fail to spread listless lan- 
guor over all our operations. To suppose this expen- 
sive war can be carried on without joint and strenuous 
efforts, is beneath the wisdom of those who are called 
to the high offices of legislation. Thofc who inculcate

m">liv(s which inspire their conduct. If once an 
opinion is admitted; that those States who do the least 
and charge mo<t will derive the greatest benefit, and 
endure I lie smallest evils; your Kxcelloncy must per- 
ceive that >harr.eless inactivity must take the place of 
that noble emulation, which ought to pervade and ani- 
mate the whole Union. It is my particular duty, while 
I remind my fellow citizens of the tasks, which il is 
incumbent on them to perform, to remove, if I can, 
every impediment which lies in the way, or which 
may have been raised by disaffection, self interest, or 
mistake. I take, therefore, this early opportunity to 
assure you, that all the accounts of the several Stales 
with the United Stales, shall he speedily liquidated if 
I can possibly effect it, and my efforts for that purpose 
shall be unceasing. I make this assurance in the most 
solemn manner, and I entreat that the consequences of 
a contrary assertion may be most seriously weighed 
and considered, before it is made or believed. 

These accounts naturally divide themselves into two 
considerable branches, viz. those which are subsequent 
to the resolutions of Congress of the ISih of March, 
17^0.* The former must be adjusted as soon as 
proper officers can be found and appointed for the 
purpose, and proper principles established so as that 
they may be liquidated in an equitable manner. I 
say, Sir, in an equitable manner, for I am determined 
that justice shall be the rule of my conduct, as far as 
the measure of abilities, which the Almighty has been 
pleased to bestev, shall enable me to distinguish bc-

tween right and wrong. I shall never permit a doubt, 
that the Slates will do what is right ; neither will I 
ever believe that any one of them can expect to de- 
rive advantage from doing what is wrong. It is by 
being just to individuals, to each olher, to the Union, 
to all ; by generous grants of solid revenue, and by 
adopting energetic methods to collect that revenue; 
and not by complainings, vauntings, or recriminations, 
that these States must expect to establish their inde- 
pendence and rise into power, consequence and gran- 
deur. I speak to your Excellency with freedom, 
because it is my duty so to speak, and because 1 am 
convinced that the language of plain sincerity is the 
only proper language to the first magistrate of a free 
community. 

The accounts I have mentioned as subsequent to the 
resolutions of the I8ih of IVlaicL, 17S0, admit of an imme- 
diate settlement. The several States have all the neces- 
sary materials. One side of this account consists of de- 
mands made by resolutions of Congress, long since for- 
warded ; the other must consist of the compliances with 
those demands. This latter part 1 am not in a capacity 
to state, and for that reason I am to request the earliest 
information, which the nature of things will permit, of the 
moneys, supplies, transportation, &ic. which have been paid, 
advanced, or furnished, by your State, in order that 1 may 
know what remains due. The sooner full information can 
be obtained, the =onner >hall we know what to rely on, 
and how to do rq-ml justice to those who have contributed, 
and those who have not, to those who have contributed 
at one period, and those who have contributed at another. 
I enclose an account of the specific supplies demanded 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 403 

of your State, as extracted from the journals of Congress, 
but without any mention of what has been done in conse- 
quence of those resolutions. Because as I have already 
observed, your Excellency will be able to discover the 
balance much better than I can. 

I am further to entreat, Sir, that 1 may be favored with 
copies of the several acts passed in your Slate since the 
18th of March, 17S0, for the rolUorii n of U\xc% and the 
furnishing supplies, or other aids to the United Slates; the 
manner in which such acts have been executed, the times 
which may have been necessary for them to operate, and 
the consequences of their operation. I must also pray to 
be informed of so much of the internal police of your 
State as relates to the laying, assessing, levying, and col- 
lecting taxes. I beg leave to assure your Excellency, that 
I am not prompted either by an idle curiosity, or by any 
wish to discover what prudence would dictate to conceal. 
It is necessary that 1 should be informed of these things, 
and 1 take the plain, open, candid method of acquiring 
information. To palliate or conceal any evils or disorders 
in our situation, can answer no good purpose ; they must 
be known before they can be cured. We must also know 
what resources can be brought forth, that we may pro- 
portion our efforts to our means, and our demands to both. 
It is necessary, that we should be in condition to prose- 
cute the war with ease, before we can expect to lay down 
our arms with security, before we can treat of peace hon- 
orably, and before we can conclude it with advantage. I 
feel myself fettered at every movement, and embarrassed 
in every operation from my ignorance of our actual state, 
and of what is reasonably to be asked or expected. Yet 
when I consider our real wealth and numbers, and when 



404 ROBERT MORRIS. 

1 compare ihem with those of oilier wni ies, I feci a 
thorough convicti >n, that we may do much more than wo 
have yet done, and with more ease lo ourselves than wc 
have yet felt, provide. I we adopt the proper modes of 
revenue and expend. tore. 

Your Excellence's good sense will anticipate my obsrr- 
vaiio is on (lie necessity of l.eing informed what moneys 
are in your treasury, and what sums you expert to have 
there, ns also the times, by which they must probably he 
brought in. In addition to this, I must pray you to com- 
municate the severs.l appropriations. 

A misfortune peculiar to America, requires that 1 en- 
treat your Excellency io undertake one more task, which 
perhaps is far from being die least difficult. It is, Sir, 
that you will write me very fully as to the amount of the 
several paper currencies now circulating in your Slate, the 
probable increase or decrease of each, and the respective 
piles of depreciation. 

Having now stated ihe several communicrlions, which 
are most indispensable, let me entreat of your Excellency's 
goodness, that they may be made as speedily as possible, 
to the end, thai I may be early prepared with those propo- 
sitions, which from a view of all circumstances, miiv he 
most likely to extricate us from our present difficulties. 
1 am also to entreat, that you will inform me when your 
Legislature is to meet. IMy reason lor making ibis request 
is, ihat any proposals lo be made to them, may arrive in 
season for their attentive deliberation. 

1 know that 1 s^ive you much trouble, hut 1 also know, 
that il will be pleasing to you, because die time and die 
1 ii» »r will be expended i i die service of your country. I', 
Sir, my feeble but honest efforts, should open to us the 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 4C5 

prospect r 'f American s'nry ; if we sho ill bo enabled to 
look forward to a period, when, supported by solid revenue 
and resources, this war should have no other duration or 
extent than the wisdom of Congress might allow, and when 
its object should be the honor and not the independence 
of our country ; if with these fair views the States sh old 
be roused, excited, animated, in the pursuit, and unitedly 
determining to be in that happy situation, find themselves 
placed there by the very determination ; if, Sir, these 
I bin sis should happen, and what is more, il they should 
happen soot; ; the reflection that your industry has princi- 
pally contributed to effect them, would be the rich reward 
of your toi!«s, and g'ne to your best feelings their amplest 
gratification. 

1 have ihc honor to be, &c.

superintendence of our finances. This gave me great 
pleasure, as from your intelligence, integrity ami abil- 
ities, there is reason to hope every advantage, that the 
public can possibly receive from such an office. You

advantage you cm expect* 'he consciousness of having

sarily to injure your private interests; and the public 
is often niggardly even of its thanks, while you are 
sure of being censured by malevolent critics and btio-- 
writers, who will aLuse you while you are serving 
them, and wound your character in nameless pam- 
phlets; thereby resembling those little dirty insects, 
that attack us only in the dark, disturb our repose, mo- 
lesting and wounding us, while our sweat and blood are 
contributing to their subsistence. Every assistance 
that my situation here, as long as it continues, may 
enable me to afford you, shall certainly be given ; for, 
besides my affection for the glorious cause we are 
both engaged in, I value myself upon your friendship, 
and shall be happy if mine can be made of any use to 
you. 

With great and sincere esteem, I am ever, Dear

B. FRANKLIN TO ROBERT MORRIS. 

Passy, July2Gth, 1781. 

Dear Sir, 

I have received the letter you honored me with, of 
the St h of June past, acquainting me, that as Superin- 
tendent of Finance, you have named Messrs Couteulx, 
& Co. at Paris to receive from his Majesty's Ministers 
the money granted to Congress, that they may be 
enabled to honor your bills whenever they appear; 
and you intimate a desire to be informed of the respon- 
sibility of that house. 

With regard to the six millions given by the King 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 407 

in aid cf our operations for the present campaign, be- 
fore the arrival of Mr Laurens, 2 : 500,000 of ii went 
in the same ship with him in cash ; stores equivalent 
to 2,200,000 more cf it were ordered by him, and are 
shipped ; 1,500,000 were sent to Holland, to go in the 
ship commanded by Commodore Gillon. Add to this, 
that Captain Jackson, by his orders, purchased clothing 
and stores in Holland, to the value of about £50,000 
sterling, for which he has drawn bills on me, which 
bills I accepted, and also agreed to pay those drawn 
on Messrs Laurens, Jay, and Adams ; expecting aid 
from a projected loan of 10,000,000 of livres for our 
use in Holland. But this loan meeting with unfore- 
seen difficulties, and its success uncertain, I have 
found myself obliged to stop the money in Holland, in 
order to be able to save the honor of the Congress 
drafts, and to comply with my engagements. By 
these means you have really at present no funds 
here to draw upon. I hope, however, that Messrs 
Couteulx, & Co. will be enabled to honor your drafts ; 
but I trust in your prudence that you will draw no 
more till you have advice of funds provided. And as 
the laying out so much money in Holland instead of 
France is disapproved here, and the payment will, 
therefore, not be provided for, I must earnestly re- 
quest your aid in remitting that sum to me before 
December next, when my acceptances will become 
due, otherwise I shall be ruined with the American 
credit in Europe. 

With regard to the wealth and credit of the House 
of Le Couteulx, & Co. I have never heard it in ques- 
tion. But as Mr Ferdinand Grand, banker at Paris,

and his broker, Sir George Gran:l, banker in Ifoll.-.nd, 
have been our zealous and firm friends ever .since our 
arrival in France, bare aided us greatly by ibeir per- 
sonal interest and solicitations, and have often been six 
or seven bundled ibousand livres in advance for us, ami 
are bouses of unquestionable solidity, i cannot but be 
concerned at any step for taking onr business out of 
their bands, and wish your future bills may be drawn 
on Ferdinand Grand, for I think it concerns our public 
reputation, to preserve the character of gratitude, as 
well as thai of honesty and justice. The commission 
hitherto charged to us by Mr Grand for receiving and 
paying onr money is a half per cent, Which, consid- 
ering the trouble given by the vast number of small 
drafts for interest of the loans, appears to nic a mod- 
erns consideration. 

With great and sincere esteem, I have the honor to 
be, Dear Sir, &c.

TO THE GOVERNORS OF MASSACHUSETTS, RHODE ISL- 
AND, NEW YORK, DELAWARE, MARYLAND, AND 

NORTH CAROLINA. 

Philadelphia, July 27th, 1731. 
Sir, 

I find upon examination, that the recommendation 
of Congress of the 3d of February last, for laying an 
impost of live per cent on goods imported, ami a like 
impost of live per cent on prizes and prize goods, has 
not been complied with by your State. 

The olj.-ct which Congress had in view when they 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 409 

issued this recommendation was of the utmost import- 
ance, and every day gives it an additional weight and 
magnitude. Whether these States are able to support 
the annual expenses of the war by their annual reve- 
nue, and whether it would be prudent and wise to 
draw forth such revenue, are questions which may 
hereafter be agitated, considered, and answered. For 
the present it is sufficient to observe, that no methods 
have hitherto been adopted to produce a revenue by 
any means adequate to the current expenses. The 
public debt, therefore, is large and increasing. The 
failh of the United States is pledged to the public 
creditors. At every new loan it must be pledged 
anew, and an appeal is now made to the States indi- 
vidually, to support the public faith so solemnly 
pledged. If they do, it is possible that public credit 
may be restored, if not our enemies will draw from 
thence strong arguments in favor of what they have so 
often asserted, that we are unworthy of confidence, 
that our union is a rope of sand, that the people are 
weary of Congress, and that the respective States are 
determined to reject its authority. I fear that a mere 
verbal contradiction of these assertions will have but 
little effect. No words will induce men to risk their 
property upon the security of a nominal union. Your 
Excellency will be able at once to determine whether 
that union is more than nominal, in which any part 
shall refuse to be bound for the debts of the whole, or 
to contribute to the general defence. I must be per- 
mitted, however, to observe, that in matters of public 
credit long delay is equivalent to direct refusal. 

Despotic governments are in war superior to others by 
vol. xi. 52 



410 ROBERT MORRIS. 

the union of efforts, the secrecy of operations, and the 
rapidity with which every wheel may be moved by one 
sovereign will. This superiority, however, is amply com- 
pensated to free governments by the ardent attachment of 
their citizens, and the general confidence, which enables 
them to make exertions beyond their force, and expend in 
one year the revenues of many. A single view of our 
enemy, in the unequal contest she now carries on, will 
demonstrate these advantages more clearly than any argu- 
ments. The credit of Great Britain is not only her chief, 
but it is almost her only support. Inferior in everything 
else to the associates combined against her, she still makes 
head everywhere, and balances the opposition through the 
four quarters of the globe. While we feel the force of 
these last strugglings of her ambition, we must admire the 
source from whence they flow. Admiring, we should 
endeavor to imitate, and in order to succeed, we need 
only to make the attempt. There was a time when public 
confidence was higher in America than in any other coun- 
try. Hence the existence of that paper, which bore us 
tliroudi the conflict of five years' hostility. In the moment 
when no others dared oppose Great Britain in her career 
towards universal empire, we met her ambition with our 
fortitude, encountered her tyranny with our virtue, and 
opposed her credit with our own. We may perceive what 
our credit would have done, had it been supported by 
revenue, from what it has already effected without that 
support. And we have no reason to doubt but that it may 
be restored, when we reflect on the fate which paper cur- 
rencies have formerly sustained. The appeal, as I have 
already had the honor to observe, is made by Congress to 
the several States. Some of them have answered by 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE 41 1 

passing the laws required, others are silent. Whence this 
silence proceeds, I confess myself at a loss to determine. 
Some reasons, indeed, I have heard assigned by individuals 
in conversation, but 1 cannot conceive that they should 
have weighed with the Legislatures. Indeed I can hardly 
conceive how any reasons can have weighed against a 
matter of such importance as the keeping public faith 
inviolate. 

I have heard it said, that commerce will not bear a five 
pe; - cent duty. Those who make such assertions must 
be very little acquainted with the subject. The articles of 
commerce are either such as people want, or such as they 
do not want. If they be such as people want, they must 
be purchased at the price for which they can be had ; and 
the duty being on all, gives to no seller any advantage over 
another. If, on the contrary, the article be such as people 
do not want, they must either increase their industry so as 
to afford the use of it with the duty, or else they must 
dispense with that use. In the former case, the commerce 
is just where it was, and in the latter case the people con- 
sume less of foreign superfluities, which certainly is a 
public benefit.* 

I have also heard it said, that the duty should be carried 
to the account of the State where it is levied. What can 
be the object of those, who contend for this point I know 
not. If there are doubts as to the justice of Congress, that 
body should not have been intrusted with the power of

the Governor of Rhode Island, on the matter of duties to be levied

Chairman, see the Public Journals of Congress, under the date of

412 ROBERT MORRIS. 

apportioning quotas on the several States. If, on the con- 
trary, those who make this proposition, expect that the 
commercial States, by carrying the 6ve per cent duty to 
their private account, can derive from their neighbors, the 
idea is as fallacious as it is unjust* The equity of Con- 
gress would lead them to relax so much in the quotas as 
would render the contribution of the States proportionate, 
or if that could not be done, the suffering State would be 
induced to carry on its commerce. Thus the end would 
be defeated, as indeed it ought; for surely the advantage 
derived by the mercantile States, as a mercantile profit, 
is sufficient without exacting a revenue in addition to it. 
Articles imported into the country are consumed in the 
country. If each pays a duty, that duty will be paid by 
til. The tax will fall equally on all, and therefore ought, 
in justice, to be carried to the general account. 

I have also heard it suggested, that the public debts 
ought to be divided among the several States, and each be 
called to provide for its proportion. This measure would 
be sufficient to destroy the credit of any country. The 
creditors trust the Union, and there can be no right to alter 
the pledge which they have accepted for any other, even 
for a belter one, without their free consent. But this is 
not all; there is in it a principle of disunion implied, which 
must be ruinous. Even at this late period, the States might 
singly be subjugated. Their strength is derived from their 
union. Everything, therefore, which injures that union, 
must impair the strength which is dependent upon it. 

I shall not encroach longer upon your Excellency's 
patience, by adducing farther arguments. Everything for 
and against the proposition, has doubtless been considered 
by the United States in Congress assembled, with that 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 413 

attention which is due to the importance of those ohjects 
on which they deliberate. I think, however, it may fairly 
be concluded, that those who wish to re-establish the credit 
and confirm the union of these States, will comply with 
this requisition. As I do not doubt that this is the senti- 
ment of that State over which you preside, I shall believe 
that the Legislature at their next session, will pass the 
proper laws, and I shall at present only entreat that it may 
be done as speedily as possible. 

I take the liberty, however, on this occasion, to make 
an observation, which applies indeed to many others. 
Those who have the public weal very seriously at heart, 
cannot but lament that the acts passed by many States 
on the requisitions of Congress, have been fettered with 
restrictions, as to their operation and effect, very inconsis- 
tent with that confidence which is due to the integrity of 
the United Slates in Congress assembled. Nothing can 
be more pernicious than the jealousy which dictates clauses 
restraining the operation of laws, until similar laws shall 
have been passed by the other States, or confining the 
revenue or supplies to partial or particular objects, not 
within the design of Congress, or short of their intentions; 
or any other clauses, which show a distrust of the Stales in 
the sovereign representative of America, or in each other. 
Such jealr/.oies must prove highly detrimental, if not 
ruinous. And surely there can be no ground to entertain 
them, for the Congress is composed of Representatives 
freely chosen, and is of consequence under the control of 
those by whom they were appointed. Nothing, therefore, 
ought to prevent the free and generous communication of 
all necessary powers to Congress; and I am confident that 
such a communication will more effectually dishearten the 



414 ROBERT MORRIS. 

enemy, encourage our friends, and promote the general 
and unanimous efforts of the whole community, than any 
other circumstance which could possibly happen. It is a 
truth, that the enemy does not even pretend to hope any- 
thing except from sowing discord among us, and it is but 
too true, that while the whigs of America are daily more 
firm and united in the cause of independence, there has 
been too lit:le attention paid to give to that union of senti- 
ment a proper political form and consistency. I am not, 
however, the less confident that in this, r,s in everything 
else, the eneuiy will, to their cost, discover that tiieir hopes 
have been extremely fallacious. 

With every sentiment of respect, &,c.

TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL. OF PENNSYLVANIA. 

Philadelphia, July 30th, 1781. 
Sir, 

I am favored with your Excellency's letter, of the 27th 
instant, for which I beg leave to make my acknowledge- 
ments. 

I must again repeat my regret, that the means devised 
by the Legislature are unequal to the exigencies of the 
State. A majority of the Assembly seemed much dis- 
posed, at their late meeting, to adopt such measures as 
were calculated to promote the public service ; and there- 
fore it is to be lamented that they were not called, after 
passing the resolutions mentioned in your letter, to appro- 
priate to the disposition of Council, such funds as might 
have been adequate to the demands they are liable to, if 
those which remained for that purpose were deemed insuf- 
ficient. I still hope, however, that the collection of specie 
in taxes may enable the Council to effect. more than pre- 
sent appearances promise ; but it is evident, that the money 
allotted to my disposal is intended for the procuring specific 
supplies, and paying the balance of the four tenths of the 
new Continental emission, and that I cannot apply any part 
of it to other purposes, without crediting the State in ac- 
count with the United States for such part, at a value equal 
to gold and silver. I must observe, that the resolutions 
taken by the Assembly, were consequent upon a report 
made to them, and communicated to me by order of the 
House, after it had been made. This report also was 
by a committee appointed on a message from your Ex- 
cellency in Council to the Assembly, and it is therefore 
to be presumed, that it originated in that message. Be 



416 ROBERT MORRIS. 

tl.at as it may, tills at least is certain, that the resolutions of 
the Assembly were proposed by them, and accepted by 
me. 

With respect to the balances due from the State, I am 
to observe, that I have a perfect conviction of and reliance 
on the justice of Congiess, who will I am persuaded, make 
every equitable and proper allowance; and your Excel- 
lency will perceive by the circular letters I have had the 
honor to transmit, my determination to have the accounts 
of every Slate with the United Stales settled on just prin- 
ciples, with all possible expedition. 

I am obliged by your communication as to Mr Searle's 
mission, * and assure you, that I lament his disappointments, 
and still more so. that his negotiations have met with any 
opposition, which to me was quite unexpected. I freely 
confess, that I did not expect he would be successful ; 
nevertheless, he had my good wishes, and had it been in 
my power, he should have experienced my readiness to 
assist every public measure. I wish his efforts it! Holland 
may be productive, but I have very little expectation of it, 
being convinced that war with England will create such 
demand for money, and procure for the lenders such secu- 
rity as will prevent them from listening to American propo- 
sals. It was from a belief that your Excellency and ihe 
Council would give your support to measures which have 
the public good for their object, that I sought your confi- 
dence, asked your advice, and relied on your assistance. 
Entertaining still the same opinion, 1 shall freely and can- 
didly give my sentiments and opinions on every proposition, 
which the Council may think proper to refer to me. 

* Mission to Holland, for the purpose of borrowing money for the 
State of Pennsylvania.

The arguments against drawing paper money from the 
treasury, and throwing it into circulation, had forcibly im- 
pressed my mind ; and nothing hut necessity will compel 
me to have recourse to it, heing very desirous to pay every 
possible attention to your Excellency's request. 

The determination to proceed with vigor and energy in 
the collection of taxes, coincides with my judgment, and 
of course meets with my earnest wishes for success. And 
your promise to strengthen my hands, and enable me to 
proceed with cheerfulness, in the great work I have under- 
taken, excites my warmest gratitude. The delays which 
attend the collection of taxes, are indeed gieat and alarm- 
ing. To remedy them will be highly beneficial, and per- 
haps the modes suggested in your letter may be effectual. 
Every proposition of this sort will command my serious at- 
tention ; and if it shail appear to me productive of the pub- 
lic good, your Excellency may rely that it shall meet with 
all the support in my power. 
I am, respectfully, &c.

CEOHCE WASHINGTON TO ROBERT MORRIS. 

Head Quarters, Dohbs's Ferry, ) 
August «M, 1761. ) 

Dear Sir, 
The expectation of the pleasure of seeing you, has pre- 
vented rue hitherto from making a communication of a 
most important and interesting nature. But circumstances 
will not admit of further delay, and I must trust it to 
paper. It seems reduced almost to a certainty, that the 
enemy will reinforce New York with part of their troops

from Virginia. In that case, the attempt against the 
former must be laid aside, as it will not be in our jHiwer to 
draw together a force sufficient to justify the undertaking. 
The detachment, which the enemy will probably leave in 
Virginia, seems the next object which ought to engage our 
attention, and which will be a very practicable one, should 
we obtain a naval superioriiy, of which I am not without 
hopes, and be able to carry a body ol men suddenly round 
by water. The principal difficulty which occurs, is in ob- 
taining transmits at the moment they may be wanted; for 
if they are ntkeii up beforehand, the use for which they are 
designed cannot I >e concealed, and the enemy will make 
arrangements to defeat the plan. 

What I would therefore wish you to inform yourself of, 
without making a direct inquiry, is what number of tons of 
shipping could be obtained in Philadelphia at any time be- 
tween this and the 20th of this month, and whether there 
could also be obtained at the same time, a few deep 
waisted sloops and schooners, proper to carry horses. 
The number of double decked vessels which may be 
wanted, of two hundred tons and upwards, will not exceed 
thirty. I shall be glad of your answer as soon as possible, 
because, if it is favorable, I can direct certain preparations 
to be made in Philadelphia, and at other convenient places, 
without incurring any suspicions. There certainly can be 
no danger of not obtaining flour in Philadelphia, and as 
you seem to have doubts of procuring salt meal there, I 
shall direct all that which is to the eastward, to be col- 
lected at points from whence it may be shipped at the 
shortest notice. 

You will also oblige me by giving me your opinion of 
the number of vessels which might be obtained at Balti-

fore mentioned, or thereabouts.

TO M. DE LA LUZERNE. 

Philadelphia, August 2d, 1781. 
Sir, 

Agreeably to the intimations I made to your Excellency 
some days ago, it was my intention to have gone to camp 
yesterday. But an act of Congress of the of 

July, rendered it necessary for me to hold a conference 
with a Committee of Congress and the Board of War. 
This was done ; and it was determined, that a member of 
the Board of War should go with me to camp. 

This circumstance has postponed my journey for a few 
days. But this is not all ; the daily demands on me for 
money are considerable, and beyond the utmost extent of 
any funds I can command. The demands for past dues 
in compensation for past services, and the like, are re- 
jected ; but those for the prosecution of the campaign 
must be attended to. If, in my absence, and from that 
cause there be any stoppage, or considerable delay, the 
consequences will be equally injurious 10 my reputation, 
and to the public service. 

I have before mentioned to you, that my dependence 
for immediate supplies of money, is on the produce of bills 
of exchange. I am sorry now to observe, that this depen- 
dence fails, and from a cause equally prejudicial to France 
and to the United States, considered in their collective 
capacity, though, perhaps, advantageous to individuals. 



420 ROBERT MORRIS. 

Your Excellency will remember, that when T was called 
to the administration, the bills of your army had been 
selling for two thirds, and even so low as for one half of 
their value in Europe. What might have been the causes 
of this, it is not my business to inquire. The fact is incon- 
testable. Your Excellency observed it, and endeavored 
to remedy the evil, by hoi. ling your own bills at five slxdis. 
But the merchants, who had benefited by the former low 
rate, could not be brought at once to make so consider- 
able an advance. They expected that the same causes, 
which had reduced bills to one half, must agiin bring 
them down ; and, therefore, were disposed to wait the 
event. 

I take the liberty here to observe, that the fluctuation of 
exchange will naturally strengthen that expectation, and 
nothing but steady, firm perseverance on the part of the 
administration, can, or indeed ought, to produce a ready 
sale on good terms. Bills of exchange arc reunited 10 
France in payment for European commodities. If the 
cost of this remittance is fixed, commerce may so far be 
established on true commercial principles ; otherwise, it is 
a mere game of hazard. Sensible of tnis, the merchant 
will rather wait, with his money in his chest, the event of 
public necessity, than invest that money in bills, which 
may shortly alter be bought on better terms by his more 
cautious neighbor. Hence it follows, that the public will 
really command less money than they otherwise might. 
Nor is that all. While the public can command the 
nionpy of the merchants as fast as it conies into their 
hands, the servants of the public can spend that money to 
advantage, and the very expendiluie will increase the cir- 
culation, so as to bring it again sooner into the hands of the 
merchant. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 421 

Your good sense. Sir, your experience, and the unre- 
mitted attention, wliirh I have perceived you piy to every 
obj.'ct which can rehte to the service of your Sovereign, 
will render it unnecessary for me to prosecute any further 
these ohserv.-.tions. 

It was from a knowledge of this subject, which many 
years' constant attention to this business had imputed, that 
1 saw the necessity of raising the value of hills by degrees, 
and, at the same time, of opposing the most inflexible 
firmness to every attempt at lowering their price. The 
bills I drew on Messrs Le Couteulx 8c Co., at sixty days' 
si'Jit, were selling readily at four fifths, until the bills for 
your army were offered at thirty days' sigl t, and at a lower 
rate; This, Sir, has checked my sales; and this induces 
me to mention to you another matter, which will, I fore- 
see, become of great importance. 

The concurrence of many venders of bills cannot be 
more pernicious thai: the concurrence of many purchasers 
of supplies. The merchant cannot reason more effectu- 
ally on public necessities, which he may conjecture, than 
the husbandman on such wants as he has ocular demon- 
stration of. Melancholy experience has shown, that the 
contest between our purchasers has been extreme!) per- 
nicious. What may ln-ve been the manner of conducting 
the business by the agents of the King, I do not positively 
know; but if I were to credit many ti.les which I have 
heard about it, I should believe there had been errors at 
Irnst. But I know too well the weakness a:id impropriety of 
listening to slanderous repoiis; and I nm very confident, 
th.it all possi.de care will be taken of the interests of his 
Majesty. 

But, Sir, if the supplies for the French army and navy 



422 ROBERT MORRIS. 

are kept in a distinct channel, 1 do not believe it will be 

possible to obtain them so cheap as they might otherwise 

be had. The ration consisting of one pound of bread, 

one pound of beef, or three quarters of a pound of pork, 

one gill of country made rum ; and to every hundred 

rations one quart of salt, two quarts of vinegar ; also to 

every seven hundred rations eight pounds of soap, and 

three pounds of candles, is now furnished to the United 

States in this city, at nine pence, with a half penny allowed 

over for issuing. It may perhaps cost more to furnish 

rations to the army, perhaps as high aS ten pence or eleven 

pence, Pennsylvania currency. 

You I suppose, Sir, can command the necessary ac- 
counts to determine what the King now pays for the sub- 
sistence of his troops ; but as the French and American 
rations differ, I take the liberty for your further inlorma- 
tion to mention, that the parts of the ration are estimated 
as follows ; for one pound of bread, two ninetieths of a 
dollar ; for one pound of beef, or three quarters of a pound 
of poik, four and a quarter ninetieths ; for one gill of rum, 
two ninetieths ; for soap, c;mdles, vinegar, and salt, one 
and a quarter ninetieths for each ration. You will also 
observe, Sir, that when exchange is at four filths, one livre 
tournois is equal to fourteen pence and two fifdis of a 
penny, Pennsylvania money. 

I go into these details to enable your Excellency exactly 
to determine what is most for the interest of France, for I 
conceive it my duty to give you a confidential state of our 
affairs, whenever it ean promote his Majesty's service, 
which I beg leave to assure you, I have every possible 
desire to assist ; being convinced, that lean I y no other 
means more fully comply with the wishes of the United 
Slates in Congress assembled. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 423 

I beg leave further V> observe, that I have no personal 
wish lo negotiate your bills, or to supply your Meets and 
armies. You must be very sensible, that I have already 
before me a field of business sufficiently large. To extend 
it, will give me labor and pain, J can derive no advantage 
from it, nor will anything induce me to engage in it, ex- 
cept it be the prospect of rendering effectual service to 
the common cause. I make this declaration, not because 
I conceive it necessary to you, or horn an ostentatious 
display of those motives, which actuate my conduct, but 
there may be persons lo whom I am not so well known 
as I have the honor of being to your Excellency, and who 
from ignorance or interest might give to the present inten- 
tions ths foulest interpretation. 

1 have been led much further, Sir, than the occasion 
strictly required, but perhaps my observations may de- 
mand your attention ; they certainly appeared to me of 
importance, or I would not have given you the trouble of 
so long a letter. 

1 pray you to believe me, with respect, Stc. 

ROBERT MORRIS. 



TO M. DE LA LUZEItNE. 

Philadelphia, August 4lh, 1781. 
Sir, 

I was honored with your letter of the 3d yesterday 
evening ; I am happy that the sentiments expressed in 
mine of the 2d, meet with your Excellency's approbation, 
and shall readily confide in your direction, to make such 
use of it as you think proper. 

The two questions you ask do not admit of a precise 



424 ROBERT MORRIS. 

answer. The rate of exchange ought hy no means to be 
under four films; indeed I could wish l lint it were higher, 
and am not without hopes of raising it ; but that must 
depend on circumstances, which I c nnot command. The 
Sinn, which can he furnished to the French army monthly 
by the sale of hills, admits still less than the other of being 
precisely ascertained. Let me add, Sir, that the sum, 
which your army may want, must greatly depend upon 
the measures, which may be taken to supply them. Gov- 
ernment might to know its expenses precisely, il that were 
possible. Upon this principle, it will be of use, that yonr 
stipulations should be to pay a certain sum in France for 
every ration ; consequently you will want no money here 
for diat purpose. 

I wish it were in my power to reply more pointedly, for 
I am well convinced of the importance of information on 
that subject. Whenever 1 am in a condition to know 
more, I glial' readily communicate to you the extent of my 
inquiries. But while it is my determination to speak to 
you with that Confidence, which your ingenuous conduct 
his merited, I am equally determined neither to comprom- 
ise myself nor mislead you, by relying on unfounded con- 
jecture. 

] have the honor to be, Sec. 

ROBERT MORRIS. 



TO THE GOVEKNOK OF MASSACHUSETTS. 

Office of Finance, August 4th, 1781. 
Sir, 

On the 23d of June last, the United States in Congress 

assembled, deeded me to take measures for the speedy

launching and equipping the ship America, and directed 
the Board of Admiralty to assign to me die share of the 
United States, in the prizes taken by Captain Barry, to 
enable me to carry their orders into effect. 

By a lett°r from the Navy Board in the eastern district, 
dated the 18th of July at Boston, it appears, that the 
greater part of this money is already expended, and that 
more is wanting to fit the Deane and Alliance for sea. 
Congress have referred this letter to me, and in conse- 
quence, as I am convinced that expense will constantly 
accrue while those vessels continue in port, 1 request of 
your Excellency to furnish to the Navy Board, such 
moneys as may he necessary to fit them out, with all pos- 
sible expedition. 1 must further entreat to be favored 
with an account of the sums furnished, that they may be 
carried to the credit of your State on the laje requisitions 
of Congress, and the Navy Board to be debited with 
them in the treasury books. 

I have the honor to be, &c.

Sir, 

Being obliged to go to camp on public business, I 
shall set off this day. During my absence, it is highly 
probable that the service may require various applica- 
tions to your Excellency. Should this be the case, 
they will be made to you by Mr Gouverneur Morris, 
who is my official assistant. I am, therefore, to pray

the same attention to his letters as if they were writ-

With great respect, &c.

TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Camp, August 13th, 1731. 
Sir, 

The orders of Congress, which wc have the honor 
to communicate, directing us to confer with your Ex- 
cellency on the subject of the proposed numbers and 
arrangements of the army for the next campaign, not 
having pointed out the reasons for inducing the mejs- 
ure, we have the honor to lay before you our ideas on 
the subject, so far as we arc acquainted with the 
matter, from a long conference at which we were 
present in Philadelphia, held by a committee of Con- 
gress, the Superintendent of Finance, and the Board 
of War, pursuant to a resolution of Congress, with a 
copy of which your Excellency has been furnished. 

After the full conversation with which we were hon- 

*August 4th. Having omitted in my minutes to make mention of 
the assistance I have received from Gouverneur Morris, I think it 
proper to declare, that he has most cheerfully afforded me every 
advice and assistance, which his genius and abilities enabled him to 
afford, from my first appointment to this time ; and that I found him 
so capable and useful as to induce me to solicit his assistance in an 
official character, which having readily consented to, I made a 
verbal engagement with him, since confirmed by my letter of ap- 
pointment, dated on the 6th of July last, being the dale of the Acts 
of Congress, which fixes a salary for my assistant, and he is of 
course entitled to that salary from that date. Diary. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESl'OXDEXCE. 427 

orcd on the 12lh instant, it is unnecessary to enter at 
forge into those reasons, or to urge the pressing ncres- 
sily of economising our affairs so as to make our reve- 
nues in a great degree meet our expenses. Your 
Excellency must he equally sensible with us of the 
necessity, and we are perfectly convinced that you are 
disposed to assist in every measure tending to promote 
so desirable an object. You are also sensible of the 
impolicy of calling on the States for men or money, in 
numbers or quantities so extensive as to excite among 
even the zealous and considerate, ideas of the imprac- 
ticability of carrying on the war on such terms. De- 
mands of this nature, instead of animating to exertions, 
are only productive of hopeless languor. Your morti- 
fying experience of the inadequate compliance of the 
Slates heretofore, with your former requisitions, will 
explain the motives inducing to the expediency of 
moderating those demands, so as to render them pro- 
ductive, and in ease cf failure to leave the delinquent 
State without excuse; Your Excellency has no doubt 
considered that t lie class of men who are willing to 
become soldiers is much diminished by the war, and 
therefore the difficulties of raising an army equal to 
former establishments has increased, and w ill continue 
to increase, and embarrass the Slates in their measures 
for filling up their quotas, should the mode of recruit. 
ing the army be continued in I he present line. You 
will also have considered, that the enemy proportion- 
ably debilitated by war, is incapable of opposing to us 
the force we originally had to encounter; and, there- 
fore, the necessity of such extensive levies as \vc 
formerly raised, seems to be in some measure super' 
seded. 



428 ROBERT MORRIS. 

In what degree the forces of these States should be 
decreased, we do not pretend to determine, leaving 
this to your Excellency's better judgment. But from 
past experience it appears, that the States are inca- 
pable of bringing into the field an army equal to that 
called for by the last arrangement; or, if all the de- 
mands of Congress on the States become merely pecu- 
niary, it does not seem probable that they can or will 
furnish money for raising, equipping, and supporting 
such an army. 

We wish we were capable, from any information 
we are possessed of, to assist your Excellency in the 
investigation of the subject with respect to the prob- 
able designs or force of the enemy the next campaign. 
This must in its nature depend upon contingencies at 
present even beyond conjecture. At this timff, there- 
fore, in cur apprehension, the only solid grounds of 
procedure is to consider what force these States are 
capable of producing. 

Having thus, in general, mentioned the ideas which 
have arisen on the subject, we beg to leave the matter 
to your consideration, and take the liberty of pro- 
posing the following queries, after further stating that 
it has been thought that it would be expedient, in case 
of a reform, to lessen the number of regiments so as 
to make fewer commissioned officers and privates in 
the regiments. It has been supposed that a consider- 
able saving would arise from this measure, by not 
having so many officers in full pay, with their horses, 
servants, baggage, and other consequent expenses in 
the field. Or if they remain in quarters from want of 
commands, they are in a situation disagreeable to their 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 429 

own feelings, and uselessly expensive to the public. 
We presume that gentlemen qualified for staff officers, 
and that artificers and other persons employed by the 
staff department, should not come into the calculation, 
as the officers at the head of those departments should 
be enabled to carry on their business without taking 
men from the line, a practice introduced from neces- 
sity, very prejudicial to discipline, and productive of 
pernicious consequences by lessening the effective 
force of the army. 

Quere 1. Is a reduction of the number of the offi- 
cers and men, as fixed by the last arrangement, expe- 
dient or proper? 

2. How can the reduction be brought about, consist- 
ently with the good of the service? and what arrange- 
ment should be made in consequence of this resolution ? 

The answer to the above queries will no doubt in- 
clude the number of men necessary for the next 
campaign, and the organization of them so as to desig- 
nate the numbers of regiments, and the numbers in 
those regiments, both of commissioned and non-com- 
missioned officers and privates, as well regimentally as 
by companies. The expediency of having fewer 
regiments of artillery and horse, and of consolidating 
the independent corps, will also, we presume, come 
into your Excellency's consideration. 

3. What periods of enlistment, under present cir- 
cumstances, are most proper to be adopted? 

4. What regulation can be made to modify the prac- 
tice of taking servants from the line by officers? and, 
on this head we beg leave to submit to your opinion a 
copy of a motion made in Congress on this subject. 



430 ROBERT MORRIS. 

5. What is to he done with officers by brevet, or 
those who have no particular commands ? Can thev 
not be placed in the regiments, or retire on half pay ? 

G. Would it be practicable, consistent with justice, 
and the good of the service, to call into actual service 
officers who have retired on half pay, by ihc foi mer 
arrangement, to fill vacancies happening in the lines 
to which they respectively belong? 

We have the honor to be, wilh much regard, &c.

GEORGE WASHINGTON TO ROBERT MORRIS. 

Head Quarters. Dobbs's Ferry, > 
August 17th, lTo'l. 5 

Dear Sir, 

I have in confidence imparted to you the alteration of 
our late plan, and made you acquainted wiili our intended 
operations. Besides the provision necessary al die head of 
the Rlk to carry the troops down the hay, a verv Consider- 
able quantity will he wanted in Virginia. I should suppose 
diree hundred barrels of flour, as many of salt meat, and 
eight or ten hogsheads of rum, would be sufli( ient Sit the 
Elk. For what will he consumed in Virginia, I imagine 
he order must be general, as we can neither ascertain the 
number of men which will be drawn together, or the time 
they will be employed. 

I have written to the Count de Grasse, and have re- 
quested him to send up his light vessels of every kind lo the 
Elk; hut I would, nevertheless, wish to have all that may 
be al Baltimore, and the upper parts of the bay, secured. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE, 431 

I shall therefore he obliged to you, to take measures nt 
the proper lime for that purpose. When that lime ui I be, 
and when you shall give orders fur the deposit at the Elk, 
1 will hereafter inform you. 

1 shall direct the Quarter Master in due season to take 
up all the small craft in the Delaware, for the purpose of 
transporting the troops from Trenton to Christiana. Should 
he have occasion for advice or assistance from you on this 
occasion, I must rocpiest yon to give him both. 

1 am confident it will be necessary to give the American 
troops, destined for Southern services, one month's pay in 
specie. This will amount to about dollars. 11 it 

will be possible for you to procure this sum, you will 
infinitely ob! : ge me, and will much benefit the service. I 
shall also stand in need of a sum of specie lor secret 
services; I suppose about five hundred guineas. 
I have the honor to be, Sic.

TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Office of Finance, August 22d, 1781. 
Dear Sir, 

I arrived in town the day before yesterday. Having 
taken the earliest opportunities to acquire information, I 
am sorry to inform you, that I find money matters in as 
bad a situation as possible. The exchange, by the con- 
course of venders, has run down to five shillings, and bills 
are offered at that rate in such great numbers, as to com- 
mand all the money which is to be disposed of; so that 
reducing the price of bilis still lower, would not command 
money, or answer any other good purpose. 



432 ROBERT MORRIS. 

The paper of this State, (Pennsylvania) is indeed appre- 
ciating ; but to issue it, in the present moment, would 
destroy in embryo all my hopes from that quarter, cut off 
the only resource which I have the chance of commanding, 
and shake a confidence which has been reposed in me, 
and which the public interest calls upon me to cherish. 
I am sorry to observe, in consequence, that you must 
expect to meet with disappointments; but I assure you, 
that I will make every possible exertion to place you in the 
most eligible situation which my means will admit of. 
I am, Sir, your most obedient, &c. 

ROBERT MORRIS. 



TO THE GOVERNORS OF NEW JERSEY AND DELAWARE. 

Office of Finance, August 22d, 1781. 
Sir, 

I have, in a former letter, forwarded to your Excel- 
lency, an account of the specific supplies, which Congress 
bad demanded from your State. It now becomes my duty 
again to press for a compliance with those demands. The 
exigencies of the service require immediate attention. 
We are on the eve of the most active operations ; and 
should they be in anywise retarded by the want of neces- 
sary supplies, the most unhappy consequences may follow. 
Those who may be justly chargeable with neglect, will 
have to answer for it to their country, their allies, to the 
present generation, and to posterity. I hope, entreat, 
expect, the utmost possible efforts on the part of your 
State ; and confide in your Excellency's prudence and 
vigor to render those efforts effectual. 

I beg to know, most speedily, Sir, what supplies are 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 433 

collected, ant! at what places ; as also the times aw! places 
at which the temsvinder is to be expected. I cannot 
express to you my solicitude on this occasion. My decla- 
ration to Congress, when I entered upon my office, will 
prevent the blame of 'ill accidents from lighting upon me, 
even if I were less attentive than I am ; hiH it is impossible 
not to feel most deeply on occasions where the greatest 
o! jects may he impaired or destroyed, by indolence or 
neglect. ! must, therefore, again reiterate my requests ; 
and while I assure you, tint nothing but the urgency of 
our affairs would render me thus importunate, I must also 
assure you, that while those affairs continue so urgent, I 
must continue to ituuortune. 

With all possible respect, &c. 

ROBERT MORRIS.* 

* August 2\st. During my stay at camp, f had constant applications 
for money from almost everybody, as all had claims on the public. 
I took with me only one hundred and fifty guineas; and, finding so 
many demands, I thought it best to satisfy none, therefore brouo-ht 
the money back. 1 had conferences with the Quarter Master 
General, Paymaster General, Clothier General, Commissary Gen- 
eral of Issues, Director General of the Hospitals, and with many 
other persons; but as these chiefly ran on the wants of themselves 
and others employed in their departments, I could only recommend 
the strictest economy in their expenditures, that I might thereby be 
the better warranted in making reasonable requisitions from the 
several States ; always promising what I mean most punctually to 
perform, that is, to use my utmost endeavors to establish such 
revenues, as will enable the regular payment of their salaries and 
other just demands ; but always concluded with assuring them, that 
this ultimately depended on the several Legislatures, which could 
only be induced to grant such revenues from a conviction, that their 
grants would be faithfully and frugally used. I made the same 
observations to the general officers and others, who spoke to ine on 
money matters. Diary.

434 ROBKRT MORRIS. 

TO THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA. 

Office of Finance, August 23d, 1781, 
Sir, 

I am just returned from the head quarters of the Com- 
rmnder in Chief, where I have been for some days, in 
order to confer with him on the various military operations 
and arrangements, as far as they are connected with the 
duties of my department. Of consequence the defence 
of that valuable part of Virginia now invaded, became 
much a subject of consideration, and I am happy to inform 
you, that every measure will be pursued for its safety, 
which is consistent with the general objects of the war. 

The force in Virginia ought to be very considerable, 
for reasons, which it is unnecessary to mention to you, who 
are so well acquainted with the country. But it is neces- 
sary to observe, that the supplies to this force must be 
proportionally gicat. I have already done myself the 
honor to transmit to your Excellency an account of spe- 
cific supplies, which have been required by Congress. 
Virginia stands debited for the whole, and it is not in my 
power, perhaps not in yours, to state as yet the credit side 
of that account. Let, however, the amount of the articles 
already (urnished, be what it may, this at least is certain, 
that I have the command of no money from the several 
States, which will serve to maintain a force in Virginia. 
Much, therefore, must depend on the provisions and for- 
age, which that State can call forth. 

It is necessary for me to inform the General what re- 
liance can be made on your resources, and it is also neces- 
sary, that this information should be just. Your Excel- 
lency must perceive, that his arrangements will greatly 
depend upon my communication ; and therefore you will 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 435 

need no incitement to transmit to me as soon as possible 
the answers to my inquiries. 

Let me then entrent, Sir, to know what quantity of 
flour, beef, and pork, both fresh and salted, and what 
quantity of hay and Indian com, or other forage, can be 
delivered by the State of Virginia, at what places, and by 
what times. 1 shall also be happy to be informed, where 
the tobacco required of your State is deposited, that I may 
take proper measures for the disposal of it. 
With all possible respect, &ic.

Gentlemen, 

iVly former letters advised you of the sundry bills I had 
drawn on you to the 2d day of this month, being num- 
bered from one to one hundred and thirtyone inclusive, 
and amounting to five hundred and twentyone thousand, 
six hundred and thirtyfour livres, sixteen sous, and eight 
dernier tournois, as you will perceive by a copy of a list 
of said bills, herein enclosed. To which you will find 
added the list of sundry bills drawn on the 10th instant, 
numbered one hundred and thirtytwo to one hundred and 
fiftyeight inclusive, all at sixty days' sight, in favor of Mr 
Haym Solomans, amounting to two hundred and one thou- 
sand, three hundred and tvvenlythree livres, eight sous 
tournois. 

On the Sth of this month I had occasion to visit his Ex- 
cellency General Washington at camp, and at my de- 



43G ROBERT MORRIS. 

pnrtme I left these bills signed. Thry were sold during 
my absence, and I pray that ihey may lie (!nly honored, 
ion will be "enabled to pay these puncf.iallv, as his Ex- 
cellency die Minister Plenipotentiary of France has en- 
gaged, dint five hundred thousand livres louruois, should 
be placed with yon for that purpose ; of course yon will 
have received one million of livies, snhject to my drafts, 
and ! shall continue to pass them on you as occasion may 
require.

CEORCE WASHINGTON TO ROBERT MORRIS. 

Chatham, August S7th, 1731. 

Dear Sir, 
Accounts brought by several vessels lo Philadelphia, 
and lo die eastward, leave little doubt but ih;:t (lie Count 
de Grasso musl have already arrived in die Chesapeake, or 
that he must be very soon there. The Count de IWham- 
beau and myself have therefore determined, that no little 
oughrto be lost ifl making preparations fur our lr;;n=por- 
t alien from Trenton to Cluistiana, and from die head 61 the 
K:k down the Chesapeake. I have wiiuen by :his oppor- 
tunity to Colonel Miles, and have directed him immedi- 
ately io engage all the proper kind of craft for die navigation 
ol the Delaware, which can be found in Philadelphia, or in 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 437 

tiic creeks above nnd below it ; ant! as your advice may 
he useful to bim, more especially as far as respects pro- 
cnrir.g the vessels at a distance from l'hiladelpLin, I bave 
desired bim to wait upon you lor that purpose. 

I sh;il! aiso be obliged to you for using your influence 
witb tbe gentlemen of Baltimore to permit any vessels, 
which may be in tbat port to come up to tbe Elk to assist us 
in transportation. 1 bave little doubt, from tbe cheerful- 
ness with which tbey furnished the JMarq.us de Lafayette 
last winter, that tbey will comply with your requisition on 
the present occasion. But lest there should be a necessity 
for the interference, of the Executive of the State, 1 have 
written to Governor Lee, upon that and other matters. 
1 enclose the letter under flying seal lor your information, 
and you will be good enough to forward it by a chain of 
expresses, which is establi?hed. Any vessels, which may 
be procured in the Chesapeake, should rendezvous as 
soon as possible in Eik river. 

You will be pleased to make the deposit of flour, rum, 
nntl salt meal, at the head of the Elk, which i lequested in 
a former letter. 

1 am very fea:ful, that about fifteen hundred barrels of 
salt provisions, and thirty hogsheads of rum, which I 
directed to be sent from Connecticut and Rhode Island, 
under convov ol the Count de Barras, would not have 
been ready when tbe fleet sailed from Newport. Should 
that have been the case, the i.isappointment will be great. 
1 would wish you to sec whether a like quantity of those 
art.cles can be procured in Philadelphia, or in Maryland, 
it we should find th.it they have not gone found bout the 
eastward. 

1 must entreat you if possible to procure one month's 



43S ROBERT MORRIS. 

pay in specie for the detachment, which I have under my 
command. Part of the troops have not been paid any- 
thing for a long time past, and have upon several occasions 
shown marks of great discontent. The service they are 
going upon, is disagreeable to the northern regiments, but 
I make no doubt, that a douceur of a little hard money 
would put them in proper temper. If the whole sum can- 
not be obtained, a part of it will be better than none, as 
it may be distributed in proportion to the respective wants 
and claims of the men. 

The American detachment will assemble in this neigh- 
borhood today. The French army tomorrow. 
I have the honor to be, &:c. 

GEORGE WASHINGTON. 



TO DONALDSON TEATES. 

Office of Finance, August 28th, 1781. 
Sir, 

The express which carries this letter will bring you one 
from Colonel Miles, on the same subject. It is necessary, 
that vessels be procured as speedily as possible, to trans- 
port a body of from six to seven thousand men from the 
head of the Elk to Virginia, with their necessary apparatus. 
You will, therefore, collect them at the head of the Elk, on 
the 5lh of September, and as soon after as may be, engage 
them by the day on the cheapest terms you can, to be paid 
in hard money, and obtain as long a credit as possible. 
There will be little or no risk of the vessels, and therefore 
you may insure them to the owners, if that will tend to ob- 
tain them either sooner or cheaper. The express has let- 
ters to William Smith and Matthew Ridley, of Baltimore, 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 439 

on this subject, and they will give you their advice and as- 
sistance, as W'll some other gentlemen, to whom 1 have 
written, should either be necessary. He Ins also letters 
to the Governor of Maryland, who will I am confident give 
every aid, which the Executive authority of the State can 
afford. You will therefore either apply to the Governor 
or not, as circumstances shall require. 

Any engagements you enter into on this account, shall 
be fulfilled ; but 1 must again request, that you will be as 
economical as the nature of the business will permit. 1 
expect and rely on the exertion of your utmost industry 
and attention and am, Sir, very respectfully, &c. 

ROBERT MORRIS. 



TO B. FRANKLIN. 

Philadelphia, August 28th, 1781. 
Sir, 

Herewith I send you triplicates of my letters of the 13th 
and 14th of July last, and duplicates of my letters of the 19th 
and 21st of July last. I have not yet executed the plan 
mentioned in mine of the 21st of July, of drawing bills on 
you, for reasons, which it is not necessary to enumerate at 
present. 

Since my letter to you of the Sth of June fast, I have 
found it necessary to apply to the Minister of his Most 
Christian Majesty in this place, to direct another sum of 
five hundred thousand livres to be deposited with Messrs 
Le Couteulx & Co., and I am now drawing bills for that 
sum, wherefore I must pray your Excellency to take meas- 
ures, that they be put in cash to answer my drafts. Al- 
though I have no doubt that this will be done on the Che- 



440 ROBERT MORRIS. 

valier <!e la Luzerne's application, yet ns his letters may 
miscarry, or other unavoidable inislortune happen, 1 take 
this additional precaution, because it is of the utmost im- 
portance to the United Slates, that these bilis he duly 
honored. 

The last advices from Europe inform us of M. Necker's 
resignation and remova 1 , which occasions much speculation, 
ns to the causes which produced this event. 1 should be 
glad to hear from you upon that subject. 

We learn from Boston the arrival of the frigate I\la<:i- 
cienue, with a large store ship laden with clothing, he. fur 
the United States ; another store ship put back lo Corunnn, 
as is said, having been dismasted in a gale of wind. If 
this he so, it is a loss which will he more easily supplied 
than that of the Lafayette, which ship we are informed was 
taken and carried into England. 

Colonel Laurens's embarkation on board a frigate for 
this place, with money, is also announced, and I hope she 
will speedily arrive. The Boston account of the iGth of 
August, mentions the arrival of the JJ-igicienne in fifty 
days. If Colonel Laurens had then sailed, he must now 
have been out sixtytwo days, which is a very long period 
for a single frigate lo be engaged in that voyage. If that 
frigate arrives safe, with five hundred thousand dollars, 
which is, as I am informed, on board of her, it will relieve 
me from many very great difficulties, which I have now lo 
struggle with, and give a much belter appearance to our 
affairs, as it will enable us to operate with far more vigor 
and activity. 

It is now a very long time since we have had any 
tidings rf Mr Adams. We have indeed been informed, 
though not from himself, that he had opened a loan for a 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 441 

million of florins ; but we are much in the dark as to the 
success of it, as well as many other particulars relative to 
his situation, which would be very interesting. 

September 1(h, 1781. Since writing the above letter, 
Colonel Laurens has come to this city from Boston, at 
which place he arrived in the Resolve, with the two store 
ships under her convoy, after a passage uncommonly 
tedious. It is certainly unnecessary to mention how great 
pleasure we have received from this occurrence. 

Another equally pleasing, is the arrival of the Count de 
Grasse in the Chesapeake Bay, on the 30th of August, 
with twentvei°ht sail of the line, viz. one of one hundred 
and ten guns, three of eighty four guns, nineteen of seventy- 
four guns, four of sixtyfour guns, and one of fifty guns- 
The Count de Barras sailed from Rhode Island on the 
24th, so that probably he has before this made a junction 
with the Count de Grasse, although he had not on the 31st 
of August. A detachment of about seven thousand men 
is on the way to Virginia, of which about two thousand and 
five hundred were at the head of the Elk. As many more 
must have arrived there this evening, and the remainder 
tomorrow. There are landed, from the fleet, three thous- 
and men, and we are told these will receive an addition of 
one thousand and five hundred marines, besides the army 
under the command of the Marquis dc Lafayette, which 
was before in Virginia, and consists of about five thousand, 
including the militia. Lord Oornwallis was entrenched at 
York, in Virginia, with five thousand men. General 
Washington takes the command of the southern army in 
person. The fleet under the Count de Grasse took on its 
way a packet from Charleston to Great Britain, on board 
vol. xi. 56 



442 ROBERT MORRIS. 

of which was Lord Rawdon. From this combination of 
circumstances, you will perceive, that we have reason to 
flatter ourselves with the expectation of pleasing occur- 
rences. 

With the greatest respect, &c. 

ROBERT MORRIS. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 

Office of Finance, August 28th, 1731. 
Sir, 

My circular letter to the Governors, of the 25th of 
July, a copy whereof was sent to Congress on the 6th 
of August, contains a solemn assurance, that all the 
accounts of the several States with the United States 
should be speedily liquidated, if I could possibly effect 
it, and that my efforts for that purpose should be un- 
ceasing. If after this declaration, I could possibly 
have forgotten it, the reference made to me, on the 
23d instant, of two letters frcm the State of Massa- 
chusetts and a report on them of the 14th instant, 
would have called for an immediate attention. 

I have thought much on this subject and feel very 
anxious about it. The settlement of those accounts is 
of the utmost importance, for, until it be completed, 
the States will persuade themselves into an opinion 
that their exertions are unequal. Each will believe in 
the superiority of its own efforts. Each claim the 
merit of having done more than others; and each 
continue desirous of relaxing to an equality of the sup- 
posed deficiencies of itr. neighbors. Hence it follows, 
that every day they become more and more negligent, 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 443 

a dangerous supineness pervades the continent, and 
recommendations of Congress, capable in the year 
1775 of rousing all America to action, now lie ne- 
glected. 

The settlement of former accounts being considered 
as a thing forgotten, men, naturally reasoning from 
them to those which are now present, conclude, lhat 
they also will drop into forgetfulncss, and consider 
everything not furnished as so much saved. The 
Legislatures will not call forth the resources of their 
respective constituents. The public operaiions lan- 
guish. The necessity of purchasing on credit enhances 
expense. The want of that credit compels to the use 
of force. That force offends. The country is daily 
more plunged in debt, and its revenues more deeply 
anticipated, A situation so dangerous calls for more 
accurate principles of administration, and these cannot 
too speedily be adopted. The settlement of accounts 
is the first step, but it is necessary not only that this 
settlement be speedy but that it be final ; for, if it be 
not final, the disputes on lhat subject will have the 
same baleful influence with those now subsisting. 
Disunion among the States must follow in the event. 
Disgust must take place in the moment. The same 
opprobrious indolence will continue, and in the mean- 
time it is to little purpose, that our country abounds 
in men and subsistence, if they cannot be called forth 
for her defence. 

All the requisitions of Congress upon the several 
States contain a provision for future liquidation, when 
the quotas shall have been ascertained according to the 
articles of confederation. The evil consequeuces 



444 ROBERT MORRIS. 

which have followed from this are very evident, and 
the great advantages which would have resulted from 
rendering ever)' appointment final and conclusive are 
equally evident. But those, who, on such ground, 
build a censure against Congress, ought to consider, 
that they could not act otherwise, before the confeder- 
ation was completed. 

The changes which have already happened in the 
affairs of the several States at the different periods of 
the war are so great, that any apportionment formerly 
made, however equitable then, would be inequitable 
now. To determine the quota, therefore, from the 
present situation, or from any particular moment of 
the past, must be equally improper. But the quotas 
must be determined at some period or other. If we 
suppose it already done, we shall clearly see how 
many inconveniences would have been avoided, and 
how many advantages gained. True it is, that let this 
final adjustment of the quota take place when it will, 
difficulties will arise by reason of those changes in the 
circumstances of the several States, which have been 
already mentioned. But those difficulties will be daily 
increased, and become at length insurmountable. If a 
final determination of past quotas were made now, it 
must be arbitrary in some degree ; but if we carry our 
ideas forward to the end of several years, it must be 
still more arbitrary. To attempt a settlement of ac- 
counts subject to after revision, and after determination, 
is still worse; for it is liable to every objection, which 
lies against leaving them unsettled, to every difficulty, 
which could attend the final settlement, and has the 
additional evil, that by placing the several precise bal- 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESFOJNDEJNCE. 445 

unces immediately before the eyes of Congress, they 
could take no step, which would not be charged with 
partiality. I will dwell no longer on this subject, for 
I trust the United States in Congress will agree with 
me in one leading position, that after taking a general 
view of the past, from the commencement of the war 
to the present moment, a certain rate or quota should 
be established for .each State of the whole expense now 
incurred, excepting the public debt of the United 
States. I will presently assign the reasons for this ex- 
ception ; but that general position which I have 
advanced is the corner stone ; without it nothing can 
be done, at least such is my conviction. Hence we 
have the irresistible conclusions, 

1st. That while a demand of Congress is the mere 
request of a loan, instead of a complete appointment of 
it will not be attended to. 

2dly. That while from the unsettled state of public 
accounts, the individual Staies are led to suppose that 
there is a balance in their favor, by superior exertions 
for which they neither have, nor are like to have any 
credit, they will relax their efforts. 

3dly. That the final settlement of these accounts 
cannot take place until the quotas be finally ad- 
justed. 

•tthly. That a settlement of accounts, which is not 
final will [blank in the manuscript] 

I feel, therefore, a demonstration, that the past cir- 
cumstances and situations of the several States should 
be candidly reviewed, that the- apportionment of all 
the past expenses should be made now, and that it 
should be final. Thus, if the whole expense be slated 



446 ROBERT MORRIS. 

at one hundred, each State would be declared charge- 
able with a certain number of parts of that hundred, 
and thus a standard will be established by which to 
determine the proportion, let the amount be what it 
may. I know it is not possible to do strict justice, 
but it is certain that less injustice will be done in this 
mode than any other, and that without adopting it 
nothing effectual can be done. 

After the proportion is fixed the principles on which 
to admit the various charges will next come into 
consideration. I know it will be difficult to draw such 
a line as will apply to all cases, or which will be abso- 
lutely just even in those to which it does apply. Yet 
neither of these objections ought to prevent Congress 
frjm laying down those general rules, which shall on 
the whole appear to be most equitable. The various 
requisitions have been made payable at certain days. 
The value, therefore, of the demand ought to be esti- 
mated at the day of payment fixed by each, and the 
proper mode of doing this would be by the table of 
depreciation, formed the 29ih day of July, 17S0, in 
pursuance of the Act of Congress of the 2Slh day of 
June preceding. It is possible that this table is not 
perfect; but we must remember, that it has been fixed 
by the authority of the United States, and acted upon. 
It ought, therefore, to be adhered to ; for there is 
always less of inconvenience and danger in pursuing 
an established rule, than in I lie frequent change of 
rules; because the former is at the worst only a partial, 
but the latter is a general evil. Assuming then this 
table as a standard, the account of the requisitions pre- 
vious to the ISth of March, 1780, will stand thus;

there is payable by January 1st, 
17S0, 60,000,000 dollars, equal 
to ' 2,042,500 

By the resolution of October 6th, 
1779, payable by February 1st, 
17S0, 15,000,000, equal to 451,041 60 

March 1st, 17S0, 15,000,000, 

equal to 401,450 30 



5,054, 9S2 39 4 
Thus the whole demand marie on the Slates, from 
the beginning of the war to the 1st of March, 17S0, is 
but little more than five millions of dollars. And yet 
this demand, moderate as it. is, has not been complied 
with. 

By the various resolutions of Congress on the sub- 
ject of requisitions it is provided, that interest at six 
per cent shall be charged on the sums due, and allowed 
on the sums paid. The sums paid do, in no instances, 
amount to the value of the demand, but each State has 
an account against the Union for advances, by supplies 
furnished of various kinds, and by payments made to 



448 ROBERT MORRIS 

militia. As no taxes were laid by the Slates, the 
sums they expended were procured partly from the 
continental treasury and partly by the emission of 
State currency, which tended to depreciate the conti- 
nental paper, and impede its circulation. A consider- 
ation of the mischiefs arising from this circumstance 
will much diminish the merit, which is assumed from 
those advances. If the State paper had not been 
issued, the same services might have been performed 
by an equal sum of continental money, and the general 
torrent of depreciation would then have swept away 
those expenditures, which now exist as State charges. 
From hence it might in strictness be inferred, that the 
continent should not be charged for the amount of 
State paper advanced, and that amount be estimated at 
its value when redeemed by the Slate, especially as 
Congress have not only urged the States not to emit 
money, but even to call in what they had already 
emitted. But this inference would perhaps be rather 
too strvng. No such idea has been formerly advanced 
by Congress, and therefore the States, not having had 
due notice, might conceive the determination at this 
late period to be inequitable. 

On the whole, therefore, it may be proper to estimate the 
sums paid by them according to the rule already noticed, 
especially as the method of redeeming the old continental 
money formerly adopted, will, if pursued, work some de- 
gree of equality. For it will create a demand for the old 
money in those Slates, which, by the amount of their own 
emissions, have expelled it from themselves and forced it 
upon their neighbors. There must, however, be a distinc- 
tion made in the advances of the several States ; much of 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 449 

them Ins been fop the pny nu:l support of the militia, ami 
much of that for the private defence of particular States, 
nod of that again a part has frequently been unnecessary. 
To so, at this late period, into a close investigation of the 
subject, is impracticable, and perhaps dangerous. Neither 
Would it answer any valuable purpose. Some general 
rule, therefore, must be adopted, and propriety seems to 
require, that credit should be given only for those expen- 
ditures on militia, which were previously authorised and 
required by express resolutions of Congress. With respect 
to all other articles, there is also to be noted a distinction 
between those which were furnished by the several States 
previously to thp 22d of November, 1777, when the first 
demand of money was made, and those made subsequently 
tii that period. 1 woidd propose that the former, as also 
the militia expenses not expressly authorised as abovt men- 
tioned, should be taken together into one account, and the 
specie value of the whole estimated. That the amount of 
both, throughout America, should be apportioned by the 
same standard with the other expenses. And ths.t the 
several actual expenditures of each State should be settled 
and liquidated with its proportional part of the whole, and 
the several balances carried to their respective debits and 
credits in the general accounts. These balances should 
bear interest at six per cent to the 1 8th of March, 17S0. 
Thus, suppose the whole of those expenses should amount 
to one million of dollars, and that the Stale A be held to 
pay ni.;c, and the State B ten parts out of every hundred ; 
the State A would be accountable for ninety thousand 
dollars, and ,the Stale B for one hundred thousand dollars. 
Ami if it should appear, that the former ha. I paid one 
hundred thousand, and the latter only ninety thousand, the 
vol. xi. 57 



453 ROBERT MORRIS. 

f >r.ii ■!• would !)f credited, and the h.tter debited ten 
thousand d.tllai'S, iviih six per cent interest. 

I would propose, that the advances made by the several 
States, subsequent to die 22d of November, and prior to 
the ISdi of March, 1780, excepting those to militia not 
authorised, should bo estimated as aforesaid, ami carried to 
account regularly upon the advances of money made to 
each from the Continental treasury, and the apportionment 
of the several demands made by Congress, in like manner 
with the moneys paid to their order. And that interest, 
at six per cent, should be charged or credited upon the 
several balances, until the ISdi of .March, 17S0. 

I would further propose, that on that day these balances, 
and those hefoie mentioned, should be liquidated together, 
and the final capitals be considered as principal sums, 
beari ig interest at six per cent. Thus, supposing the 
Slate A, in one account, to be credited ten thousand dol- 
lars, amounting, with interest, to eleven thousand, and 
debited in the other account five thousand, amounting, with 
interest, to six ; in tiiat case, die final balance, on the ISth 
of March, would be a credit of five thousand dollars. 

On the J Silt of March, we come to a new and more 
enlightened era of public accounts. The appointment 
formerly mentioned as preliminary to a settlement, will 
determine the quota due by each State for the two hun- 
dred millions of old Continental money, valued at forty for 
one. These resolutions of the ISth of March, 17S0, i.ot 
having been fully complied with, there appears to be a 
propriety in the following plan. 

1 st. To charge the several States with their proportions 
of it at that rate. 

2dly. To fix some future day for the full compliance 
with the resolution. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 451 

3(!ly. To receive old paper at the rate of forty for one, 
in discharge of those proportions, until thai diy ; and, 

4ihiy. To charge the balances then unpaid in specie, 
with a debit and credit of interest at six per cent in the 
manner before mentioned, 

I am sensible, that many persons now condemn the reso- 
lutions of the 18th of I\l;.reh, anil among these are found 
some of those who warmly advocated it previously to that 
period. It is not my business to enter into arguments on 
the subject. Be those resolutions wise or unwise, they are 
acts of the sovereign authority, which have been obeyed 
by some, if not by all, and therefore those who have 
obeyed ought not to suffer by their obedience. They are 
acts for the redemption of bills issued by that sovereign, 
and they have formed the standard of public opinion with 
respect t<» those biils. If, therefore, for argument's sake, 
it were admitted, that the measure was impolitic and un- 
just, yet, now that it has taken place, there would certainly 
be both injustice and bad policy in altering it. The re- 
spective States have either obeyed it in the whole, or in 
part, or have totally neglected it. The* first have a right 
to insist upon a compliance with it. The second must 
Ir.ue so far accommodated themselves to it, as that interior 
mischiefs would arise from changing the system. And ih<3 
last, whatever may be their claim to superior wisdom, will 
at least acknowledge, that the precedent of disobedience 
once established, our Union must soon be at an end, and 
the authority of Congress reduced to a metaphysical idea. 
Besides, the claim of such States must ultimately rest mi 
the foundation of their own neglect ; and as this will always 
be in their own power, it will be sufficient to rear any 
argument lor any purpose. 



452 ROBERT MORRIS. 

By the resolutions of the IStli of March, 1780, ten 
millions of dollars of new paper were to haw been isseed, 
wheieof four millions were to he at the order of Congress. 
By the resolutions of the 2Gth of August, ITSO, three 
millions more were demanded. By the resolutions of the 
4th of November, ITSO, besides the specific supplies, an 
additional demand was made of one million, six hundred 
and fortytwo thousand, nine hundred and eighiyseven and 
two thirds dollars hi money : and hv the resolutions of the 

• * • 

] Gih of March, ITS I, six millions more are required. 
These sums amount in the whole to fourteen millions, six 
hundred and fortytwo thousand, nine hundred and eighty- 
sewn dollars and two thirds. A very small part of this 
sum has yet been pnid ; but admitting that there may have 
been circulated '.y the United States two millions, six hun- 
dred and fortytwo thousand, nine hundred and eightyseven 
dollars and two thirds, twelve millions would still remain 
due. If from 1I113 we deduct the whole of the new emis- 
sions, it would leave a balance of two millions. I piopose, 
therefore, the following plan. 

1st. That no more of these new emissions be used on 
any pretence. 

2dly. That as fast as the old Continental money is 
brought in, the several Slates be credited for the new 
emissions to have been issued as sjefie, agreeably to the 
several resolutions of Congress upon that subject ; ami, 

3<lly. That on all those requisitions last mentioned, the 
money of the new emissions of any particular Slate bo 
received as specie. 

It is true, that these propositions are liable to exception, 
but they have the great advantage of being consistent ivilh 
former resolutions of Congress, which should always be 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 453 

attended to as much as possible. I am sure that Congress 
must be convinced of this, for they are not to learn, that 
authority is weakened by the frequent change nf measures 
and pursuits ; that such changes injure the reputation of 
supreme power in public opinion, and that opinion is the 
source and support of the sovereign authority. It is lur- 
llier to be observed, that the motives for complying with 
the resolutions of the J 8 •. 1 1 of March, will, if the above plan 
is adopted, become very strong ; for in that case, every 
forty dollars ol old Continental, | aid by a State, will pro- 
duce to the credit side of its account three dollars in spe- 
cie ; because in the first place, the whole proportion of 
old Continental being (hanged at forty for one, and re- 
ceivable until a certain day at the same rate, thai payment 
will so far operate a discharge of one dollar ; and in the 
second place, it will entitle the Slate to two dollars of the 
new emission, which not being issued, will also be carried 
to its credit upon its several requisitions. 

It will be in the wisdom of the United Slates, in Con- 
gress assembled, to determine whether after the expiration 
of t!ie day to be fixed for the a Love purpose, they will per- 
mit the possessors of the old Continental money to bring it 
in loan at the rate of forty for one. It is true, that this 
miirht operate against those States, who have not complied 
with the resolutions of the lS'.h of March, 1760, and who 
have not now the old Continental to comply with i; ; but it 
is entirely consistent with the former resolutions of Con- 
irrcss, and the Stales are themselves blamable for the 
neglect. Resides, those who now hold the Continental 
do it either from choice, because ol their confidence in 
Congress, or. from necessity, because it has been poured 
i.i upon them from those places where it was of inferior 



451 ROBERT MORRIS. 

value, and this inferiority was owing to the neglect of those 
States in riot passing the laws which Congress recom- 
mended. There is, thereforp, a degree ol jusiiee and 
firmness in that measure, whic h will create confidence in 
the future acts of the United States. 

Whatever principles may he established for settling these 
accounts, and however ju ? t they may be, many doubts will 
arise in the application ol them. It must always he re- 
membered, that the States are independent ; and that while 
they are pressed to a compliance with their duty, they 
must have full evidence, that Congress act fairly. It might 
therefore be proper, that for the settlement of their ac- 
counts, Commissioners should be chosen as follows ; one 
by the State, one by the United Slates, one by the other 
two, and the decision of the majority to be final. 

Hitherto I have taken no notice of the specific supplies 
called for from the spveral Slates. Many of these have 
been furnished, and many remain to be provided. I would 
exclude them entirely from the other public accounts ; but 
as the apportionment so olien mentioned, will give a rule 
to go by, I shall continue to press for the supplir? ; or 
where l bey are not wanted, make such composition wi;h 
the Slates in lieu of ihose which remain to be hirn'shed, as 
the public service shall render most eligible. 

I have observed, that the public debts ought to be ex- 
cepted from the apportionment of past expenses. The 
reason is clear. Those debts, or at least a great pan of 
them, may subsist until the relative wealth el the Stales 
has entirely changed. Those who are now most licit, 
may become poor, and those who are poor, may heroine 
rich. This is not all ; these debts are hitherto unfunded. 
The creditors have indeed the general promise of govern- 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 455 

merit, and some of them have ceitificntos as evidences of 
t!i;H promise ; but until measures are taken in provide solid 
funds for the final payment, the puUie credit must languish; 
To an enlightened mind, it is needless to ddate on the ad- 
vantages resulting from national credit. Congress will 
doubtless pursue the steps necessary for its perfect estab- 
lishment* And this cannot be otherwise accomplished, 
than bv raisinsi taxes in hard money from sources which 
must be productive and increasing. Those taxes must be 
so bound to the public creditors for the debts due to them, 
that the produce cannot be diverted. These taxes ought 
to be raised from the same article •, at the same rates, and 
in the same manner throughout the whole confederation ; 
and consequently, a present apportionment of the public 
debts will be as unnecessary as it would be unjust. 

I think it my rimy, while 1 am upon this subject, to men- 
tion my opinion, that in addition to the five per cent called 
for on articles imported, and on prizes and prize <;oods, it 
would be pmper to appropriate to the payment of the pub- 
lic debts, ? land tax, a poll lax, and an excise on spirituous 
liquors. 1 readily grant that neither of these taxes would 
be strictly equal between the States, nor indeed can any 
other tax be so, but I am convinced, that all of them taken 
together, would be as nearly equal as the fluctuating na- 
ture of human affairs will permit. 1 am, however, to ob- 
serve in addition, that the land tax should be laid at a cer- 
tain rate per acre, because the superior certainty of such a 
tax will give it the preference of others, although it cannot 
perhaps be so great as might have been expected. What- 
ever inequalities may remain, must be adjusted among in- 
dividuals, by the several States in raising their quotas, and 
although those quotas will be most considerable during the 



45G ROBERT MORRIS. 

war, yet it must be remembered, that after the conclusion 
of it, such sums will be necessary for the establishing a 
maiine and other national purposes, as will still enable the 
Slates to continue, their interior regulations fur equalizing 
tile general taxes. 

Among the public debts, there are a considerable num- 
ber of certificates given by public officers to the e tizins of 
tin; several States fur articles occasionally taken for the 
public use. Willi respect to tht se- eeiiificales, it is unne- 
cessary to mention, that they have aniicipated ihe revenue, 
and brought us to the brink of destruction. But it is time 
to pay a particular attention to (hem. Many ways may be 
fallen upon for their liquidation, nil of which ore perhaps 
justly exceptionable. 

1st. Thry may be consolidated with the rest of the pub- 
lic debt, and be made payable at a future period ; but this 
could only be by f.ircing a loan from the people, many of 
whom are unable to make it, and of consequence it would 
be a hard measure, if not an unjust one. Perhaps it could 
not be executed, lor laws repugnant to ihe general feelings 
of mankind are only a dead letter. 2dly. Another mode 
is by receiving them in taxes, but this is very dangerous 
for several reasons, among which, the two following are 
cogent. The public revenue will not bear such a heavy 
deduction as those certificates would create, and the collec- 
tors of taxes would be liable to be defrauded themselves, 
or the remedy for that would give them opportunities of 
defrauding the public, which considering the natural bent 
and disposition ol many men, ought to be carefully provided 
against. A third mode would be, by turning over the 
holders of these eeiiificales to their respective Slates, and 
giving credit for them on account of the specific supplies. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 457 

This may in some degree become necessary in cases 
where the negligence of the States on the one hand, and 
the necessities of the army on the other, have compelled to 
seize by force what ought to have been collected by law. 
But in many cases it cannot be done, and it would be im- 
proper in many others where it is practicable. 

Among the bad consequences, which attend the present 
mode of supplying our armies, or rather leaving them to 
supply themselves, it is one of no small magnitude, that the 
officers who are compelled to the melancholy duty of plun- 
dering their fellow citizens, endeavor by the sum of their 
certificates, to compensate for the manner of taking as well 
as for the value of the thing taken. Nor is that all; where 
there is a disposition for fraud, an ample opportunity is 
afforded to commit it. Whatever may be the cause, I am 
informed, that these certificates are for sums vastly beyond 
the value of the services and articles obtained for them. 
The respective States would naturally be led to give to these 
certificates their specified value, and it cannot be expected 
that they will scrutinise them so rigidly as they ought, if they 
are to be accepted in discharge of demands existing against 
the particular State. To all these modes there are also 
some further objections. Among which it is my duty to 
state the following. The accounts of the several staff 
officers still remain unsettled. The certificates given by 
them, if they are to be paid by the public, ought to be 
carried both to the debit and credit of their cash accounts, 
and the articles obtained carried to their debit in the ac- 
count of expenditures. Of consequence the amount of 
these last debits must depend much upon the amoOnt of 
the certificates, and therefore either the certificates given 
should be known, and the accounts settled with those 
vol. xi. 58 



458 ROBERT MORRIS. 

charges, or the account should be settled, and no other 
certificates allowed but such as are charged in it. 

A further mode of liquidating these certificates would be, 
by purchasing them from the holders ; but it is needless 
to state any other objections to it than the want of money, 
which is fell through all our operations. There still re- 
mains this method. 

1st. That at present those certificates should neither be 
receivable in taxes nor transferable. 

2dly. That they should be taken up and examined in 
the course of settling the public accounts. 

3dly. That they should be brought to the amount in 
specie, which the article procured, or service performed, 
was reasonably worth. 

4thly. That where the sum due to any person on cer- 
tificates is small, a bill for the amount should be given, 
payable at the distance of a year. 

5thly. That where the sum is large it should be divided 
into five different parts, and bills given payable in one, 
two, three, four, and five years, calculating on each part 
an interest of six per cent, and adding it to the amount. 
As if for instance, the sum were one hundred pounds, 
then the bills would be for twentyone pounds four shil- 
lings, twentytvvo pounds eight shillings, twentythree pounds 
twelve shillings, twentyfour pounds sixteen shillings, and 
twentyfive pounds. 

6thly. That these bills should be drawn payable to the 
bearer, and in such form as not to be counterfeited with- 
out great difficulty. 

Tthlv. That they should be receivable in continental 
taxes, within any of the Slates, as cash, at the times when 
they are respectively due, or if not so received, payable 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 459 

by the continental treasurer, or any receiver of the con- 
tinental taxes, on demand, after collecting the taxes, in 
which they were respectively receivable. 

In this way a credit would be obtained not only with- 
out injury, but probably with advantage to the individual. 
The anticipation of the public revenue would not be very 
great, and, as a list of these notes would be kept, the 
amount of every year's anticipation would be accurately 
known. Exceptions may probably be found even to this 
mode, but unfortunately for us, we have only an a'ternative 
of difficulties. All which human prudence can do in such 
cases is to choose the least. 

I have the honor to be, Sir, &c. 

ROBERT MORRIS. 



TO THE GOVERNOR OF MARYLAND. 

Office of Finance, Philadelphia, 1 
August 2dth, 1761. J 

Sir, 

Whilst I was at Head Quarters, near Dobbs's Ferry, the 
determination was taken by his Excellency the Comman- 
der in Chief, to send a very considerable force against the 
enemy's troops under Earl Cornwallis in Virginia ; and 
immediately on my return hither, I did myself the honor 
to address your Excellency, respecting the specific supplies 
due from the State of Maryland to the United States, 
upon the requisitions of Congress, of the 25th of February 
and 4th of November, 1780, well knowing the whole 
balance due on these calls of Congress would now 
become absolutely necessary to the intended operations. 

1 am very sensible that your government have upon 






460 ROBERT MORRIS. 

all occasions executed demands of Congress with a deci- 
sion and vigor, which does them honor, and on that account 
I should decline saying anything calculated to stimulate 
their present exertions, did I not know, that everything 
depends thereon. Virginia, North and South Carolina, 
have long subsisted large armies, and that expense of pro- 
visions must come to their credit. The New England 
States, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, have 
supported, and must continue to support, the main army. 
Pennsylvania will also contribute towards the support of 
the southern army, and her supplies will be directed both 
ways, as circumstances may require. Delaware and 
Maryland must chiefly be depended on. Virginia and 
North Carolina will, I hope, continue to do all they can. 
But your Excellency must be perfectly sensible, that I 
have not any funds wherewith to purchase supplies; no 
State in the Union has hitherto supplied me with money, 
except Pennsylvania. But as the money of that State 
is (in consequence of plans adopted for that purpose) very 
rapidly rising in value, it would be improper to call it into 
circulation at present, when it is at the rate of only two 
for one, though it has been as low as seven, because the 
public interest would thereby be injured, and indeed I 
might be charged with defeating the measures I myself 
had taken, in the very moment when they bid f;.irest for 
success. 

The security of your State, the safety of individuals 
and their property are so immediately connected with 
the present operations, that I persuade myself your 
Excellency will receive every aid and support in your 
exertions, that you can wish, both from public bodies 
and individuals. My dependence, therefore, on re- 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 46 1 

ceiving the supplies from your State seems well 
founded. 

I have the honor to transmit your Excellency here- 
with a letter from the Commander in Chief on the 
same suhject, which will add weight to my entreaties. 
I have written to Donaldson Yeates, Quarter Master 
of the States of Maryland and Delaware, to procure 
immediately as many craft or vessels suitable for trans- 
porting; the troops from the head of the Elk to Virginia, 
as will carry about seven thousand men, with the ne- 
cessary provisions and apparatus. I have written to 
Mr Ridley, William Smith, and some others in Balti- 
more, to assist in procuring these vessels, and should 
any application to your Excellency be necessary on 
this subject, I persuade myself, that the authority of 
the government or weight of its influence will be 
brought in aid of the Quarter Master's endeavors to 
procure the shipping. I have also written to Mr Cal- 
houn to know what part of the specific supplies he has 
ready, and what prospects for the remainder. He must 
bestir himself, as indeed must every person on whom 
the procuring of these articles depends. 

While the demands for the campaign are constantly 
transmitted to me, and so much depends upon the 
measures I am constantly taking to economise the 
public funds and facilitate our military operations, your 
Excellency will perceive that full, early, and accurate 
intelligence upon the various objects of my Depart- 
ment is of the utmost importance. I must, therefore, 
reiterate my requests for it. To act from necessity 
and on the spur of occasion is not only the source of 
waste and extravagance, but frequently defeats plans 



462 ROBERT MORRIS. 

otherwise the best concerted, while on the other hand, 
that timely forecast and early provision, which com- 
plete knowledge of circumstances can alone permit of, 
will save much public money, and go very far to in- 
sure victory to our arms. 

I am, with great respect, &c. 

ROBERT MORRIS.* 



CIRCULAR TO THE GOVERNORS OF THE STATES. 

Office of Finance, September 4th, 1781 
Sir, 

I do myself the honor to enclose the plan of a Na- 
tional Bank, which I laid before the United States in 
Congress assembled on the 17th day of May last, and 
which was adopted by them on the 26th. I have now 
the pleasure to inform your Excellency, that an elec- 
tion for Directors will be held iw this city on the 1st 
day of November next. 

It is important that the execution of this plan be 
facilitated as much as possible, and particularly that of 

"August 30th. Went out to meet his Excellency General Wash- 
ington, who arrived in this city about one o'clock, amidst the uni- 
versal acclamations of the citizens, who displayed every mark of joy 
on the occasion. His Excellency alighted at the City Tavern, 
received the compliments of many gentlemen, who went out to 
escort him, and of others who came there to pay him their respects 
and then adjourned to my house with his suit, Count de Rocham- 
beau, the Chevalier Chastellux. General Knox, General Moultrie, 
and others, to dinner. The owners of several ships in the harbor 
ordered them out into the stream, and filed salutes, whilst we drank,

jesty, The United Provinces, The Allied Armies, Count de Grasse's

it which relates to the currency of the bank notes. 
The inhabitants of the United States already suffer 
from the want of a circulating medium. Of conse- 
quence the taxes must* soon press heavily on the 
people. My feelings conspire with my duty in 
prompting me to alleviate those burdens. Therefore 
I pray the speedy attention of your Legislature to that 
resolution, by which the notes are to be receivable in 
payment of all taxes, duties, or debts due, or that may 
become due or payable to the United States. 

I do not doubt either the credit or currency of bank 
notes, but I wish to render them equally useful to 
America in the individual as well as collective capa- 
city, and to supply the necessities of the husbandman 
as well as the merchant. I shall not at present men- 
lion the other articles to be attended to ; nor will I 
adduce any arguments in favor of my present propo- 
sition, as it is evidently calculated for the ease and 
benefit of the people you preside over. I hope, how- 
ever, that your Legislature will not only pass the 
proper laws to make bank notes receivable in the 
manner mentioned in the resolution, but that it will 
be done soon. 

With all possible respect, &c. 

ROBERT xMORRIS.* 

* September 5th. The Commander in Chief having repeatedly 
urged, both by letter and in conversation, the necessity of advanc- 
ing a month's pay to the detachment of troops marching to the 
southward, under the command of Major General Lincoln, and my 
funds and resources being at this time totally inadequate to make 
that advance, and at the same time answer the various demands that 
are indispensable, I made application to the Count de Rochambeau 
for a loan of twenty thousand hard dollars, for such time as his rnili- 



464 ROBERT MORRIS. 

TO THE COUNT DE KOCHAMBEAU. 

Office of Finance, September 6th, 1781. 
Sir, 

In consequence of the conversation I had the honor to 
hold with your Excellency yesterday, and your promise 
to supply the United States with the sum of twenty thou- 

tary chest could, without inconvenience, spare that sum, promising- 
repayment at the time he should name. 

1 was desired to meet the Count at the Chevalier de la Luzerne's 
house, which I did on Wednesday the 5th instant, where I met the 
said Minister, Count de Rochambeau, and General Chastellux. 
They informed me of their strong desire to comply with my request 
but that their treasury was at present not well filled, considering the 
daily drains upon it, and that although they had money arrived at 
Boston, it would require six or eight weeks to get it from thence; 
that although they expected money by the fleet of Count de Grasse, 
yet it was not then arrived, and of course that supply was less cer- 
tain than the other ; that the Intendant and the Treasurer were set 
out for the head of the Elk, and their consent was necessary ; how- 
ever, they concluded this subject with requesting that I should ride 
down to Chester, where we should overtake those gentlemen, and if 
it were possible on consideration of all circumstances they would 
supply the money required. 

General Washington was extremely desirous, that the troops 
should receive their month's pay, as great symptoms of discontent 
had appeared on their passing through this city without it. This 
affair being considered of great importance, I desired Mr Governeur 
Morris, my assistant, to accompany me, on account of his speaking 
fluently the French language. We set out at three o'clock for 
Chester, and on the road met an express from General Washington, 
who left us in the morning to join his troops at the head of the Elk, 
with the agreeable news of the safe arrival of Count de Grasse and 
his fleet in the Chesapeake. This news I received with infinite sat- 
isfaction on every account, and among the rest one reason was the 
facility it would give the French treasury in complying with my 
views, and this I found was actually the case, as Count de Rocham- 
beau very readily agreed at Chester to supply at the head of the Elk

sand dollars, for an immediate purpose, to be replaced on 
the 1 st day of October next, I have directed Mr Philip 
Audibert, the bearer of this letter, to wait upon you. I 

twenty thousand hard dollars, to such person as I should appoint to 
receive them. I engaged to replace the same sum in their treasury 
by the 1st day of October next. 

On Thursday forenoon I returned to this city about twelve o'clock' 
having been impeded in my journey by meeting the last division of 
the French army, their artillery, and baggage on the road. On my re- 
turn I immediately despatched Mr Philip Audibert, Deputy Paymas- 
ter General, to the head of the Elk, with orders to receive the money, 
pay the troops, (fee. agreeably to instructions given hirn in writing. 
In the conferences with Count de Rochambeau and General Chas- 
tellux, they asked whether, if upon any occasion their treasury 
should stand in need of temporary aids, I thought they could procure 
loans in this city. I answered, that money is very scarce, that the 
people who have property generally keep it employed, and that no 
certain dependence can be placed on any given sums, but that I 
knew the people to be very generally disposed to assist our generous 
allies, and should such occasions offer, I was certain they would 
exert themselves ; and as to my own part they might on every occa- 
sion command my utmost services, assistance, and exertions, both 
as a public officer, and as an individual. I mentioned to them again 
the affair of exchange, showing that they had reduced the price 
below what it had been raised to by my measures, and requested 
that in future when they expected to raise money by bills, they 
should in good time previously lodge them with the Minister, and 
that on his giving me timely notice, I would cause the most advan- 
tageous sale to be made of them, and deliver him the money without 
any other charge or deduction, than the expense of the brokerage. 

I observed, that this mode of proceeding was now become essen- 
tially necessary, as there is no general market for bills of exchange 
to the southward, but that Philadelphia, in that respect, is as Boston 
to the eastern States. They answered, that they expected to pro- 
cure their supplies with money, without occasion to draw bills, but 
if it happened otherwise they would pursue my advice. In regard 
to the articles of provisions, forage, wood, transportation, &c. ne- 
eessary for their army, and which, when at camp, I had offered to

shall be much obliged to your Excellency if you will be 
pleased to direct, that the above sum be paid to Mr Audi- 
bert, and that duplicate receipts be t;.ken of him, one of 
which I pray may be transmitted to me. I will take care 
that the money be replaced at the time agreed upon. 
With every wish for the most biilliant success to the allied 
arms, and for your own personal glory, I am, very respect- 
fully, &ic

TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Chester, September 6th, 1781. 
Dear General, 

Permit me most sincerely to congratulate you on the 
arrival of the French fleet, nnd to express my warmest 
wishes for the success oi your future operations. 

As soon as I arrive at Philadelphia, I shall give direc- 
tions for the Deputy Paymaster to repair to the head of 
the Elk, and make the payment of a month's pay in specie 
to the detachment under the command of General Lincoln. 
I wish the Stales had enabled me to do moie, but it is 
to be lamented, that the supineness of the several Legis- 
latures still leaves the servants of the public to struggle 
with ummerited distresses. 

procure for them on the same terms as for the continental army, by 
contract, I proposed to postpone that matter, as it might be best to 
continue their present method of supplies during the active scenes 
they are likely to be engaged in, as their Agents have given satis- 
faction, and are acquainted in the country where they are going, 
and that I could advertise for proposals to supply them the ensuing 
winter, and lay before them such offers or proposals as I should re- 
ceive. This appeared very satisfactory, and here that subject rests 
for the present. Diary. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 467 

It shall, however, be a part of my business to rouse 
them into exertion, and I hope soon to see the army better 
paid than heretofore, and ! confide, that your Excellency 
will, with every ether public officer, exert your influence 
to aid me in this necessary task. 
With the greatest respect, &e.

Dear Sir, < 

Every day discovers to me the increasing necessity of 
some money for the troops. I hope by this time you are 
provided to give a month's pay. 1 find it of the last im- 
portance to hasten forward myself to join the Marquis de 
Lafayette as soon as possible. I may leave this in a few 
hours ; I cannot do it, however, without entreating you in 
the warmest terms to send on a month's pay at least, with 
all the expedition possible. 1 wish it to come on the 
wings of speed. 

I am, Dear Sir, he

Head of the Elk, September 7th, 1781. 
Dear Sir, 

I have received your two favors of yesterday. 1 find 
myself so pressed by circumstances, that it will be impos- 
sible for me to stay at this place till the payment of the 
money committed to Mr Audibert can be effected. I must 



468 ROBERT MORRIS. 

leave the head of the Elk this afternoon or early tomorrow 
morning. I shall however leave instructions with Gen- 
eral Lincoln to do all that is necessary on the occasion. 
The sum of twenty thousand dollars will fall much short 
of the sum necessary. 

The five hundred guineas on my own account 1 have 
received.

TO GEORGE WASHINGTON. 

Office of Finance, September 10th, 1781. 
Dear Sir, 

The sole intent of this is to acknowledge the receipt of 
your two letters of the 7th instant ; that which related 
to the month's pay you would see was answered by the 
steps previously taken, but 1 am a good deal disappointed 
and put to inconvenience by the money at the Elk falling 
short of the object, which obliges me to send money thither 
that was absolutely necessary to fulfil my engagements here. 
1 must struggle through these difficulties, but the doing so 
requires that attention and time, which ought to be be- 
stowed upon greater objects. 

The letter respecting the crimina Iwas too late, the poor 
fellow was gone. I am sorry for it, and remain your 
Excellency's most obedient, &c.

* September 13th. Several members of Congress and others called

DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 4G9 

B. FRANKLIN TO ROBERT MORRIS. 

Passy, September 12th, 1781. 
Dear Sir, 

I have received your letters of July 13tli, 14il;, I Oil), 
and 2 1 st, all at once, by way of L'Orient. The originals 
of those you mention to have sent by Major Franks are 
not yet come to hand, nor have I heurd of his arrival in 
Spain. 

Your letters of June 6th and 8th were remarkably lucky 
in getting to hand. I think 1 have received seven of the 
copies you had the precaution to send of them. I enclose 
copies of my answers. 

I have now the pleasure to acquaint you, that I have ob- 
tained a promise of the sum I wanted to pay the bills I had 
accepted for the purchases made in Holland ; so that your 
supplying me with remittances for that purpose, which I 
requested, is now unnecessary, and I shall finish the year 
with honor. But it is as much as 1 can do, with the aid of 
the sum I stopped in Holland ; the drafts on Mr Jay and 
on Mr Adams much exceeding what I had been made to 
expect. 

I had been informed, that the Congress had promised to 
draw no more bills on Europe, after the month of March 
last, till they should know they had funds here ; but I learn 
from Mr Adams, that some bills have been lately presented 

wherein I direct Mr Jay to protest certain bills of exchange 
drawn by authority of Congress. The explanation is easily given, 
as the ship on board which I had remitted these bills was taken. 
The moment I knew her fate, 1 judged it proper to stop payment 
of the bills, lest the enemy, with their usual cunning, might attempt 
to procure the money ; but I am now of opinion, that the Captain 
sunk them when captured. Diary.

to him, drawn June 22d, on Mr Laurens, who is in the 
tower, which makes the proceeding seem extraordinary. 
Mr Adams cannot pay these bills, and I cannot engage for 
them ; for I see by the minutes of Congress you have sent 
me, that though they have stopped issuing bills drawn on 
the Ministers at Madrid, and the Hague, until they shall be 
assured that funds are provided for paying them, they have 
left open to be sold those drawn on their Minister at Ver- 
sailles, funds or no funds; which, in the situation you will 
see I am in by ine letters of the Count de Vergennes, ter- 
rifies me ; for I have promised not to accept any drafts 
made on me by order of Congress, if such should be after 
the time above mentioned, unless I have funds in my hands, 
or in view, to pay them. After its being declared to me, 
that such bills could not be provided for, and my promise 
not to engage for them, it will be impossible to ask (or the 
money, if I should accept them ; and I believe those bills 
of Mr Ross must go back protested. 

The projected loan in Holland has of late some appear- 
ances of success. J am indeed told it is agreed to by the 
States ; but I do not yet think it so certain as to venture, 
or advise the venturing, to act in expectation of it. The 
instant it is assured, I will send you advice of it by every 
opportunity, and will, from lime to time, send parts of it in 
cash by such ships of war as can conveniently take it. 

I cannot write to you fully by this opportunity. I will 
not, however, delay acquainting you, that having the fullest 
confidence in your assurances of enabling me to pay them, 
I shall cheerfully accept your hills for four hundred thous- 
and livies. 

Captain Gillon has sailed from Holland, without taking 
under his convoy the two vessels that were freighted to

carry the goods purchased by Captain Jackson, in Holland. 
There has been terrible management there ; and from the 
confusion in the ship, before and when she sailed, it is a 
question if she ever arrives in America. 

They are hard at work here, in providing the supplies to 
replace those lost in the Marqiiis de Lafayette. 

Willi best wishes of success to you in your new employ- 
ment, and assurances of every aid 1 can afford you, I am,

TO M. DE LA LUZEUNE. 

Office of Finance, September 20th, 1781. 
Sir, 
His Excellency the Count de Rochambeau having gen- 
erously made me a very considerable advance of money, I 
was thereby enabled to give the detachment of our army 
under General Lincoln, one month's pay, which was earn- 
estly pressed upon me by the Commander in Chief. I 
promised M. de Rochambeau, that I would replace the 
sum borrowed, on the 6rst of next month, wherever the 
army should then be. 

The movement which lately took place to the southward, 
has been attended with a variety of expenses, which have 
been very heavy, and have absorbed all the money I could 
command, notwithstanding which many demands still re- 
main unsatisfied, so that I cannot obtain the sums neces- 
sary for the service from any ordinary means. 

As it is probable that the moneys which the Count de 
Grasse has brought, will prevent any immediate want by 
the fleets or armies of his Most Christian Majesty in the 
States of Maryland and Virginia, I am induced to believe, 



472 ROBERT MORRIS. 

that no inconvenience would arise from delaying the pay- 
ment, until the money in Boston shall be brought forward, 
which will be speedily, as a very active person has gone 
for it, who will lose no time in the business committed to 
him. 

Should your Excellency be of this opinion, I shall be 
glad if you will signify it to me, and if that be in your 
power, that you will extend the time when payment is to 
be made. But if you think the money must be forwarded 
to Virginia immediately, you may depend that I will in- 
stantly endeavor to procure it, and although that cannot be 
done but with great difficulty and much loss, yet nothing 
shall deter me from complying with my engagements. 
I have the honor to be, he. 

ROBERT MORRIS. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF PENNSYLVANIA. 

Office of Finance, September 20th, 1781. 
Sir, 

I am honored with your Excellency's letter of this date, 
and most sincerely wish my situation was such as to jus- 
tify a promise of aid, equal to the present necessities ; I 
mean the necessities that will be created by the call of 
the militia at this time, but unluckily the late movements 
of the army have so entirely drained me of money, that I 
have been obliged to pledge my personal credit very deeply 
in a variety of instances, besides borrowing money from 
my friends, and advancing, to promote the public service, 
every shilling of my own. In this situation I was prepar- 
ing an application to the honorable Council and Assembly 
for relief from my advances, from the State of Pennsyl- 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 473 

vania, and this will be the more necessary, as this alarm 
whilst it lasts will cut off* all possibility of recruiting the 
treasury. Those who possess hard money will keep it, 
and those who have demands will become more eager for 
payment, therefore, all I can promise is the use of my 
credit, and an exertion of any influence L may have in 
favor of such measures as may be deemed necessary. At 
the same time T do no! recede from my first opinion, that 
the enemy do not meditate any attack on this city. 
I have the honor to be, &.c. 

ROBERT MORRIS.* 



TO M. DE La LUZERNE. 

Office of Finance, September 25th, 1781. 
Sir, 
I received last night your Excellency's billet requesting 
to be informed of the amount of the bills drawn by me as 
Superintendent of the Finances, on Messrs Le Couteulx 
& Co. of Paris, under the sanction of you? engagements, 

* September 2\st. At one o'clock I waited on the President of 
the State of Pennsylvania, at his house in Market Street, and met 
there, Mr Peters and Mr Cornell, of the Board of War, General 
St Clair, General Irvine, and General Irwin, of the militia. This 
conference lasted a considerable time, and in its consequences took 
up the rest of the day. I gave it as my opinion, that Sir Henry 
Clinton did not intend for this city, nevertheless, as the inhabitants 
are alarmed and uneasy, I agreed to the propriety of being prepared, 
although I lamented the expense such preparations would puL us 
to. 1 advised the placing a garrison at Mud Island, and putting 
that place in a posture of defence, and mentioned the plan pro- 
posed to me by Mr Paine, of collecting immediately one quarter's 
rent from all the houses in Philadelphia, in order to have an imme 
diate supply of money to defray the expenses, &c. Diury. 
VOL. XI. 60 



474 ROBERT MORRIS. 

This communication I intended making to your Excel- 
lency in consequence of the conversation that passed be- 
tween us a k\v days since ; but it was only yesterday that 
I completed the delivery of such bills as had been sold 
previous to that conversation, which amounted to fiftyseven 
thousand seven hundred and eighty livres ; and now on 
summing up the whole I find, that I have drawn one hun- 
dred and eigbtyone sots of hills, all at sixty days' sight, in 
favor of various persons to whom they have been sold, 
amounting to nine hundred and one thousand and eighteen 
livres, four sou ■-, and eight deniers tournois ; of ihese bills 
three hundred and seventysix thousand one hundred 
and twentytwo livres, ten sous, have been sold at five 
shillings and six pence for five livres, and five hundred 
and twenty four thousand eight hundred and ninetyfive 
livres, fourteen sous, eight deniers, at six 'hillings for five 
livres ; by which it appears the discount does not ex- 
ceed sixteen and five eighths per cent on {he value in Eu- 
rope ; and were this money to be imported I suppose the 
freight and insurance might amount to nearly the value of 
that discount ; if so, this mode of bringing it into use is not 
a bad one. Besides I must again observe, that by a union 
of management in the sale of bills drawn for the service of 
his Most Christian Majesty's fleets and armies, and those 
drawn for account of the United Slates, still belter prices 
might be obtained, nay, I should not despair of trying to 
raise the price of exchange to par, by means o( partial im- 
portations of money, and passing bills before die expenditure 
thereof, so that necessity might not have any influence in 
fixing the price. 

What your Excellency has said to me respecting the 
advances made this year by his Majesty to the United 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 475 

States, has left on my mind those impressions you intended 
to make. You may depend, Sir, that it is my wish, and 
shall be a part of my study, to render these States as 
little troublesome to his Majesty as possible, and 1 shall 
probably have many opportunities to convince you, that 
it is a fixed point with me, that the United Stales, to 
become truly independent, must trust more to their own 
exertions, and lean but lightly ori their allies. But, Sir, 
you must remember the situation, in which I found their 
affairs ; you are not ignorant, that although I have cut off 
entirely many sources of expense, and curtailed others, yet 
that I have not been able to obtain either supplies of money 
or permanent revenue from the States, which however 1 
attribute chiefly to the recess of the several Legislatures 
during the greatest part of the time that I have been in 
office, for 1 hope and expect that they will severally attend 
to the calls upon them, when they shall come to know 
their real situation. 

But in the meanwhile, what am I to do if the means 
of supplying indispensable war-rts are cut off? The im- 
portant operations now carrying on by General Washing- 
ton depend so materially on the performance of my en- 
gagements, that the most fatal consequences may ensue 
from any breach of them. Your Excellency well remem- 
bers, that you thought yourself justifiable in giving me 
assurances, that Messrs Le Couteulx h Co. should be sup- 
plied with one million five hundred thousand livres tour- 
nois, to answer my drafts to that extent ; the produce 
whereof to be employed in the service of the present cam- 
paign. You will also recollect, that previous to my journey 
in August to camp, I judged it necessary to know, whether 
that sum was the whole on which I could place depen- 



476 ROBERT MORRIS. 

dence, because, as the General's operations would in a 
great measure depend on the aids I could afford him, it 
was absolutely incumbent on me to be informed of their 
extent in every channel, through which I expected them 
to flow. 

Your Excellency, convinced of the propriety of my ob- 
servations, and of the actual necessities of our situation, 
ventured the assurance of another million of livres. There- 
fore, whilst I was at camp, during the consultations on the 
measures, I gave his Excellency reason to believe, that the 
amount of two millions five hundred thousand livres of 
bills on France, in conjunction with the resources provided 
by Congress, should be brought to the support of his opera- 
tions. Counting upon this as certain, General Washington 
has taken his measures accordingly. 

It has been my study to make the bilis as productive as 
circumstances would permit, and to apply the money to 
the purposes lor which it was granted, under the most 
scrupulous and assiduous attention to the principles of 
economy, and I may hazard the opinion, that no money 
has been more frugally or usefully expended by the United 
States during the war, without the least danger of being 
put in the wrong. 

You are sensible that the money which arrived with 
Colonel Lsurens, although landed on the Continent, cannot 
be brought into use until its arrival here ; and although I 
have sent for it, yet it is but now on the road, and the 
General cannot stop his operations, nor can I refuse or 
defer compliance with my engagements until its arrival. 
The ruinous consequences that would follow, must appear 
too strong and clear to a gentleman of your reflection and 
information, to need any other demonstration than the bare 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 477 

mention of the facts. Consequently your Excellency will 
be well convinced of the absolute necessity of permitting 
me to draw to the extent agreed upon, and 1 hope his Ma- 
jesty's Ministers will be too strongly impressed with appre- 
hensions of the fatal consequences that would follow any 
neglect of my bills, to suffer the least inattention to them j 
and as the sum in total will not be of such magnitude as to 
occasion great inconvenience, I hope his Majesty will find 
cause to applaud your zeal and attention upon the occa- 
sion. 

A committee of Congress have laid before me the com- 
munications your Excellency has lately made to Congress, 
which will claim my utmost attention, and your Excellency 
will do me the justice to believe that my most strenuous 
endeavors shall be to promote what is so strongly urged by 
his Majesty's Ministers, the most spirited exertions of these 
States to diive the enemy from our country. And that 
my affection for, and gratitude to France, are unalterably 
fixed, as is also my respect and esteem for your Excellen- 
cy's person and character. Being, Sir, your most obe- 
dient, &tc. 

ROBERT MORRIS. 

P. S. Upon a more exact calculation of the sale of 
bills, a few of which were sold a little higher than the rest, 
I find that nine hundred one thousand and eighteen livres, 
four sous, eight deniers, produced fifty two thousand two 
hundred and eleven pounds, ten shillings and ninepence, 
Pennsylvania currency ; which is equal to one hundred 
twentyfive thousand three hundred and seven French 
crowns, and seven tenths of a crown, at eight shillings four- 
pence, Pennsylvania currency, for a crown ; and the same 
number of livres reduced into crowns at six livres each 



478 ROBERT MORRIS. 

crown, is one hundred fifty thousand one hundred sixty- 
nine and four sixths crowns. Consequently the discount 
is little more than sixteen and a half per cent. 



TO THE SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY OF PENNSYLVANIA. 

Office of Finance, September 28th, 178fc 
Sir, 

As the Honorahle House of Assembly are now sitting, 
and have before them the several letters which I had 
the honor to write during their recess to his Excellency 
the President in Council, I shall now endeavor to state, in 
a short manner, the situation of accounts depending be- 
tween Pennsylvania and the United States, and propose 
such measures, as, I think, will lead to a speedy and satis- 
factory settlement of them. 

In the treasury books of the United States, there is an 
account current open for transactions commencing with the 
revolution, and continuing to the 18th ol March, 1780, 
wherein the State of Pennsylvania stands charged with ad- 
vances, made at different periods during that time, to the 
amount of four millions four hundred and fortyfour thou- 
sand and seven hundred dollars, and has credit to the 
amount of one hundred and thirtysix thousand and ninety- 
eight dollars. Most of these advances were made whilst 
money was valuable; but 1 expect that the expenditures 
of the State on behalf of the United States kept pace with 
the advances made, and that, probably, when this account 
comes to be settled, there may be no great balance either 
way ; but in this respect, I do not pretend to speak with 
certainty. However, I must here observe, that every 
State in the Union has an account of the same sort de- 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 479 

pending; wherefore, T propose that Congress should fix 
such general principles as will tend to do justice on the 
settlement of the whole, and appoint immediately Auditors 
to go through the whole ; so that when the balance of 
each shall be justly ascertained, it may be paid or received, 
according as the same shall happen to be due, to or from 
the United States, and this will put every State on an equal 
footing so far. 

You will find by the resolution of Congress of the 
22d of November, 1777, Pennsylvania is called on to 
pay, in four quarterly payments, commencing on the 
1st day of January, 177S, the sum of six hundred and 
twenty thousand dollars. By the resolutions of the 
3d and 5th of January, 1779, Pennsylvania is called 
on to pay, during that year, the sum of one million 
nine hundred thousand dollars. By the resolution of 
the 21st of May, 1779, Pennsylvania was called on to 
pay, by the 1st of January, 17S0, the sum of five mil- 
lions seven hundred thousand dollars. By the resolu- 
tions of the 6th and 7th of October, 1779. a monthly 
tax of fifteen millions is called for, of which the pro- 
portion of Pennsylvania is two millions three hundred 
thousand dollars, making for the two months payable 
the 1st of February and the 1st of March four millions 
and six hundred thousand dollars. Thus the whole of 
these requisitions appears to have amounted to twelve 
millions eight hundred and twenty thousand dollars, 
of which there appears to have been paid on different 
' drafts to the amount of six millions four hundred and 
fifty four thousand one hundred and fourteen dollars 
and two thirds, leaving a balance still due of six mil- 
lions three hundred and sixtyfive thousand eight 



480 ROBERT MORRIS. 

hundred and eightyfive dollars and one third, of the old 
emissions. 

By the resolution of the 10th of March, 1780, the 
fifteen millions of monthly taxes is continued so as to 
include thirteen months, making for the proportion of 
Pennsylvania twentynine millions nine hundred thou- 
sand dollars; of which sum ten millions six hundred 
thousand dollars have been paid into the Loan Office ; 
of consequence, there remains due nineteen millions 
three hundred thousand dollars. 

By the resolutions last mentioned, new money was 
to be issued, at the rate of one for every twenty of 
the old ; of which new money Congress had reserved 
four tenths to their disposal, and the Treasury Board 
have already issued warrants to the amount thereof. 
The State paper being of equal value with the new 
emission, and the former not bearing interest, I have 
thought, it most for the benefit of this State and of the 
United States, to draw from the treasurer a sum of the 
new State paper equal to the balance of those four 
tenths, and have accordingly done so. 

By the resolution of the 26th of August, 17S0, the 
States are called on to pay into the treasury by the 
last day of December then next ensuing, three mil- 
lions of dollars, of which the quota of Pennsylvania is 
four hundred and sixty thousand dollars. 

By the resolution of the 4th of November, 1780, 
Pennsylvania is called upon to pay two hundred and 
seventythree thousand eight hundred and thirtylwo 
dollars and two thirds, in quarterly payments, com- 
mencing the 1st day of May last ; and by the resolu- 
tion of the 16th of March, 1781, Pennsylvania is 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 481 

called upon to pay one million and fiftynine thousand 
eight hundred and sixtythree dollars, in quarterly pay- 
ments, commencing the 1st day of June last. All 
these are payable in the new emission, or specie. 
Thus the whole of the requisitions will, on the 1st 
day of March next, amount to one million seven hun- 
dred and ninetythree thousand six hundred and nine- 
tyfive dollars and two thirds. Of this sum there 
appears to have been paid seventeen thousand seven 
hundred and forty dollars; wherefore, there will still 
remain a balance of one million seven hundred and 
seventyfive thousand nine hundred and fifty five dol- 
lars and two thirds. 

By a note from David Rittenhouse, I find that he 
has in his hands one hundred and thirtyeight thousand 
nine hundred dollars of the new emission, and four- 
teen millions one hundred and forty five thousand six 
hundred dollars of the old, in which latter sum, nev- 
ertheless, is included some State money received at 
seventyfive for one, the amount of which cannot be 
determined until it is sorted and counted ; wherefore, 
the old emission may be estimated at about fourteen 
millions. 

On this state of things, I take the liberty of propos- 
ing to the honorable House, that all the old money be 
immediately paid in, and the new taken out, which 
will be about seven hundred thousand dollars, and 
that, with what is now in the Treasurer's hands, will 
make eight hundred and thirtyeight thousand nine 
hundred dollars. I further propose, that this be paid 
to me, as Superintendent of Finance, on account of the 
above balance of one million seven hundred and sev- 
VOL. xi. 61 



4S2 ROBERT MORRIS. 

entyfive thousand nine hundred and fiftyfive dollars 
and two thirds, which will then be reduced to nine 
hundred and thirtyseven thousand and fiftyfive dollars 
and two thirds. I further propose, that the remaining 
sums of old continental, due from the State, be 
collected and paid as soon as possible, which, besides 
discharging that demand, will also enable the State to 
receive the further sum of two hundred and sixty 
thousand dollars of the new emission, and that, being 
paid in as before, will still further reduce the balance 
against the State to six hundred and seventytwo thou- 
sand and fiftyfive dollars and two thirds. There are 
at present in circulation of the new emission three 
hundred and ninetyone thousand one hundred dollars, 
which ought certainly to be brought in as soon as pos- 
sible, and applied to the same purposes already spe- 
cified ; by which means the eventual balance payable in 
specie, would be two hundred and eighty thousand 
nine hundred and fiftyfive dollars and two thirds; to 
which must be added, thirteen thousand three hun- 
dred and thirtyfour dollars, required by Congress on 
the 8th day of January last to be paid in specie; being 
together one hundred and ten thousand three hundred 
and fiftyeight pounds, twelve shillings and sixpence. 
To explain all which more fully, I enclose the ac- 
counts, number one, two, and three, to which I pray 
leave to have reference. 

The specific supplies will still remain to be provided 
for, in order that all the demands of Congress may be 
fully answered ; but I hope that the specie tax now 
collecting will go a great way towards the accomplish- 
ment of this necessary object, and at any rate, as the 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPOJNDEJS'JE. 483 

state of paper, notwithstanding every effort, has not 
yet appreciated to par, I would propose that no more 
of it be issued from the treasury, except as equal to 
gold and silver, and then the collection of the present, 
taxes will at least prevent any depreciation, and in the 
meantime, the fund on which it was emitted, become 
more productive. The next Assembly will be able to 
take such additional measures as may be necessary, 
further to raise the value of it. This can only be done 
by holding it up from circulation, on the one hand, 
and on the other, by raising taxes, in which the public 
receive it as equivalent to the precious metals. 

It is my determination, as Superintendent, to deposit all 
the money of the new emission, which shall be received 
from the several States, in the Continental Treasury, and 
not to issue one shilling of it, unless compelled by absolute 
necessity ; which, I hope, will not be the case, if the States 
take measures to pay in the eventual balances. 

Whether the House will find it consistent with the situ- 
ation of their constituents to lay an additional tax this 
session, is for them to determine ; but it is my duty to 
mention it, which I do from a conviction that it is neces- 
sary. They will perceive, that very great arrearages are 
due, and they must be sensible, that taxation alone can 
support the public credit, or enable government to carry 
on the war. 

With the greatest respect, I have the honor to be, &tc. 

ROBERT MORRIS. 



484 ROBERT MORRIS. 

TO THE COUNT DE ROCHAMBEAU. 

Office of Finance, October 1st, 1781. 
Sir, 

This being the day agreed upon for repayment of the 
moneys your Excellency was so kind as to advance me, I 
do myself the honor of assigning to you the reasons why it 
is not done. I had determined to make every effort and 
every sacrifice for the sake of complying with my engage- 
ments. But his Excellency, the Minister of France, per- 
ceiving that it would be very inconvenient to me, and being 
convinced that you were not in immediate want of it, was 
so kind as to assure me, that he would write to you on the 
subject, and that, in the meantime, I might delay the pay- 
ment until the arrival of money from the eastward. I shall 
then take care to have your advance replaced. 

Being convinced, Sir, that M. de la Luzerne has al- 
ready made the proper representations to you upon the 
subject, I should not have troubled you with reading this 
letter, but that I feel a pleasure in seizing every oppor- 
tunity to express my wishes for your success and glory, cs 
well as to assure you, that I am, he. 

ROBERT MORRIS. 



TO MAJOR GENERAL GREENE. 

Office of Finance, October 3d, 1781. 

Sir, 

I have received your letter, dated the 18th of August 
last, at the high hills of Santee, and am now to thank you 
for it. Your observations on public affairs are, 1 fear, too 
just, but I hope that when our situation is thoroughly per- 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 485 

ceived by the people, they will adopt those effectual 
remedies, which every friend to his country ought to wish. 
That more power ought to be given to Congress is evi- 
dent now to many, and will, probably, become soon very 
apparent to all. The disobedience of many States, and 
the partial obedience of others, discontents every one of 
them, and that will, in itself, be a reason for enabling the 
sovereign representative to exact a compliance with its 
requisitions ; but, as you justly observe, all these things 
are in the womb of time, which can alone disclose the 
events we plague ourselves with guessing at. 

From the latter part of your letter, 1 perceive that you 
greatly misunderstood me. When I requested you to 
draw on me, I meant to extend those drafts so far as might 
be necessary for secret service money, and the like small, 
but indispensable occasions. I well knew that you could 
not, by bills of exchange, supply the wants of your army, 
and, if I had thought it practicable, I should have been 
more explicit, for I could not then have paid the bills you 
would have drawn. 

To give you an idea of my situation as to money, I 
think I need only inform you, that since 1 have been in 
office, I have only received the sum of seven thousand five 
hundred pounds, Pennsylvania money, from the Treasury cf 
this State, and that was in part payment of advances made 
for them. This is all I have received from the funds of 
America. It is true, that Colonel Laurens ha? lately ar- 
rived, and brought with him a sum of money from France. 
And it is also true, that 1 have made use of a very limited 
credit given me on France, by drawing bills of exchange ; 
but both of these resources, taken together, are vastly 
short of what is necessary, though they have contributed 
to the present operations. 



486 ROBERT MORRIS. 

I have lost no occasion of showing to the several States 
their situation, but hitherto without success ; and, unless 
some unforeseen event turns up very speedily, it is im- 
possible to say what may be the consequences. However, 
it is our business to hope all things, and that Providence, 
who has hitherto carried us through our difficulties, will, 
I trust, continue his bountiful protection. 

Your circumstances have long been arduous, but you 
have hitherto risen so superior to them, that we should be 
almost as much surprised now, if you should be unsuccess- 
ful, as we formerly were at your successes. I wish I 
could contribute to render you more easy. As far as my 
abilities extend, I shall do it most cheerfully ; but they un- 
fortunately are very limited. Accept, I pray you, my 
good wishes, which are almost all I have to give, and be- 
lieve me to be, Slc 

ROBERT MORRIS. 



TO THE COMMISSARY GENERAL OF PURCHASES. 

Office of Finance, October 4th, 1781. 
Sir, 

I have received your letters, dated at Alexandria the 
19th, and Williamsburgh the 23d of September last. 

I am very glad that you push hard upon the States for 
supplies. It is, I find, necessary that you and I should 
understand each other on the subject. The General will, 
I dare say, take care to have as few unnecessary mouths 
as possible ; but, after all, a certain quantity of provisions 
is indispensably necessary. Now this quantity must be 
furnished by the States of Virginia, Maryland, and Dela- 
ware. If you rely on my exertions, you will, probably, 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 4S7 

be disappointed. Should the operations against Corn- 
wallis fail for want of supplies, the States must thank their 
own negligence. If they will not. exert themselves on the 
present occasion, they never will. As to all that can be 
said about the failure of the one or of another kind of 
money, it is left to themselves. Let them tax in money, 
which will not fail. It is their business to provide supplies 
and money too. If they neglect or omit this necessary 
duty, I again repeat, they must answer for the conse- 
quences. 

I shall be glad at all times to hear from you very par- 
ticularly, with all such information as you shall think ne- 
cessary. But do not lean too hard upon me. Do not 
expect too much help from me. You will be deceived 
and disappointed if you do. Urge the States. Urge 
Delaware in particular. When I do furnish anything, it 
must be money. Let some of your people, therefore, 
apply when you intend applications. I cannot run about 
the city to purchase articles. That is the duty of an 
assistant Commissary ; and my time is too much, and, 
I hope, too well employed, to permit it. 

I am, Sir, &c. 

ROBERT MORRIS. 



TO MESSRS LE COUTEULX &L CO. 

Office of Finance, October 12th, 1781. 
Gentlemen, 
In consequence, of a new arrangement taken with his Ex-

TO THE LOAN OFFICERS OF THE STATES. 

Office of Finance, October 13th, 1781. 
Sir, 

As the organization of the Treasury Department will 
soon be completed, it becomes my duty to inform you of 
that circumstance, and to request that you will prepare for 
a full settlement of your accounts. I must also request, 
that you will be pleased to make out and transmit to me 
an accurate list of all the certificates issued, with their 
dates, sums, and the persons to whom they were given. 
It will be necessary that an account of the public debt 
be prepared for the public inspection. This cannot be 
done until the proper materials be obtained from the 
several offices ; wherefore, I make no doubt that you will 
exert yourself to comply with my request. As I am in- 
formed that the late Treasury Board gave orders for send- 
ing back the blank certificates, I suppose they are now on

the way hither ; but, if that should not be the cr se, I must 
require an immediate performance of the directions given 
by the Board, and I must insist that no mor; certificates 
be issued on any pretence whatever. 

With great respect, I hai'e the honor to be, he.

TO THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA. 

Philadelphia, October 16th, 1781. 
Sir, 

I would willingly write you an official letter by this post, 
on the subject of supplies for the year 17S2; but I must 
decline it, until i can obtain the proper estimates, which 
are now preparing. In the meantime, as I learn that your 
Legislature are now sitting, I write you this private letter 
on that subject. 

My former public letters will fully have stated my ideas 
as to the present demands on the existing requisitions of 
Congress. I hope and expect, that those requisitions will 
be immediately complied with. It is my decided opinion, 
founded on the best observations I have been able to 
make, and the most accurate and extensive information I 
could possibly obtain, that paper emissions will no longer 
answer the purpose of carrying on this war, and experi- 
ence must by this time have convinced every dispassionate 
observer, that specific supplies are at once burdensome to 
the people, and almost useless to the government. 

It is unnecessary to draw the conclusion, which I am 

sure will strike your mind, that a revenue in hard money 

must be obtained ; but I will observe to you, that the 

present moment is very favorable to that object in your

State. While the war is in your country, the expenses of 
it will be so diffused as to possess its inhabitants of specie, 
and should it be happily removed to a distance, your com- 
merce will bring in resources equal to your necessities. 

I take the liberty to request that you will communi- 
cate these sentiments to my worthy friend Colonel Har- 
rison, and I pray you to believe me very sincerely your 
friend, &tc. 

ROBERT MORRIS. 



TO THE PRESIDENT OP CONGRESS. 

Office of Finance, October 18th, 1781. 
Sir, 

The honorable committee, on the letter of the Board 
of War of the 11th instant, have favored me with a perusal 
of it. I think it my duty, on this occasion, to express my 
approbation of that attention the Board of War have paid 
the public service. That letter has opened a subject, 
which had pressed itself strongly on my mind, and which 
I had determined to mention to Congress, but was re- 
strained by the hope, that a review of their own proceed- 
ings, and a sense of our difficulties would soon have ren- 
dered it unnecessary. 

This matter being now before them, it would be unpar- 
donable in me not to enforce those sentiments, which I 
myself am most deeply affected with. 1 am convinced, 
that a slight view of the situation, in which their finances 
now are, will give a strong impression of the necessity 
there is to guard against pecuniary solicitations from every 
quarter. If the revenue were equal to the demands upon 
it, nothing can be more simple and clear, than that all 
those demands should be speedily and punctually paid. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 491 

Unfortunately this is far from being the case. I believe 
much further than many are aware of. When I say, that 
I cannot command more than one twentieth of the sum 
necessary for the current service of the year, I am within 
the strictest bounds of truth. It is with equal truth that 
I assure you, that I have not since my appointment re- 
ceived one shilling from any State in the Union, Penn- 
sylvania excepted. And from Pennsylvania I have re- 
ceived paper money to the amount of the four tenths due 
to the United States, the appropriation whereof Congress 
must be thoroughly acquainted with, and seven thousand 
five hundred pounds in specie, which is applied to the 
payment of contracts within the Slate, and still leaves a 
balance against them for articles of their specific supplies 
which I have furnished. 

The moneys drawn for by permission of the Minister 
Plenipotentiary of his Most Christian Majesty have been 
already applied to the public service, and the engagements 
I have entered into amount to a very considerable sum. 

I enclose a few out of many articles, which immediately 
suggest themselves to me. Had I sought for the smaller 
instances they would have been numerous, and of course 
weighty. Instead of this, I have omitted many consider- 
able articles, such for instance, as expense of stores for 
the hospitals, much of which is now due, and more to be 
immediately provided for. You will perceive, that I have 
no't even mentioned the expense of transporting military 
stores, such as shot, shells, Stc. to the camp before York, 
which the Board of War assure me will be very great, 
and indeed it must be so. Neither have I mentioned the 
expense of transporting money, clothing, medicines, arms, 
&ic. from Boston to this place, and hence to the south- 



492 ROBERT MORRIS. 

ward. Besides all this, I am told it will be necessary to 
procure ten thousand suits of clothes for the ensuing winter. 
II this be so, that article alone will amount to at least two 
hundred thousand dollars. 

1 might go much further, but I shall only observe, that 
exclusive of all these things, the enclosed estimate amounts 
to above two hundred thousand dollars. Yet attention must 
be paid to the wants of three large armies. Congress 
know the extent of my means. 

In this situation of things, it is proper to ask on every 
occasion, before private grants of money are made, whether 
the public service will not suffer by it. But this is not all, 
1 am bound to observe, that the expectations of our troops 
now in the field may be much disappointed, and that they 
will conceive it unjust to dispose of any moneys, which 
might be spared, unless as an equal division among them. 
To press this point any further would imply a want of that 
confidence, which I really have in the wisdom and dis- 
cernment of Congress. They will see, that while the 
indispensable calls for money to forward general operations 
continue to be so loud as to draw from me all my private 
funds, it cannot be expected, that I shall pay warrants in 
favor of individuals. I am sure they will feel for me, 
when I mention the pain I suffer from being compelled 
to refuse money on their resolutions. A regard for their 
honor is the second motive of my conduct. I hope it is 
unnecrvs'-aiy to say, that a regard for the public interest 
is the iiist. 1 am far from wishing to insinuate a line of 
conduct to Congress; but 1 must place before their eyes 
those facts, which it is for their honor and their interest to 
be informed of. They wil! draw the proper conclusions. 
With the most perfect respect, I am, &ic. 

ROBERT MORRIS.

494 ROBERT MORRIS. 

CIRCULAR TO THE GOVERNORS OF THE SEVERAL STATES. 

Office of Finance, October 19th, 1781. 
Sir, 

I am now to address you on a subject of very great im- 
portance. I have to detail some facts, which will demand 
the most serious attention from every Legislature, and 
from every public officer in the United States. It is my 
determination to administer the affairs intrusted to my care 
according to plans, which are founded in sincerity and 
truth. Convinced of the folly of our enemy, in supposing 
that any considerable body of men in the United States 
are opposed to the Revolution, I am persuaded that, in 
order to remove the greater part of our difficulties, the 
first proper step is to state them fully to the people through 
their representatives. It shall, therefore,, be a part of my 
study to prepare every transaction for the public eye, so 
that the meanest individual may be in due time informed of 
those affairs, in which, as a free citizen, he is interested. 
The various reports, which have been circulated, the pub- 
lications in the several gazettes, and even letters from 
some who ought to have known better, all these things have 
conspired to infuse an opinion, that every power in Europe 
is favorable to us ; that great sums of money are already 
advanced to us, and that still greater may be obtained. 
Whatever may be the fate of my administration, I will 
never be subjected to the reproach of falsehood or insin- 
cerity. I, therefore, take the earliest moment, in which I 
am permitted, to make those communications, which will 
give an insight into our real situation. 

With respect to the situation and politics of Europe, 
it is neither my business to detail them, nor am I in a 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 495 

capacity to do it with certainty. But this, at least, is 
certain, that the disposition of the European powers, 
however friendly, has been too much relied upon. As 
a proof I need only observe, that not a single State 
has acknowledged our independence except France, 
although our alliance with that respectable monarchy 
has now subsisted nearly four years. Yet that mon- 
archy is certainly the first in the world. It is in the 
closest connexion with Spain. Spain has long been 
engaged in the war, and still longer solicited to form a 
union upon the basis of the treaty with France. The 
armed neutrality, which gave such splendid hopes to 
many, has not yet produced the benefits expected. 1 
will not proceed on the ground of conjecture, nor is it 
necessary for me to dwell longer on our political state 
with respect to foreign powers. But as there is little 
reason to expect, so I hope there is no American, who 
would wish an alliance with any empire on earth, 
until they shall be so sensible of our importance, as to 
treat on principles of equality. 

The public opinion, as to the conduct of other 
Princes and States, has greatly injured us by relaxing 
our exertions. But the opinion as to pecuniary aid 
has been still more pernicious. People have flattered 
themselves with a visionary idea, that nothing more 
was necessary, than for Congress to send a Minister 
abroad, and that immediately he would obtain as much 
money as he chose to ask for. That, when he opened 
a loan, hundreds would run to see who should have 
the honor of subscrihing to it, and the like. But. 
surely a. moment's reflection should have convinced 
every reasonable man, that, without the clear prospect 



496 ROBERT MORRIS. 

of repayment, people will not part with their property. 
Have the efforts in this country been so successful as 
to ground any hopes from abroad ? Or, is it to be 
supposed, that foreigners will interest themselves more 
in our prosperity or safety, than our citizens? Or, 
can it be believed, that credit will be given abroad 
before solid funds are provided at home ? Or, could 
it be imagined, that the disorders necessarily incident 
to a great revolution, would be considered as a better 
source of trust and confidence, than the regularity and 
consistency of ancient establishments? 

The Congress, conformably to the public wish, have 
appointed Ministers, requested grants, and opened 
loans. In Holland they have got nothing, and in 
Spain but very little. Loans were expected from in- 
dividuals in Holland, but nothing of that sort has been, 
or probably will be, obtained. Loans were not ex- 
pected in Spain, unless from the King, and from him 
they have been solicited with but little success. 

The distressed situation of public affairs forced the 
Congress to draw bills of exchange on their Ministers. 
Some were drawn on France, some on Spain, and 
some on Holland. The first were honored and paid, 
the others were accepted, but recourse was finally had 
to the Court of France for the payment of those also. 
They were drawn at long sight. The sales were slow. 
They were remitted from time to time, and every op- 
portunity afforded the Ministers of the United States to 
obtain the moneys for discharging them, but in vain. 
Of consequence, these bills have been regularly re- 
ferred to the Court of France for payment; and this 
has done us injury, by anticipating the aid, which 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 497 

France has been disposed to afford us, and at the same 
time has justly alarmed and greatly embarrassed the 
French Ministry. 

These things it appears necessary that you should 
know, and your Legislature will undoubtedly draw 
the proper inferences. They will see how much has 
been suffered by delaying to call forth the resources of 
our own country, and relying on the empty bubbles of 
hope, instead of the solid foundations of revenue. 
They will, I trust, clearly see, that all their hopes and 
expectations are narrowed down to what France may 
give or lend. But here, as in other cases, delusion 
takes place of reality. We flatter ourselves with ideal 
prospects, and are only convinced of our folly, by the 
fatal crisis of national distress. In order that you may 
clearly understand the succor afforded by France, I 
enclose an account extracted from a statement lately 
furnished to Congress by the Minister Plenipotentiary 
of his Most Christian Majesty. 

You will observe that his Majesty granted to the 
United States a subsidy for the current year of six 
millions of livres ; and on a representation of our dis- 
tresses, he was pleased to become security for a loan 
to be opened on our account in Holland. And when 
it appeared, that there was but little probability of 
obtaining any money there in season, he further agreed 
that the sum to be borrowed should be advanced for 
us, in the first instance, from the royal treasury. 
Thus the gift and the loan together amount to sixteen 
millions of livres, which would, if in this country, be 
equal only to two millions nine hundred and sixtytwo 
thousand nine hundred and sixtytwo dollars, although 
vol. xi. 63 



49S ROBERT MORRIS. 

at the rate of estimating dollars in France, it is there 
equal to three millions and fortyseven thousand six 
hundred and nineteen dollars. But at the highest rate 
of exchange, which has hitherto taken place, this sum 
if drawn for, would have amounted to no more than 
two millions five hundred and sixty thousand dollars. 
I have been thus particular with respect to the amount 
of this sum, because the difference of currencies very 
often tends to deceive those to whom their real value 
is not a familiar subject of attention. 

The enclosed account is in livres, and the two first 
articles contain the total of the grant and loan, amount- 
ing to sixteen millions of livres. The remainder con- 
tains the deductions to be made ; the two first articles 
whereof, amounting to two millions three hundred 
thousand livres is for the payment of the bills drawn 
on France, Spain, and Holland, which I have already 
mentioned, the produce of the sales whereof had been 
applied to the public service long before my appoint- 
ment. The next article, being two millions of livres, 
is appropriated to the payment of the interest bills ; 
wherefore, no part of it can be applied to other pur- 
poses. The fourth article, I need say nothing of here, 
as it has long been in the mouths of everybody. The 
fifth and sixth articles are for those stores, which were 
laden on board of four transports by order of Colonel 
Laurens, three of which have safely arrived, and the 
other put back in distress. The seventh article, is in 
consequence of the loss of that valuable ship, the Mar- 
quis de Lafayette, which contained a great number of 
public stores, the replacing of which is necessary for 
the army and its operations, and which will amount to 
that sum. 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 499 

The last article contains the amount of moneys de- 
posited to answer my drafts, which have heen made 
from time to time, and the produce appropriated to 
the service of the current year. On the whole, there 
remains a balance of three millions and sixteen thou- 
sand four hundred and ninetynine livres. This, with 
the sum brought by Colonel Laurens, may be consid- 
ered as of the value of about one million of dollars? 
which is the utmost ; for it would exceed that only by 
twentyone thousand five hundred and seventyfour dol- 
lars, if it were now in this country. 

Thus then you see the extent of that pecuniary suc- 
cor, which has filled the minds of all with such teem- 
ing expectation, is narrowed down to one million of 
dollars. But by the best accounts and estimates I 
have been able to procure, this war has hitherto cost, 
about twenty millions annually. I do indeed expect 
that the future expenditures will be greatly curtailed; 
but it must be remembered that the most rigid econ- 
omy has its bounds, and that it cannot exist without 
the punctual performance of those engagements, on 
which the first steps towards it must depend. As soon 
as the proper estimates for the next year can be made 
out, the demands founded upon them will be stated, 
and I shall shortly advertise for contracts, as the most 
effectual mode of husbanding our resources. I feel it 
to be my duty, however, to observe, that a note this 
day sent to Congress, of some of my principal engage- 
ments for money, amounts to upwards of two hundred 
thousand dollars. Yet the calls for it from every 
quarter are incessant. 

I would gladly quit the subject of foreign supplies 



500 ROBERT MORRIS. 

and expectations here, but it is necessary that the 
States should know all, and I should not answer the 
views of Congress, if I did not add, that the Court of 
France place the aid now afforded us among the num- 
ber of those extraordinary efforts, which cannot be 
repeated. The declaration, that no more pecuniary 
assistance can be afforded to us, is as plain as language 
will admit of; and although the applications may, and 
probably will, be made by our Ministers to the Court 
of Versailles, yet surely no prudent man would form 
any reliance on such applications, in the face of such 
a pointed and express assurance to the contrary ; and 
especially, when, to every request a short answer can 
be made, by asking what we have done for ourselves. 
Sir, I must speak to you most plainly. While we do 
nothing for ourselves, we cannot expect the assistance 
of others. 

This is a very painful subject to dwell upon, but a con- 
sideration of great magnitude remains behind, and sooner 
or later it must come forward. Prudence, therefore, bids 
us examine it now, and provide for it in season. The 
neglect in funding the public debt, has introduced a prac- 
tice of issuing Loan Office certificates, for the interest due 
on other Loan Office certificates. This I have absolutely 
forbidden, nor will I ever consent to it. Such accumula- 
tion of debt, while it distresses the public, and destroys its 
credit, by no means relieves the unfortunate individual, who 
is a public creditor ; for if revenue is not provided, in- 
creasing the certificates would only lessen their value. 
This would be such a fraud as would stamp our national 
character with indelible marks of infamy, and render us 
the reproach and contempt of all mankind. It is high time 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 501 

to relieve ourselves from the ignominy we have already 
sustained, and to rescue and restore the national credit. 
This can only be done by solid revenue. Disdaining, 
therefore, those little timid artifices, which, while they 
postpone the moment of difficulty, only increase the dan- 
ger and confirm the ruin, 1 prefer the open declaration to 
all, of what is to be expected, and whence it is to be 
drawn. To the public creditors, therefore, I say, that 
until the States provide revenues for liquidating the princi- 
pal and interest of the public debt, they cannot be paid ; 
and to the States, I say, that they are bound by every 
principle held sacred among men to make that provision. 

I have gone through the task, which I proposed to my- 
self in writing to your Excellency this letter, which I pray 
you to communicate to the Legislature of your State. I 
hope the Congress will soon be able to transmit their requi- 
sitions, and I shall endeavor that those be as moderate as 
possible. But I must pray that every man, whether in 
public or private life, will seriously consider the importance 
of complying with these requisitions. It is not by the bril- 
liant successes of war, the splendor of conquest, or the 
shouts of victory, that a wise ministry are to be affected. 
The superiority of national resources is the sure ground on 
which to hope for success, and that superior resource 
steadily and persevering!}' applied, must eventually attain 
its objects. It is for these reasons, that the enemy have 
hoped everything from the derangement of our finances ; 
and on the other hand, as I am well informed, it is from 
the establishment of a national bank, and the forming of 
contracts to supply our armies, that they have the greatest 
apprehensions. By the bounty of the Almighty, we are 
placed in a situation where our future late depends upon 



502 ROBERT MORRIS. 

our present conduct. We may be happy or miserable, as 
we please. If we do our duty now, the war will soon be 
brought to a close ; if not, it may last for many years, and 
what will then be its termination, it is not in human wisdom 
to foresee. Thoroughly convinced that the enemy must 
ask for peace, when we are in a condition vigorously to 
prosecute the war, and that we shall be in that condition, 
whenever our affairs are reduced to order, and our credit 
restored, and that for these purposes, nothing more is ne- 
cessary than a proper system of taxation ; I cannot avoid 
expressing my sentiments on the subject in all the warmth 
with which they flow from my heart. I hope and pray 
that the facts, which I have stated, may meet that calm at- 
tention, which is due to their importance, and that such 
measures may be taken as shall redound to the honor and 
interest of our country. 

With all possible respect, i have the honor to be, &c. 

ROBERT MORRIS. 



TO MAJOR GENERAL GREENE. 

Office of Finance, November 2d, 1781. 
Sir, 

Your favor of the 17th of September last has been de- 
livered to me by your Aid, Captain Pierce. Your recom- 
mendations and his own character, give him a double title 
to everv mark of attention. 

I hope it is unnecessary to make assurances of my dis- 
position to render your situation both easy and respectable. 
I am sure it is unnecessary to remark, how inadequate the 
provisions have been, which the States have hitherto made. 
At least, it is unnecessary to you. Much less need I dis- 



DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. 503 

play the detail of expenditures, which have been requisite 
for the accomplishment of that happy event, which has 
taken place in Virginia. 

I have neither forgotten nor neglected your department. 
I have done the utmost to provide clothing, arms, accoutre- 
ments, medicines, hospital stores, Sic. j and I flatter my- 
self that you will, through the different departments, re- 
ceive both benefit and relief from my exertions. I have 
detained Captain Pierce a day, in order to make up with 
infinite difficulty, one thousand pounds Pennsylvania cur- 
rency in gold, which he is the bearer of, and which will, I 
hope, be agreeable and useful. You have done so much 
with so little, that my wishes to increase your activity have 
every possible stimulus. I hope soon to hear that you 
have gathered fresh laurels ; and that you may wear them 
as long and as happily as they have been speedily and 
worthily acquired, is the earnest wish of yours, he. 

ROBERT MORRIS.
