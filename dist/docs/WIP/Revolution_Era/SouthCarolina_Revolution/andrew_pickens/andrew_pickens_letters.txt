SIR: 
</p><p>
By order of <a href='/results.php?tla=jaw' rel='colleague'>Col. Williams</a>on, you are hereby required to embody the State draft from your company, and march with them, well armed and 
accoutred, with three days provisions, to the place where the Long Cane road crosses Little River, near the Rev. Mr. John Harris . You 
will be at the above place of rendezvous punctually on Friday, the 4th day of September next, as the situation of the distressed people in 
Georgia, to whose assistance we are to march, will admit of no delay. There will be wagons at the place where we meet, to carry the men's 
baggage, as the horses must be sent home if the men bring any from home. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, your most humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=anp" rel="me">ANDREW PICKENS</a>.  
</p><p>
N. B. Order every man to bring a good hatchet. Since I wrote the above I have got intelligence that a party of Indians are on their 
way to our frontier. I desire you would, with all possible speed, march up to John Cameron's old place with five or six days provisions.

On receipt of this immediately march, with twenty-five men of your 
company, to Ninety-Six, and join <a href='/results.php?tla=jaw' rel='colleague'>Col. Williams</a>, in order to guard the 
prisoners while on trial. You will receive orders from <a href='/results.php?tla=jaw' rel='colleague'>Col. Williams</a> 
when you arrive at Ninety-Six. Binborough is to supply you with pro 
visions while on duty. You will have Lieut. Joseph Wardlaw and 
any others of your company that were prisoners with the Tories, and 
can be any evidence against any of them. Elijah and Samuel Moore, 
that were with me at the battle of Kettle Creek, I am well informed 
have some horses and two rifle guns that were taken at that battle, and 
as that property belongs to the people in general, you will order them, 
without loss of time, to bring those effects to me, or they may depend 
on being prosecuted for the same.

SIR:

It is the Governor's orders that two-thirds of the militia of thik State 
be embodied, and Gen. Williamson's orders to rne, to embody the same 
number of this regiment. You will, therefore, order one-third part of 
your company, with yourself, to join me on Friday, the 16th inst., on 
horseback, at Cowan's Ferry, well armed; and those who neglected 
going with your lieutenant when ordered, you will bring with you, that 
they may be dealt with as the law directs. You will bring an exact 
list of your company, as I am ordered to make a return of the payment.

SIR:

I wrote you a few days ago to reinforce <a href='/results.php?tla=jaw' rel='colleague'>Colonel Williams</a> at NinetySix with twenty-five men from your company; but, as I have just got 
orders from Gen. Williamson to march a strong party of my regiment 
to Cowan's Ferry, on <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> river, you will, therefore, march with 
two parts of your company to that place, to be there on Wednesday 
next, the 17th inst., armed and accoutred, with good horses. I have 
wrote to <a href='/results.php?tla=jaw' rel='colleague'>Col. Williams</a> to let your men come home, though you had 
better see him yourself. I hope you will be spirited in this matter.

SIR : 
</p><p>
As the situation of this country makes it still necessary that a part of 
the people should constantly be on duty for the purpose of suppressing 
such parties of men, as lost to every sense of justice or principle of 
honesty or humanity, make it their sole study to ruin and distress by every 
means in their power, every man who shews the least attachment to 
honesty, regular order and civil government; and as this service will 
be better performed by men engaged for a certain determinate time, 
than by the militia called out from time to time as exigences may re 
quire, I desire that you will, with all possible expedition, engage arid 
embody twenty-five good men for your own and Captain John Mitchel's 
companies, exclusive of one Lieutenant, one Quarter Master and two 
Sergeants, to serve for six months from the day the whole are engaged 
and reported to me. 
</p><p>
They will serve on horse-back, each man furnishing his own horse, 
saddle, and other accoutrements if he can, but where that is not in his 
power, you will have horses, saddles, &c., provided for such as are in 
want by virtue of the warrant to impress such articles herewith given 
you ; you will be particularly careful to have an exact account kept by 
the Quarter Master of all such horses, saddles, &c., as may be impressed 
by you, specifying the person's name for whom they are got, the time 
when, and the sums to which they are appraised ; all which as well as 
the people's own horses, you will have the greatest care taken of, that 
you may always be in a condition fit for service, and that there may be 
no unnecessary waste of property, you will also take care to make the 
Quarter-Master give receipts for all provision and forage you receive, 
and keep a book in which he is to rate regularly all articles, either 
horses, saddles, provisions, or forage, the two last articles need not be 
appraised, but the quantity and quality exactly ascertained that the 
Legislature may with the more ease fix the prices. 
</p><p>
You will be particularly careful not to distress any of the good citizens of this State under any pretence, as the interest of this company is 
to protect, not to injure ; you will, therefore, effectually stop all plundering, of every kind, as no property is to be meddled with on any pretence whatever, unless such as may be taken in the field from men in 
arms against the State, which is to be the property of the captors, except what may be proved to belong to good citizens, doing or always 
ready to do their duty when called on, who are to have their property 
delivered to them when proved, without any reward or deduction. 
</p><p>
All those who may claim property retaken from the enemy, and who 
have not themselves done their duty when called on, or who have 
refused or neglected the same., or moved into other States, will pay one-third part of the value of all such property, to be ascertained by three 
indifferent men, sworn to appraise the same. 
</p><p>
Your company will be governed by the rules and articles for the 
Government of the troops of this State, and entitled to such pay as is 
allowed by the present militia law, and they will not be called out of 
this District, unless on some particular emergency, and by my particular 
order.

SIR: 
</p><p>
Your favor, with the cattle by Mr. DeLoach came safe, for which I 
am much obliged to you. I am glad to hear you have got your company, 
and are quiet with respect to the out layers, though I would recommend to you to be on your guard, least they should return, at a time 
when you do not expect them, and come on you unawares. As it is deter 
mined to go against the Cherokees, I would be much obliged to you, if 
you can possibly do it, to collect on Edisto twenty-five or thirty good 
beeves and send them up so as to be at the Cherokee ford on <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> 
River, on Monday, the sixteenth inst. I would not put you to this 
trouble, but expect beeves will be scarce. As I do not mean to take the 
men you have engaged to the nation, if any of them should come with 
the cattle, I will send them immediately back. I would recommend to 
you to send spies down Edisto, and if possible find out where Cunning 
ham keeps, and what his intention is, and if possible drive him from 
those parts ; though I would much rather you could destroy him and 
his party. I send you six swords which you will have care taken of, 
and when you have done with them, you will have them returned. 
</p><p>
I have likewise sent you a few sheets of paper to make your returns. 
You have my best wishes, and am, sir, 
</p><p>
Your most humble servant, 
</p><p>
