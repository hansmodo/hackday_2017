SIR: 
</p><p>
I am directed by <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Major-General Greene</a> to inform you, that the 
quarter part of the garrison of <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> have arrived at Charlestown. 
</p><p>
This reinforcement places the enemy in a situation to act offensively. 
The General begs you will order the troops under your command to 
Bacon Bridge with as much expedition as possible, as the advanced 
position of the army exposes it to be attacked by the enemy whenever 
they may think proper. <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a> is fully persuaded that no time 
will be lost in taking the position at the bridge. I have the honor to 
be, with much respect and esteem, 
</p><p>

MY DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
I have this moment received information that Major Brewerton was 
to leave Charlestown with a party yesterday, on an expedition to <a href='/results.php?city=santee' rel='city'>Santee</a> 
or <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>. As the General will not be in camp till late in the 
evening, I have despatched an express to communicate the intelligence, 
that you may take the most effectual measures to counteract the designs 
of the enemy. Should there arrive any accounts more minute, I sup 
pose <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a> will transmit it as early as possible to you. It is 
probable the success of Major Doyle has induced them to make a second 
attempt to collect rice. Is the rice at Waccamaw much exposed? 
</p><p>
I am, with great respect, dear sir, your most obdt. humble servant,

DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a> has this moment received information that a detachment 
of the enemy are gone up Cooper River; their object is not ascertained. 
It is said to consist of more than 400 men, and that they left town yesterday noon. The General desires me to transmit you the information 
for your security. 
</p><p>
I am, respectfully yours,

MY DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
Since the General wrote you, this morning, he has conversed with 
the person mentioned in his letter ; he is impressed with the idea of 
the enemy's intending to advance immediately; preparations are making to accomplish it as early as possible. The movement towards the <a href='/results.php?city=santee' rel='city'>Santee</a> was probably to draw the attention of part of our force to that 
quarter. You will join the army with the troops under your command as early as possible. Be pleased to communicate to Gen. Marion on the 
subject. <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a> wishes to hear from you this night. I am with sincerity yours, 
</p><p>
