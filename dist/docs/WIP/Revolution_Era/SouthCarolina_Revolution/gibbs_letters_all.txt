MAJOR B. ELLIOTT TO MRS. ELLIOTT. 

CHARLES TOWN, after 7 o clock, A. M., 29th June, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>.
 
MY DEAR WIFE : 

As soon as I got to my battery, after leaving you, we took up several 
pieces of the inside of the cabin, upon which were brass screws, all 
bespattered with blood, and other ornaments of the man-of-war. The 
firing continued till near 10 o clock, and I have the pleasure to inform 
you that we have lost but ten men and twenty-two wounded. Dr. 
Faysseaux came up this morning with the latter. He tells me that 
Richard Baker, our nephew, behaved gallantly, as did all the officers 
and men. The expression of a Sergeant McDaniel, after a cannon ball 
had taken off his shoulder and scouped out his stomach, is worth re 
cording in the annals of America: "Fight on, my brave boys; don t 
let liberty expire with me to-day!" Young, the barber, an old artil 
lery man, who lately enlisted as Sergeant, has lost a leg. Several arms 
are shot away. Not an officer is wounded. My old grenadier, Serj. 
Jasper, upon the shot carrying away the flag-staff, called out to Col. 
Moultrie: "Col., don t let us fight without our flag." "What can you 
do?" replied the Col.; "the staff is broke." "Then, sir," said he, 
"I ll fix it to a halbert, and place it on the merlon of the bastion, next 
to the enemy;" which he did, through the thickest fire. General Lee 
crossed from Haddrell s to Sullivan s in the heat of the cannonade, and 
was at the Fort. His letter to the President says he never saw but one 
cannonade equal to this, though he has seen many; nor did he ever 
see officers and men behave better, nor could any in the world exceed 
them. 

A fine sight from our cupola.* I wish you and Rinchey were here to 
look at it, viz. : One of the finest of the enemy s frigates was all in a 
blaze, and has been burning two hours. She is one of the two that got 
on shore on the middle ground, which they not being able to get off, 
have burnt. A bowsprit was shot away yesterday afternoon ; part of 
her rigging came up with the tide also, several yards of the masts. 

The Bristol, of 50 guns, the Roebuck, of 44 guns, and the Syren, 
of 28, were the three ships that lay nearest the Fort. The distance, 
though it appeared great from our cupola, did not exceed 400 yards. 
Six men-of-war engaged. Col. Moultrie has sent up for ammunition. 

The President told me he had sent to Dorchester for 2000 Ibs. The 
Fort was three-quarters of an hour yesterday without powder. 

I think you and Rinchey may come down with safety to-day, and if 
they should renew the attack in the afternoon, you may stay till John 
ston s Fort is engaged. Now, iny dear wife, let us not forget to whom 
we are indebted for this success against our enemy. Let us return 
God thanks for it. It is He that does all for us He inspires our officers 
and men with courage, and shields their heads in the day of battle 
He is the wonderful Grod of victory. 

The enemy made three attempts to land on the north of Sullivan s 
during the cannonade, but were each time repulsed without any loss 
on our side. Let Mr. Baker have this letter after you have read it, 
and when he has seen it, you can order the boy to bring it to you, or 
send it to Mr. Piercy, if an opportunity can be had. 

The house looks melancholy without you, pray come down. You 
can retreat time enough. I long to see you, and am 
Your very affectionate husband, 

BARNARD ELLIOTT.

BATTLE OF FORT MOULTRIE. 

JUNE 28, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 

Only 470 men to sustain the attack at the advance guard from 
Clinton. At five in the afternoon they were re-inforced by 700 Continen 
tals. At ten, bare of ammunition ; only one cartridge in the 18 pounder, 
and one out, and only two or three charges for the two field pieces. 
After being reduced to this state, the enemy continued firing more than 
an hour. Lee had been so dissatisfied with Moultrie s conduct, that he 
had determined to supersede him in the command of the Fort; and 
leaving the President on the morning of the action, he told him he 
was determined to do it that day if he did not, on his going down, find 
certain things done that he had ordered. 

4,600 Ibs. at the beginning. 

300 Ibs. from Haddrell s and Tuffts about five o clock. 

200 Ibs. from town in the night none of this fired. 

When left off firing at night, had 13 cartridges that is, 144 so 
that 4,766 Ibs. were expended, and about 600 shot. 

From three to five, had no powder, but a few cartridges for grape shot, 
in case the enemy attempted to land. Lee came about five o clock, when 
the first of the supply of powder arrived, the General having some hours 
before sent word by an aide-de-camp that a supply would be sent. He 
stayed about a quarter of an hour. Ten killed and twenty-two wounded. 
Commodore and Experiment lay within 480 yards, the others about 550 
yards. These five engaged instantly the Bomb covered by the Friend 
ship, and two on shore. Two hours after the engagement began, orders 
arrived from General Lee that when the powder was expended, to spike 
the guns and evacuate the Fort. The day he arrived there were 1,200 
on the Island, but he soon reduced them to about 600, and averred in 
public, before the men and officers, that the Fort ceuld not hold out 
half an hour, and that the platform was a slaughtering stage.

NARRATIVE BY THOMAS BENNET, OF COL. DONNELSON S MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT, DANIEL HAWKINS, OF BOSTON, ROBERT 
SCOTT AND EDMOND ALLSTON, OF NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND JAMES 
SCOTT, OF VIRGINIA AMERICANS TAKEN BY THE ENEMY AT SEA, 
AND DESERTERS FROM THE FLEET, WHICH ATTACKED AND WAS 
REPULSED FROM SULLIVAN S ISLAND, JUNE 28, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 


Bristol, 50 guns, Sir Peter Parker, Commodore; Experiment, 50 
guns, twelve-pounders, on two decks; Solebay, 28 guns; Active, 28 
guns ; Acteon, 28 guns ; Syren, 28 guns ; Sphinx, 20 guns ; Thunder 
Bomb ; Friendship an hired vessel, 26 guns. 

The Bristol, greatly damaged in her hull, large knees and timbers 
shot through, and if the water had not been very smooth, it would 
have been impossible to have saved her from sinking. Her mizen mast 
was shot away three shot in her main mast, which is badly wounded 
two shot in her fore mast rigging, sails and yards much damaged. 
The Captain of the Commodore lost his arm above the elbow. He was 
sent yesterday, June 30, to England. The Commodore s breeches were 
torn off, his backside laid bare, his thigh and knee wounded. Fortyfour men killed and thirty wounded, of which twenty are since dead. 
When lightened as much as possible she draws 18 feet 7 inches. 

Experiment exceedingly damaged in her hull. Killed fifty-seven, 
including the captain, and thirty wounded. When lightest, draws 17 
feet. 

In coming up, the Sphinx and Acteon got on ground. The Sphinx 
cut away her bowsprit and got off. The Acteon was burnt next day by 
her own people; and while she was on fire, Lieut. Milligan boarded 
her, and brought off her colors, bell, and as many sails as three boats 
could hold. 

The Thunder Bomb lay at a considerable distance, covered by the 
Friendship and Syren, the first throwing shell, and the two others 
firing briskly shot ricochet at the Fort. The Thunder, by overcharg 
ing, is so much damaged, as to require being docked before further 
service. 

The whole fleet badly manned and sickly, particularly the Syren; at 
two-third short allowance ; no fresh meat since their arrival, June 1. 

Lord Wm. Campbell had been very anxious for the attack, and pro 
posed to be sent with the Syren and Solebay to take all the Forts. 

The Pilot Sampson much caressed by the Commodore. When the 
fleet sailed, there were about 4,000 land forces, but eleven transports 
had been separated from the rest, and had not been heard of. 

Between nine and ten at night, the squadron, slipping their anchors, 
dropt down from before the Fort. 

About two o clock, when the Fort was silent, and waiting for a supply 
of powder, some of the men-of-war s men, mistaking the silence for a 
surrender, cried out : " The Yankees have done fighting." Others re 
plied, " By God, we are glad of it, for we never had such a drubbing 
in our lives. We had been told they would not stand two fires, but 
we never saw better fellows." All the common men in the fleet spoke 
loudly in praise of the garrison, and the seamen in general are desirous 
of getting on shore to join the Americans. 

A deserter from Fort Johnston informed the Commodore that he had 
spiked up all the cannon, and that the place might be easily taken. 

A report prevailed in the fleet that no quarter was to be given to the 
Americans, and that <a href='/results.php?year=5000'>5000</a> had been offered for Gen. Lee.

ACCOUNT OF THE ATTACK ON FORT MOULTRIE. 

[The South Carolina and American General Gazette of August 2, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>.] 

CHARLES TOWN, August 2, <a href='/results.php?year=1770'>1770</a>. 

It having been deemed expedient that the printing presses should be 
removed out of town during the alarm, the publication of this Gazette 
has been necessarily discontinued for the last two months. As the 
transactions in this province during that period will probably make it a 
distinguished one in the American annals, we doubt not but a succinct 
account of them will be very acceptable to our readers. 

On the 1st June, his Excellency, the President, received advices of 
a fleet of forty or fifty sail being at anchor about six leagues to the 
northward of Sullivan s Island. Accounts of the arrival of Sir Peter 
Parker s fleet in North Carolina, and that it was destined either for 
Virginia or this province, having been received about three weeks be 
fore, put it beyond a doubt that this was his fleet. Next morning the 
alarm was fired, expresses having been sent ordering the country militia 
to town ; the fortifications were all visited by his Excellency and Gen. 
Armstrong, and preparations for the most vigorous defence ordered. In 
the evening a man-of-war, thought to a twenty-gun ship, beat up to 
windward and anchored off the bar; next day she was joined by a frigate, and, on the day following, June 4, by upwards of fifty sail of menof-war, transports, tenders, c. We have since learned that the menof-war were the Bristol, of 50 guns, on board of which the Commodore 
had his flag; the Solebay, Capt. Syrnonds, 28; Syren, Capt. Furneaux, 
28; Active, Capt. Williams, 28; Acteon, Capt. Atkins, 28; Sphinx, 
Capt. Hunt, 20; Hanger, sloop, of 8; Thunder Bomb, of 6 guns and 
2 mortars one of them thirteen inches, and the other eleven; an 
armed ship, called the Friendship, of 18 Guns, with some smaller 
armed vessels. The same day Capt. Mowat arrived from North Caro 
lina, with an express from General Lee, informing that the fleet had 
left North Carolina, and that he would be here, as speedily as possible, 
with several Continental Regiments to our assistance. 

A few days after the arrival of the fleet, several transports and small 
armed vessels went to Long Island, situated to the eastward of Sulli 
van s Island, from which it is separated by a small creek called the 
Breach, where they landed a large body of troops, who encamped 
there. The wind and tides being favorable for the four following days, 
about thirty-six vessels came over the bar, and anchored at about three 
miles distance from Sullivan s Island. Two of their transports got 
aground in coming over ; one got off, but the other went to pieces. On 
the 10th the Bristol came over, her guns being previously taken out. 

" On the 7th, a boat, with a flag of truce from the enemy, came to 
wards the Island, but was fired on by an ignorant sentinel. The boat 
thereupon immediately put about, and would not return, notwithstanding the officer who was sent to receive the flag waved his handkerchief, 
and desired them to come ashore. Next day Col. Moultrie sent an 
officer to the fleet to acquaint them of the sentinel s having fired with 
out orders, and that he was ready to receive anything they had to send. 
Gen. Clinton was satisfied with the apology, and said the intention of 
the flag s being sent was only to deliver the following Proclamation, 
which the officer brought on shore : 

A PROCLAMATION BY MAJOR GENERAL CLINTON, COMMANDER OP HIS MAJESTY S FORCES IN THE SOUTHERN PROVINCES OP NORTH AMERICA, 

&C., &G. 

Whereas, a most unprovoked and wicked rebellion hath for some 
time past prevailed, and doth now exist, within his Majesty s Province 
of South Carolina; and the inhabitants thereof, forgetting their alle 
giance to their sovereign, and denying the authority of the laws and 
statutes of the realm, have, in a succession of crimes, proceeded to the 
total subversion of all legal authority, usurping the powers of Government, and erecting a tyranny in the hands of Congresses and Commit 
tees of various denominations, utterly unknown and repugnant to the 
spirit of the British Constitution ; and divers people, in avowed defiance 
to all legal authority, are now actually in arms, waging an unnatural 
war against the King. And whereas, all the attempts to reclaim the 
infatuated and misguided multitude to a sense of their error have 
hitherto unhappily proved ineffectual, I have it in command to proceed 
forthwith against all such men, or bodies of men in arms, and against 
all such Congresses and Committees thus unlawfully established, as 
against open enemies to the State. But, considering it as a duty in 
separable from the principles of humanity, first of all to forewarn the 
deluded people of the miseries ever attendant upon civil war, 1 do 
most earnestly entreat and exhort them, as they tender their own hap 
piness and that of their posterity, to return to their duty to our common 
sovereign, and to the blessings of a free Government, as established 
by law, hereby offering, in his Majesty s name, free pardon to all such 
as shall lay down their arms and submit to the laws : And I do hereby 
require that the Provincial Congress, and all Committees of Safety, and 
other unlawful associations, be dissolved, and the Judges allowed to 
hold their Courts according to the laws and Constitution of this Pro 
vince, of which all persons are required to take notice, as they will 
answer the contrary at their peril. 

Given on board the Sovereign transport, off Charles Town, this sixth 
day of June, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>, and in the sixteenth year of his Majesty s reign. 

H. CLINTON, Major- General 

By command of Gen. CLINTON, 
RICHARD REEVE, Sec. 

Major-General Lee, Brigadier-General Howe, Colonel Bullet, CoL 
Jenifer, Otway Byrd and Lewis Morris, Esquires, aides-de-camp to 
General Lee, with some other gentlemen, arrived at HaddrelFs Point 
on the morning of the 9th. After having viewed the fortifications 
there, and on Sullivan s and James Islands, they came to town. Orders 
being given on the 10th for a number of buildings on the wharfs to be 
pulled down, intrenchments to be thrown up all around the town, and 
barricades to be made in the principal streets every person, without 
distinction, were employed on these works. 

On the 12th, there blew a violent storm, in which an hospital ship 
and the Friendship, which were at anchor on the other side of the bar, 
were obliged to put out to sea, but returned in a few days after. A 
schooner, having on board some provisions and coals, drifted a little 
way from the fleet, was taken by one of our pilot-boats, and brought to 
town. Her crew took to their boat on observing the pilot-boat ap 
proach. 

His Excellency, the President, on the 14th, proposed to the militia 
under arms an oath of fidelity, which was voluntarily and readily taken 
by every one excepting three. The next morning it was proposed to 
the country militia doing duty in town, and to the Artillery Companies, 
when it met with their unanimous assent. 

A sloop from the West Indies for this port, with a cargo of gun 
powder, arms, rum, &c., having, on the afternoon of the 16th, descried 
the fleet, attempted to make her escape; but, through the ignorance 
of her pilot, ran aground and bilged. Next day she was discovered by 
the men-of-war, and a tender, with several boats full of armed men, 
came towards her. The crew, being only twenty-two men, unable to 
cope with such a force in the situation the vessel was in, quitted her. 
She was soon after boarded, set on fire, and blew up with a great ex 
plosion. 

By some sailors who deserted from the Ranger sloop, lying near Long 
Island, we were informed that the land forces were about 2,800 (some 
say 3,300) men, under the command of Major-General Clinton, who 
had under him Major-General Lord Cornwallis and Brigadier-General 
Vaughan. 

On the 21st, our advanced party at the north-east end of Sullivan s 
Island fired several shot at the armed schooner, Lady William, an armed 
sloop, and a pilot-boat, lying in the creek between Long Island and the 
Main, several of which hulled them. For several mornings and evenings the enemy threw shells, and fired from some field pieces on our 
advanced post, but without any effect. 

A large ship hove in sight on the 25th, in the morning. It was 
thought to be the Roebuck, but we have since learnt it was the Experi 
ment, Capt. Scott, of 50 guns. Next day she came over, having her 
guns out. On the day following, the 27th, between nine and ten in 
the forenoon, as soon as the Experiment had her guns all in, the Com 
modore hoisted his topsails, fired a gun, and got under way. His ex 
ample was followed by several others of the men-of-war; but a squall 
coming on, and the wind shifting from south-east to the opposite quar 
ter, prevented their coming much nearer at that time. In the after 
noon the Commodore again got under way, and came about a mile nearer 
Sullivan s Island. 

Next morning, June 28, the following was the disposition of the 
ships-of-war : The Friendship, at the distance of about a mile-and-a
half from Sullivan s Island, covering the Thunder Bomb, the Solebay, 
Sphinx, Bristol, Active, Experiment, Acteon and Syren. About halfan-hour past ten o clock in the forenoon, the Thunder began throwing 
shells on Fort Sullivan, and the Active, Bristol, Experiment and Solebay, came boldly up to the attack, in the order their names are put 
down. A little before eleven o clock, the garrison fired four or five shot 
at the Active, while under sail, some of which struck her. These she 
did not seem to regard till within about 350 yards of the Fort, when 
she dropped anchor and poured in a broadside. Her example was in a 
few minutes followed by the other three vessels, when there ensued one 
of the most heavy and incessant cannonades perhaps ever known. The 
bomb vessel was at the same time throwing shells. A firing was heard 
from the advanced post at the north-east end of the Island, and more 
vessels were seen coming up. Our brave garrison (consisting of the 
2d Regiment of Provincials, a Detachment of Artillery, and some 
Volunteers), under all these difficulties, which to the far greater part 
were entirely new, encouraged by the example of their gallant Com 
mander, Col. William Aloultrie, and the rest of the officers, behaved 
with the cool intrepidity of veterans. Our cannon were well served, 
and did dreadful execution. About twelve o clock the Sphinx, Acteon 
and Syren, got entangled with a shoal, called the Middle Ground. The 
two first ran foul of each other ; the Sphinx got oif with the loss of 
her bowsprit, but the Acteon stuck fast. The Syren also got off. Much 
about the same time the bomb vessel ceased firing, after having thrown 
upwards of sixty shells. We have since learnt, that her beds got 
damaged, and that it will require much repairing before she is fit 
for service again. In the afternoon the enemy s fire was increased by 
that of the Syren and Friendship, which came within 500 hundred 
yards of the Fort. 

Till near seven o clock was the enemy s fire kept up, without inter 
mission. It slackened considerably after that, and they only returned 
the garrison s fire, but generally twenty fold. At half after nine, the 
firing on both sides ceased, and, at eleven, the ships slipped their cables. 

About the time the ships came up, an armed schooner and sloop camo 
nearer our advanced post, in order to cover the landing of their troops, 
and every other preparation for that purpose was made the soldiers 
even got into their boats, and a number of shell were thrown into our 
intrenchments, but did no other damage than wounding one soldier, 
notwithstanding which, they never once attempted to land. At the advanced post were stationed Col. Thomson with his Rangers, some com 
panies of Militia and a detachment of Artillery, They had one 18 
pounder and two field pieces, from which they returned the enemy s 
fire. They were reinforced in the afternoon with Col. Muhlenburg s 
Virginia Battalion. 

Next morning all the men-of-war, except the Acteon, were retired 
about two miles from the island, which they had quietly effected under 
cloud of night. The garrison fired several shot at the Acteon, which 
she returned; but soon after her crew set her on fire, and abandoned 
her, leaving her colors flying, guns loaded, with all her ammunition, 
provisions and stores on board. They had not been long gone before 
several boats from the Island went to her. Lieut. Jacob Milligan, 
with some others, went on board, and brought off her Jack, bell, some 
sails and stores, while the flames were bursting out on all sides. He 
fired three of her guns at the Commodore. In less than half-an-hour 
after they quitted her, she blew up. 

ihe Bristol, against which the fire was chiefly directed, is very much 
damaged. It is said that not less than seventy balls went through her. 
Her mizen mast was so much hurt, that they have since replaced it 
with another. The main mast is cut away about fifteen feet below the 
hounds ; and, instead of her broad pendant soaring on a lofty mast, it 
is now hardly to be seen on a jury main mast considerably lower than 
the fore mast. The Experiment had her mizen gaff shot away; the 
other vessels sustained little damage in their rigging. The loss in the 
fleet, according to the report of the deserters, is about 180 killed and 
wounded; among the former is Captain Morrison, of the Bristol. Sir 
Peter Parker had the hind part of his breeches shot away, which laid 
his posteriors bare, and his knee pan hurt by a splinter. There have 
been several funerals in the fleet since the engagement ; and from the 
parade of some, it is conjectured they were of officers of ranks. Some 
of the deserters say that Capt. Scott, of the Experiment, is among the 
killed. 

The loss of the garrison was as follows : 

Artillery Killed, 1 matross; wounded, 2 matrosses. 

3d Regiment Killed, 1 sergeant, 9 rank and file; wounded, Lieuts. 
Gray and Hall, the fife major, 1 sergeant, 19 rank and file. 

An officer s mulatto waiting boy was killed. 

Total Killed, 12; wounded, 23. 

Both the officers were but slightly wounded, and are well five of 
the wounded privates are since dead. 

The works are very little damaged, but hardly a hut or tree on the 
island escaped the shot entirely. Many thousands of the enemy s shot 
have been picked up on the island. 
2 

G-eneral Lee was at HaddrelFs Point at the beginning of the action, 
and went in a boat, through a thick fire, to the fort, where he stayed 
some time. He says, in the whole course of his military service he 
never knew men behave better, and cannot sufficiently praise both officers and soldiers for their coolness and intrepedity. The behavior of 
two sergeants deserves to be remembered. In the beginning of the 
action, the flag-staff was shot away, which, being observed by Sergeant 
Jasper, of the Grenadiers, he immediately jumped from one of the 
embrasures upon the beach, took up the flag, and fixed it on a sponge 
staff. With it in his hand he mounted the merlon, and notwithstanding the shot flew as thick as hail around him, he leisurely fixed it. 
Sergeant McDonald, of Capt. Huger s company, while exerting himself 
in a very distinguished manner, was cruelly shattered by a cannon ball. 
In a few minutes he expired, after having uttered these remarkable 
words : " My friends, I am dying; but don t let the cause of liberty 
expire with me I" His comrades felt for him. The gallant Jasper im 
mediately removed his mangled corpse from their sight, and cried aloud : 
" Let us revenge that brave man s death !" The day after the action, his 
Excellency, the President, presented Sergeant Jasper with a sword, as 
a mark of esteem for his distinguished valor. 

We hear that the fort on Sullivan s Island will be in future called 
Fort Moultrie, in honor of the gallant officer who commanded there on 
the memorable 28th of June, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 

The men-of-war dropped down several miles further from the island 
a few days after. The carpenters in the fleet had sufficient employment 
in repairing the vessels. Several deserters came from both fleet and 
army, who all agreed we need not expect another visit at present that 
it was talked that the two large ships would go to English harbor in 
Antigua to get refitted the transports, with the troops, to proceed to 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, under convoy of some men-of-war, to join the grand army, 
and that two frigates would be left to cruise between North Carolina 
and Georgia. 

On the 2d of July, Gen. Lee sent a flag to the enemy, with a pro 
posal to exchange a prisoner for Col. Ethan Allen, who it was said was 
in the fleet. A present of some fresh meat and vegetables was sent at 
the same time. Gen. Clinton being at Long Island, an answer was not 
received till two days after, when he informed Gen. Lee that Col. Allen 
was not on board, and in return for his present, sent some porter, 
cheese, &c. Two engineers came in the boat, but as they were received 
at some distance from the fort, they were deprived of an opportunity 
of seeing what they were probably sent to observe. 
A sloop from the West Indies, with gunpowder, &c., ran aground on 
the 5th, in coming into Stono Inlet. She, a few days afterwards, went 
to pieces, the cargo having been previously taken out. 

A number of the enemy s transports went to Long Island about ten 
days after the repulse, and took on board all the troops on it and Goat 
Island. About the same time some of their frigates and armed vessels 
went over the bar; and, on the 14th, the Bristol made an attempt to go 
out, in which she failed, having struck on the bar. She succeeded in 
another attempt, four days after, and came to an anchor off the harbor. 

The transports, with the Solebay, Thunder, Friendship, and some of 
the small armed vessels, sailed on the 20th, steering a southward 
course ; they were afterwards seen standing to the eastward. On the 
same day a brigantine, having on board fifty soldiers and six sailors, got 
aground near Dewees Inlet. She was left unobserved by the rest, and 
on the day afterwards was taken by an armed flat or floating battery, 
commanded by Lieut. Pickering. The brigantine could not be got off, 
and was, therefore, burnt. She was mounted with six 4 pounders. 
The soldiers threw their small arms overboard, on seeing the approach 
of the flat. Four of the crew escaped in their boat. 

On the 25th, the Experiment went over the bar, her lower tier of 
guns being taken out. She came to an anchor near the Commodore, 
Syren, and three transports, lying off the harbor. A frigate, which had 
not been here before, came to the Commodore in the afternoon of the 
25th. Next morning she sailed for the southward, and two days after 
the Syren followed her. 

This forenoon the Active, Sphynx, and a large transport, being all of 
the enemy s vessels within the bar, went out, and with the Bristol, 
Experiment, three transports and a tender, stood out to sea, steering an 
E.N.E. course.

CAMP, LONG ISLAND, 13th July, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 

DEAR BROTHER, 

With great difficulty I have procured this small piece of paper, to 
inform you of my being very well, notwithstanding the miserable situation we are in. We have been encamped on this island for this month 
past, and have lived upon nothing but salt pork and peas; we sleep 

upon the sea-shore, nothing to shelter us from the rains but our coats, 
or a miserable paltry blanket there is nothing that grows upon the 
island, it being a mere sand-bank, and a few bushes, which harbor 
millions of musketoes, a greater plague than there can be in hell itself. 
By this sloop-of-war you will have an account of the action which hap 
pened on the 28th June, between the ships and the fort on Sullivan s 
Island. The cannonade continued for about nine hours, and was, per 
haps, one of the briskest known in the annals of war. We had two 
50 gun ships, five frigates from 24 to 80 guns playing upon the fort 1 
may say without success, for they did the battery no manner of damage; 
they killed only about fifteen, and wounded between forty and fifty. 
Our ships are in the most miserable, mangled situation you can possible 
imagine. The Acteon, a 30 gun frigate, ran aground during the 
action, and, as it was impossible to get her off, we were obliged to burn 
and blow her up. Our killed and wounded amounts to betwixt 200 
and 300. Numbers die daily of their wounds. The Commodore is 
wounded in two different places ; his captain lost his arm and right 
hand, and was wounded in different parts of the body. He lived but 
two days after the action. Capt. Scott, of the Experiment, died of his 
wounds, and a number of officers. If the ships could have silenced 
the battery, the army was to have made an attack on the back of the 
island, where they had about <a href='/results.php?year=1000'>1000</a> men entrenched up to the eyes, be 
sides a small battery of four guns, one 18 and three 4 pounders, all 
loaded with grape shot, so that they would have killed half of us before 
we could have made our landing good. We are now expecting to em 
bark for <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, to join General Howe with the grand army. 

My anxiety to inform you of bad news had well nigh made me forget 
to mention our passage to Cape Fear, where we arrived safely the 1st 
of May, after a passage of three months. Though it was long, yet it 
was not disagreeable, after we got out of the Bay of Biscay, where we 
met with the worst weather ever known at sea, and continued in that 
situation for sixteen days. After that time we had very fine weather 
all along, sometimes we were becalmed four or five days together, not 
going above ten knots a day. Upon our arrival at Cape Fear, we dis 
embarked, and were encamped in the woods till the 27th May, when 
we went on board again, and sailed for this infernal place. The oldest 
of our officers do not remember of ever undergoing such hardships as 
we have done since our arrival here. 

I hope you will be so good as watch every opportunity to let me hear 
from Mrs. Falconer and you, and at the same time to inform me how to 
do in case I shall be obliged to purchase my lieutenancy. I beg you 
will make my excuse to my dear sister for not writing to her at this 
time. It is not owing to want of affection, but to the want of proper 
materials. I am obliged to write upon the ground. You ll be so good 
as let Capt. Falconer know the same thing. I shall write again from 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. I am, dear sir, 

Your most affect, brother, 

WILL. FALCONER.

MAJOR WM.SON TO W. H. DRAYTON. 

WHITEHALL, June 27, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 

DEAR SIR : 

I have no later letters from Charlestown than those I showed to 
Mr. Salvador when here. 

James Holmes left Charlestown a day later, and says no attempt 
was made against the town that several of the small vessels had re 
turned back over the bar, and several more getting under sail, appre 
hended to be bound the same way. 

Your letter to the President I despatched to Charlestown with some 
of my men, on Friday last. The two Cherokee Indians returned to the 
nation on Wednesday week, seemingly well satisfied with their journey. 
I gave them a strong talk, the substance as follows : That I had, agree 
able to the desire of the warrior of Sugar Town, acompanied them 
across the frontier settlements, and told them before I set out, that if 
they saw, and would show me any bad white warriors, who carried lies 
and bad talk amongst them from the settlements, that I would take 
them into custody, and punish; and in return demanded liberty to send 
some of our people into the nation to secure York, and other bad white 
people, who had carried lies and bad talk amongst them, and endea 
vored, by every method they could devise, to make them quarrel with 
us. If they complied with this proposal, I should then know they 
wanted to live at peace with us ; but, if they denied us that liberty, I 
should believe they did not care to continue in friendship with us 
longer, and should either send, or come myself, and bring the bad people 
out of the nation by force. A string of white beads. I desired them 
to remember talk well, and tell it to the warriors, and return an answer 
soon, which I received yesterday by one Price, a half breed. On 
receiving my talk, the warrior of Sugar Town summoned the other 
warriors of the lower towns, and returned an answer as follows : 
Thanked me for the good talk in them, by Shurry Shurry, and believed 
every word therein was truth that the warriors of the lower towns 
would not interfere between the white people in their quarrel, and in 
future would not prevent me sending men into the nation, to take into 
custody such white people as went into the nation with bad talk and 
lies. They remembered the good talk given them at Fort Charlotte, 
and were resolved to abide by them. A string of white beads. 

Mr. Hammond writes me on the 25th instant that Brown had met 
with an affront in the Creek nation, at a great ball play, where he and 
some white people, and Indians, by desire of Tate, the commissary, 
seized one Tapley, a trader, fitted out from Mobile; but the other Indians interfered, and rescued Tapley, and broke Brown s sword, and 
beat him and his party, and carried Tapley to Tate, and desired him to 
tell Tate what he had a mind to speak. Brown, it is thought, is gone 
to Florida, in great disgust for this treatment. The Creeks say they 
will suffer no ammunition to be carried through their nation for the 
Cherokees. 

I received a kick from Major Downes stallion the evening of the 
day I left you, which cut my leg, and my being careless of it, has 
brought on a fever for these two days past, which confined me to my 
chamber. I have sent Mr. Salvador a little powder and bullets. Mr. 
Williamson and Winter are well. They join me in best compliments 
to you and Mr. Salvador. I am, dear sir, 

Your most humble servant, 

A. WM.SON,

FRANCIS SALVADOR TO HON. CHIEF JUSTICE DRAYTON. 

CAMP NEAR DEWIT S CORNER, 18th July, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 

DEAR SIR : 

Major Williamson has told me that you thought the present alarm a 
good opportunity to execute your commission. I have employed an 
unsuspected person, who has taken refuge in the same fort with Nor 
wood, and am in hopes, by the time I return from the Cherokee Nation, 
it will be accomplished, though he is a most positive old blockhead. 

You would have been surprised to have seen the change in this country 
two days after you left me.* On Monday morning one of Capt. Smith s sons 
came to my house, with two of his fingers shot off. I gave an account of 
the shocking catastrophe at his father s. I immediately galloped to Major 
Williamson s, to inform him, but found another of Smith s sons there, 
who had made his escape, and alarmed that settlement. The whole 
country was flying some to make forts, others as low as Orangeburgh. 
Williamson was employed night and day sending expresses to raise the 
militia; but the panic was so great, that on Wednesday following the 
Major and myself marched to the late Capt. Smith s with only forty 
men. The next day we were joined by forty more, and have been 
gradually increasing ever since, though all the men in the country were 
loth to turn out, till they had procured some kind of fancied security 
for their families. However, we had last night 500 men, but have not 
been joined by any from the other side of the river. I rode there last 
Saturday, and found Col. Williams and Liles, and two companies from 
Col. Richardson s regiment, amounting to 430 men. They were at 
tacked on Monday (July 15) morning, by Indians and Scopholites, but 
repulsed them, taking thirteen white men prisoners. The Indians fled 
the moment day appeared. I will not trouble you with more particu 
lars, as Major Williamson will send a circumstantial account to his 
Excellency. I arn afraid the burthen of the war will fall on this regi 
ment, and that the people over the river will do nothing. They 
grumble at being commanded by a Major; and, I fear, if they join us 
at all (which I doubt), they will be very apt to prejudice the service by 
altercations about command. I cannot help saying, that if Williamson is fit to conduct such an expedition, he certainly ought to have a much 
higher rank than any of these classes, who don t object to his person, 
but his rank. I likewise think it an omission that the colonels on the 
other side the river have no written orders to put themselves, or their 
men, under his command. On the last accounts from town, that Cun 
ningham and his companions were set at liberty, we were very near 
having a mutiny in camp; and it is really a measure (which, though 
certainly intended for the best,) very alarming to all ranks of people. 
The ignorant look upon it as turning their enemies loose on their backs 
in the day of their distress; and the sensible part consider it as a dangerous exercise of a dispensing power, assumed contrary to the express 
determination of Congress, and a corroborating resolve of the succeeding House of Assembly. Pearis house having been a rendezvous for 
the Indians and Scopholites, Col. Thomas intended to attack it on Mon 
day. We are not yet informed if he did or not; but one of our spies 
was there on Tuesday, and saw many of our enemies about the place, 
and all the buildings in ashes. Whether they were burnt by friends or 
foes, is still uncertain; if by the first, I fear Pearis will injure us much. 
Our men seem spirited, and very much exasperated against our enemies. 
They one and all are displeased at the people over the river for granting quarter to their prisoners, and declare they will grant none either 
to Indians or white men who -join them. We have just received an 
account that two of the Cherokees head warriors were killed in the 
late skirmish at Lindley s Fort. 

19th July, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 

Cunningham and Pearis came here last night, and by the former I 
imagine he was much caressed in town. Here he was treated politely, 
but with reserve, the Major and myself having advjised him to go home, 
and mind his private business, at which he seemed chagrined. I am 
clear he had not yet given up the idea of being a man of consequence; 
but the friends of liberty in this part of the world are determined to 
have no connection with him, and to consider him for the future merely 
as an individual, and not as head of any party. We have just heard 
from over the river that the white people in general had quitted the 
Indians, after the repulse at Lindley s, and were delivering themselves 
up to Col. Liles. He has sent all those to Ninety-Six jail, against 
whom there is proof of having been in the action. 

I hope you will pardon the freedom with which I express my sentiments; but I look upon it as an advantage to men in power to be truly 
informed of the people s situation and disposition. This must plead 
my excuse, and believe me to be, with great respect, dear sir, 
Your obedient humble servant, 

FRANCIS SALVADOR, 

P. S. We, this day, increased to 600, all from the same regiment. 

Capt. McCall, with 20 men, was sent by Major Williamson to the 
Cherokees at Seneca, to make prisoners of some white men, by the 
encouragement of some Indians, who had been at the Major s. When 
the detachment got near, the Indians came out to meet them, spoke 
friendly to them, and invited the captain, lieutenant, and another man, 
to sup with them, leaving three of their own people in their room ; and, 
in a few hours after, in the night, the Indians returned, and suddenly 
attacked the detachment, which fled as fast as possible. They are all 
returned but the captain and six men. This happened immediately 
before Smith s family was cut off, who lost five negro men, himself, 
wife, and five children. On this day Stringer and one child, three or 
four of Gillespy s family, in the same settlement. The ravage ex 
tended all along the frontier the same morning. At Lindley s Fort, 
Downes accidentally arrived with 150 men at night, on his way to 
Williamson s, when at one in the morning the fort was attacked by the 
Indians and white men eighty-eight Indians and one hundred and two 
whites.

A. WM.SON TO 

CAMP AT BARKER S CREEK, July 22 ; <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 

DEAR SIR : 

Your favor of the 12th instant is now before me, giving an account 
of the agreeable news of your having beat the British fleet. I shall 
try my utmost endeavors to follow your example, and beat the Chero 
kees, of whose treachery and faithless behavior you are well acquainted. 
I am now encamped here, with about 700 effective men from this regi 
ment, which, with 136 who do duty in the different forts, you ll perceive 
have turned out pretty well. My numbers would soon increase if I 
had arms. If any can be spared from Charlestown, you can never do 
this part of the country a greater service than by using your endeavors 
to have them immediately sent here. 
Capts. Tate and Prince s companies of Riflemen, have just now 
joined me. They consist of ninety-three effective men ; and to-morrow 
Col. Williams, who has been at least fourteen days contriving a mode to 
cross Saluda River, will also join me, with about 200 men. Captain 
Hammond marched with a detachment of 100 picked men, on Friday 
morning, for Paris House, where I am informed a party of the enemy 
have been skulking about there some days past. I expect hourly to 
hear from him, and some agreeable news. He has my orders if he can 
conveniently join Col. Thomas and Niel, to act in concert with them, 
and proceed directly into the nation by Estatoe, while I penetrate by 
way of Seneca and the Sugar Town. Thomas has acted in every 
respect agreeable to his declaration when at his house. I have wrote, 
and sent him express upon express, to no purpose. It is really disagree 
able to have any connexion with such men. He has not wrote me a 
line since the Indians first commenced hostilities. Lieut.-Col. Polk, of 
Niel s regiment, with 300 men well armed, has joined Thomas; and I 
am told by Capt. Powes, who I sent on purpose to see his strength, and 
marked out a plan to act in conjunction with them, that Polk is eager 
to join me. It is agreeable to his sentiments, communicated by letter 
to me lately. Judge, then, what feelings such a man must be pos 
sessed of, who, in place of hastening to save or revenge his country, 
can content himself with doing nothing. Robert Cunningham and 
Paris came to my camp. The former, on his arrival, declared himself 
our fast friend, and that he came to stand and fall with us. I was 
sorry I could not show him the countenance I could have wished, 
owing to the people being so much exasperated at the behavior of Hugh 
Brown, and others, who have lately joined the Indians against us, 
thirteen of which were taken prisoners, a few days ago, a*nd sent to 
Ninety-Six jail four of which were found painted as Indians. I have 
no doubt of Cunningham proving true to his declaration, but at present 
it would be improper to confer any public trust on him. Mr. Salvador 
has been with me since my first taking the field. I showed him your 
postscript. He thinks of making the campaign to the nation. I under 
stand last night, the Indians struck at North Carolina and Virginia the 
very day they commenced hostilities against our frontier. If these two 
colonies join heartily with us, I hope soon to have the pleasure of 
congratulating you of a happy issue being put to their expedition, and 
reduce the savages to such a state, as to wish they had never broke 
their faith with us. I am, with much regard, dear sir, 
Your most humble servant, 

A. WM.SON.

REV. JAS. CRESWELL TO W. H. DRAYTON. 

NINEY-SIX, 27th July, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>, 

HONORED. SIR : 

I make no doubt but you are anxious to hear how our affairs stand 
in this perplexed and unhappy district, since the heathen has broke in 
on our frontier. orne on such occasions speak variously; nor is it 
easy :o report only real facts. You may rely on the following : 

It is quite evident that the savages were made acquainted with the 
desig is of the British fleet against Charlestown, and that there was a 
concerted scheme between them against our country. Nor is it less 
certain that the disaffected party among us knew the intention of 
the Indians, and were really elated with the prospect. They made no 
secret of their expectations of safety; and when the time drew near 
that was appointed for the savages to muster, they refused to muster, 
or obey any ofiicer appointed by their country over them. This insolent 
behavior, at such a threatening time, very much alarmed us. At this 
time, it evidently appears that they were, by compact, to assist the 
savages to ruin the country; and had they been in possession of their 
arms, many of them would have actually engaged in the bloody scheme. 
But, providentially for us, their arms were scarce, and the savages killed 
the disaffected in common, without distinction of party. That greatly 
alarmed them, changed their countenance and tone, and made them 
look out for safety for their families. Others of them justly supposed 
that any of their party that was killed must have suffered through mis 
take. This now appears plain to us, by the Indians giving up those of 
them which they had taken as prisoners. 

The savages have spread great desolation all along the frontiers, and 
killed a great number. On the 14th they attacked a part of Colonel 
Williams regiment at Lindlay s Fort, but were repulsed, by the loss of 
one lover of his country, who unfortunately suffered a cruel death by 
them. This attack was made by about ninety Indians, and 120 white 
men. Ten of the white Indians were made prisoners, nine of which 
were painted. They are now safe at Ninety-Six, where they will remain, 
unless released by their brethren. Major Williamson, and the officers 
under him, have exerted themselves in getting our forces together, and 
arming them as well as could be done among us. Our army is about 
1,000, or 1,100 strong, and has advanced about fifteen miles over the 
line. 

Ninety-Six is now a frontier. Plantations lie desolate, and hopeful 
crops are going to ruin. In short, dear sir, unless we get some relief, 
famine will overspread our beautiful country. As our army is now over 
the line, the dread of savages, and the disaffected, will deter the lovers 
of their country from looking after their affairs at home. Fences are 
thrown down, and many have already suffered great loss. 

Such of us as are in forts have neither suitable guns nor ammunition, for the defence of our wives and little ones, as we were obliged to 
furnish our army with our best arms. 

By every intelligence we have from Georgia, we learn that the new 
purchase is in great distress. Should the savages break through the 
new purchase, we will then be a frontier in that quarter. The release 
of the prisoners at Charlestown at this critical juncture very much 
alarmed us. We really dread that party. I cannot express qur dis 
tress. Your friendship, on our behalf, with our Governor, to procure 
us the rangers, or part of them, to assist us, will be acknowledged by 
all with real gratitude, and by none more than by, honored sir, 
Your very humble servant, 

JAMES CRESWELL.

CAMP AT SENECA, August 22, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 

DEAR SIR : 

This is to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the 10th instant, 
acquainting me of the independence of the United States of America 
being declared, which 1 agree with you is a glorious event. I asked 
Col. Thomas, who is now in camp, concerning the titles you mention. 
He says he sent them to <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> by Capt. Ralph Smith, with directions to deliver them to Mr. Parsons or Ferguson, as you were at that 
time in the country; but, it being the day that General Lee had ar 
rived, Capt. Smith had no opportunity to deliver them to any of these 
gentlemen, who, therefore, returned them again into his hands, and that 
he will forward them to you at the end of the campaign, or when he 
returns home. 

I have now burnt down every town, and destroyed all the corn, from 
the Cherokee line to the middle settlements Little Cliote exccpted, 
ivJiicli is said to stand on the Creek land, concerning which, I wrote to 
Mr. Galphin, and recommended it to Col Rae (if Mr. Galphin approves 
of it) to march against Little Chote, at the same time I move into the 
middle settlement, which will attract the enemy s attention, and, of 
course, yield him an easy conquest. I have received letters from Gen. 
Rutherford, wherein he acquaints me that he will be in the middle 
settlements about the 4th or 5th of next month, with about 2,000 men. 
I have wrote him the day I am to move from home for the same place, 
where we are to endeavor to join, and act conjunctly, while Col. Lewis, 
from Virginia, attacks the Overhills, with about the same number. My 
last battle with the Cherokees has already produced some good effect, 
having in their confusion given an opportunity to James Holmes and 
family, and nine others, to make their escape. Mr. Galphin writes me 
the Creeks are fully determined not to assist the Cherokees in the 
present war, which is a great point gained; and I hope we shall soon 
put the Cherokees in such a condition as will deter any other nation, or 
tribes of Indians, disturbing the quiet of Virginia, North Carolina, 
Georgia, or this province, for some time to come. 

Capt. Hammond is in camp, and well. He joins me in best compliments to you. I am, dear sir, 

Your humble servant,

MEMORANDUM OF MR. FARR FOR W. H. DRAYTON. 

THURSDAY, Sept. 5, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 

By the several pay bills brought in of the country militia, Tfho did 
duty in Charlestown, at Haddrell s Point, and Sullivan s Island, in the 
months of June and July last, there were paid, for those two months, 
296 officers and 3,648 privates, making 3,944 men; and supposing 
one-half of those men to do duty in June, and the other half in July, 
makes 1,972 men, including officers. These country militia cost the 
public, for doing duty at the before-mentioned places, 16s. 9H- per 
day for each respective man, exclusive of provisions, fire-wood, &c., 
which tis supposed, the whole charges put together, comes to much 
more than 20s. per day per man. 

If there were any more country militia in town either of those 
months, the bills have not been brought in to the paymaster; but he 
thinks the above account to be just. 

Mr. Farr s compliments wait on Mr. Chief Justice Drayton, and has 
sent him the above calculation, which Mr. Farr has taken some pains 
to ascertain.

and advised, that a gentleman of character be sent to North Carolina 
to solicit the aid of 1,500 minute or militia men, to be immediately 
marched into this State, and to remain here for two months, from the 
time of their arrival, who should be allowed the same pay and rations 
as are allowed to our own militia, from the time of their setting out 
until their return to North Carolina. 

Mr. Chief Justice being proposed, agreed to go on this business.

The Board advised his Excellency to direct Mr. Drayton to solicit 
that, in case North Carolina shall agree to furnish us with 1,500 men,

JOURNAL OF CAPTAIN CHARLES S. MIDD^ETON. 

DECEMBER 20, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 

The men all got over the river on our march southwardly. Colonel Mclntosh, Major Malberry and Lieutenant Doghartj sat off from the 
river to join Captain Caldwell. Lieutanant West tnd myself with a small party stayed at the river that night. 

SATURDAY, December 21, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 

Lieutenant West and myself, with the party, sat off early in the 
morning ; returned one man that had lost the cock of his gun ; joined 
the main body at Camay s Old Cowpen. 

SUNDAY, December 22, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 

Major Malberry took a detachment of thirty privates, three non-com 
missioned officers and one commissioned officer } crossed the river at 
the Bluff, where Lieutenant Jenkins was stationed, to join us at the 
old ferry ; the main body sat off. Adjutant Fash waited on the Colonel to know whether the Carolinians were to take the front or rear ; the 
Colonel did not chose to determine, as he did not know which was the 
oldest Regiment, but, in order to satisfy both parties, gave order that 
the officers and men were to fall in promiscuously and no distinctions 
made which was agreeable to both parties until it was known which 
had the rank. On our march some one discovered, as he thought, a 
party of men running from us ; a party pursued but could make no dis 
covery of them. I was detached off with a party to stop the advance 
guard and join a small detachment that was sent round as a reconnoitering party. I met them at the place appointed, but never overtook 
the advance party until we got to Middleton s plantation, which was to 
have been our rendezvous that night, but the alarm altered our designs. 
We were to join and rendezvous that night at Mr. Williamson s cowpen, 

but the main party proceeded to pursue the tracks, following them some 
distance, found them to be cattle tracks. Judged the man who had 
thought he saw people made a mistake, and then proceeded on the old 
plan of going to Middleton s that night. On my return from Middleton s, met the main body and rendezvoused at Middleton s that night. 

MONDAY, December 23, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 

Sat off; disco T ered some fresh tracks going down to Inglis ; Lieu 
tenant Fitzpatrick was detached with ten men to find out whose tracks 
they were. We arrived at the old ferry ; I was ordered with a party to 
reconnoiter the landing, but could make no discovery of the enemy. 
Ordered that erery officer mounting a guard should sleep at the 
main guard, and risit the sentries at least three times a night. Placed 
a lance sergeant and four men as a guard at the river. Sergeant 
Warren, who was ordered from head-quarters to bring provisions round 
to us, arrived in tie night ; hailed the sentry, but was made no answer, 
came past them, landed and came up to the Colonel s camp; the Colonel immediately ordered the sentry under the main guard. 

TUESDAY, December 24, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 

Major Malbeny arrived with his detachment at the other side ; a 
boat wag sent for him immediately ; he had seen no signs of the enemy. 
Lieutenant Dogharty came over the river says he saw very fresh signs 
of four or five men crossing the river. Ordered that a Court Martial 
be held upon Abner Islands for being caught sleeping on his post. 
Lieutenant Fitzpatrick returned ; says he followed the tracks up to Mr. 
Inglis plantation ; they appeared to have run off from there; they fol 
lowed the tracks until they got intermixed with ours in such a manner 
that they could follow them no longer. The Court Martial were opinion 
that the prisoner should receive twenty lashes on the bare back, but my 
writing a note to the Colonel, informing him of the character of the 
soldier, of its being his first offence committed in the service, the Colonel thought proper to forgive the prisoner. The Regiment was drawn 
up and some of the articles of war I read to them. Ordered that every 
man hobble and bell his horse and have him ready to cross the river 
early in the morning. 

WEDNESDAY, December 25, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a> 

The whole detachment crossed the river, all to a small guard at the 
river of a subaltern and twenty men. The detachment proceeded as 
far as Lee s hill. I was detatched to McG-irth s as a reconnoitering 
party ; could make no discovery of any sign fresher than three or four 
days; joined the party. 

THURSDAY, December 26, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 

I was ordered to take a subaltern and twenty-three privates, volun 
teers, to cross the river St. Mary s in search of the Florida scouts ; the 
men turned out, and we crossed the river that night and went as far as 
Taylor s. 

FRIDAY, December 27, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 

We proceeded, and in about an hour afterwards came upon fresh 
signs of cattle, imagined to have been drove along late last night. I 
gave the necessary orders, ss in all probability we might expect to come 
upon them every minute. However we did not come up with them un 
til we got to Cornelious Rains , where they had just gone from, but dis 
covering a house we made three different parties to surround the houses. 
Unluckily, Joseph Rains was going over to his brother s and discovered 
us creeping up ; he immediately ran and gave the alarm at the house ; 
then proceeded after the men who were driving the cattle and alarmed 
them also. We surrounded the houses and came in ; the men were 
all gone; though I could not learn there were more than Cornelious 
Rains there at that time ; the cattle drivers had been gone about half 
an hour before ; Mrs. Rains and her daughter informed me that one 
Captain York, with a party, was with the cattle, and that James Moore 
and Sampson Williams were each to have been there the night before 
with each of them a company. We had several times information that 
there was a strong party of whites and another of Indians coming out, 
though I did not put much faith in the report. I thought if it was 
true, and any strong party came against us and we should be defeated, 
I should be much blamed, my order being very particular to be as care 
ful as possible what number I was to engage. Again our retreat was 
very bad no conveniency for crossing the river St. Mary s, we thought 
proper to retreat as fast as possible over St Mary s and there ambuscade 
on the river bank, on the Georgia side, as there we might give them bat 
tle, be their number what they would. We took two negroes and three 
horses from Rains , and retreated. About two miles from there we met 
a party that was detached to join me on coming up with the sign where 
the cattle had crossed the river. Lieutenant Gooden commanded the 
party, fifteen strong, which made the command forty, officers included. 
We then thought we were strong enough for anything on this side St. 
John s, and returned and surrounded Rains houses a second time, but 
there were no appearances of the enemy. We then began to collect 
what intelligence we could. We were informed that one Capt. Jeffres 
had been there that morning, and went off with a party to William 
Mills ; that Colonel William Macintosh s fellow, Osker, was with them. 
Lieut. Gooden and Lieut. Daughty, and a number of the men, knew 
this Jeffres to be a noted tory, and had been among the Cherokee Indians endeavoring to, and did, bring them against us. I was very anxious 
to catch him. We were also informed of one McGuire, belonging to 
the Florida scout, about ten miles off, at one Loughton s, and that in 
all probability Jeffres was there, as it was on the way to Mills . I took 
the men off immediately to Loughton s, and surrounded the house. 
McGuire, who was in the yard, spied us, and ran for the bush, which 
was not above twenty yards from the house very thick. In his flight 
two of my men fired at him, but. I believe with no success. We made 
a strict search in the bushes, but could not find him. Our horses were 
much jaded. Jeffres had not been that way. I was at a loss to think 
what was become of them. Our horses were not able to proceed any 
further, as some of the men then were obliged to walk on foot. We 
remained there that night; put all the men on guard. About break of 
day one of the sentry fired twice. We all ran out, thought the Indians 
and scouts were come up. I ordered the men to possess themselves of 
the houses, and detached a party to know the reason of the guns firing. 
The sentry says he shot at a man that was walking up within ten steps 
of him; he fired first with his pistol, then with his rifle On his firing 
his rifle, the man stumbled very much; he believes he hit him. I 
then thought it could be no one but McGuire, who was endeavoring to 
steal our horses. I sent parties all round the plantation, but they could 
discover no signs of any body there. We were very clever in turning 
out, and to all appearance would have fought bravely. 

SATURDAY, December 28, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 

We got from McGuire a negro boy, who he had taken from Captain 
Anderson, and a mare, saddle and saddle-bags, and his rifle, and some 
of his cloth, and returned. Crossed the river that night. 

SUNDAY, December 29, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 

Proceeded on and joined the main body at Sattillie, and informed 
the colonel of our proceedings. 

MONDAY, December 30, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 

Sergeant Warren informed me that one of my men, George Hall, had 
a fall from his horse, and was dangerously hurt. I went to see him immediately, and believe lie will die. A court-martial was summoned to 
hold and try Levi Coleman and John Bilbo, two soldiers, for sleeping 
on their posts. The court-martial were of opinion that Levi Coleman 
should sit down, and have one gun under his hams, and another over 
his neck, and brought as close together as possible, and tied fast, there 
to remain for the space of ten minutes, and at the expiration of the 
time the upper gun to be fired off the whole detachment to be drawn 
up at the same time. John Bilbo, who had some favorable circum 
stances on his side, was to stand up alongide of Levi Coleman, with a 
gun across his head, and to remain ten minutes. Some of the plunder 
was sold. Ordered that every man be ready to march. We marched 
about six miles that night. 

TUESDAY, December 31, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 

Several horses missing. We were obliged to wait until late in the 
afternoon. There were two sergeants and twenty men left to hunt the 
horses, and to follow. We proceeded as far as Red Cap that night. 

WEDNESDAY, January 1, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>. 
We got to the Bluff, where we were to build the fort that night. 

THURSDAY, January 2, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>. 
Nothing particular. 

FRIDAY, January 3, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>. 

Ordered, that a court-martial be summoned to try Josiah Clark for 
sleeping on his post. The court-martial ordered him to ride the wooden 
horse ten minutes. The colonel thought proper to take off five minutes. 
The major and myself viewed the Bluff, in order to point out a proper 
plan for a stockade. The tools were got in order to begin. 

Ordered, that thirty men be set aside as a guard in the day. The 
whole are to be on duty to guard the workmen and horses that is, 
twenty-two as a guard round the workmen, and eight as a grass guard, 
to go out by turns, and at night fifteen men on duty, who will be re 
lieved the next night by other fifteen. 

That fifteen men, with an officer, be kept as a scouting party con 
tinually. 

That the remainder be kept at work on the stockade, except a sergeant 
and six men, to be sent out occasionally to bring in cattle, or any other 
necessaries that should be wanting, as there is no commissary to supply 
them. 

In case the scout or any other party discover any of the enemy, the 
commanding officer will act as he thinks best for the good of the ser 
vice. 

That John Bilbo act as sergeant to the first company. 

That William Goold and act as sergeants to Capt. 

Cade s company. 

John Gray, one of my troop, arrived express to the colonel, the pur 
port of which was, that there were four men of the third troop killed, 
and the rest had evacuated the fort on Beard s Bluff, saving two men, 
which were all that Lieut. Bug could get to stay with him. These two 
men and himself went to Fort Howe. 

SATURDAY, January 4, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>. 

Lieut. -Colon el Mclntosh, Major Marbury, Capt. Caldwell and Lieut. 
Daughty, left us. Lieut. West, with fifteen men, went as a scouting 
party as far as the Altamaha, and on their return to bring provisions. 
The command now fell upon me, the Colonel and Major being absent. 
We had a great deal of difficulty to get the men to work on the stock 
ade; however, promising them that they and their horses should be 
exempt from guard duty, they went to work. 

SUNDAY, January 5, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>. 

Desired the Adjutant to give James Murphy and John Nepper a 
severe reprimand, for leaving their posts before they were regularly re 
lieved. Some favorable circumstances being on their side, was the rea 
son of their not being regularly tried. 

MONDAY, January 6, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>. 

The men continued on the stockade. The grass guard reported that 
there were many horses missing. Sent men in search of them all day, 
but could not find any. One of Capt. Cade s men, who had his leg 
much hurt, applied for leave to go to Fort Howe for the benefit of his 
leg. Sergeant Bryson applied for leave to go with him. I granted it. 

TUESDAY, January 7, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a> 

Copy of a letter sent to the commanding officer at Fort Howe : 
" Sergeant Bryson has liberty to go to the Altamaha with the man 
who has his leg hurt; he returns to-morrow. I shall be much obliged 
to you to procure a few tools for the stockade, as they are much hindered 
for the want of them ; also, two or three sets of wedges are very much 
wanted, and a cross-cut saw, file, one or two chisels, and some nails. 
Pray send by Sergeant Bryson what he can bring, and send the rest by 
the next opportunity. We get on very well with the stockade, con 
sidering the want of tools. Some axes are also wanted. 

" There are a good many horses missing. I have had men out all 
day yesterday looking for them, but they could not be found. I have 
ordered men out again to-day. 

" Our provisions are out. I hope though before this reaches you, the 
supply will arrive. 

" C. S. M." 

Sent men out in search of the lost horses, but they returned without 
them. 

WEDNESDAY, January 8, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>. 

Sent Lieut. Fitzpatrick and fifteen men to scout up Sattillie as far as 
the Old Ferry, and round by Middletou s, as a reconnoitering party. 
Sent out again for the lost horses, but they were as unfortunate as the 
rest. * * * * * 

THURSDAY, January 9, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>. 

Capt. Donaldson, Lieut. Goodin and seventeen men, set off for Fort 
Howe. 

Copy of a letter wrote to the commanding officer at Fort Howe : 

" Lieut. Beams and his attachment arrived here 7th inst. I was a 
good deal alarmed that they brought no provisions, at least not enough 
to last two meals round to each man. We have here, including Lieut. 
Beams party, near one hundred souls. I sent out Lieut. Fitzpatrick and 
fifteen men yesterday, with orders to scout as far as the Old Ferry, on 
Sattillie, round by Middleton s plantation, to answer two purposes first, 
as a scouting party; second, in hopes they might meet with the lost 
horses. The horses mentioned in my last are not yet found. I hope 
there will be some method fallen upon to supply this place with provi 
sions. The men seem eager to have an opportunity of complaining; 
they are coming to me every moment enquiring what they should eat. 
I have had hunters out since yesterday morning; they have not come 
in yet, so that we are out of beef as well as rice. 

"The hunters are just come, and brought beef, which is some satisfac 
tion. Pray, don t omit sending as much salt as possible, as we shall be 
obliged to keep a good deal of beef salted up, the cattle being very 
hard to get here unless it is breeding cattle. Some chisels are very 
much wanted to finish the fort gate. The horses are very troublesome, 
as they incline much to ramble." 

FRIDAY, January 10, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>. 

Sergeant Cray ton set off without liberty to the Altamaha, and was 
carrying one of the scout men s horses. I stopped him and ordered 
him to stay until I gave him orders, and that if he or any man attempted 
to leave the fort without my permission, should be sent after, and taken 
as a deserter. Several men leaving the place before, without my know 
ledge. In consequence of that I issued these orders. Lieut. Fitzpatrick 
and his party arrived ; had discovered signs of Moccosins, very fresh, 
supposed to have crossed Sattillie about three or four hours, and signs 
of four horses, supposed to be the four that was lost on our march from 
the Old Ferry to the Bluff. There appeared by the signs of the tracks 
to have been about fifteen men. They crossed at Lemmons ferry. 

SATURDAY, January 11, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>. 

Early in the morning I wakened, and was told that Sergeant Crayton 
was gone off with the horse, notwithstanding the particular orders 1 
gave him yesterday to remain here. I thought it such an insult upon 
orders, that I got immediately ready, took Sergeant Bilbo along with 
me, and hurried after him, and overtook him about one mile-and-a-half 
from the fort, brought him back, and had a strong guard put over him, 
for he could be looked upon as no other than a deserter, and in a par 
ticular manner guilty of breach of orders.

F. MARION S ORDERLY BOOK. 

GENERAL ORDERS BY GENERAL HOWE, 

February 14, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>. 

Gen. Howe, with concern and surprise, has observed the frequent 
applications made by gentlemen of the army for leave to resign their 
commissions at this important crisis, when it is difficult to find any 
reason sufficient to excuse men for not endeavoring to get into the ser 
vice. What can possibly exculpate those who desire to forsake it? 
The freedom of America, and all its essential privileges, are at present 
the objects of contest. Compared with these all private interests, how 
ever important, and every darling inclination, attachment and sympathy, 
however endearing and heartfelt, are but futile considerations. The 
present generation, and all the generations of succeeding ages, have 
the strongest claim upon a soldier for every strenuous endeavor and 
utmost effort to preserve and maintain such invaluable rights, and to 
hand them down to posterity unimpaired. Difficulty and distress and 
danger are the mediums through which this purpose is to be effected, 
which every officer must have been sensible of at the time he solicited 
a commission. Local advantages, therefore, and temporary inconve 
nience, are but contemptible pleas for retirement; an opinion of an 
officer s spirit and abilities a belief that he would, by attention to 
duty and by every other means in his power, gain a proper knowledge 
of his profession, with a firm persuasion that he would not forsake the 
service at the very moment he has qualified himself to be useful, must 
have been what induced his country to honor him with a commission, 
which otherwise would undoubtedly have been granted to those who, 
emulous to serve, were probably possessed of equal abilities, and who, 
by greater perseverance, would have continued in the common cause. 
The benefit of that experience they must have obtained, had not the 
interference of those very officers who now wish to resign, deprived 
them of the opportunity. Let, therefore, those officers now solicitous 
of leaving the army, but for one moment consider that by the superior 
confidence placed in them by the country, they were preferred to those 
who would have served it to the last; and let them ask their own hearts, 
if withdrawing from their duty at this critical juncture, is not a poor 
return for the very honorary preference given them ? Let them then 
add to this the noble and animating consideration that they are actors 
upon that glorious stage where every incident is to become an historical 
fact, and the General persuades himself that they will not, by future 
application for leave to resign, reduce him to the painful necessity of 
refusing the requests of gentlemen he respects, or by complying with 
them deprive the army of officers so capable of doing honor to them 
selves, and rendering service to the common cause. This order to be 
transmitted to the commanding officer at Haddrell s Point, Sullivan s 
Island and Fort Johnson, who are to take care that it is made known to 
the officers of their corps. Adjutant Dellient will inform Gen. Gadsden (if in town), Gen. Moultrie, and all the field-officers in town, that 
Gen. Howe would be glad to speak with them at his quarters, at 5 o clock this afternoon. 

May, 4, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>. 

For the day, to-morrow, Captain Potts, Town Guard from tne 5th 
Regiment; Magazine, Fort Perrineau; Brick-house, Lieut. Read; Bar 
racks, a sergeant. 

Gen. Howe approves of the proceedings of the General Court Martial 
lately held at Fort Moultrie, which he ratifies accordingly, with this 
only exception that the punishment to which Robt. Cunningham was 
sentenced is remitted, in respect to the court, as they recommended 
him to mercy; the judgment of the court to the other prisoners may 
be carried into execution at such time and in such a manner as the 
commanding officer for the time being shall direct ; or is impowered if 
he thinks proper to pardon the criminals, provided they agree to enlist 
for the war. Adjutant Delliant is to transmit this order to Fort Moultrie. 

May 15, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>. 

For the day, to-morrow, Capt. Cogdell, Town Guard, Lieut. Mazyck; 
for the Magazine, Lieut. P. Gray; Brick-house, from the 5th Regiment ; Barracks, a sergeant. 

Gen. Moultrie is requested to appoint some officer of his Brigade to 
take an exact list of the prisoners of war in town and to make a report 
thereof at Head-Quarters. 

The four following French vessels having come to this State under 
particular circumstances, viz : the Union, Capt. Laroach ; the Marquis 
de la Chaletac, Capt. Poligny ; the Thunder, Capt. Aldirron ; the An 
drea, Capt. Corronant ; the men of these vessels are not upon any ac 
count whatever to be enlisted in the Continental Battalions, and if any 
of their men have been enlisted, the commanding officers of those Bat 
talions into which they have entered are immediately to discharge them 
from the service, and have them safely conveyed to the officer of the 
main guard in <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a>, who is to have them taken care of and de 
livered, when demanded, to the master of the vessel to which they be 
long; the Adjutant is to transmit this order immediately to the out 
posts. 

The honorable the Continental Congress, having entered into the fol 
lowing resolutions relative to some of the articles of war, Commanding 
Officers of Brigade and of Battalions not formed into Brigades are im 
mediately to have them published to the army that none may plead 
ignorance thereof; this order is also to be transmitted to the outposts. 

IN CONGRESS, April 14th, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>. 

Resolved, That from and after the publication hereof the 2nd Article 
of the 8th Section, the 1st Article of the llth Section, the 8th Article

" Rules and Articles for the better Government of the Troops, raised or 
to be raised and kept in pay by and at the expense of the United States 
of America," passed in Congress the 28th September, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>, shall be, 
and they are hereby repealed, and that the four following articles be 
substituted in the place and stead thereof : 

ARTICLE IST. All officers and soldiers shall have full liberty to 
bring into the forts or garrisons of the United American States any 
quantity of eatable provisions, except where any contracts shall be 
entered into by Congress, or by their orders, for furnishing such provi 
sions so contracted for. 

ARTICLE 2D. If any officer shall find himself to be wronged by his 
colonel or commanding-officer of the regiment, and shall, upon due ap 
plication made to him, be refused to be redressed, he may complain to 
the Continental General commanding in the State where such regiments 
shall be stationed, in order to obtain justice, who is hereby required to 
examine into the said complaint, and take proper measures for redres 
sing the wrongs complained of, and transmit as soon as possible to Congress a true statement of such complaint, with the proceeding had 
thereon. 

ARTICLE 3c. No sentence of a general court-martial shall be put 
in execution till after a report shall be made of the whole proceeding

and there on his order being issued for carrying such sentence into 
execution. 

ARTICLE 4iH. The Continental General commanding in either of

pointing general court-martial to be held, and of pardoning or mitigating any of the punishment ordered to be inflicted for any of the offences

government of the troops, except the punishment of offenders under 
the sentence of death by a general court-martial, which he may order 
to be suspended until the pleasure of Congress can be known, which 
suspension, with the proceedings of the court-martial, the said General 
will immediately transmit to Congress for their determination, and every 
offender convicted by any regimental court-martial may be pardoned, or 
have his punishment mitigated by the colonel or officer commanding 
the regiment. 

May 24, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>. 
Lieut. Thomas Shubrick is appointed Brigade-Major to Gen. Howe till the pleasure of the honorable the Continental Congress be known ; he is to be respected and obeyed as such. 

June 10, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>. 

For the day, to-morrow, Capt. Conyers; town-guard, subaltern from 5th 
regiment; magazine, Lieut. Hort; brick-house, Lieut. Henry Grey. 

The General having considered the proceedings of the general courtmartial, lately held for the trial of Lieut. Raphel of the artillery, 
charged by Capt. De Treville for having ungenteelly and falsely aspersed 
his character in a manner unbecoming a gentleman and an officer, and 
for the trial of a number of prisoners of different corps for desertion, 
and other crimes, find that the sentence against Lieut. Raphel thus : 
That he was no wise criminal, but rather indelicate ; the court, there 
fore, find him not guilty. Lieut. Raphel, in consequence of his acquit 
tal, will do duty as usual. The General, however, thinks it incumbent 
on him, for the sake of service, to observe that indelicacy in the con 
duct of one officer to another in a profession so pure as that of a sol 
dier, ought upon every occasion to be avoided as inconsistent with that 
nicety of honor which gives dignity to the character. The General 
thinks proper to suspend his determination till a further day upon those 
sentences which inflict capital punishment. All those inflicting corporal 
punishments he approves of and ratifies. The sentence respecting those 
criminals belonging to the corps in town will be carried into execution 
at such times and in such manner as the commanding officer of those 
corps shall think proper. Those under sentence belonging to outposts 
are to receive their punishment at those posts in the manner and at the 
time the commanding officer there shall direct, who are to order proper 
persons to receive the criminals of their several corps from the officer 
of the main-guard, and convey them safely to the place of punishment. 

The commanding officers of the main-guard for the time being are 
in the most particular manner enjoined to be careful of Robert Potts, 
of the second regiment, and John Cooker, of the first an escape of 
either of those prisoners will be considered as an unpardonable neglect 
of duty. The Adjutant-General will transmit a copy of these orders 
to the outposts, with a copy of the sentence of the general court-martial relative to the criminals of each corps. 

June 19, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>. 

For the day, to-morrow, Capt. Lesesne; town-guard, from the 5th 
regiment; magazine, Lieut. Shubrick; brick-house. Dr. Burke. 
The General, with surprise and displeasure, has observed the slovenly, 
indecent and dirty state in which the soldiers have of late, upon almost 
every occasion appeared, inconsistent to their health, disgraceful to the 
army, censurable at all times, and, when upon duty, absolutely unpardon 
able. He laments the inattention of officers of companies to their men, 
to which this degeneracy must in a great measure have been owing, 
and which it was their absolute duty, as much as possible, to have pre 
vented. They cannot surely suppose that their whole duty consists in 
appearing at, and that it ends in, parade, or that their reputation is not 
concerned in the appearance of their men. If, however, they do, it 
behoves them to adopt ideas more consistent with their own credit, and 
the good of the service. The uncombed, unshaved and dirty condition 
of many soldiers, even upon duty the rusty, improper condition of 
their arms, and degeneracy in other particulars of late, too discernible, 
denote past inattention, and will, if not corrected in future, be deemed 
and treated as disobedience of orders. The relief of sentries sent from 
guard, even to the President s door, and head-quarters, come up with 
flapped hats, bare legs, long beards and uncombed hair; in short, in a 
manner so shamefully dirty and indecent, that officers of guard permit 
ting it may, with too much appearance of justice, be accused of inattention and neglect. The General hopes that reformation will follow 
reprehension in all persons, and every department, where requisite; 
the soldiers will, therefore, take care to appear at all times, but particularly for duty, in a manner as decent as the situation of things will per 
mit; and all adjutants are warned against receiving them, and all officers 
of relief against marching them off, till that is the case. It is painful 
to the General to have occasion to remonstrate against any impropriety 
in the conduct of officers and men he has the honor of commanding. 
He wishes them to be assured that he never has, or never shall do it, 
but where duty exacts it of him, and that he has never served with any 
officers or men in his more respectable than those he is now with.

GENERAL ORDER BY GENERAL WASHINGTON. 

HEAD-QUARTERS, Morristown, May 8. 

As few vices are attended with more pernicious consequence in 
civil life, so there are none more fatal in a military one than that of 
gaming, which often brings disgrace and ruin upon officers, and injury 
and punishment upon soldiers; and reports prevailing, which it is to be 
feared are too well founded, that this destructive vice has spread its 
baneful influence in the army, and in a peculiar manner to the preju 
dice of the recruiting service. The Commander-in-chief, in the most 
pointed and explicit terms, forbids all officers and soldiers playing at 
cards, dice, or at any game except those of exercise for diversion, it 
being impossible, if the practice be allowed at all, to discriminate between 
innocent play for amusement and criminal gaming for pecuniary and 
sordid purposes. Officers alive to their duty will find abundant employment in training and disciplining their men, providing for them, and 
seeing that they appear clean, neat and soldier-like; nor will anything 
redound more to their honor, afford them more solid amusement, or 
better answer the end of their appointment, than to devote the vacant 
moments they may have to the study of military authors. The com 
manding officer of every corps is strictly enjoined to have their orders 
frequently read, and strongly impressed upon the mind of those under 
his command. Any officer or soldier, or other persons belonging to or 
following the army, either in camp or quarters, or the recruiting ser 
vice, or elsewhere presuming, under any pretence, to disobey this order, 
shall be tried by a general court-martial. The general officers in each 
division of the army to pay the strictest attention to the execution 
thereof. The Adjutant-General is to transmit copies of this order to 
the different departments of the army; also, to cause the same to be 
immediately published in the Gazette of each State, for the information of officers dispersed in the recruiting service. 
" By his Excellency s command, 

" MORGAN CONNERS, A. G.

REGIMENTAL ORDERS, LIEUT. -CoL. MARION. 

All the officers off duty to be on the parade to-morrow afternoon, at 
usual time of exercise, to ballot for a , to fill up one of the vacancies of the regiment. 

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

January 8, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>. 

For the fort-guard, to-morrow, Capt. Ashby and Lieuts. Galvan and 
Capers; rear-guard, a sergeant. 

No person whatever to do their occasion within the fort, or within 
twenty yards of the walls on the outside; no bones or other filth or 
litter whatever to be thrown in the fort ; all persons who disobey this 
order may expect to be severely punished. Commanding officers of 
companies to order two men and a sergeant or corporal, as fatigue men 
to their companies, who are to clean daily all filth which may be about 
their barracks, and to do other company duties. It is expected that 
officers will visit their men s quarters daily, and see that orders are 
complied with. 

The officer who reads roll-call morning and evening is not only to 
call the men s names over, but to see they have their arms and accoutre 
ments, and in what order. Whenever they find a man without any 
part of his arms and accoutrements, they are immediately to confine 
him and bring him to a court-martial; otherwise, they will be liable for 
losses, and will certainly be called upon for payment. 

That every officer may have it in turn to go to town, or be absent 
from garrison, the Lieut. -Colonel desires the to observe that 

no more than- three captains to begin from the eldest in rank, if he 
should not choose to go the next may have the right and two men of 
a company to have leave of absence at one time. This is not meant to 
include those men who obtain furloughs, but those only who may go to 
town. 

As the regiment, by being in town too long, have lost a great part 
of their discipline, and it is necessary to reform all abuses and neglect 
of discipline, the Lieut. -Colonel calls upon every gentlemen in the 
regiment to aid and assist him to bring the regiment to true and exact 
discipline, that they may regain their former credit, and be an honor to 
themselves and their country. He promises on his part that he will 
exert his utmost to so good a purpose, and will think no pains or trouble 
too great to effect it, but must sink under the burthen without the 
assistance of the rest of the officers. A little perseverance, with attention to all parts of duty, will soon bring them to what we could wish, 
and make them equal to the best troops in the State, or in any of the 
United States of America. He begs leave to observe a few regulations 
necessary for each company; that besides the orderly-book for each 
officer, one ought to be provided for the company, in which the orderlysergeant for the day should enter the orders as soon as they come out, 
and carry the book to all the officers of his company (and not to 
have it on a scrap of paper, which through negligence or laziness may 
be lost), by which means the sergeant will know all orders, as they may 
have full access to it. All the men for duty or parade to draw up 
before their own barracks, there to be examined by the sergeants, and, 
when ready, to be examined by their officer. Though men may not be 
completed with clothes, yet such as they have should be put on to the 
best advantage; their hair combed, their face and hands made clean. 
The orderly-sergeant may be the one who is ordered for fatigue, and 
should see the men receive their provisions, and properly distributed to 
each mess; all the men to be in messes of six, and not less than five; 
to visit the men at meal time, and see if their victuals are well-cooked; 
to visit the sick and report everything which may happen during the 
day, to the commanding officer of the company. Whenever any part 
of duty is neglected, or done in a slovenly manner, though ever so 
minute, it tends to destroy discipline entirely; that it is necessary never 
to overlook any part whatever; many small crimes may be committed, 
which would be best punished in the company by various ways much 
better, and with greater effect, than bringing them to a court-martial. 
One corporal and six men, with twelve rounds per man, for the advanceguard to-morrow, who will receive orders as soon as they are ready to 
march ; this guard to be relieved weekly. An officer of the guard in 
garrison to visit the sentries at night, once between each relief, and to 
send a subaltern to visit the rear-guard, and a sergeant to patrol within 
the fort every half hour during the night. The sergeant of the rear 
guard to visit his sentries between each relief during the night; when 
he goes his rounds to leave the corporal the charge of his guard till ht 
returns. 

" ORDERS TO THE SERGEANT OF THE REAR-GUARD. 

" SIR, You are to stop and bring to all vessels, boats or canoes, 

which may attempt passing the bridge, either up or down, and send the 

principal person with your corporal to the captain of the fort-guard; 

and you are to examine all such vessel or boat, and give an account of what she may have have on board, particularly all such who may come 
from town, and detain them until you have orders to the contrary. 
You are not to let any boats land near your guard, without examining 
them, without there should be an officer belonging to the Continental 
forces of the United States of America, or the President of this State, 
or any of his council. You are to make a report of anything which 
may happen, to the captain of the fort-guard; you are to give orders to 
the sentry on the bridge not to let any soldier go over it in the day 
time without a permit from some officer, nor suffer any person to pass 
after retreat beating, without such a pass. This order to be given to 
the relieving sergeant, and to be continued till further orders." 

January 23, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>. 

For the fort-guard, to-mcrrow, Capt. Dunbar, Lieuts. Burke and 
Guerryj rear-guard, Sergeant Keels. 

As long hair gathers much filth, and takes a great deal of time and 
trouble to comb and keep clean and in good order, the Lieut-Colonel 
recommends to every soldier to have their hair cut short, to reach no 
further down than the top of the shirt-collar, and thinned upwards to 
the crown of the head, the fore-top short, without toupee, and short at 
the side. Those who do not have their hair in this mode, must have 
it plaited and tied up, as they will not be allowed to appear with their 
hair down their backs and over their foreheads, and down their chins at 
the sides, which make them appear more like wild savages than soldiers. 
The major will please pick out three men to be regimental barbers, who 
are to be excused from mounting guard, or doing fatigue duty. They 
are daily to dress the men s heads, and shave them, before they mount 
guard the men to pay them half-a-crown a week each man. Any sol 
dier who comes on the parade with beards, or hair uncombed, shall be 
dry-shaved immediately, and have his hair dressed on the parade. The 
orderly-sergeant, or corporal of companies, are to call on and see the 
barber dress and shave their men that are for duty, and see that they 
aje clean, and their clothes put on decently, or must expect to answer 
for the neglect. 

The commissioned officers are desired to pay attention to their men s 
dress at all times, particularly when for duty. 

No officer to take charge or march off a guard without the men have 
complied with the above orders, and are as clean and decent as circum 
stances of clothing will permit. 

No person to sell ajiy spirituous liquors or beer without leave from 
the commanding officer of the regiment; but may sell candles, soap, or 
all kinds of eatables. 

The sutler, Mr. Young, has leave to sell one gill rum and one quart 
beer per man a day, and no more, without a written permit from an 
officer of the company the man belongs to. He is not to let, have or 
sell, any liquors before the guard is relieved, or after retreat beating. 

Any persons who cut, lop, or bark any trees on this island, must expect to suffer agreeably to a former order. 

It is expected the guards will pay the usual compliments to all field 
officers of the regiment, as well as to the commanding officer. 

No officer to go to Haddrell s Point, or off this island, without leave 
from the commanding officer; and all officers to see the orders of the 
day before they go any distance from the fort. Sergeant Newton, of 
Capt. Harleston s company, to do duty in Capt. Motte s till Sergeant 
Laurence returns from command. 

A court-martial to sit this morning at 11 o clock, to try all prisoners 
brought before them; all evidences to attend Capt. Moultrie, Presi 
dent; Capt. Dunbar, Lieuts. Guerry, Burke and Hart, members. 

One sergeant and three privates to be added to the advance-guard 
immediately, and to follow such orders as he will receive from the cor 
poral he will relieve. He is to post one sentry by day, and three at 
night. James Campbell, of Capt. Ashby s company, Timothy Green, 
of Capt. Chamock s, and David Stewart, of Ashby, are appointed barbers to the regiments. 

Match 13, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>. 

For the fort-guard, to-morrow, Capt. Motte, Lieuts. Grey and Roux; 
rear-guard, Sergeant Coleman.

peace, and plenty abounding in, and smiling on, the countenance of 
every individual therein.

Extract of the minutes. 

CHAS, THOMPSON, Sec, 



EAST FLORIDA. 

The following intelligence and letter were brought from St. Augus 
tine by a Georgia gentleman who had been detained at St. Augustine 
for some time. The President laid them before the Council March 11, 
<a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>, and also the Proclamation of Tonyn s, dated Feb. 10, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a> : 

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

His excellency the Governor having received the following intelligence desires the same may be made public. 

NEW YORK, December 19, <a href='/results.php?year=1776'>1776</a>. 

Since the success of his Majesty s forces on Long Island, Gen. Howe 
has made very considerable progress, and has never yet met with a 
check, the rebels make no stand ; their strong posts at and near King s 
Bridge were relinquished the moment they were attacked. Fort Wash 
ington, which they deemed impregnable, surrendered with all its stores, 
cannon, &c., and above 2,500 prisoners, among whom were some of 
their best troops, if any of them with propriety can be called good. 

A detachment of the army under Lord Cornwallis after the surrender of Fort <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> crossed the Hudson River and easily took pos 
session of Forts Lee and Constitution, which are situated directly opposite to Fort <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>, the garrison retreating with usual precipitation, 
and Gen. <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>, collecting as well as he could such of his scattered 
forces as were in the Jerseys, took post at Brunswick, from whence, 
however, he retreated on the approach of Lord Cornwallis, and was soon 
after forced through that Province, and over the Delaware. Philadel 
phia had not any security left, but the passage of this river, which, from 
the want of boats, was found impracticable, and the season too far advanced to construct other means of crossing it. 

It is computed that the rebels have lost about 25,000 men in the 
course of this campaign. The success of his Majesty s arms induced 
their Excellencies the Commissioners, in order to spare the effusion of 
more blood, to publish their proclamation of the 30th of November, of 
which a considerable number in the provinces of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, Pennsyl 
vania, Connecticut, Rhode Island and the Jerseys, have already availed 
themselves, and many others of real property, are making this sub 
mission. 

NEW YORK, Jan. 14, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>. 

The king s troops were lodged in cantonment about the middle of 
December. The enemy getting once more in force, took advantage of 
this situation, and met with some success against three Hessian bat 
talions at <a href='/results.php?city=trenton' rel='city'>Trenton</a>, who withdrew from that post with the loss of 
between 400 and 500 men. 

A very considerable number of prisoners have fallen into our hands 
during the campaign among others, Gen. Lee. Col. Harcourt, with 
a small party of light dragoons, surprised him and his party, and 
brought him off. 

Lieut.-Gen. Clinton was detached with a corps the beginning of 
December to Rhode Island, and took possession of that important place 
on the 8th of the said month, without the least resistance. Every thingis quiet here, and the harbor well blocked up, to prevent any of the 
rebel vessels escaping. 

Sir Guy Castleton has driven the rebels entirely out of Canada, con 
structed a naval force on Lake Champlain, with which he totally de
stroyed that of the enemy, and proceeded with his army to Crown 
Point; but the season being too far advanced, he retired to winter quarters in Canada. 

By command of his Excellency, 

(Signed) DAVID YEATS, Sec.

FORM OF THE REMONSTRANCE AND PETITION OF THE INHABITANTS OF IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA. 

[Original MS.J 

To the Honorable the of Georgia : 

HUMBLY SHEWETH : That, whereas it is the undoubted right of the 
people to remonstrate to their representatives against such public mea 
sures done or pursued, as may be thought by the people to be prejudi 
cial to the public interest ; and to petition for such measures as may be 
thought likely to promote their welfare, so, at this juncture, we respect 
fully desire your attention to this our remonstrance and petition. 

It is with the deepest concern that we have beheld the progress of 
public measures in this State ; because those measures have progressed 
without placing the government upon a respectable footing, or the con 
ducting of it into hands in which we can confide ; for, while South Car 
olina, long since has enjoyed the blessings of regular government lodged 
in the most respectable hands in the State ; her ports, by the wisdom of 
her administration, filled with shipping; her manufactures encouraged 
and increased ; her people supplied with foreign goods even directly from 
Europe, and vent provided for almost the whole of her produce ; Georgia 
having had as much time as South Carolina, and better opportunity, 
seeing our attention has never been called off to defend our government 
against civil insurrections, to have procured, yet possesses no such ad 
vantages ; ever has been and is distracted by dissentions among those 
in authority; and is in a manner destitute of trade and commerce. 

We have seen Continental money sent hither for Continental pur 
poses, particularly for the payment of the troops, diverted from such 
services and withheld after repeated applications from General Mclntosh 
for payment of the troops, even while the enemy attacked our Southern 
frontier in January last ; whereby the troops, having great arrears due, 
were wantonly made dissatisfied and driven to a disobedience of orders, 
and to desertion, to the great prejudice of the service and the danger of 
the State. 

We have seen the public treasure squandered by the passing by a 
bare majority, in a thin convention, extravagant and unjust accounts for 
public services and pretended services; to the great encouragement of 
even bare-faced frauds and impositions upon the public. 

We are alarmed with well-authenticated informations, that no less a 
sum than about 7,000 sterling of public money, has been misapplied ; 

for which, no account can be given; and about which, as far as we can 
learn, no proper inquiry has even been made. 

"We have lately, to our astonishment seen a resolution of the last 
Convention to raise 15 battalions of 500 men each, as minute-men ; al 
though by a report to the Convention in June last, it appeared that all 
the effective male inhabitants in Georgia, did not amount to 2,000 
men. 

Finally, it is with the deepest concern, set from the strongest conviction we add, that inasmuch as the public affairs have been for so long a 
time as we have experienced, so destructively conducted ; we are of 
opinion that, that which has been the cause thereof, is but too likely to 
continue the same effects, unless the most effectual remedy be applied. 

To which end, at this, the first meeting of this honorable 7 

we have thought it our duty to lay these things before you, our repre 
sentatives, chosen for the sole purpose of promoting the real happiness 
of the people ; and, at the same time, respectfully to point out that 
public conduct, which we think will tend most effectually to remove 
our fears ; relieve our distresses ; advance our prosperity ; increase our 
strength ; secure our liberties ; and insure our safety. Inestimable ob 
jects, and which we are confident may be procured by an union with 
South Carolina, whose just overtures upon that subject, were hastily 
and unadvisedly rejected by the late convention. 

Wherefore, as we do most ardently desire such an union, we do 
humbly and most earnestly petition that you will be pleased to take such 
measures as may be best calculated to accomplish, as speedily as may be, 
an union of South Carolina and Georgia under one government. 

And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray, &c. 

Done this day of <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>.

FORM OF THE ADDRESS AND PETITION OF THE INHABITANTS OF IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA. 

To the honorable the General Assembly of South Carolina : 

HUMBLY SHEWETH : That being impressed with a just sense of the 
good consequences, that would result from an union between South Car 
olina and Georgia, under one government, we beg leave to present to 
you our thanks for your invitation to the Legislature of this State to 
treat of an union, and to lament that it was by them rejected, and that 
in such a manner, as to deprive your commissioners even of an opportunity to answer those matters that were objected. 

Convinced that nature and good policy dictate, that South Carolina 
and Georgia ought to be united so as to form but one State, we have 
presented a remonstrance and petition to our new house of Legislature 
respecting this subject, a copy whereof is hereunto annexed, and we do 
humbly petition, that you will be pleased to resume your deliberations 
upon the subject of such an union, that by God s blessing, South Caro 
lina and Georgia may be united into one State and ruled under one 
common government, and, as in duty bound, we shall ever pray, &c. 
Done this day of <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>. 

PROCLAMATION BY HIS HONOR JOHN ADAM TREUTLEN, ESQ., 
CAPTAIN-GENERAL, GOVERNOR AND COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, IN 
AND OVER THE STATE OF GEORGIA. 

[Original Circular.] 

Whereas, it hath been represented unto me, that William Henry 
Drayton, Esq., of the State of South Carolina, and divers other per 
sons, whose names are yet unknown, are unlawfully endeavoring to 
poison the minds of the good people of this State against the Government thereof, and for that purpose are by letters, petitions and other 
wise, daily exciting animosities among the inhabitants, under thepretence of redressing imaginary grievances, which by the said William 
Henry Drayton it is said this State labors under, the better to effect, 
under such specious pretences, an union between the States of Georgia 
and South Carolina; all which are contrary to the Articles of Confede 
ration entered into, ratified and confirmed by this State as a cement of 
union between the same and the other United and Independent States 
of America, and also against the resolution of the Convention of this 
State, in that case made and entered into : Therefore, that such per 
nicious practices may be put an end to, and which, if not in due time 
prevented, may be of the most dangerous consequences, I have, by and 
with the advice and consent of the Executive Council of this State, 
thought fit to issue this proclamation, hereby offering a reward of one 
hundred pounds, lawful money of tjie said State, to be paid to any 
person or persons who shall apprehend the said William Henry Drayton, 
or any other person or persons aiding and abetting him in such unlaw 
ful practices, upon his or their conviction; and I do hereby strictly 

charge and require all magistrates, and other persons, to be vigilant 
and active in suppressing the same, and to take all lawful ways and 
means for the discovering and apprehending of such offender or offenders, so that he or they may be brought to condign punishment. 

Given under my hand and seal, in the Council- Chamber, at Savannah, this fifteenth day of July, one thousand seven hundred and seventy seven. 

JOHN ADAM TREUTLEN. 
By his Honor s command, 

JAMES WHITEFIELD, Secretary.

Bra i 

As the multiplicity of public business absolutely prevents my being 
able to attend at Ninety-Six as a juror, I enclose for your Honor s 
perusal, a letter received from Gee. Galphin, Esq., on Friday; as, also, 
copies of the talks he last received from the Creeks. He mentions in 
case the Congress he intends holding with the Creeks takes place about 
the time appointed for the Cherokees to come to Dewitt s Corner, that 
he and Col. Hammond must attend as Commissioners from this State 
at the Congress with the Creeks, by which means we shall fall short two 
out of the number appointed from this State to treat with the Chero 
kees, which may prove a disadvantage, in case the others do not attend. 

Col. Mason informs me that he came up with an intention to recruit 
for the 3d regiment, and that many of the prisoners have promised to 
enlist with Capt. Hopkins, of the 3d regiment, who I have now ordered 
on a part of duty which he cannot have effected before Wednesday 
next. In this case he may be disappointed, if the prisoners are tried 
and discharged before his return. I promised Col. Mason that I would 
mention this matter to your Honor, and request you will postpone such 
persons trial till near the last of the sitting of the court, by which 
period Hopkins will be at Ninety-Six. 

I last night received a letter from Capt. Tutt, wherein he informs me 
that some Indians had carried off six horses belonging to the volunteer 
companies, who were arrived a few days before to reinforce Fort Rutledge, and that he had dispatched Capt. Rainey, with thirty men, to 
take their track, and endeavor to come up with them, which he thought 
he would be able to effect, and take satisfaction of them. I apprehend 
this robbery is done by some of the disaffected Indians who lately lived 

at Seneca; and if Capt. Rainey comes up with them, it may be a lucky 
circumstance, and prevent them attempting carrying off the horses in 
future. When court is over I expect to have the pleasure of your com 
pany at Whitehall. 

It is his Excellency the President s express orders that Conner, who 
enlisted and afterwards run away to the Cherokee Nation, as also P. 
Hawkins, Robertson or any other prisoners who are committed to 
Ninety-Six gaol for seditious practices against the State, should be sent 
to Charlestown, together with those now under sentence of death in 
Ninety-Six goal. When you have perused the papers you will please 
return them. 

I am, sir, your most humble servant, 

A. WM.SON.

DEAR SIR : 

I am ordered by his Excellency, the President, to send down to 
Charlestown immediately, under a strong guard, all the prisoners in 
Ninety-Six gaol, who are convicted on the Sedition Act, and are under 
sentence of death, together with the seditious persons lately committed, 
and the charges against them on oath. As I apprehend before the re 
moval of these last it is necessary to obtain a writ of habeas corpus, I 
inform your Honor thereof, in order that the needful may be immediately done, as I intend Capt. Hopkins, who escorts them to Charlestown, shall set off on Saturday morning next. 

I am, with great respect, dear sir, your most humble servant,

EXTRACT OF A LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT FROM H. LAURENS, 

September 10, <a href='/results.php?year=1777'>1777</a>. 

A QUESTION IN CONGRESS TO BORROW MONEY OF FRANCE. 
First question to draw bills on the Commissioners for ten millions of 
dollars, passed in the negative, as did a second for five millions; but 
on the 9th September a question was put and carried, for drawing bills 
on our Commissioners at the rate of five livres of France for a Spanish 
dollar, for payment of interest at six per cent, per annum, of all money 
already brought into the loan-office, or that shall be brought in before 
the 1st of March. 

It is expected that upon this encouragement money-holders will bring 
supplies into the loan-office, and that we may, without another emission 
of paper, raise before the 1st of March twenty millions of dollars, the 
annual interest of which will be about 270,000 sterling, besides the 
risks of loss and delay by remittances. 

It is true the Commissioners have given Congress assurances of 
money received and promised, sufficient to pay the interest of five mil 
lions of dollars annually, and added, " we hope" to find sufficient by 
subsidies to pay the interest of twenty millions, if we should be obliged 
to borrow that sum. At the same time they inform us, that upon 
application to the Court of France to borrow two millions sterling, they 
were told it was "impossible" to spare such a sum; that they had been 
strongly pressed, and that the minister was " anxious" to contract for 
the delivery of 20,000 hhds. of tobacco, as a ground for raising money 
by taxes; that they had actually engaged to deliver 4,000, and had 
received a very considerable advance on the stipulation, and earnestly 
a entreat" Congress to enable them to comply with their part of the 
agreement, which, while our ports are stopped, will be impossible. 

It appears to me that the foundation of drawing bills is not substan 
tial, the practice dangerous, and the measure, except for articles abso 
lutely necessary for carrying on our defensive war, not necessary. 

The Commissioners speak positively of money advanced, and expected by periodical payment only, for payment of the interest of five 
millions which sum, and a much larger, I apprehend, will be consumed 
by a variety of other demands on them, which it is impossible for our 
mode of transacting business, and our total ignorance of the public 
debt contracted and increasing, to form an estimate of. This forbids, 
in the strongest terms, the act of borrowing more money abroad. They 
say in a subsequent dispatch, that we may rely on punctual payment of 
Congress bills, drawn for the discharge of the interest of sums bor 
rowed, but refer, I apprehend, only to the five millions per annum; and 
then they recommend that the interest should be reduced to five and 
four per cent. but Congress, upon a question, confirmed six per cent, 
against five, and have put former loans upon a level with such as may 
be hereafter made. 

The Court of France, on failure of our part of the contract for 

tobacco, our continued demands on them for money, for ship-building, 
cloths, arms, and many other articles, will have ground for complaint, 
and may make a pretext of failure on our side for withholding further 
payments to the Commissioners. 

The drawing bills of exchange is to all intents and purposes emis 
sions of paper money upon the very worst terms, aggravated by six per 
cent, per annum. It is putting our debt out of sight for a little time, 
but it will infallibly return upon us with accumulated force. 

Although France has peremptorily told us it is impossible to lend us 
two millions sterling, we are hastening to make a demand for that, and 
for aught we know, a much larger sum. 

We should pay proper regard to the conduct of the Court of Ver 
sailles, in refusing to receive our Commissioners openly in their ambas 
sadorial characters in " avoiding every act which should seem to 
acknowledge our independence 77 in "refusing, positively/ 7 the naval 
aid which we had applied for in neglecting to consider or give any 
answer to our plan for a treaty, and in betraying part of our proposals, 
and possibly the whole of them, to the British Ambassador in a 
taunting, sarcastical remark to one of our Commissioners, that we had 
not bid high enough- in imprisoning one of our captains, seizing his 
vessel, ordering a restitution of his prizes, and, in a word, in carefully 
avoiding to give "umbrage 77 to the English. 

To borrow money from a foreign power, is to mortgage our soil; that 
the boasted generosity of the King of France, in feeding us lightly, 
and demanding no security, is, when compared with the conduct abovementioned, liable to suspicion of being insidious. It will be the in 
terest of the French minister to ensnare us by degrees into a considerable 
debt, and the knowledge of the negociation will be a strong incentive 
to the British for protracting the war. 

That by altering the tenor of our loan certificates, making the payment of capital at one instead of three years, and of interest quarterly 
or half-yearly, money-holders would be induced to bring supplies into 
the office; that the expectation which the public have been held in, of 
an emission of bills of exchange for five or ten millions of dollars, had 
been no small impediment to the loan. 

When the loan-office certificates are put on a beneficial plan, if money 
shall not be brought in sums equal t t o the public exigency, it will be a 
proof that past emissions are not excessive. The demand for money at 
this time is not confined to the capital towns and cities within a small 
circle of trading merchants, but spread over a surface of 1,600 miles in. 
4) 

length, and 800 broad; nor is it now the practice to give credit for one 
and more years for seven-eighths of the whole traffic. Every man is 
now a money-holder, and every article is paid for in cash it is hence 
obvious, that an immense sum is necessary for a complete circulation. 
No man would be so void of understanding as to keep Continental bills 
idle, and at a risk of loss in his desk, when he might, upon the same 
security, improve them at six per cent, per annum. 

The sudden rise of price for domestic necessaries of life, is not 
wholly owing to great emissions of paper, but, in fact, principally to 
the total stoppage of imports, and the consequent scarceness and dearness of such articles as our real wants cannot, and too many which our 
luxury will not, forego. 

Borrowing of a foreign power will not increase the value of our 
paper money; it may, and probably will, be the source of extending 
the depreciation to several years beyond the term when we might, if 
we were in debt at home only, have redeemed it. 

Such and many other arguments I used upon this occasion, particularly recommending taxation, and the most vigorous exertions for opening our ports, and promoting exportation. The question being put, 
and the yeas and nays demanded, there appeared 21 yeas, and 5 Col. 
Harrison, Mr. Jno. Adams, W. Duane, W. Middleton and Mr. Laurens 
nays. "The enemies very near each other, and within thirty miles 
of this city" (<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>).

SIR: 

I have just received information that the Indians have carried away 
Thos. Stevenson and his family, and three others that were there, and 
robbed his house. They were tracked some distance, and seemed to 
bear up the other side of Barker s Creek. This conduct seems unusual, 
but from the signs it appears that there are Indians in company. I ani 
also informed that on yesterday there were several guns heard from the 
Corner. The alarm is sufficient to direct you how to proceed. Please

\ A. WM.SON TO COL. ROBERT GOODWYN. 

WHITE HALL, November 28, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>. 

DEAR SIR : 

My having been continually employed in Georgia since the Southern 
expedition, prevented me being able before this period to attend to 
and examine and adjust the expenses arising from that service. I 
would therefore request you will, as soon after the receipt of this letter 
as you possibly can, furnish me with the pay-bills and amounts of your 
detachment employed in that service, in order that I may examine 
and adjust them, and be able to take the proper and necessary steps to 
obtain payment for the people for their good services. Some information I have just received makes me apprehensive that the disaffected 
meant again to collect, and join the enemy, who are said to have landed 
on this side the Altarnaha, to the amount of 800, and penetrated into 
the lower parts of Georgia. You will perceive from this intelligence 
how cautious we should be to guard against our internal enemies, who, 
during this struggle, have demonstrated themselves the most cruel and 
rancorous enemies. McGirt, it is said, landed in Georgia at the same 
time, but has taken his course higher up the country; no doubt but he 
will endeavor to visit his old range. I wish you may be fortunate 
enough (if he comes your way) to secure him, or give him. a proper 
dose, to prevent his inroads in future. 

I am, with great regard, dear sir, your most obdt. servant, 

A. WM.SON,

not to stay there more than three days before you set out from which

him. All reasonable expenses will be paid for bringing recruits to 
Head-Quarters.

INTRODUCTION OF THE MINISTER TO A FREE CONFERENCE IN A COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE CONGRESS. 

MONDAY, February 15, <a href='/results.php?year=1779'>1779</a>. 

He informed the Committee that his master, actuated by the most 
friendly regard to the United States, had ordered him to acquaint them 
that a great revolution had taken place in Great Britain respecting the 
question of their independence ; that there had been a great party in 
the Cabinet Council of that nation in favor of that independence ; that 
they were willing to grant that independence with certain conditions; 
that those conditions were somewhat similar to those proposed by the 
late commissioners ; that they principally respected a kind of Federal 
Union, such as that the United States should assist Great Britain in 
her wars ; that, however, this measure had been laid aside, the Cabinet 
being impressed with the representation of the Commissioners that 
divisions prevailed among the members in Congress, and between the 
Congress and some of the States; that by the operations of the Com 
missioners a foundation was laid upon which discord would arise between 
the United States and France in the ensuing campaign; that in its 
operation it would be sudden and critical, and that there was a power 
ful party against the independence of the United States; that the 
British Court, as they had always done, propagated and spread these 
suggestions throughout Europe, and were the more at large in the 
calumny, that some impressions might remain in consequence of the 
heat of the calumny; that although his most Christian Majesty paid 
no attention to these suggestions, yet he most strongly recommended 
concord without meaning in any manner to look into or interfere in the 
internal measures of the United States. 

That such being the disposition of the Cabinet the beginning of 
October, the Court of Spain had thereupon taken her final resolution, 
as expressed by her remonstrance to the Court of London the end of 
that month, respecting her hostile operations against France, making 
the independence of the United States the preliminary article to a 
general pacification; that it was possible this would lead to a general 
peace, and that the negociations would necessarily be rapid, as peace or 
war must finally be determined upon before the season for opening the 
campaign came on. That as the Court of France had no object in view 
but the independence of the United States, if this was to be obtained 
there was a great probability of peace; but if it could not be obtained, 

his most Christian Majesty would exert all his powers in the next campaign in prosecution of the war. That the Congress ought to lose no 
time in appointing a proper person to take a part in the expected negociations; that he should be furnished with ample powers, as well as the 
desires of Americans as her ultimatum, relaxing in the first as in his 
discretion he should see fit, the distance being too great, and the crisis 
too pressing, to admit of applications to Congress for instructions; that 
the United States should consider their resources and their abilities on 
the one hand, and the probable advantages and disadvantages arising 
on the other, by continuing the war; that moderate terms might, per 
haps, be now obtained; that the pride of Great Britain was too high, 
and her abilities too great, to submit to extraordinary demands at 
present. She might be able to continue the war for some years yet. 
France desired no aggrandizement by conquest, the Independence of 
America being alone such a debilitating of Great Britain, as to secure 
her effectually against the haughtiness of that nation. 

That the Court of Great Britain had endeavored to form alliances 
upon the Continent; that twenty months ago she had applied to the 
Empress of Ilussia for a body of her troops for the American service; 
that she replied she had not been raised to empire by <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> for 
such a purpose ; that she would not send her troops against a people 
who asked only for justice and liberty; she would not engage in such 
a bloody work. In short, she answered with such disdain, that the 
British ambassador retired from Court till he received instructions on 
that head from London; that these instructions were in such mild 
terms, that he returned as if nothing had happened; that afterwards he 
applied to the Empress that her Majesty should act in strict conjunction with the British, and that a large district in America would be 
assigned to the Empress; but she answered this in such a manner, as 
discouraged a renewal of the application. That Britain had also pro 
posed to the King of Prussia to loan an army of observation, with the 
view of collecting to it such forces as were against the interests of the 
Emperor; that the King, the Emperor, and the Queen of Hungary, 
had applied to his Master to mediate in the disputes relative to Bava 
ria; that he being in alliance with Vienna, had not chosen to be alone 
the arbiter, but had called upon Ilussia to be a co-umpire, to which the 
King of Prussia and the Emperor had consented; that the Empress of 
Russia had desired of the King of France to mediate between her and 
the Porte; that thus it appeared none of the Great Powers of Europe 
would take part against France, and that Great Britain was destitute 
of alliances against his Master; that Spain wished to have the territorial claims of the United States terminated. She wished to have the 
navigation of the Mississippi shut, and possession of the Floridas; that 
she disliked the neighborhood of the British in that quarter, who were 
too restless and enterprising, and preferred that of the United States; 
that if the war continued, a subsidy might be obtained of Spain in aid 
of the pecuniary wants of the United States; that this aid was most 
honorable to protect States to obtain under the mark of a subsidy; that 
it might at a loose rate call for 6,000 men, when not more than 3,000 
would be expected to be embodied for the reduction of the Floridas, to 
be relinquished to Spain when conquered; that Spain might obtain that 
territory independent of the States; that if a peace now took place, 
Spain would have no claim upon the United States, nor would they have 
any upon the Floridas; that if this subsidy took place, the money might 
be lodged in respectable private hands in Paris, and if prudently managed 
would give the States a credit in Europe equal to their wishes; that at 
all events the United States should exert themselves to prepare for 
another campaign, and put on the appearance of aiming at more than 
they meant to strike at; for such an appearance would accelerate the 
negociations, especially if the United States could strike a blow, which, 
though not important, might be brilliant; that peace was the time for 
the United States to recover their finances; that France had just begun 
to recover hers when hostilities begun between her and Britain; that 
had those hostilities been postponed two years, she would be more com 
petent to the war; that, however, France had made every necessary 
arrangement for the next campaign. But that, as her exertions, and the 
maintenance of 60,000 men on the frontiers of Germany, to enforce 
her urnpirage, would occupy all her resources, she was not able to afford 
those aids to America, which she was disposed to do, considering as she 
did the interests of America as her own.

SIR: 

I have sent you down two prisoners, one Gunrod Beasinger, a de

month and better, and by what I can learn was at the taking of our 
guard at <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> River. The other is one John Martias, a Spaniard, 
who has lately stole a beef from Thomas Bass, and was found in his 
possession and by the account of this Beasinger, has supplied the outlyers with beef for this sometime past. I have an account of two companies of out-lyers in the swamp, and will do my endeavor to have them 
taken or killed this week. I shall be much obliged to you, if you will 
send me up two or three pounds of lead, as I am in great want at 
present, and also to acquaint me in what manner I can get provisions 
for rny horses, as I know of a great deal, but can t get it without a pro

I am, sir, your most obedient humble servant,

I herewith send by the bearer for some powder, ball, buck-shot and 
flints ; likewise the rum you mentioned to me yesterday. Our people 
here complain very hard of their duty being every night on guard and 
then they say if they were safe from the enemy they would not think 
much of the duty, hard as it is, but every night expect to be surprised. 
They go so far as to declare they will not stay without more assistance, 
so that they may have three sentries of a night. I am willing to comply 
with any orders whatever, but at the same time I can t think but there 
is a good deal of danger in our situation, there being no guard in all the 
Creek but ours, and if Mrs. Page once knows our situation, she will do 
her endeavors to let the enemy know, and I don t know of any way to 
prevent her from sending, as the river is so wide she may send in the 
night and our sentry never the wiser of it. 

I am, sir, your most obedient humble servant, 

J. FERGUSON. 

P. S. Send some paper for cartouches.

JULY 10, <a href='/results.php?year=1778'>1778</a>. 

SIR: 

Your last orders to me was to keep only one fourth of the company 
on duty ; the rest were sent to you, now most of them are returned (as 
they tell me from Charles Town) ; should be glad to know what is to be 
done with them. I have ordered them on duty in different parts of the 
district, and shall be glad to have your approbation ; we are surrounded 
on all sides by the enemy. I have put a Sergeant and six men at 
Shubrick s Cliff; a Sergeant and ten men on the river May; and am 
myself with ten men at Colleton s Bluff , the mouth of Oakety Creek. 
Mr. Guerard s school master has lately corne over to the Barony, and 
carried off a handkerchief full of indigo, and told the negroes he in 
tended coming for the whole shortly. I have ordered a patrol of six 
men to keep a look out for him ; another officer is much wanted to take 
post on May river, from whence I have reason to think a correspondance 
is carried on between some of the inhabitants and Georgia. I have 
ordered Mr. Pendarvis to you for trial. He lids certainly taken the 
oath, and there are some returned from town that have taken it say 
Joseph Sealey, John Kerr, and Thos. Scott they took protection from 
Capt. Thacher at Purysburgh, and all that took protection from him 
were sworn as likewise those that went to stone the Capt. of the Galley 
at Purysburgh. None mind the oath but those that went to Major 
Yanbram at Ebenezer, and they all got printed certificates. There is a 
continual concourse of small craft (such as sloops and schooners) going to 
and fro, through Scull Creek. A small galley (such as one of the trading boats would make that are laying in New River) would annoy them 
much and might have a safe retreat up to Pring s Creek, should any 
thing too hard for her come against her. 

I am sir, your most obedient humble servant, 

GEO. HIPP.

DR. RAMSAY TO HON. WILLIAM HENRY DRAYTON. 

CHARLESTOWN, September 1, <a href='/results.php?year=1779'>1779</a>. 

DEAR SIR : 

Your favor of July 18th,. came safe to hand on the 16th of August, 
A hurry of business prevented my acknowledging the receipt of it 
sooner. 

Our Assembly is now drawing near to the close of a long session. 
Little business is yet completed. A tax bill of twenty-one dollars a head 
has been read twice. A bill for filling our regiments by giving a negro 
bounty to every volunteer recruit, has also been read twice. This mea 
sure is now our ultima spes. Money will not procure soldiers. The 
militia will not submit to a draught ; it has been once carried in the 
House to put them under Continental articles ; but the friends of this 
measure, fear that it will be lost on the next reading. The patriotism 
of many people is vox et prceterea nihil. The measure for embodying 
the negroes had about twelve votes ; it was received with horror by the 
planters, who figured to themselves terrible consequences. Next Friday 
is set apart to choose a new delegate in the room of Mr. Lowndes, when 
it is probable that Mr. E. Rutledge will be chosen. Mr. A. Middleton will set out in a few weeks. Most people expect the enemy here in 
October or November, and yet we are half asleep. When the eampaign 
closes to the northward, it will be easy for them to send a few thou 
sands of a reinforcement to their troops in <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>. Our back 
country is much disaffected especially at the high price of salt, which is 
60 dollars a bushel. We mean to solicit aid from the grand army. I 
wish you would send us two thousand Continentals immediately. You 
know the importance of Charlestown ; it is the vinculum that binds 
three States to the authority of Congress. If the enemy posses them 
selves of this town, there will be no living for honest whigs to the south 
ward of Santee; at present, nothing is wanting to put them in possession of it, but vigor and activity on their part. A spirit of money
making has eaten up our patriotism. Our morals are more depreciated 
than our currency. It is with great pleasure I receive your letters, and 
I shall be always ready to acknowledge them. 

Yours, 

DAVID RAMSAY.

CAMP SMITH S CLOVE, Sept. 13, <a href='/results.php?year=1779'>1779</a>. 

DEAR SIR : 

We arrived in those disagreeable mountains about two weeks ago, 
from the mouth of the Clove, where our chief employment is to repair 
the roads, and keep them in good order, which is a very difficult task. 

By various accounts from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, we have every reason to believe 
the enemy intend an embarkation of a great part of their troops. It is 
generally believed they are destined for the West Indies, from the quantity 
of summer clothing the officers are getting made, and other reasons. 

I much fear if the enemy don t soon embark that it won t be ill my 
power to accompany you to Virginia, as a number of officers have ap 
plied for leave of absence for a few months, but to no effect; they can t 
get liberty until the close of the campaign. Indeed, tis very few who 
would ask for it, if their business was not very urgent. If you think my 
going to Virginia would be of any service with respect to the Colonel s 
claims, let me know as soon as you can, by post or otherwise, and in what 
respect I can be of assistance, as it might be necessary for me to show 
that part of your letter to the General which would mention the necessity of my going. I had a few lines from the Colonel s man, James, 
informing me of his being very unwell. Pray, let me hear from you 
soon, and say how the old gentleman is, and if he purposes going to 
Virginia. I am, dear sir, your most obedient humble servant,

extended. This morning, at 9 o clock, the enemy opened his batteries, 
firing bombs, carcasses and hot balls, which were returned with all our 
force from the batteries. This lasted about two hours, when the firing 
was abated on both sides, till about 5 o clock, when all the fire was on 
the side of the enemy. We had one 18 pounder dismounted, and two 
houses burnt in town. Our workmen employed as before.

fications. All that I can learn is, that they have strengthened the pro 
files of the lines ; that they have constructed a Fort at Hampstead very 
nearly upon the plan herewith, marked with dotted lines ; and some 
redoubts more advanced ; they have also commenced a battery on Shultz s 
Folly ^but the foundation is scarcely raised.

CHARLESTOWN, S. C., April 8, <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>. 

DEAR SIR : 

I arrived here about ten days ago, when I had an opportunity of 
seeing the enemy at one view, both by land and water. We had one small skirmish with the infantry, but nothing of consequence done. 
They have been throwing up works, and making nightly approaches on 
this city for some nights past; their lines are now about six hundred 
yards off; but I expect they are now approaching much nearer, as eleven 
sail of their line, this afternoon, with a fair wind, passed Fort Sullivan 
(now Fort Moultrie), under an exceeding heavy fire. We don t know 
what injury they sustained, further than our seeing one of their masts 
shot away. They now lay just out of cannon shot from town; but we 
expect if the wind continues fair, that they and their army will attack 
us early to-morrow morning, when they, doubtless, will meet with a verv 
warm reception from our batteries, which are well constructed, have 
heavy metal, and well pointed, which we have convinced their army of 
for some days past, having fired pretty constant at their new works. 
The army and citizens are in high spirits, and have no doubt of their 
being able to defend the city, and make Sir Henry again give up the 
thought of taking it. I am uncertain where your brother is, otherwise 
should write him. Please present my best compliments to Mrs. and 
Miss Gratz. I am much fatigued, and determined to try if the enemy 
will let me sleep half-an-hour. I fear they won t, for now a heavy fire 
begins at Fort Moultrie. I am at a loss to know the reason. 

I have wrote Col. Croghan, and hope he may receive the letter, as I 
have enclosed him one from his son-in-law, which a Mr. Cowen, for 
merly of Lancaster, gave me. 

I am, your most obedient,

In the morning, at the appearing of day-light, 300 men from Gen. 
Hogan s and Gen. Woodford s and Gen. Scott s brigades, and twenty-one 
men from the South Carolina Continentals, sallied out on an intrenchment which the enemy had thrown up in the night, and killed and took 
prisoners to the amount of sixty men, only twelve of whom were brought 
alive into lines, three or four being mortally wounded with bayonets. 
Col. Henderson, from Virginia, had the command of our troops, and 
made the men march up to these works, with their priming thrown out, 
and gun cocks let down. Our men behaved with the greatest bravery 
and good conduct. Our loss consisted of only 1 colonel 
killed, and three privates wounded. THOS.

I am just now going to cross the river to Haddrell s Point, where I 
am to remain on parole within the space of six miles our army being 
under the necessity of surrendering this town to the British forces the 
12th of this month. The bearer, Major Kice, is aid-de-camp to Gen. 
Lincoln, and can give you every information concerning this town. I 
suppose you will be informed of our supporting this town while we had 
provisions to live on, or a prospect of a reinforcement of troops. We 
have no Continental troops but the Virginians, Hogan s, and three 
South Carolina regiments. We had but very few militia. The ma 
jority of them are citizens of this town. We had a heavy and pretty 
constant fire from our side six weeks, and from the enemy twenty-nine 
days; not many lives lost on our side. The second day after the enemy 
took the town, their magazine blew up by accident, which destroyed all 
the arms they received from us, and near a hundred lives. 

Pray, present my best compliments to Col. Croghan, and let him 
know I have wrote the Major, his son-in-law. Compliments to Mrs. 
and Miss Gratz. 

I am, with much respect, your most obedient servant,

September , <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>. 

DEAR SIR : 

I got home last Monday evening from my little excursion into South 
Carolina, and had the happiness of finding my family in good health. 

I imagine you have already heard the particulars of the action at 
Whitsill s Mill, on the 6th instant; and I make no doubt but those of 
the action near Guilford C. H,, upon the 15th, will be agreeable to you, 
General Greene having collected an army of 4,500 men at the High 
Rock ford of Haw River, began his march from that place on Monday, 
the 12th inst., determined to give battle to the enemy on the first oppor 
tunity. General Cornwallis lay at that time within two or three miles of 
Guilford C. H., on a branch called Buffaloe; and upon Gen. Greene s 
advancing towards him, he retired into a fork of Deep River, about 
eight miles above the Court House. Our army, upon the evening of 
the 14th, got up to Guilford C. H., and encamped about a mile above 
it that night. Myself and Col. C. Lynch, having each of us the com 
mand of a corps of riflemen, with Lieut. -Colonels Lee and <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a>, 
of the Light Dragoons, were that evening advanced about a mile in 
front of the army, and about seven miles from the enemy. Next morning early, we had intelligence of their being in motion, and marching 
towards us; upon which Col. Lee, with his legion, and about thirty of 
my riflemen, under the command of Capt. Tate, of the <a href='/results.php?city=augusta' rel='city'>Augusta</a> militia, 
went out to meet them, while the rest of the riflemen, and Col. Washington s horse, formed at our encampment, to support them in their 
retreat back. They met with the enemy near two miles from our en 
campment, and immediately began to skirmish them, and continued 
fighting and retreating for about half-an-hour, which disconcerted and 
retarded the enemy very considerably. In the meantime, the main 
body of our army was formed about three-quarters of a mile in rear of 
us; and upon the legions rejoining us, we were ordered back, to take 
our position in the line of battle. We had not been formed there above 
ten minutes, before the cannonade began in the centre, which lasted 
about twenty minutes, in which time the enemy were forming their line 
of battle, by filing off to the right and left, and then immediately advanced upon our troops, upon which the firing of the small arms began. 
The Virginia regulars and militia, with the first Maryland regiment, 
behaved with the greatest bravery, and the riflemen who acted upon the 

wings, have done themselves honor; but, unhappily, a whole brigade of 
the North Carolina militia, of about 1,000 men, abandoned their party 
from the first onset. Many of them never fired their guns, and almost 
the whole of them threw away their arms, and fled with the greatest 
precipitation. To this misfortune is attributed our being obliged to 
quit the field, though the battle was maintained long and obstinately. 
All agree that it lasted two hours and a half, and I think myself it was 
considerably more. The enemy followed us no further than the heights 
just above Guilford C. H., and our army retreated in tolerable order to 
Speedwell Furnace, which is about ten miles below. There the most 
of the troops, who were dispersed in the action, assembled next day. 
The enemy lay at Guilford C. H. from Thursday till Sunday, 12 o clock, 
(being employed in burying their dead, and taking care of their 
wounded,) and that evening retreated to New Garden Court House, 
where they left a number of their wounded, and wrote to Gen. Greene, 
requesting that they might not be ill-treated by the Americans. The 
next day (Monday) they continued their retreat to Centre Meeting 
House, and next morning I left camp, and have not had any certain 
intelligence from them since, though I make no doubt but there has 
been another battle, as every person seems to believe that Gen. Greene 
intended a pursuit. 

Very truly yours, 

W. CAMPBELL.

COL. WILLIAM CAMPBELL S ACCOUNT OF THE BATTLE OF KING S MOUNTAIN. 

WILKES COUNTY, CAMP ON BRIAR CREEK, October 20, <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>. 

DEAR SIR: 

Ferguson and his party are no more in circumstances to injure the 
citizens of America. 

We came up with him in Craven county, South Carolina, posted on 
a height called King s Mountain, about twelve miles north of the Chero 
kee ford of Broad River, about two o clock in the evening of the 7th 
instant, we having marched the whole night before. 

Col. Shelby s regiment and mine began the attack, and sustained the 
whole fire of the enemy for about ten minutes, while the other troops 
were forming around the height upon which the enemy was posted. 
The firing then became general, and as heavy as you can conceive for 
the number of men. The advantageous situation of the enemy being 
the top of a steep ridge obliged us to expose ourselves exceedingly, and 
the dislodging of them was equal to driving them from strong breast 
works; though, in the end, we gained the point of the ridge, where my 
regiment fought, and drove them along the summit, nearly to the other 
end, where Col. <a href='/results.php?city=cleveland' rel='city'>Cleveland</a> with his country men were. There they 
were drove into a huddle, and the greatest confusion. The flag for a 
surrender was immediately hoisted; and as soon as the troops could be 
noticed of it, the firing ceased, and the survivors surrendered themselves 
prisoners at discretion. 

The victory was complete to a wish. My regiment has suffered more 
than any other in the action. I must proceed with the prisoners until 
I can some way dispose of them. Probably I may go on to <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> 
in Virginia. 

I am, &c., 

WM. CAMPBELL, Col Com.

IN THE SENATE, November 15, <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>. 

Resolved, nemine contradicente, that the thanks of this House are 
justly due to Col. William Campbell, of <a href='/results.php?city=washington' rel='city'>Washington</a> county, and the 
brave officers and soldiers under his command, who with an ardor truly 
patriotic, in the month of September last, without waiting for the call 
of Goverment, voluntarily marched out to oppose the common enemy, at 
that time making depredations on the frontiers of North Carolina, and 
on the seventh day of October, by a well-timed judicious, and spirited 
attack, with a force inferior to that of Maj. Ferguson, then advanta 
geously posted on King s Mountain, with upwards of eleven hundred 
men, and by a perseverance and gallantry rarely to be met with, even 
among veteran troops, totally defeated the whole party ; whereby a form 
idable and dangerous scheme of the enemy was effectually frustrated.

FEBRUARY 25th, <a href='/results.php?year=1781'>1781</a>. 

DEAR COLONEL : 

Yesterday I had an express from Col. Lock s camp ; he is at the High 
Rock Ford on Haw River. Gen. Perkins is near Hillsborough, and by 
this time considerable strong ; General Greene on his march towards 
the enemy with a number of the Virginia militia and regulars ; General 
Butler, with the Orange district militia, lies below Hillsborough, and 
by every intelligence, the enemy are penned up in that town. It is 
generally supposed that a reinforcement is on their march to the assistance of the British ; our people are gathering from all quarters, and the 
enemies pickets are constantly harrassed by our reconoitering parties. 
The arrival of your troops would add vigor to us and discourage the 
enemy, who, no doubt, have heard of your being on your march towards 
them. Pray send back this express as quick as possible ; I shall endeavor to have some meat for you at Bethabara meal and corn you can 
have a plenty, but meat is scarce. However, I shall try my best. 
This day Col. Preston, I think, will join Gen. Pickens ; if any extra 
ordinary news comes to hand before you arrive at Bethabara, I shall let 
you know by another express. 

I am in haste, sir, your humble servant, 

MARTIN ARMSTRONG.

WILLIAM MOULTRIE TO CHARLES MONTAGUE. 

HADDRELL S POINT, March 12, <a href='/results.php?year=1781'>1781</a>. 

MY LORD : 

I received yours this morning by Fisher. I thank you for your 
wish to promote my advantage, but am much surprised at your propo 
sition. I nattered myself I stood in a more favorable light with you ! 
I shall write with the same freedom with which we used to converse, 
and doubt not you will receive it with the same candor. I have often 
heard you express your sentiments respecting this unfortunate war, 
when you thought the Americans injured; but am now astonished to 
lind you taking an active part against them ; though not fighting partic 
ularly on the Continent, yet the seducing their soldiers away to enlist 
in the British service is nearly similar. 

My Lord, you are pleased to compliment me with having fought 
bravely in my country s cause for many years, and, in your opinion, ful 
filled the duty every individual owes to it; but, 1 differ very widely 
with you in thinking, that I have discharged my duty to my country, 
while it is still deluged with blood, and over-run by the British troops, 
who exercise the most savage cruelties. When I entered into this con 
test, I did it with the most mature deliberation, and with a determined 
resolution to risk my life and fortune in the cause. 

The hardships I have gone through, I look back upon with the greatest pleasure and honor to myself; I shall continue to go on as I have 
begun, that niy example may encourage the youths of America, to stand 
forth in defence of their rights and liberties ! You call upon me now, 
and tell me, I have a fair opening of quitting that service with honor 
and reputation to myself, by going with you to Jamaica ! Good God ! 
is it possible that such an idea could arise in the breast of a man of 
honor ? I am sorry you should imagine I have so little regard for my 
own reputation, as to listen to such dishonorable proposals ! Would you 
wish to have that man, whom you have honored with your friendship, 
play the traitor ? Surely not ! You say, by quitting this country, for 
a short time, I might avoid disagreeable conversations, and might return 
at my own leisure, and take possession of my estates for myself and 
family ; but, you have forgotten to tell me, how I ain to get rid of the 
feelings of an injured, honest heart, and where to hide myself from 
myself ! Could I be guilty of so much baseness, I should hate myself, and shun mankind ! This would be a fatal exchange from my present 
situation, with an easy and approved conscience of having done my 
duty, and conducted myself as a man of honor. 

My Lord, I am sorry to observe, that I feel your friendship much 
abated, or you would not endeavor to prevail upon me to act so base a 
part ! You earnestly wish you could bring it about, as you think it will 
be the means of bringing about that reconciliation we all wish for. I 
wish for a reconciliation, as much as any man but, only upon honor 
able terms ! The repossessing my estates ; the oifer of the command of 
your Regiment, and the honor you propose of serving under me, are 
paltry considerations to the loss of my reputation ! No ! not the fee 
simple of that valuable Island of Jamaica should induce me to part with 
my integrity ! 

My Lord, as you have made one proposal, give me leave to make 
another, which will be more honorable to us both. As you have an in 
terest with your commanders, I would have you propose the withdrawing the British troops from the Continent of America ! allow the Inde 
pendence ; and propose a peace ! This being done, I will use my 
interest, with my commanders, to accept the terms, and allow Great 
Britain a free trade with America. 

My Lord, I could make one more proposal, but my situation as a 
prisoner circumscribes me within certain bounds I must, therefore, 
conclude with allowing you the free liberty to make what use of this you 
may think proper. Think better of me. 
I am, my Lord, 

Your Lordship s most obedient humble servant, 

WILLIAM MOULTRIE, Brigadier General.

WILLIAM CHRISTIAN TO COL. WILLIAM PRESTON. 

M AH AN AIM, Saturday June 30, <a href='/results.php?year=1781'>1781</a>. 

DEAR SIR : 

The Assembly adjourned on this day was a week. Mr. W. Madison 
came from Staunton but one day before I did, and, I suppose, has given 
you nearly all the news I have, but, as John Young is going over, I ll 
write what occurs to me. Several laws are made respecting the war. 
The militia law is amended martial law declared in force for 20 miles 
around our army and also around the enemy s all the powers of Government necessary for calling out militia, and resources of every kind are 
vested in the Executive persons suspected of disaffection may be sent 
to the enemy after twenty days to dispose of their property a law is 
passed allowing ten thousand dollars for voluntary recruits for two years 
or the war. I think there are twenty-two Acts in all, but the above are 
the most material, except one, I just remember, for punishing those who 
may oppose the laws by an armed force, declaring them to be civilly 
dead, and their estates to descend to the next of kin; 

The lowland people are as true and firm, in the interest of America 
as any people in it. All I saw seem to disregard property, and only 
talk of independence. None despair in the least. They are more en 
gaged for the fate of South Carolina at present than Virginia. Not 
withstanding the anxiety for Carolina we had no certain accounts since 
the 24th of May at that time Gen. Greene lay before Ninety-six, and 
expected twelve days would determine its fate. Col. Knox took down a 
report about ten days ago that it was actually taken, and that the General with his whole army and prisoners were then at Salisbury. Capt. 
Sagers took down an extract of a letter said to be written by G. 
G. to Col. Armstrong, saying that all Carolina had fallen but 
Charles Town. Since I came home last Tuesday I can hear nothing at 
all. The Marquis de LaFayette, retreated into Culpepper, near the 
Court house, to meet Wayne, to save 2,500 stand of arms, coming to 
wards <a href='/results.php?city=fredericksburg' rel='city'>Fredericksburg</a>, and to try to save Hunter s Works. Lord Cornwallis, was steering for <a href='/results.php?city=fredericksburg' rel='city'>Fredericksburg</a> until he took some of our Ex 
presses, giving information about our stores at Point of Fork, soon after 
which he turned about to that place. The Marquis crossed the country 
again to Alligre s, and followed down. The last and best accounts we 
had this day week were that Lord Cornwallis was in <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, and the 
Marquis at a church twelve miles on this side up the Goochland road. 
The Marquis said he would fight if pushed hard, but if not would wave 
it longer. Baron Steuben it was supposed joined last week with six 
hundred newly raised regulars, and as many militia raised on the south 
side of the river. He had retreated as far as Dan from the Point of 
Fork, intending for Greene, but returned as we heard. Some stores 
are saved, some lost. We had no certain accounts, how much either 
way. At <a href='/results.php?city=charlottesville' rel='city'>Charlottesville</a>, the damage was not great; perhaps, about 
three hundred guns destroyed, and some stores, but the greatest part 
had got out of town, and Tarlton followed but one mile up the road. 
Col. Boone who was with Lord Cornwallis and since paroled, thinks the 
enemy about 6,000. Reports call ours 7,000, and increasing. Our 
strength in regulars, is about 2,200 to wit : the Marquis men, 800, 
Wayne s 800, and Steuben s 600. When we got a return from the 
Marquis, of the militia, they fell greatly short of what was reported, 
near half. Deserters from Lord Cornwallis, call his force 4,500 and 
5,000. Reports call his horse, 700. We were told that there are com 
panies formed for trading in negroes and shipping them to the Islands, 
and East Florida. The midde country will be eat out between the two 
armies. I think there is an equal chance for peace next winter. The 
Spaniards seem to be bending their whole force at Gibralter and the 
French at the Islands. The French had fifty and the English thirtyfive line of battle ships before St. Lucia. An engagement was looked 
for as the French would try to take that Island. I expect none of them 
here now. Let me deal in Latin like A. B. and desire you to ask D. 
R. to English uti possidetis. 

Adieu, 

WILLIAM CHRISTIAN,

SECRET CORRESPONDENT TO GEN. MARION. 

APRIL 4, <a href='/results.php?year=1782'>1782</a>. 

SIR: 

I forwarded you yesterday a small packet by Mr. M Bowie, to which 
I refer. I am now in the country and at liberty. I must, therefore, 
thank you again for your kindness and attention in forwarding me a 
protection and for saving me from impending destruction. Your late 
worthy brother, whose memory I shall ever revere, I considered as 
my father and best friend, and esteemed him beyond all other men and 
yourself, by your generous conduct have laid me under such obligations 
as entitles you to my affection and best services. I now answer your 
favor of the 7th ultimo, received the 23d. When it came to hand, I 
resolved the subject over and over in my mind, and came to this con 
clusion, that it would be impossible for me alone to carry your views 
into their full extent, for the following reasons: first, Because as I 
followed no kind of business, the purchasing goods alone in any quantity would create suspicion; secondly, Because I am much suspected 
already, not by those in authority, but by busy people who are ever 
prying into other people s business. I have been told I am suspected, 
and that my conduct is watched ; thirdly, Because I think I want resolution for such an undertaking, laboring as I do under a great infirmity 

of face (having in all my concerns walked in a straight path), insomuch 
if any danger arose, I should sink under it, if the truth was against 
me. These considerations determined me to consult a second person. 
I knew of none so proper as my friend, Mr. Win. Smith, No. 33 on 
the Bay; I, therefore, in confidence made him acquainted with the 
subject of your letter. This produced a return of confidence from him, 
and he acquainted me Capt. Theus had already wrote to him on the 
subject, and that he had made the necessary applications; that the 
answers were more favorable than he expected, and that he only waited 
for an opportunity to write Capt. Theus. I enclosed Mr. Smith s 
answer to 0. T. to you yesterday. I wish it may be satisfactory. In 
my former letter I mentioned a Mr. Warrington, gone in a flag to 
George Town. He has a large stock, and I fancy has had large con 
cerns in the country already. I am of opinion good business may be 
done with him if he is not returned. I lament much I could not advise 
you of this man before, but it was impracticable. I am in hopes your 
business may be done by mutual consent of parties; if it can, you will 
be much better served, and there will be no risk, which always is great; 
for only two or three days ago a vessel loaded with rum was seized at 
Roper s Wharf; Capt. Keaton and Dickerson confined in the prevost, 
and Mr. John McQueen obliged to abscond. Excuse me, sir, for offering to give advice. But, supposing Capt. Theus were to write to Mr. 
Smith for such articles, as he wanted to be paid in produce, it will be 
Mr. Smith s interest to serve you, or rather himself. I, perhaps, may 
succeed in a small concern, also, if you approve it. Fresh meat sells 
at an enormous price; a good animal would fetch in quarters twenty 
guineas or upwards. If permission could be had to bring proper goods 
in return from town, a few animals would procure you a great many 
necessaries, and bear trifling and temporary relief to the town. I do 
not know this can be done; but if you desire it, I will try, and desire 
no advantage from it; at all events, I can get many goods out with 
passes, as I did the hoes. To conclude, I will render you all the ser 
vices in my power, and when the plan and correspondence is settled, 
the conveyance of letters from hence will be regular. I could wish 
Lieut. Capers might convey all letters, and accompany any person on 
this business; as he is known by my people, and often here, it will not 
create any suspicion, for I only wish to- trust one negro. I must now 
beg leave to execute a commission in behalf of a very much distressed 
man; I mean my worthy friend, Mr. Philip Porcher. He is much 
hurt by the late act that affects him. I do think if ever man was de 
serving of favor, he is of the number. As you know him well, I shall 
only say, he is determined to throw himself on your protection, and I 
expect he is now on his way to you to solicit your kind offices to rank 
him amongst the number you have made happy. I am also desired to 
forward your letter from my friend Dr. E. He is a true penitent, and 
sincerely desirous of making his peace and of following your directions 
in all things. His lady is coming out to effect it, if possible. This 
freedom in me needs every apology I can make; my wish to serve my 
friends will, I hope, plead it. I shall only further add, that 
I am, sir, your obedient humble servant, 

P. S. Please to destroy this letter, for fear of accidents.

SIR: 

Having the honor of bearing a Continental commission, I have, 
agreeably to my instructions from Congress, seized a certain vessel, now 
here under the sanction of a flag from Charlestown, for having contra 
band goods. As I have in all former cases of this kind applied to the 
Judge of the Admiralty, where civil Government was established, so I 
have in the present one wrote to the Judge of the Admiralty of this 
State, in order that she may be legally tried ; but am apprehensive? 
from the behavior of Col. Horry (his ordering my cutter under the 
guns of the battery, when she might be at sea, and other matters which 
I conceive to be entirely out of his line), that the military mean to 
interfere with the ci il authority. I think it needless to trouble you 
much further about he matter, as I conceive it to be altogether of a 
civil nature. I just beg leave to trouble you with the enclosed copies 
of my commissioned orders and instructions for your perusal, by which 
you see, and I hope readily agree, that I have only acted in the line of 
my duty, and that the vessel and cargo are lawful prizes, in consequence 
of her having on board goods for which no license or permission has 
been given; and do, therefore, request you will give orders for the dis 
charge of my cutter, in order that I may send her to sea. I beg, sir, 
that you would not have that unfavorable opinion of my conduct as the 
misrepresentations of some people might induce you to entertain. I 
have always been a friend to my country, and have acted as such. 
I am, sir, your most obedient servant,

COLONEL THOMSON TO GENERAL HENDERSON. 

AMELIA, June 2, <a href='/results.php?year=1782'>1782</a>. 

DEAR SIR : 

I am very sorry to inform you that it is out of my power to get the 
officers of Col. R. Hampton s regiment to do their duty. When I saw 
you last, I thought it was the men s fault; but I sent a party of Gapt. 
Humph s men, under the command of Lieut. Wanamaker, to take all the 
delinquents of the third division, and bring them to me. He returned 
yesterday, and informs me that there is not a man in Capt. Dryer s nor 
Tateman s company, warned to go on duty. I find its the neglect of 
the officers, for they have had orders ever since the 18th or 19th of 
las* month, for the men to meet at Beaver Creek on the 29th. If you 
arrest those officers, and have them broke, there is no other men that 
can, by any means, be entrusted with companies. I can t tell in what 
manner to act? Should esteem it as a singular favor if you would give 
orders to Col. Hampton, and let him try what he can do, and consider 
me no longer as an officer in his regiment. Capt. Humph informs me 
Capt. House, and eight other prisoners, made their escape from Orangeburgh, the 31st May, and all the prisoners could have got away if they 
had tried. He likewise informs me that there are two parties of Tories 
in the Fork of Edisto; they consist of about fifteen each. If there 
could be about thirty or forty men to go and stay about in the Fork, 
they might be dispersed. I should be very glad to go with this com 
mand. The command to stay about eight or ten days would be long 
enough. Capt. Humph is in great want of ammunition. 
I am, dear sir, your most humble servant, 

W. R. THOMSON.

WILLIAM PIERCE, JR., TO MAJOR RUDOLPH, AND THE CAPTAIN OF THE LEGION. 

HEAD-QUARTERS, June 23, <a href='/results.php?year=1782'>1782</a>. 

DEAR GENTLEMEN : 

I have had a long conversation with General Greene respecting your 
resignations, and ain happy to assure you that he discovered a disposetion to accommodate the matter. He has, be assured, a proper idea of 
your merit, and upon all occasions speaks of the Legion in the warmest 
strains of panegyric. Your services are acknowledged with great 
generosity, and his friendship for you, individually, I know to be sincere. 

Was the matter properly inquired into, and your rights fairly inves 
tigated, perhaps you wculd be of a different opinion to what you are 
now. From the information I have received, you did not fairly com 
prehend the order, and there appears to have been a mistake with respect to the disposition of the troops. 

All this, I think, I can convince you of; and I shall feel myself the 
happiest man in the world to be able to restore to the service a set of 
officers whom I love and esteem. I think it can be done with satisfaction to yourselves, and with honor to the General. 

You complain of having received a letter couched in terms improper 
and indelicate. I confess it struck me in the same point of light; but 
be assured I am authorised to say, that the General did not mean it as 
an insult, nor did he expect that it would meet with such a construction. 

The manner of resigning your commissions, in my opinion, was im 
proper, and I think all combinations to oppose the measures of a com? 
manding officer had better be avoided, because it inflames and irritates 
the mind more than it can well support. Had the commissions been 
sent separately, I think it would have been better. Your letter was 
rather violent. I wish it had been more moderate. The General is 
governed as much by prudence as almost any man I know; but in this 
instance, perhaps, he was carried too far, and in my opinion you haye 
been too hasty. But the matter must be settled, and I beg you to 
throw aside every prejudice, and prepare your minds for a candid ex 
amination of the matter to-morrow. I will wait upon you at McQueen s, 
between twelve and one o clock. 

I am, dear gentlemen, with sincere friendship, your very humble servt.,

DEAR GENERAL : 

I take the liberty of enclosing you the names of near 500 soldiers, 
belonging to the 3d regiment, most of whom were absent at the time 
Gharlestown surrendered to the enemy. Many of them are entitled to 
their discharges ; but the greater part are deserters, and I hope will be 
apprehended and made to serve their times over, at least. A few have 
already been taken up and tried by a court martial in camp, and sen 
tenced to serve in the South Carolina line two days for every absent 
one. Whether this kind of punishment is right or not, I am at a loss 
to know; however, the men seem satisfied with it. I heartily wish this 
list may enable you to strengthen our line, which is still very weak, as 
you will see by the annexed return of the detachment under my com 
mand. I propose making out a few copies now, in order to send to 
Gens. Henderson and Pickens, and to some of the militia Colonels. 
Corporal Gambell unfortunately, a few days ago, killed one of the re 
cruits from <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>, by the name of Charles Smith. He was soon 
after committed to Orangeburgh jail by a magistrate of this district. 
I have not heard what success the officers recruiting have had lately. 
Lieuts. Martin and Langford wrote Gen. Huger, about a fortnight ago, 
that they then had enlisted eight men for the South Carolina line, four 
of whom are in camp, the rest on furlough. Capts. T. Warley and

With respect to the names of those who refuse to do duty, their number is so large, that I have mentioned them collectively, which you will

a letter from his Excellency the Governor, of a later date than yours,

with orders to march at a moment s warning, and let them remain 
where they are until further orders from him or you, and to give him 
the earliest notice of any movement of the Tories in my district, who 
are now quiet and peaceable, and are joining us very fast. I will keep 
the regiment embodied, and endeavor to enforce the law on the refractorj, by going from district to district, till countermanded by your 
orders. But neighbors are not willing to take those measures which 
the law points out, with their neighbors, and a small party from your

GOV. RUTLEDGE TO CAPT. SIMONS, 

September 1, <a href='/results.php?year=1782'>1782</a>. 

SIR: 

I have had the honor of receiving your letter of yesterday, requesting me to peruse a note from Capt. Giles, signifying to you that an 
officer of the Pennsylvania line had informed the officers of Col. Lee s 
legion, that you, at the Governor s table at dinner, had called them all 
a trifling set of fellows, and that they were all privates, sergeants or 
corporals in the army, and that Gen. Greene should not have restored 
them their commissions again, but have filled up their vacancies with 
gentlemen of merit resident in this State; and that the officers, having 
heard you make use of these illiberal expressions, or words to that 
effect, told you that the omcers of Lee s corps were gentlemen, and 
that you were a rascal or scoundrel for saying what you did, of which 
abuse you took no notice. In compliance with your further request, 
that I would relate what I recollect of the conversation which passed 
at the Governor s quarters about that period, that some of the officers 
of Col. Lee s legion had resigned, I will state it as clearly and as fully 
as the length of time which has intervened will admit of. I do not 
now recollect, nor do I think, that we had any conversation at dinner 
relating to Lee s corps; but in the afternoon some of the company with 
drew into the piazza, and others remained in the room in which we 
had dined. The officer of the guard, Capt. Blake, yourself, and, I 
think, Col. and Mr. Prioleau, were of the first party; I, and some other gentlemen, remained behind. Hearing some altercation 
between you and the officer of the guard relative to some order which 
had been issued, or letter written by Major Rudolph, I walked into the 
piazza, and after a time I asked what had given rise to the conversation 
which appeared to be rather warm, though by no means indecent. 
You answered it had been asserted, and to the best of my recollection 
you added, by the officer of the guard but of this I cannot be positive that Major Rudolph, when he resigned his command, assigned 
as a reason to the corps that he was tired of the service, and that you 
thought although an officer had a right to resign his commission if he 
considered himself ill used, yet he had no right to assign such a reason 
as might create disaffection in the corps; that you had served with the 
officers of the legion, you knew they were valuable, and loved some of 
them like brothers still, if Major R. had issued the order which had 
been attributed to him, you should ever think he had acted improperly. 
The officers there endeavored to maintain the contrary. The conversation became general; it at last took a turn without your having reflected 
in the least in my hearing on the officers of the legion, and without 
any reflection whatever having been thrown out on you. The foregoing, 
sir, is, to the best of my remembrance, the substance of what passed at 
the Governor s quarters. I am truly sorry that any misunderstanding 
should have taken place on so very delicate a subject as the character 
of officers. As far as my memory can assist me, I have endeavored to 
do justice to all parties. 

I am, sir, your most obedient servant, 

EDWARD RUTLEDGE.

gave permission for provisions and necessaries to be sent here for the 
prisoners captured at different times from the party under your com

the Lieut. -General is sorry, sir, to find that such indulgence, instead of 
being confined to the humane uses intended that of feeding and 
clothing your prisoners is made to answer the most improper purposes; 
for the boat which last arrived here was loaded with stock and provi 
sions for private families in town, and on its return some negroes were 
conveyed away from town in that very boat. This being the case, and 
in order to prevent such abuses in future, the General desires, sir, when 
ever any provisions, &c., are sent for your prisoners, the boat that brings 
them shall be with that sole intention; that a proper flag-master shall 
take charge of them, and deliver to our Commissary of prisoners an 
account of the quantity of every thing entrusted to his care, that no 
article of any sort shall be suffered to be put into the boat except pro 
visions, clothing and necessaries for the prisoners, under pain of having 
the whole seized; and, finally, that no person, white or black, or any 
goods, merchandise, &c., &c., shall, on any pretence, be taken from

had served with them, and loved some of them as brothers; and I am

SIR: 

Although I have not the honor of being acquainted with you, I 
return you my most humble and hearty thanks for your favor and great 
humanity shown my wife, when in the greatest distress, and persecuted 
by some of her neighbors, and for the protection you afforded her, 
which must show your benevolence and goodness of heart. I would 
next beg leave to address you on my own account, as being unfortunate 
enough to be on the confiscation list. I must acknowledge my attachment to the British Government from principle; but surely, sir, you, 
yourself, who must have acted from principle, also, and from your steady 
and unwearied perseverance in that cause which you deemed to be the 
right one, will not condemn that in me which you have done with so 
much honor to yourself and country. I would further beg leave to 
acquaint you, that 1 have been very anxious to leave this town, which I 
would have done some time past, but for the reason above mentioned. 
Except my loyalty, I hope there is nothing else can be alleged against 
me. I have always been of a pacific disposition, and am entirely clear 
of the exceptions in your laws, such as murdering, plundering, house 
burning, &c. I reckon to prefer a petition to the Assembly, when they 
meet, setting forth my case; and, as I am informed some of the Acts 
will be repealed, I am not without hopes, especially if a gentleman of 
your character and influence would espouse my cause, and which, I 
hope, I shall not solicit in vain, from your innate goodness to assist the 
distressed. It does not suit me to follow the English any longer; it is 
said they are to evacuate this town next month. The nine sail of 
victuallers, and three of merchantmen, with goods, arrived two days 
ago. Be that as it will, I am heartily tired of this place, and have had 
time enough to repent of my folly. If I shall have the good fortune 
to be restored, 1 shall, undoubtedly, be a good subject to the State of 
South Carolina; if, unfortunately, it should be otherwise, I shall always 
regret having ruined my wife and children more than anything that 
can befall myself, though at this time in my fiftieth year. I hope your 
honor will excuse my detaining you so long upon a subject so interesting to myself. If you will, or can, grant me protection for myself, and 
what few negroes I have, I will go out the first opportunity. If I can 
not obtain that, should be glad to know if I can stay in town after the 
evacuation, otherwise, must go to Augustine, or some of the islands, 
till the Act is repealed in my favor, by the assistance of my friends. 
I hope I have several, never having injured any individual to my 
knowledge. I wish you health and happiness, and that you may live 
long to protect the distressed and unfortunate. With high esteem and 
due regard, 

I am, sir, your most obedient humble servant,

Your letter of the 9th August I have received by Capt. Youngblood, 
wherein you desire to take all defaulters of my regiment who refuse to 
do duty agreeably to my orders, either to try them in my regiment, or 
to send them down to be tried in your brigade that is out; the latter 
you ll think best, and which I approve of, and will conform thereto. 
Capt. Youngblood has not attended according to appointment, which 
has delayed my carrying your orders into execution. I should be glad 
to know if you have given him orders to the contrary. I think it will 
be useless, without assistance, to endeavor to get them out, as I have 
many times endeavored to turn them out agreeably to your orders, with 
out effect. They are of opinion that they will not be obliged to comply 
with the law, and think you will not send after them, as they are fed 
up, and have contrary opinions instilled into them. I will appoint 
officers to the three companies who are without, and order them out on 
duty; and, should they remain refractory, I must send them down to 
you, to be dealt with as you shall think proper, with some assistance, if 
agreeable to you.

ECHAU, September 23, <a href='/results.php?year=1782'>1782</a>. 

DEAR GENERAL : 

I received yours of the 23d inst., and am much surprised of your 
being informed of my supplying the British with cattle, and that one Joulee was my driver; your informant was not just. Joulee did drive 
some cattle from the North side of Santee River to the South side; but 
the most of them were breeding cattle, which I did not think was 
against your orders to drive to this side. I could wish the whole of 
the Americans (though I say it) were like myself. I would freely give 
my all to serve my country, and, indeed, it has cost me nearly all, and 
still would give the remainder; if it were in my power the British should 
not eat or drink of what belong to the Americans. I always could give 
my friends a drink of grog or a cup of coffee until now, which plainly 
shows the dealing I have with the enemy; indeed, I have been plundered so often, that I have no clothes to wear on credit, nor as much 
hard money to purchase them. If I have traded, I must either have 
had money or clothes; but I can declare I have neither. I beg, Gene 
ral, you will satisfy me, in letting me know the informer. You know 
when I found what was carrying on, I begged of you to let me have a 
few men, and I could give you abundance of satisfaction in serving 
from Echau to the mouth of Santee ; but you never were kind enough 
to do it. You say my conduct has deceived you ; I am heartily sorry 
for it. I am in hopes you will yet have a better opinion of me than 
what you express at present. I am sorry I am obliged to write, as it 
is not in my power to come to you at present; but I shall wait on you 
as soon as I possibly can. I have always executed your orders as far 
as I have been able, and, indeed, have got a good deal of ill will for 
executing them; but, were it to do again, I should do it, or any orders 
you may give me, either on friend or foe. I have always made it my 
study to see that they were executed. My men should have been in 
camp before now, but the most of the relief are sick. Winningham 
and his sons, who say that you told them to collect the public cattle, 
do very little at it. I will be glad if you let me order them to camp, 
and with your orders will appoint some more qualified than them, and 
who are not of much other service. My lieutenant, who was to go 
with the men, has moved out of the parish. If nothing happens, in 
about a month I natter myself I shall be able for business, and shall 
be able to give more satisfaction. About ten days ago I had some idea 
of some blacks collecting fifteen or twenty horses near me. I pursued, 
but missed them; they carried off their horses safe and, for fear of 
iny pursuing them, they pulled up Oindaw Bridge to cover their re 
treat, and went off clear. I shall be much obliged to you for a copy of 
the militia law. I have some men that deserve to be made Continentals; 
but think I had better send them to camp to be tried. 
I am, dear General, your obedient servant, 

ALEXANDER McGREGOR.

CAPT. CONYERS TO GEN. MARION. 

TRAVELLER S REST, October 9, <a href='/results.php?year=1782'>1782</a>. 

DEAR GENERAL: 

This will be handed you by Capt. Taylor, who comes to attend the 
sitting of the Board of Officers. Capt. Simons resignation ends the 
dispute between him and Capt. Taylor. Capt. Martin claims the same 
as Capt. Simons; he was left out in the consolidating. How that matter is to be settled, you are the best judge. A few, and a very few of 
the junior officers, think Simons resignation ought not to continue 
both Martin and Taylor, and that if Taylor is the youngest, he ought 
to be left out ; but I hope he will not. I have enclosed the different 
claims, as I am confident I shall not be able to ride so far. I am now 
an object of pity, and the fever continues. Capt. Nelson informed me 
that you, as usual, have been helping us in clothing. It is to you, and 
from your favorable assistance only, that we can make that appearance, 
or be enabled to do that service to our country that is expected from us. The Governor is poor, and, I find, contracted in his opinion of 
matters in general; that he has no resource unless he has money, no 
stratagem, no policy; and, in short, he is poor. 

My compliments to Simons, Muller, Edwards, Elliot and Neufville, 
and receive the best respects from, dear General, 

Your most obedient and very humble servant, 

JAMES CONYERS.

CAPT. MILLIGAN TO GEN. MARION. 

GEORGETOWN, October 27, <a href='/results.php?year=1782'>1782</a>, 

DEAR GENERAL : 

After a small cruise of six days after two of the enemy s galleys, I 
arrived last evening quite late, and in the morning early my Lieutenant 
had intelligence of a sloop-of-war going loaded with rice and tobacco 
for Charlestown, without any flag, but a pass filled up in this place from 
the Governor, dated the 18th July last. I only want to know whether 
there is any later proclamation, or if this method of carrying on trade 
with the enemy is allowed by the Governor or not; for I like to have 
had my eyes pulled out by only putting an officer on board until I saw 
the passport, which was filled up. After I had done that matter, I 
then discharged him from on board. If such trafficking is allowed, I 
would be glad to be informed by a letter from your Excellency. 
I am, sir, with respect, your most obdt. servant, 

JACOB MILLIGAN.

SIR: 

I have this moment been honored with your Excellency s letter of 
28th inst., in consequence of which have made a seizure of a schooner 
from Mr. Lockwood in Charlestown, deeply laden with tobacco, rice, 
&c., which was discharged from the sloop I mentioned to your Excellency I had seized before, and which I then cleared upon seeing a pass 
port, signed by the Governor. I have put an officer on board of this 
vessel, and am determined to hold her until I hear further from you. 
Your Excellency may depend I shall strictly adhere to the instructions 
which your letter contains, and do all in my power to prevent the 
scandalous trade which is now carrying on with the enemy in Charlestown by numbers of people in this place, and its vicinity. On board 
of the schooner which I have now seized bound to Charlestown, are 
twenty-six hogsheads of tobacco and nine tierces of rice. The seizure 
of this vessel has already raised a clamour amongst those concerned, 
and am apprehensive it will be productive of more; therefore, shall 
wait ycur Excellency s further determination respecting this matter ; 
but, at all events, am determined to keep possession of her until I hear 
further from you. I am, with respect and esteem, 

Your Excellency s obedient humble servant,

COMMODORE LOCKWOOD TO GEN. MARION. 

CHARLESTOWN, October 31, <a href='/results.php?year=1782'>1782</a>. 

DEAR SIR: 

As it is the Governor s desire, for the good of our country, I have 
made it my business to send out whatever I can send them, Dorchester 
way, without a pass, and one with the Governor s pass to <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>; 
but this day Daniel Shields applied to me for a recommendation to you, 
for a pass to go with his schooner to Mr. Swinton s, at Wappetaw. I 
know little of the said Shults, but am told he is a good coaster; there 
fore, must be of service to us, and doubt not but you will give him a 
pass to remain until further orders, as the Governor s passes run. Here 
is, also, a fine Virginia schooner, the Nancy, Capt. John Anderson, 
which wants a pass to <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>, and there to remain, which I shall 
be obliged to your Excellency for, by the bearer, as I have no opportunity at present to send to the Governor. The troops are to embark 
the 15th November, as Leslie says. 

I am, with the greatest respect, sir, your most humble servant, 

J. LOCKWOOD.

COL. LUSHINGTON TO GEN. MARION. 

GEORGETOWN, October 31, <a href='/results.php?year=1782'>1782</a>. 

SIR: 

I received yours of the 28th inst., and note the contents. If I cannot act with honor to myself in the command of this garrison (for I 
am determined to support the character of an officer) must beg leave 
to decline the service. The order transmitted to Capt. Milligan, an 
officer subordinate to my command, is not only a reflection on me, but 
it carries with it a suspicion; and I defy any man in existence to say I 
received the value of one farthing in any vessel as a flag, or coaster, 
except some small present say a cheese, and four chests medicine, be 
longing to the State. The military mode of transmitting orders goes 
to the commanding officer of armies, wings, divisions, brigades, regi 
ments, &c., and not to an inferior officer, who is obliged to put them 
in execution, or abide the consequences. Hope you ll not say I have 
neglected yours, where it was possible to comply. It would not be 
likely Gen. Greene would transmit any orders to an inferior officer in 
your command; if he did, you would certainly think it hard. I could 
not but obey orders sent me by his Excellency the Governor, which I 
received at the time. Messrs. Heriot and Tucker received the pass 
ports desiring I would aid and assist Mr. George Selby in his business, 
which was the transportation of the produce, arising from the sale of 
fifty negroes sold by Governor s orders. Six separate passports were 
sent, and I believe only four were made use off for want of vessels. 
The Governor has sent a flag by this schooner, and I must take the 
liberty of exculpating myself from any disobedience of orders. The 
other matters contained in the letter will be attended to, as all your 
orders. I have supplied this country with upwards of six thousand 
guineas worth of property this year, for the use of the army, which 
comes not from the British, for which I have not yet received a single 
dollar, and I can say I never received a copper made from any person 
in the British service, by importing or smuggling goods, which I will 
attest any day. I am apprehensive you have received information from 
people on whom I have threatened formal practices. I have nothingfurther to add, only remaining 

Your very humble servant, 

R. LUSHINGTON. 

Ni B. With this I transmit the returns. Prichard s vessel brought 
up prisoners, as you ll see by the list, and went from here empty.

SIR: 

We enclose you the Governor s passports, granted Mr. Selby for the 
purpose of carrying round to Charlestown the nett proceeds of fifty 
negroes. The vessel loaded with a considerable part of this property 
(particulars of which is in the passport) with the Governor s flag be 
sides, is seized by Capt. Milligan, and detained by him. We have 
wrote the Governor particularly on this business, and of a sloop-of-war 
stopped in the same manner, and prevented sailing. Col. Lushington 
has only delivered us Mordecai Myers and Cohen s accounts, amounting to 20 Is. 4d. sterling, which we have assumed. Soon as we can 
have the others delivered, we will inform you what balance will be 
wanting. Capt. Rotix shall have the articles you mention, and we 
shall strictly observe your orders. 

With respect, we are, sir, your most obdt. servants,

CAPT. JOHN COGDELL TO GEN. MARION. 

GEORGETOWN, Nov. 25, <a href='/results.php?year=1782'>1782</a>. 

SIR: 

As I am in expectation of a vessel in a very short time, I will esteem 
it a favor if you will order the rice in payment for the powder supplied 
this garrison, as the account stands at foot ; the other rice payable the 
1st January next, I will give you timely notice when wanted, as it belongs 
to a person in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, to whom I have wrote that the rice was to 
be received at that time, and I suppose a vessel will be sent for the pur 
pose. I am sorry to acquaint you with the trade carried on to Charlestown from this place, by a set of people that I can t think friends to 
this State. I sometime ago wrote his Excellency, the Governor, 
respecting it in as full a manner as I could; he has taken no notice of it. 
Several are down now for that purpose to Daniel s Island, and may be 
expected back in a few days. I am told some are concerned that you 
could hardly suspect were those that commanded here. The Jews are 
all deeply concerned and do no duty, and are entirely excused. I could 
a few days ago have seized a cart load of goods going to Cohen s, but so 
many had already been cleared by applying to the Governor, I let them 
pass unnoticed. All our ready money is sent to Charles Town and the 
answer is, to supply the army. A few articles I wanted for my family 
use, such as blankets for my negroes, some cloth for my own wear, and 
a few things for my wife. I dare not send for them for fear they should 
be taken, and myself censured for a trade of the kind, though these 
things are laid by in town for me. I will thank you to advise me if 
this is allowed and how I am to act in such a situation. 

I am with regard, sir, your most obedient servant, 

JOHN COGDELL.
