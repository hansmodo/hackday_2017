DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
I have just received the enclosed note from Mrs. McQueen, and have been talking with . It appears the enemy have it in contemplation to attack us in our divided state; they must inevitably ruin us. 
You will join the army, therefore, without loss of time. I wish it was possible for Gen. Marion to take a position near Monk's Corner, that he 
might join us in cases of necessity. Please to write to him on the subject. Let me hear from you to-night. I did not know until this morning that you had Major Moses command with you. I thought 
they had joined the line. 
</p><p>
Yours, &c.,

DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
Your letter yesterday to Col. Maham is this moment handed to me. <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague met'>Lieut. Col. Laurens</a> joined us the night before last, and I have heard 
nothing further of the enemy's attack upon us. While the light troops 
were absent, I was a little apprehensive; but on their return, I feel 
perfectly easy. Enclosed I send you a copy of a letter from General Leslie, by which you will see what the poor inhabitants have to expect. 
I gave no other answer to it than by informing him that I had no control over civil Government, and directed him to the Governor and 
Council, who alone possessed powers competent to the business, and 
who would give him such an answer as the honor and interest of the 
Government required. If you could subsist with a flying party in the 
neighborhood of Strawberry, or anywhere between Cooper River and Santee, it would afford great protection to that part of the country. 
Our present position is so favorable for affording you support by a rapid 
march of our cavalry, that I much doubt whether the enemy will venture any bold enterprise against you; and if they should, if you move 
from day to day, and with your usual caution and address, as you are 
so perfectly acquainted with the country, you can easily avoid them 
</p><p>
until our cavalry can join you, and by fixing upon some place to meet 
at, you may form a junction with certainty and despatch. But, if you 
think your party will be too much exposed, you will take any position 
you may think their safety requires, giving the inhabitants as full notice 
as possible and all the negroes, also of the enemy's intentions to 
steal all the latter they can, and carry them off. If the negroes are 
advertised of the enemy's intentions, I think they will get but few of 
them.

DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 8th was handed me yesterday. <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague met'>Lieut. Colonel Laurens</a> has given me an account of the enemy's last movement, and 
Gen. Leslie has explained the object to me in a letter, a copy of which 
I inclosed to you in my last. With respect to the incorporation of Horry's and Maham's corps, I have said all upon it that I can say. If 
you cannot effect the incorporation upon the first plan, pursue your 
second; and if you cannot accomplish that, employ the force in any 
manner you can most for the benefit of the service, and in a way most 
pleasing to the officers. The schooner that went to <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a> for 
rice has the Governor's pass, and not mine; however, be it one or the 
other, tell Col. Horry not to let the cutter have anything to do with 
her; and if they attempt to carry her away by force, to repel force by 
force. Whatever position you take with your troops, it will be necessary frequently to change it, which will keep the enemy in the dark, 
and prevent their enterprising anything against you. Should the 
enemy move out after you, our cavalry shall form a junction with 
you at the place you mention, or any other you may advise, upon the 
spur of the occasion. Col. Pinckney has arrived in camp. With 
esteem and regard, 
</p><p>

DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 8th April has been received; and as I have had 
no direct opportunity to give it an answer, and as the subject did not 
require it immediately, I have omitted it. I cannot decide on one part 
of your letter, that is, respecting half-pay. If you were entitled to 
half-pay on your former standing, you are entitled to it now; but, if 
you mean upon the present reduction proposed, there can be no half-pay establishment follow it, as I have no authority for the purpose, nor 
</p><p>
can I conceive the officers would have the least right to expect such a 
thing. Their services were due to the State, from the situation it was 
in, and those temporary corps afforded them a much more honorable 
and agreeable service than serving in the militia; and as the Continent 
takes the expense upon themselves until their reduction, it is all that 
can be expected and, to continue them longer than they are useful, 
would be multiplying expense without sufficient object, for no country 
ever required economy more than ours to complete their independence. 
I left the business of reducing the regiments entirely to Gen. Marion; 
if it could be effected, well, but if not, let them remain as they were, 
until the men's term of service expires. He informs me that he has 
united all the horse under Col. Maham, and directed your men to 
do duty at <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>; this is perfectly agreeable to me, if so to you. 
I directed, a few days past, a company of artillery to join you at 
<a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>, and to your orders, in defence of that place. I am much 
afraid the enemy will attempt something against Waccamaw, as I am 
told there is a great quantity of provisions there.

DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
I have been of opinion some time, and got intelligence last evening, 
that the enemy were preparing to come out and attack us. It seems 
the refugees are pushing the General very hard for the purpose. What 
serves to confirm me in opinion that the enemy have some offensive 
operations in view is, they have taken uncommon pains for a few days 
past to find out our position, by sending flag after flag, and by searching out and interrupting every channel through which we might get 
intelligence. The refugees are ordered to be embodied to do garrison 
duty, while the army takes the field. It may all end in smoke, but I 
seriously believe they mean to give us battle ; and as they will have all 
their force collected, so I think it prudent to draw ours to a point until 
their intentions are better understood. You will, therefore, move over 
towards Dorchester with all your force as soon as possible, and let me 
know from time to time where you are. You will leave a very small 
patrole to watch the motions of the enemy in that quarter, and to for 
ward intelligence of all matters of discovery. I would have you put 
your men in the best order for action, and send me a roll of the force 
you will be able to bring to our aid.

DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 13th inst. is this moment came to hand. The 
prospect of a general action is not so immediate as I expected a few 
days ago. You will, therefore, halt in the neighborhood of Strawberry 
</p><p>
Ferry, and wait there, or in that neighborhood, until you hear further 
from me. I don t believe the enemy will make another excursion soon 
into St. Thomas , but they may. I should be obliged to you to get an 
account of all the forage in that quarter; with us it is scarce. I begin 
to feel afraid our cavalry will be obliged to cross the Edisto for subsistence.

DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
I wrote you yesterday to return to Strawberry, but, as you are so 
near, before you return I wish to see you, provided you come to Mr. 
Blake's to-night; but, if you should meet with your first express, and 
halt short of Mr. Blake s, you may return to the position recommended 
in that letter. However, I am of opinion, from a variety of reports, 
the enemy means to take the field in a few days, and that they have 
little less than 700 negroes armed for the purpose. The British horse 
were at Dorchester yesterday, but returned last night.

DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
I am favored with your letter of this day. I know of no way of 
reinforcing you but by Col. Hampton's corps. I will speak with the 
Governor on the subject. At present, I believe we have no spare arms; 
however, I will make more strict enquiry, and let you know. Arms are 
expected from the Northward, but they will be a long time on the road, 
if we are to judge of the future by the past. To enable me to give my 
orders respecting the cannon at <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>, you must send the size of 
the calibres. Every measure should be taken to preserve the provisions, for I am very apprehensive there will be a scarcity. I thank you 
for the enemy's returns of rations drawn. I think it large, but, perhaps, their force may be greater than I imagine,

DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
From many different accounts the enemy threatens us with an attack. 
We have had no small uneasiness in our camp for want of pay, clothing 
and spirits. The discontent has reached the enemy, and it is confidently asserted that they are coming out to take advantage of it. I 
</p><p>
think it necessary, therefore, as I am not well informed of the full ex 
tent of the discontent, to call our force together from all parts, as well 
to awe the malcontents, if any there be, as to prevent the enemy from 
attempting anything in consequence thereof. I beg you will, therefore, 
march and join us as soon as possible, with all your force, except a 
small recounoitering party; and, although this may expose a greater 
part of the country, yet it will serve to secure a greater object. I beg 
you will lose no time.

DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
Yours of the 16th June and 8th July I have had the pleasure to 
receive, and am made happy that you have brought Major Ganey, and 
his party, to submit to the laws of the State without making much use 
of force. Nothing reflects more honor upon an officer than accomplishing that by address which others could effect only by force; to save the 
effusion of human blood must be the wish of every humane and generous 
bosom. I fancy you must be mistaken about Mr. RavenePs being in 
confinement. Capt. Warren, our Commissary of prisoners, was in town 
to examine the state of all the prisoners, as well militia as regulars; his 
report contains no such thing. Capt. SkeJly is released in consideration of Judge Pendleton being set at liberty. The Judge has come 
out, and Capt. Skelly gone in. Should it be found that Mr. Ravenel 
is in confinement, which I cannot suppose, I will write to Gen. Leslie 
on the subject. It is evidently for the interest of those corps of Maham 
and Hampton to be incorporated. Neither would have existence long 
without it; but, by being consolidated, they will have, perhaps, a permanency during the war, and provision made for them accordingly. 
You will inform the officers thereof, that it is a matter settled between 
the Governor and myself, that the two corps be united, and that they 
are to be considered in future upon the State establishment. This was 
thought advisable after the fullest examination of the matter, and I 
</p><p>
hope the officers will make no difficulty in concurring in a measure 
equally beneficial to them, as necessary for the public good. The requisition for the militia was upon the supposition that the garrison of 
<a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> might come to Charlestown, and give the enemy such an 
additional force as to enable them to give a blow to our army. I believe 
<a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> is not fully evacuated, and therefore nothing to apprehend at 
present; you will remain, therefore, on the other side of Cooper River, 
between that and Santee, to protect the people from the daily depredations of little parties from Charlestown. If the garrison of <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> 
arrives, I will notify you, and direct you where to form a junction with 
me. It is said that Fanning is determined to have you, dead or alive, 
therefore, take care of yourself. It is, also, reported, by a person in the 
enemy's secrets, that a large party of the enemy is to move out soon 
into St. Thomas and St. Stephens parishes.

DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
I have just got your letter of this day, dated at Wasmasaw. No 
thing ever surprised me more. I was in the highest hopes you were 
at or near <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>. Mr. Singleton, by whom I wrote, was fully 
informed of the contents of the letter, and the necessity of its being 
delivered with all possible dispatch. He had a letter for Col. Lushington, and promised to have it delivered in <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a> the day fol 
lowing the date of your letter, by 10 o clock, and yours I expected 
</p><p>
would have got to you by one in the morning, and you on your march 
before sunrise. Never did I feel such a vexatious disappointment in 
all the course of my life. I beg you will make enquiry into the cause 
of the delay, as you write that mine never got to your hands until this 
morning. Somebody deserves nothing short of hanging. I am afraid 
you will now arrive too late to be of any service, unless the goods should 
be got up the rivers, and your force deter the enemy from following 
them. Since I wrote you, the enemy's intentions have been again con 
firmed by repeated accounts. I need not urge you to use all possible 
dispatch in marching to the relief of the place, as your own zeal will 
stimulate you to do all in your power. I have not heard anything from 
the party that crossed to Haddrell's Point, whether they proceeded or 
not; but, in order to alarm their fears, I made a move in force towards 
James Island, to induce them, if possible, to countermand the order. 
I beg you will let me hear from you respecting the progress the enemy 
has made, and if they have attempted anything, and how far they were 
successful. If the enemy has not made the descent, you will wait in 
the neighborhood of <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a> until you hear further from me. I 
consider the disappointment of your not getting my letter the greater, 
as I find your force so respectable, as they appear by your returns. 
I am, sir, your obedient servant,

DEAR GENERAL : 
</p><p>
I have just received your letter of the 5th. I am sorry the enemy 
is so situated as to give them an opportunity to carry off the produce of 
the country, without your having it in your power to injure them. 
Cannot small parties interrupt them, or is there any move that we can 
make that may tend to dislodge them. Great preparations are making 
in Charlestown for the evacuation of the place. I am persuaded it 
will take place soon, and the more scanty we can render their supplies 
of provisions, the sooner it will happen, and the fewer negroes they will 
have in their power to take with them. I am glad you have got through 
the disagreeable business of uniting Maham's and Hampton's corps. 
In the present form I am in hopes they will be useful. Should the enemy 
leave Santee, you will cross the river and move towards the Cooper. 
But it is necessary I should inform you that the enemy are advised of 
my wishes on this head, having taken Mr. Singleton with a number of 
letters among others, one for you. With respect to the beef collectors, 
I am a stranger to it. We have no Commissaries of our own, they are 
all under the government of Mr. Hort, and by him appointed. But I 
should not suppose these people will dare to rise in the present situation of things, and it is necessary they should contribute to the support 
of the army as well as other parts of the State.

DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 20th July, came safe to hand. The dissolution of 
your corps, or rather embodying it with other corps, I think a prudent 
measure. At present, I have no commands which will interfere with 
your wishes for retiring. All the cavalry corps are incorporated into 
one, and the great probability of a speedy evacuation of Charlestown 
will, I hope, render your further services unnecessary. Whether you 
</p><p>
are a supernumerary or not, don t depend on my opinion; but if those 
letters are all you have to found your claim upon, I think you are not, 
however great your sufferings, expense and trouble, since I have been 
to the Southward. I flatter myself you feel yourself happy in the 
reflection that you have aided your country in the hour of her greatest 
distress, and that the efforts have contributed to her deliverance. I 
sincerely thank you for your polite attentions to all my wishes, and for 
the very essential service which you have rendered the public and me 
in the arduous struggle.

DEAR SIR :

I have this moment received your letter of the 23d inst. Since the 
letter written by Major Burnet yesterday, I have been informed that 
a fleet, consisting of one sloop-of-war, three galleys, three armed brigs, 
with ten empty sloops and schooners, having 500 infantry under Major 
Brewerton and Doyle on board, passed the bar of Charlestown early 
yesterday morning, destined for Santee and Cambahee, to collect rice. 
It was supposed they would divide the force nearly equal. I have no 
doubt but you will take measures to make them pay dearly for the rice 
they may collect on Santee. I am, dear sir, with esteem and regard^

DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
I have just got letters from Gen. Gist, giving an account of a little 
action between <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague met'>Col. Laurens</a> and the enemy, about twelve miles below 
the ferry on Combahee, where he had taken post, and thrown up a 
little work to fire on the enemy's shipping, as they passed down the 
river. The enemy landed in considerable force. The Colonel's party 
being small, was beat back, in which conflict the Colonel fell, and we 
had the mortification to lose a howitzer. Gen. Gist got up just time 
enough to save the party from suffering further injury. We had twenty-four killed, wounded and missing. After this action the enemy embarked, and went down the river to the mouth of it, where they lay 
when Gen. Gist's dispatches came away; it is said they are going to 
Port Royal. There is no mention made of the enemy's loss; but they 
must have suffered considerably, and I believe they have got little or 
no rice. This is the substance of the General's letter. I lament the 
unhappy fate of <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague met'>Col. Laurens</a>. I am, with great respect, 
Your Excellency's most obedient humble servant,

DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
I most sincerely congratulate you upon the very honorable check you 
gave the enemy, and I am happy to hear you give such ample testimony 
to the bravery and firmness of the militia. I wish in every part of the 
State they were equally deserving the same applause. From what has 
passed, you may see how little dependence is to be placed in the enemy's 
peaceable professions. It gives me the highest satisfaction to find that 
they are disappointed in their expectations of finding you off your guard, 
from the arts that had been practised to effect it. At the close of every 
month, you will give me a return of the Continental and State troops, 
and the militia serving under your command, specifying where they are 
employed, and for what purpose, as I want to give the minister of war 
as satisfactory an account as possible of the force of this country. 
I am, dear sir, your most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>

DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
I have received your letter by Mr. Pollock, with the returns enclosed. 
Intelligence from town induces me to believe the enemy are making 
preparations for another expedition after provision, and that the neighborhood of <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a> will be their object, if there is a large quantity 
of provisions near that place. I beg that some steps may be taken for 
removing the rice, if possible, or for effectually covering the country 
from the ravages of the enemy. I am unable, at this distance, to deter 
mine with precision the position you ought to take, or the measures 
you have it in your power to pursue, to oppose their designs. You 
will, therefore, adopt the plan which you think most eligible. 
I am, dear sir, your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>

SIR: 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 28th inst. I have this moment received. Capt. 
Warren has written to you requesting the prisoners, mentioned in the 
list you enclosed, might be sent to Charlestown, except the dragoons, as 
they were exchanged by an agreement entered into the 23d instant, 
by which all citizens and militia of every rank and denomination, made 
prisoners of war previous to that date, southward of the Delaware 
River, with all the volunteers, and many Continental officers, a list of 
whose names will be immediately published by the Commissary of 
Prisoners. The safe-guard had certainly, by his conduct, forfeited 
his protection. I wish, however, you would send him to Gen. Leslie, 
with a remonstrance against the irregularities committed. Should 
there be an opportunity of injuring the enemy at the distillery, by a 
detachment from this army, I beg you will send me such intelligence 
as to enable me to give you the necessary aid. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, sir, with much esteem, your obdt. servant, 
</p><p>
