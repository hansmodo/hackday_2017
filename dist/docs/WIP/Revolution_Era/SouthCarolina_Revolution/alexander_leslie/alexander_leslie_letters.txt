SIR: 
</p><p>
It was with deep concern I viewed, on the proceedings of the last 
sessions of your Assembly, acts for amercing the property of some 
persons, and confiscating that of others, whose principles had attached 
them to the cause of their Sovereign. Yet, alarming as these public 
resolutions appeared, I was in hopes humanity, as well as policy, would 
have arrested their execution, and that I should not have been compelled to take measures for their counteraction, injurious to the country, 
and therefore painful to me; but when these hopes were disappointed, 
and I found the effects of the loyal and well-affected removed from their 
estates, and carried to parts far distant from them, I could no longer 
remain the quiet spectator of their distresses; but, in order to induce a 
more just line of conduct, have employed a part of the force intrusted to 
my charge for their protection, in seizing the negroes of your friends, 
that restitution may be thereby made to such of ours as may suffer 
under these oppressive and ruinous resolutions. This, sir, was the 
object of the late excursion towards Santee, and these principles will 
greatly mark the future operations of this army, unless a relinquishment of this assumed right on your part should justify less destructive 
measures on mine. To point out to you, or the world, the distinction 
between temporary sequestration and actual confiscation, would be im 
pertinence; but, will by no means be so to observe on the opposite con
duct, pursued by each party in carrying into execution these very different measures, for which you have endeavored to involve in perpetual 
ruin the persons and estates of those whose violent opposition to the 
King s Government compelled the withholding from them, for a time, 
their possessions in this province, for the great attention which has 
been invariably paid to their property the connected state in which it 
was preserved, and the liberal allowances that were made to their fami 
lies insomuch, that whilst other estates were running to waste by the 
distractions of the country, these have greatly thriven at the expense 
of Government. Thus far I have deemed it necessary to urge the 
motives of humanity, policy and example, for your suspension of such 
rigorous procedures; and should you think a meeting of Commissioners 
on each side might tend to lessen the devastations of war, and secure 
inviolate the property of individuals, I shall have a peculiar happiness 
in embracing proposals that may accomplish such benevolent purposes. 
But if, notwithstanding this earnest representation, you should still per 
severe in executing these Acts of your Assembly, I trust this letter will 
hold me justifiable to the world for any measures which necessity may 
adopt, in counteraction of steps unjust in their principles, and person 
ally distressing in their consequences; and that whilst I only endeavor 
to secure to those who, with respectable steadiness, have attached them 
selves to our cause, the full possession of their effects, or, in case of 
losses, to provide an equitable restitution for them, I shall be clearly 
exculpated from all the honors and calamities which the road you now 
point out unavoidably leads to. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, sir, your most obdt. and humble servant,

SIR: 
</p><p>
Capt. Skelly having stated to me the queries he had the honor to 
receive from you, respecting the papers I submitted to your consideration, and what official authority I had for proposing a cessation of hostilities, and believing a treaty for terminating the war was now carrying 
on, I have, therefore, to inform you that those papers were transmitted 
to me by his Excellency, Sir Henry Clinton, accompanied by the Right 
Hon. Welbore Ellis, then one of his Majesty s principal secretaries of 
State, referring generally for my conduct in this respect ; and that, I 
suppose, not only from the weight of their authority, but likewise from 
the explicit terms in which they convey the sense of his Majesty and 
the British House of Commons. Fuller instructions I momently expect from our present Commander-in-Chief, Sir Guy Carlton, whose 
appointment and arrival in America has not yet been regularly notified 
to me. Thus, sir, I have explicitly stated to you the mode and circumstances under which these important papers have reached me; and as I 
can have no doubt from current report, and the nature of these documents, that a suspension of hostilities has taken place to the Northward, 
and that a treaty to conclude the war is now carrying on, I held it a 
duty I owed the rights of humanity, the welfare of this country, and 
the sentiments of the Legislature, of my own to propose, that such a 
cessation should take place here, and this proposal, from these motives, 
I again renew, and will depute, if it meets your concurrence, commissioners to settle the terms of it, and for securing the interests, as well 
civil as military of each party, in the present state, assuring you, at the 
same time, you will have the earliest notice of what instructions and 
advice I may receive on this head from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
</p><p>
I have the honor to be, sir, your most obedient, &c.,

DEAR SKELLY : 
</p><p>
I am glad to hear you are well. Mr. Scott showed me a letter from 
you. I fear the Commandant of <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a> cannot settle anything in 
regard to your exchange, however, on your arrival in this city. I do 
assure you that Lieut. Raven el shall be immediately parolled, and sent 
out of town. I am going to a grand German fete champetre. I hope 
you got mine by Mr, Bordeaux. 
</p><p>
Yours, in haste, 
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=all" rel="me">A. LESLIE</a>. 
</p><p>
You shall hear from me very soon, if I don t see you.
