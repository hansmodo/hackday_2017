MY DEAR : 
</p><p>
I have nothing more than I have enclosed of the 1st instant. As to the news, our army is very strong, and in high spirits. There was a 
probability of an action the other day, and it appeared to be the hearty desire of every man to come to action j but it was not thought expedient 
by the General, and we returned to camp. We are now laying in camp, where I expect to lay for several days. As to particulars, I refer 
you to Major Gillam. I desire that Daniel will use his utmost endeavors to have the mills in the best order against harvest.'t was 
speaking to him in regard to trying to plant that field over the road in corn; but that I submit to him, and he may do as he pleases. I hope 
that the utmost care will be taken by him to save the crop that is planted. My wagon that I rode in with, is at Ninety-Six; send Daniel 
to bring it home, and have it put under a shed. I purpose to sell it 
when I return home. I desire you, my dear, to send me about half-apound of cloves and cinnamon by Major Gillam; what I brought I have 
used, and find it a great help to me. The water fs so bad that I make as little use of it as possible. Major Gillam has corne to bring a relief 
for the men that are here. If it is possible, I should be glad that you could send me an under jacket, for the two that I brought with me are breaking before. 
</p><p>
I am, dear wife, with respect, your ever loving husband till death,

</p><p>
DEAR SON : 
</p><p>
This is the first chance I have had to write you. I am, by the care 
of <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>, in the field in defence of my country. When I reflect 
on the matter, I feel myself distracted on both hands by this thought, that in my old age I should be obliged to take the field in defence of 
my rights and liberties, and that of my children. God only knows 
that it is not of choice, but of necessity, and from the consideration 
that I had rather suffer anything than lose my birthright, and that of 
my children, When I come to lay down in the field, stripped of all 
the pleasure that my family connections afford me at home- surrounded 
by an affectionate wife and eight dear children, and all the blessings of 
life when I reflect on my own distress, I feel for that of my family, 
on account of my absence from their midst; and especially for the 
mother, who sits like a dove that has lost its mate, having the weight 
of the family on her shoulders. These thoughts make me afraid that 
the son we so carefully nursed in our youth may do something that would 
grieve his mother. Now, my son, if my favor is worth seeking, let me 
tell you the only step to procure it is the care of your tender mother 
to please her is ten times more valuable than any other favor that you 
could do me in my person. I hope that when you come to reflect on 
the duty of a son to a tender parent, you will take every step to establish that connection, which will add to my happiness; for it is a pleasure 
to me to know that I have a son who is able to manage my business 
and plantation affairs. Make it your study to be obliging to your 
mother, being careful not to do anything that may grieve her. Take 
the utmost care of every thing that falls under your care, so that you 
may receive, on my return, my thanks, and have the blessing of being 
a faithful and dutiful son to his trust. I would have you to consider 
yourself filling one of the most important posts that could be confided 
in you; and if you should manage well, it will greatly redound to your 
praise. After these serious thoughts, I beg that you will take these 
hints. In the first place, consider that the eye of God is on you, and 
to secure His blessing is the only way to make yourself, and those that 
are concerned with you, happy; for to fear God is the first and great command. 
</p><p>
The next command is, to honor thy. father and mother. Now, the 
only way to do this, is not to do anything that will grieve or oppress 
them. Be kind to your brothers and sisters, and careful to manage the 
business to the interest of the family. Your care and good conduct in 
the management of my plantation adds greatly to my happiness; and I 
can promise you, that you shall feel the good effects of it, for I have 
the pleasure to hear by your tender mother's letter to me, that you. are 
doing very well, and business goes on well. I am happy to hear it. 
I have wrote several times about trying to get a few good horses. 1 
expect by this time you have made the trial ; if you have been successful in procuring some, I shall be glad to hear how many, and what sort 
they are, and I will send some good man to bring them down -if unsuccessful in your effort, no matter. I want Nancy brought to me at that 
time to ride. Try to have the mares in as good order as possible ; be 
careful that they are all well fed; let them be used as little as possible. 
I have traded for a fine English mare, which is on Fishing Creek, at 
Mr. Win. Adair s; the order is enclosed for her. I wish you could 
get a man to go for her, or spare the time to go yourself, as she is a 
valuable animal. If you go, Mr. Adair will, doubtless, be saying some 
thing about her. She was taken from MeGirth by Capt. Moore, and I 
bought his right of her; she is a young, full-blood mare, and has no 
brand on her unless Adair has branded her since she has been to his 
house. He took her up in favor of Capt. Moore, and since she was 
carried from camp I traded for her. I want her got home with as little 
stir as possible, and branded on both cushions with my branding iron; 
and let it be said that I bought her of a man on Fishing Creek, and paid 
$1,000. My reason for begging you to go for her is, that it may not 
be known she is a plunder mare; and when we have the pleasure of 
meeting, I will put you in possession of all the particulars regarding 
her. I shall be glad if you put her to the horse as soon as you get her. 
On all necessary occasions get Mr. Griffin to help you about the plantation. Regarding the horses I wrote you about, you may either come 
or let it alone, just as you please, as I can send for them if you have 
any agreeable to my direction. 
</p><p>
I am sorry I have to inform you of the melancholy death of Anthony 
Griffin, which took place on the 11th instant, while out with a scouting 
party. Alighting from his horse, and leaning on his gun, it accidentally went off, shooting him through the head. He never spoke after 
the accident. This is the fatal consequence of handling guns without proper care ; they ought to be used with the greatest caution. The 
uncertainty of life ought to induce every man to prepare for death. 
</p><p>
As for news, I have nothing more to communicate than what I wrote 
last to your dear mother. I hope every thing will be done to have the 
mill in as good order as possible, to grind up the wheat; and as soon 
as you can, supply the saw mill with timber, as I desire it put in operation. In regard to whiskey, I think you must raise the price of it, in 
order to have things as much on an average as possible. I think you 
ought to sell it at two dollars a quart; if by retail, one dollar a half 
pint. Secure all you can at 35 per 110 gallons. I am in hopes of 
being at home by the 1st July, to see my family. I shall be glad to 
hear from you by every opportunity. Son, I think if you manage matters well, and I am spared, I can put affairs in such a state that, under 
the blessing of God, we may stand in as good a position as any family 
in the State. Pray, let no pains be spared to make every edge cut, 
and have the crops secured in the best manner, as much depend on 
them. 
</p><p>
Now, my son, I must bid you farewell. I commit you to the care of Providence, begging that you will try to obtain that peculiar blessing. 
May God bless you, my son, and give you grace to conduct yourself, in my absence, as becomes a dutiful son to a tender mother and the family. 
I am in reasonable good health at present, and the regiment as much so as could be expected. The death of Griffin is much lamented. I 
hope in God this will find you, my son, and your dear mother and the children, all well. My best compliments to you all, and all enquiring friends. 
</p><p>
I am, dear son, with great respect, your affectionate father,

DEAR WIFE : 
</p><p>
I wrote a letter last night to you, my love, that gave you the best intelligence that I have been able to get. I have every reason to believe 
that the matter is settled before this j and as you may in confidence depend that whenever I am able to get the truth of matters I will transmit it to you, by express. I beg that you may bear with fortitude 
my absence ; and let us with humble confidence rely on Him that is able to protect and defend us, in all danger, and through every difficulty ; but, my dear, let us, with one heart, call on God for his mercies, 
and that his goodness may be continued to us, that we, under his blessing, may have the happiness of enjoying each other's society once more. 
I mentioned in my last letter about the salt. I beg that you may have it well dried and ground in the mill and then you are to sell it for 
one hundred dollars per bushel. Let Sam have the wheat sown as soon as possible, and I beg that you may take a little time to see about the 
plantation, and make Samuel do what is best to be done. As to Lea, I hope you will let no one have her without an order from me in writing, 
and signed by me. My compliments to you, my dear, and my children and friends. 
</p><p>
I am, dear wife, with great respect, 
</p><p>
your ever loving husband, until death,

DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
I received your favor by master George, and have carefully observed the contents. I have had a Captain, one Sergeant, and 8 picked men 
out in the upper part of my regiment for some time, in order to prevent those fellows from plundering the good people, and to have them taken 
and brought to justice. I am about to try to embody a part of the regiment to send to town ; how they will turn out I can't tell, but I fear 
but poorly. I have made it as public in these parts, as possible, about 
the Governor promising to get salt for the back country ; and it has 
given some satisfaction to the people but at present it is bad, for 
many a poor man is obliged to turn out his hogs for the want of salt. 
To my knowledge some people must suffer greatly. I have sent a pay 
bill of Capt. I. Gray's with Mr. McNear to get the money, and should 
take it as a singular favor if it could be got. The Captain deserted his 
country, and the men will probably lose their money, and I am likely 
to be a great loser by it myself. I have advanced a great part of their 
</p><p>
wages to them myself. If I could get the money, I am going to that 
part of the regiment, and will settle with every man myself. If it is 
possible, I should be glad to get the money, as I am going to that part 
of the regiment the latter end of this week. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, your most respectful and humble servant,

MR. WILLIAMS TO MRS. WILLIAMS.

</p><p>
DEAR WIFE : 
</p><p>
My anxiety for you and my dear children, far exceeds anything that I am able to express ; not knowing your distress but I trust in God that 
His guardian care has been over you for your protection ; I have earnestly requested the favor of heaven on you. I have had some 
accounts from you, but they were very imperfect. I pray God that I may have the happiness of seeing you my love at Mount Pleasant in the 
course of this month, with a force sufficient to repel all the Tories in the upper part of South Carolina. I have been informed that many false 
stories are in circulation in our country to the disheartening of our friends in that quarter of the State. I give the true state of things 
touching our army, and you, my love, and all my friends, may depend on it to be the truth. I was at my brother's and settled my family on 
as good terms as possible, and left him well with his family. I left there on the 29th of last month; that day, Major General De Kalb and 
<a href='/results.php?tla=atw' rel=''>General Wayne</a> and Smallwood, with the Maryland and Pennsylvania troops to the amount of 3,000, and 2,500 from Virginia, are on the 
march from Roxbury in order to join Major General Caswell with about 2,000 North Carolina militia, and about 200 regular light horse ; on 
the whole, 7,700, that is now in motion, and will be at Camden in the course of six or seven days, which may put a different face on matters. 
And there are 5,500 Virginia militia marching that will be here shortly, (and 2,000 North Carolina militia, under General Rutherford, that is to 
march to Ninety -six,) with some South Carolina militia commanded by Col. Sumter, to the amount of 500, now in camp at this place, and are 
expected to cross the river to-day, with about 500 of the Mecklenburg militia, Over and above all these, there are 4,000 more North Carolina 
militia to march as soon as harvest is over. On the whole, I expect we will shortly meet the tories, when they must give an account of their late 
conduct. I can assure you, my dear, that there is a large French Fleet and army on our coast. I think, from these circumstances, that our 
affairs are in a nattering condition at present. I expect you have heard of Moore's defeat, in the fork of the Catawba by a detached party from 
General Rutherford, under Capt. Falls, not exceeding 350, that defeated 1300 tories, and took their baggage, with about 500 horses and saddles 
and guns, and left 35 on the field dead. Since that General Caswell has defeated the English at the Cheraws, and cut off the 71st Regiment 
entirely. I can assure you and my friends that the English have never been able to make a stand in North Carolina yet, and they have slipt 
their time now, for they or retreating to Charlestown with all rapidity. From this you may see, under the blessing of God that we will soon 
relieve our distressed families and friends ; so bear up with fortitude till that happy day comes. I hope in God this will find you, my dear wife, 
and my children all well. My compliments to you and my children and friends that inquire after me. Myself and Capt. Hays, Daniel and 
the boys are all hearty ; God be blest for His mercy to us. 
</p><p>
The uncertainty of your situation is my great mortification; but let our joint prayers meet in Heaven for each other and our bleeding 
country. The Rev. Mr. Simson has had his house and every thing he had but the clothing the family had on destroyed, and he is in camp 
with rue and Mr. Croghead, and is part of my family in camp. Mr. Simson, Mr. Croghead, and Capt. Hays, join me in our compliments to you, my love and friends. 
</p><p>
I am with great regard your loving husband till death,
