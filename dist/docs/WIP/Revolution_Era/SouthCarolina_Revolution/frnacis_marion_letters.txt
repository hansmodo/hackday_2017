DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
I am informed that a Capt. Howell, in a N. W. cutter, has taken 
the flag schooner which G-en. Greene ordered to load with rice. I hope 
you have prevented her being carried away. You will confine Captain 
Howell for infringing a flag contrary to <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a>'s passport ; his vessel 
and crew must also be secured and confined as plunderers until I have 
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a>'s and the Governor's orders and directions, and the schooner 
be permitted to sail without delay for Charlestown. I have heard from 
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a> there has not been any action, as was reported; the firing 
heard was within the enemy's lines, and proved to be a field day with 
them. As it is possible the enemy may make another excursion in the 
country, you will send me every horse you have, that can be of the 
least service, as I am determined to oppose them at all events. There 
are only two officers, and twenty-eight non-commissioned and privates 
here the rest have been sent away by the officers on frivolous pretences. 
Mr. Lesesne is absent without leave, Mr. Wragg also ; if he is a volunteer he must be discharged, and not suffered in future to be on the 
Commissary Department. Mr. Guerry is absent without leave, and 
must be dismissed. I expect every officer and private will be sent me 
that is able to act. I have had no answer from the General respecting 
the reduction of the corps, and have again wrote him on that subject 
yesterday. You will go on in equipping and arming your men as usual; 
and as soon as I hear from <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a>, will send you a power to impress horses to make up your losses. I wish you would procure the 
ruin, sugar and coffee, formerly mentioned to you. If a stop is put to 
the injurious proceedings of the N. W. privateers, I shall be able to 
procure clothing, &c., &c., for our army, and again complete your men 
with those articles. I shall remain here some time. 
I am, your obedient servant,

DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
Yours of the 8th ultimo came to hand. By the papers just sent me, 
it appears that Capt. Howell had the candles sold to the flag people, on 
purpose to have a plea of seizing her; you will, therefore, order the 
flag to sail immediately, and Capt. Howell and his vessel's crew to be 
detained, as I wrote you yesterday, until I hear from <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a> or 
the Governor. If Botard should take her at sea, we have nothing to 
do with it. You will put Moore, Broderick and Myers on board the 
flag vessel, to return to Charlestown, with orders not to return within 
our lines. In answer to your last post, I wrote you yesterday; have 
not heard from head-quarters since. A letter from Capt. Pinckney, Cainhoy, says the British horse were crossing to Haddrell's on Saturday, 
but it comes by such a hand that I don t believe it. I shall hear more to-day.

SIR: 
</p><p>
Yours by Mr. Cest came to hand. I wrote per Dragoon respecting 
Capt. Howell and the flag. Messrs. Doughty and Ancruni are not to do 
duty your way. I shall have such men returned as have served their 
month. I cannot send you the militia law; have none by me. I wrote 
you before that Capt. Weyman had it, and you might get it from him. 
I sent Capt. Stephens to <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>, only to stay until his corps re 
turned. I wrote the Governor respecting Mr. Wayne's account, and think he is rather impatient. I have had no answer yet to my letters, 
and hope you will make yourself easy until I can fully satisfy you, 
which will be as soon as I get an answer from the General. I have 
some accounts of the enemy's coming over to St. Thomas , and wish I 
had every horse you have that can be of any service, as I find I am 
under the necessity of attacking them.

DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
Since I wrote the enclosed, I have received a letter from <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a>. His orders are, not to suffer the flag schooner to be taken or 
detained. You will follow my orders respecting that business. I have 
answered Capt. Howell's letter by this opportunity. In respect to your 
corps, the General and Governor approves of the plan of dismounting 
them, to act in <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a> as infantry; but will not impress any more 
horses for the service of either corps, as their time will so soon expire, 
and it seems not their intention of keeping them up longer. I shall 
write you fuller in my next.

SIR: 
</p><p>
Yours of the llth ultimo is before me. If you suffer Moore and Broderick to remain, they must give bail for their good behavior; each 
to give two good sureties, bound in five hundred guineas each, and to do six months duty in the militia; the bond to be executed before 
a Justice of the Peace. Mr. Lesesne must certainly pay his rent; but it is a matter I have nothing to do with ; as it is a civil affair between citizen and citizen, there is a way pointed out by law. He 
never had any promises from me of a billet, which ought not to be 
done but on the greatest necessity, as it is a grievance to the people, 
which at all times ought to be avoided when it can. If it can be 
proved that Solomon Miller has cheated or defrauded the public, he 
should suffer agreeably to law, which is, to have a hearing before a 
Justice of the Peace, and, if found guilty, must go to jail, or give security to appear at the next sessions. Capt. Gough told me he had 
leave of absence for a month. As the Governor and <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a> have 
come into the plan of dismounting your corps "to act as infantry under 
you, if it is agreeable to you; if not, to remain as they are, without 
the liberty of impressing any horses for them, for their time of service 
is so short, it is not worth going to that expense, neither will they let 
Maham impress any more horses, and without more horses, &c., &c., 
the few you have cannot be of any service. I will make the proper 
arrangement, but will not do it without you signify your approbation, 
which I will wait for. The four barrels indigo, in the hands of Paul 
Trapier, Esq., you will take for public uses, and may procure clothing 
for our troops, and rum, sugar, &c. I wish the flag could sail, that 
Capt. Howell and crew may be dismissed. In my last I mentioned the 
British being up in St. Thomas , but believe it is premature, as my 
party of observation, who are down towards Cain hoy, have given me 
no account of it. For want of forage and subsistence, I shall remove 
to-day above Murray's Ferry, in St. Stephens ; indeed, I shall be 
obliged to move often, to prevent the enemy forming any plan against 
me. I am very sensible the trouble you must have in your command 
in <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>, but your well known abilities and zeal for your country 
will surmount everything.

DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
I have got thus far in my return from the Southward. I have been 
within eight miles of Bacon Bridge, and have had a hard march for no 
purpose. The General imagined the enemy was coming out, and is 
still of the opinion they will take the field soon ; but I think they will 
not without a reinforcement, which it seems they expect, as they have 
don e for six months past. I hope the flag schooner is sailed; if so, 
discharge Capt. Howell's crew and cutter. Col. Moultrie is to stay in 
<a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>, and collect his regiment; he will be of service to you at 
least, will not keep you so much confined. I shall send Col. Maham 
for the horses of your corps as soon as I hear from you. I intend to 
leave you thirteen, but they must not be the best. I will send you 
arms as soon as I get them from the high hills of Santee. 
I am, yours, &c.,

SIR:

Yours of the 12th came to hand yesterday, on my march here. I 
wrote you before respecting Brodrick and Moore, to take bail for their 
appearance at court, and good behavior. The Georgia refugees must 
do duty, if they have been in this State three months. No excuse to 
be taken for not doing duty. Let me know if the flag has sailed; and, 
if you have not discharged Howell and crew, it must be done immediately. Send me the calibre of the different pieces of cannon you have, 
that I may procure shot for them ; also, other articles which may be 
wanted. I wrote you yesterday by Col. Moultrie.

DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
I received yours of the 17th. The flag must be sent immediately 
back, with all her cargo, passengers, attendance, goods, &c., &c., except Mrs. Shad, Mrs. Barnes and Miss Simmons, and their attendances 
and property; and I positively order no other man, woman or servants, 
or any property, be landed, or suffered to come ashore but the vessel 
ordered immediately to go out of the harbor, on pain of being made a 
prize in twenty-four hours after such notice be given; and you are 
hereby ordered to make prize of said vessel, cargo, &c., &c., and the 
captain, crew and passengers to put in close confinement, without suffering any person whatever to visit or speak to either of said prisoners, 
until rny further orders. McClean, with his companions, must be kept in close confinement until a proper opportunity offers to send them to the Governor of North Carolina. Col.'s is trading on his private 
account, and I am not surprised at anything he has, or can do; he is no friend. I wrote you respecting the pilots, and I left you to act as 
you pleased respecting the boat mentioned in my last. Mr. Chatelleat has my pass to go to the Northward. You will permit the flag to carry 
one barrel of rice, and a few poultry, for the relief of Mr. John Clements, a prisoner, and wounded in Charlestown; he is one of my brigade. 
No officer ever had a right to public horses; but those you have you will keep, and you have a right to them, until my further orders. The 
officers and men of your corps here must remain as yet. The report of galley or armed vessels to go to <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>, I do not think true, as 
I had a letter from Charlestown last evening, that says a French fleet is at Tybee; and, from the person it came from, I have reason to believe it may be true.

I am, with esteem, your obedient servant,

P ? S. Since I wrote the above, I have perused the papers sent, and 
find Col. Ray is exchanged; he and the others mentioned in General 
Butler's pass are to be put on board the flag vessel, and suffered to proceed to Charlestown.

SIR:

Enclosed is a return of the companies which are to do duty in George 
town. Warden's and Long's will be sent to you. I also send you the 
militia laws. The Governor wrote you that Commodore Gillon has 
carried in five Jamaica prizes in the Havanna, worth 150,000 dollars. 
Two of the prizes are expected in <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>, and the Governor desires 
the pilot to keep a good look out for them. Several of your men wish 
to enlist in the infantry, on the new bounty. Such as have but two 
months to serve in your corps, may be discharged, on condition of 
enlisting for three years, or during the war. I send two men, with their 
attestations, which cannot be sworn to until your discharge is obtained, 
which please see done, and give them the enclosed orders to Swinton 
for their negroes, and grant them one month furlough. Mr. Shrewsberry will wait on you he is a shipwright, and may be useful; but he 
must be watched, for he has been, and is, much suspected. He will 
want to send a boat to Dewees Island for some goods, osnaburgs and 
Russian drab, which is for our soldiers. You will please give him a 
pass for that boat, and receive the goods; but he must not be suffered 
to go out of <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>. I will send fifty stand of arms, and pouches 
with ammunition. Col. Moultrie will want some of them, and you are 
to take what he may not want at present, until I get more from Gen 
Greene.

you last night, and enclosed Meyer's account, but the letter is lost. You will pay him out of the indigo and rice you have in your hands; 
if not sufficient, he must wait. I am called to join <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a>. You will keep a good look-out, lest the enemy form an attack against you ; 
and let it be always a rule to be ready at a moment, if a retreat should be necessary, as my former orders. I shall be absent I fear some time. 
A wagon, with fifty stand of arms, is on its way from High Hills for you. Should you want ammunition, send to Mr. William Richardson. 
I am told your officers have public horses, and the best; they must be given up, and all your horses and men that are out must be called in

relieve those at Cat Island by some other men. I hope by this you 
</p><p>
have received the arms. Send me by the first opportunity a general 
return of your corps, of men, horses, saddles and arms; as you have 
all the officers except Maxwell, you cannot be at a loss. If any officers 
or men are on a furlough, you must call them in, and give no more leave 
of absence on any account. I shall send a waggon for rum, sugar and 
coffee; please get it ready for me. This place is a starving hole, where 
nothing can be had, and nothing can be expected but hard knocks. 
Gen. O'Hara and seventeen empty transports are arrived, and Gen.

You will deliver all the horses you have, with the saddles, bridles, halter, and swords, except 14 of the ordinary horses which you will keep

permission to send to Charlestown some tobacco to procure necessaries for the army You will give him passes when he applies for it, and receive whatever clothing he may get. I sent you a letter by Comodore Lockwood, informing that the British intend to go to <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>, under 
French colors and dress; you will, I dare say, prevent their deception from taking effect. I am apprehensive they will go to Waccamaw ; 
you will keep some boats ready at the ferry above Wragg's to cross over a few men on Waccamaw. Should they go there, a fire or two on them

from the enemy for six months duty. You must endeavor to seize Mrs. M's boat and negroes, and make prize of them, agreeable to the Governor's proclamation; a few men may do it easily. She has no 
pass from the Governor, <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a>, or myself, nor no other person; 
they wish a stop put to it. I have taken steps with Mrs. T . In respect to the regulation of trade, we must submit to superior power. 
I believe that scoundrel you mention has misrepresented to the Governor, I do not know any letters of yours I have not answered. Mr. Dillon, or any other Continental commissary, have nothing to do with 
the hides or tallow of the militia forces. Mr. Samuel Dwight is appointed by <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a> commissary of issues, for the port of George 
town, in the Continental line; White must act as commissary of purchases. I am sorry to see so few horses of your regiment to be had, 
out of so great a number. The officers must give a particular account 
how they are gone, or it can never be settled. Saunders is resigned. 
You certainly have a right to make what regulation you think proper in your corps. I shall march from here on Sunday for . The 
news is, that the Parliament have unanimously resolved that whoever 
advises the King to continue the war in America, shall be deemed a 
traitor and enemy to the country, and have petitioned him to discontinue the American war. His answer is, that he shall comply with the 
wishes of his Parliament. All the offensive ministers are put out, and 
Lord Rockingham is at the head of the administration, and it is expected 
peace will soon be concluded. The letter sent by <a href='/results.php?tla=all' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Leslie</a> to Gen. 
Greene proposes cessation of hostilities ; it is said this has taken place 
at the -Northward. It is believed that Count de Grasse and six ships of 
war were taken in the West Indies in the late fight; but the French 
and Spaniards have yet got the superiority of those seas. Please send 
the letters to Murrell, Allston and Long. It is necessary their companies should all be with you, to prevent the enemy from taking advantage when the troops are distant. I think there is little danger of the 
enemy attempting your post at this time.

P. S. Postell's men I shall take with me. Warden, Murrell and 
Long, will send you half of their companies.

SIR:

Yours of the 25th came to hand. I wrote you yesterday. It would 
be capital to take these Tories gone to town; about the mouth of Waccamaw will do it I approve much of your sending Capt. Matthews 
in Santee. I am glad to hear the galley is got up. She must be fitted 
and manned for service as soon as possible, and stationed in the conflux 
of Waccamaw, Pee Dee and Sampit Rivers. I enclosed you brevets 
for Capt. Milligan and two lieutenants. The armed schooner will be a 
great addition to our strength and security at your post. All the sails 
and rigging, &c., belonging to the schooner Three Friends, must be to 
fit up the galley. The hulk, sell or dispose to the best advantage for 
the State. I dislike Col. Senff's plan of fortifying <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>. I 
shall visit it soon, and probably throw it wholly aside. I am sorry to 
see you have so few men, but I refer you to my last letter. I will ac 
quaint the General and Governor respecting Capt. Putnam's vessel. 
The powder and lead from Capt. Putnam is seasonable. Let me know 
everything you learn of the Tories movements and preparations, and 
take steps to know it by sending proper persons amongst them for the 
purpose. I believe your danger, if any, will be by water and Pee Dee 
I am, your obedient servant,

SIR: 
</p><p>
My last acquainted you that your letter was laid befoft the Governor 
and Council, Since that, I have received their instructions, and have 
sent Col. Peter Horry, CoL Baxter and Major James, to confer with 
you, and offer such terms as I can, and wish it may be acceded to, and 
prevent the effusion of blood and distresses of the women and children. 
The Colonels will give you a paper, in which you will find the determination of the British making peace with the Americans, which leaves 
you no hope of being supported by them. I have marched thus far 
with my brigade, for the purpose^of either making terms, or prosecu 
ting the war, whenever the term of the truce expires. And you may 
depend that I shall not infringe it until then; but wish that you may 
know your own interest, by submitting in time, and preventing ill con 
sequences from obstinacy, which must terminate in your own and your 
people's destruction, and cannot be prevented when the North Carolinians come on, who are on the march, and are near at hand. Col Horry, and the gentlemen above mentioned, will talk with you, and 
acquaint you with every particular with which they are charged. In 
the meantime, you will consider them under the sanction of a flag of 
truce ; and you, or such men as will meet them at Birche s, shall be 
protected under that sanction.

Col. Richardson acquaints me that there was some men who did not, 
or would not, submit to the terms sent you. All such men will be 
allowed to go to Charlestown, and be considered as prisoners of war, to 
be exchanged for the American prisoners. Their wives and children, 
and such property as is theirs, they will be allowed to take with them, 
except stock and arms, and shall be safely conducted to town on Saturday, or sooner, if possible. I shall be glad to see you at Mr. Burches .

DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
Yours of the 5th inst. came to hand. I am very sorry to hear you 
are yet sick. Yesterday, Major Ganey and myself signed a treaty. 
The principals are to submit it, and those who do not chose it are to 
be permitted to go within the enemy's lines with their wives and children, and their movable property, except stock, which they may sell. 
It seems all the officers will *go, and a few men who are so notorious, 
as they will not be suffered to live. Col. Fanning, with thirty men came a few days ago in the truce, and is thought will endeavor to make 
his way to Charlestown; but it is not unlikely he may make some 
attempt on your post, as his number is increased since he came. You 
will, therefore, guard against any sudden attack, by keeping a look-out 
at Wragg's and Black River Ferries. I am informed your troops receive rations of coffee and sugar I mean the militia with you. I 
never knew that such articles were ever given to troops but in a besieged 
garrison, where provisions are scarce, "and therefore must be stopped. 
Mutton, veal and poultry are not soldiers food. I also am informed, 
that the officer who succeeds you in command, when you are absent, 
gives passes to men to go to Dewees with articles for tradiDg. You 
must give a general order te prevent it, and occasional commandants 
must be notified to take that liberty. Please send me some coffee by 
the bearer, as I am entirely out. You will let me know any particulars 
you may learn, for I find I cannot return soon, as we cannot finish here 
before the 25th ult., which is the time that these who are to go to 
town are to march, and possibly some few on the line, who never were 
subject to any command, may give us further trouble. I am with wishing you a speedy recovery, 
</p><p>
Your obedient servant, 
</p><p>

DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
Yours of the 10th came to hand the last evening, with the coffee, and 
shall be obliged to you to send me a few pounds of sugar per bearer. 
Provisions are so scarce here, that I am obliged to send boats down for 
rice. You will send by express thirty barrels, from whoever may have 
it, without regard of public or private property or engagements. If 
Heriot and Tucker have any by them, it must be taken from them, 
notwithstanding anything they may say, for without a supply I must 
move down, which would be of the worse consequence, until I can fully 
see the treaty properly executed. Mr. Fanning is very busy in recruiting men. On Friday next Ganey is to have a meeting of his people, to 
see who are to go to town, and who stay. I only wait until then, when 
I shall march over the river and overawe those who may be wavering, 
or will not give up or go to town. If Major Skelly is landed, I desire 
he may be parolled in a house where he may be genteelly and politely 
treated; and you will tell them I should have no objection to parole 
him to Charlestown, if he would get Lieut. Henry Ravenel parolled 
within our lines. I am told he is put in the provost; if so, Major Skelly will be detained until he is liberated. You will give the Major 
a flag to <a href='/results.php?tla=all' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Leslie</a>, to effect that matter, and send his letters, after 
perusing them ; this I wish may be done immediately. Enquire of the 
captain of the vessel who captured Major Skelly, if he found no letters 
or papers about him, as he must be charged with some important business to the Commander in Georgia. Three boats set out this day for 
the rice; if they can take more than thirty barrels, they must bring 
them. I beg the rice may be ready by the time they arrive. 
I am, dear sir, your obedient servant,

You will give what you think is a reasonable profit.

SIR: 
</p><p>
Enclosed is a copy of a letter wrote <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a>. If you wish to 
stop all intercourse with the enemy, and prevent any supplies being 
carried into them, the position hinted for the General's cavalry is the only means to effect it. The change of the ministry indicates a prolongation of the war. Our lenient countenance towards those people who 
have surrendered to us, and are carrying a continual trade of provisions to the enemy, has obliged me to warn the people that they will be 
taken into custody under the Sedition Act. So great a trade is carried 
on along Wambo and Goose Creek, to supply the enemy, that all my 
vigilance to stop it is fruitless; and I find, to stop the trade of feeding 
the enemy, it must be effected by taking every person adjacent to town 
and make them prisoners, or keep them a great distance from their 
plantations, and remove all their possessions. Without such a mode, it 
is impossible to prevent the infamous practice. I have already gone in 
some respects in this measure, which I hope will meet with your and 
the Council's approbation. What I have gone into in this respect, is 
only threats, but wish to carry them into execution. My opinion on this 
particular juncture is, that we should act with a determination against 
every man whatever, who may be found playing a false game, without 
which a small reinforcement will ruin everything in the former channel. 
This obliges me to be more particular in having the State legion completed by every means that can be thought of, as Continental cavalry 
cannot be commanded for that service, which I am certain you have 
found by experience. Believe me, good sir, I wish to be clear of every 
public employment; but, to retire when my country calls for my poor 
abilities, I should call cowardice, and am determined, notwithstanding 
my debilitated body, to do everything in my power to see this once 
happy country enjoy its former liberty.

SIR: 
</p><p>
Yesterday I received a letter from Major Call, at Smith s, in Goose Creek. By his account, he expected the enemy was out; but I have 
heard from Haddrell's and Daniel's Island late yesterday, and no troops are out. Marquis Rockingham's death has made a change of ministers, 
Lord Shelburn at the head, who is our most inveterate enemy, which I conceive will prolong the war ; however, I have certain intelligence that 
steps are still taken to evacuate, and am very sanguine it will take place by the 15th of next month. If your cavalry will take post on 
Goose Creek, it would secure my right, and I would have a better opportunity to shut up my left; they being so near in your front, would 
prevent every necessary from being carried in town, and secure your position and mine; the communication would be so near each other, 
that a reciprocal support would be had in three hours. I must beg pardon for this hint; I wish not to exceed the station I am in, and pay every deference to your judgment. Should the enemy attempt 
me, I am determined not to quit this ground without I am forced. I have now thrice the number of men in the field that I had when Frazer 
made his appearance, and I trust I can make my men stand their ground. I could wish a more frequent intercourse of intelligence could 
be between us. At present I am acting without the materials from the Southward to form a judgment of my security. I have the honor to be, with great respect and esteem,
