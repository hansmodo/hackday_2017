SIR: 
</p><p>
I received your letter of the and , and I now enclose you a copy of a letter from Governor Burke, which explains what Ganey 
has been for some time past complaining of. I hope you will pay 
particular attention to Gov. Burke's requisition, that none of the disaffected of his State may be suffered to harbor with Ganey and his party; 
and it would be well to apprize him that if, when driven out of North 
Carolina, they are sheltered by any of his party in this State, it will be 
deemed an infraction of the truce, and consequently the North Carolinians will have a right to enter th e neutral ground, and apprehend 
the fellows wherever they are found. If it can be clearly proved that 
the truce has been violated on their part, how far it might be advisable 
for you to co-operate with the North Carolinians, and by one decisive 
blow crush this infamous banditti, I must leave with you to determine. 
As to the proposal you make respecting Maham's and <a href='/results.php?tla=peh' rel='colleague'>Horry's</a> corps, 
<a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a> and myself having fully considered that matter, have given 
you our opinion thereon, which I suppose you have received ere this. 
But should there be any great difficulty in carrying our determination into 
execution, I have no objection to adopting the mode you now propose, 
if <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a> approves of it, except that part " to recruit Maham's 
corps to one hundred and twenty men/ as the time of service of the 
men will expire in July, therefore, it would not be worth while to incur 
the expense. I am very glad you have got some negroes for the recruiting service. I wish Col. Grimke would continue to furnish you with 
them, and not wait for my orders, which I can give him hereafter, when 
I know the quantity delivered to you. The orders you have lately received from me renders it unnecessary to say anything now respecting 
Mr. Philip Porcher. 
</p><p>
Since writing the above, I have seen <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a>, and he approves 
of <a href='/results.php?tla=peh' rel='colleague'>Horry's</a> corps being continued as infantry, agreeable to your proposal.

SIR: 
</p><p>
I received yours of the 8th instant late last evening. I now write to 
Heriot and Tucker about the indigo, which you will forward to 
them. I answered your former letter respecting Mr. Philip Porcher, 
by referring you to the orders I had given respecting those who should 
come from within the enemy's lines; lest any accidents should have 
happened to that dispatch, I now enclose it. These orders are general, 
therefore unnecessary to observe upon the other. I have already in 
formed you that <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a> and myself agreed to the last proposition 
you made respecting Maham's and <a href='/results.php?tla=peh' rel='colleague'>Horry's</a> corps, which was to continue <a href='/results.php?tla=peh' rel='colleague'>Horry's</a> dismounted, to act as infantry. If the matter can be 
accommodated upon this plan, I shall give myself no further trouble 
about it, as they have so little time to serve. Whilst I am on this subject, I must take notice of the conduct of Mr. Thomas Drayton, who 
was sent to the southward to impress horses. He has made so improper 
a use of the authority given him, that I have been obliged to order him 
on no account to impress another horse, and to return such as he had 
impressed. The reason of my ordering him to return those he had 
taken was, that at all events Maham would have <a href='/results.php?tla=peh' rel='colleague'>Horry's horses</a>, and 
consequently could not want more; however, whether the thing takes 
place or not, the impressing of horses is attended with such ruinous 
consequences, that I am determined not to countenance it. You will, 
therefore, sir, look upon the authority given you on the 6th of March 
last, for impressing horses, as hereby revoked. I have given no com 
missions in the second regiment. I did give <a href='/results.php?tla=top' rel='colleague'>Mr. Thomas Pinckney</a> a 
certificate for a commission in the first regiment before I knew of the 
form observed for commissions in the regiments of this State. You say 
the application can only be made to the Colonel of the regiment. In this 
</p><p>
case the Governor, who has the sole right to appoint if he chooses to 
exercise it, becomes a mere machine. At all events, I shall expect a 
decent regard to be paid to any recommendation from me. This is a 
point I do not think I am at liberty to give up. I should be glad Mr. Hall's baggage was sent forward, as the public papers in it are much 
wanted. 
</p><p>
I am, sir, with esteem and regard, your most obdt. servant,

SIR : 
</p><p>
Your letter of the 10th inst. came safe to hand two days ago. The 
commanders of privateers, knowing their authority, and regardless of our 
unfortunate situation, are determined to add to our distresses, instead 
of contributing towards their relief; indeed, the men who usually command these vessels are needy and avaricious to the last degree, and 
come out with a view of making money by any means that does not 
subject them to be hanged; humanity is a thing they are totally unacquainted with. By a late Act of Congress, all British property, where 
soever found, is made liable to seizure. How far the vessel in question, 
having <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a>'s flag, might have violated, I will not pretend to 
judge, if it is put upon this issue; thus its rests with <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a> to 
take cognizance of the affair. But in the light the matter at present 
strikes me, we have gone far enough in confining the captain and crew; 
more rigorous measures may probably bring us into a dispute with the 
State of North Carolina. What we have already done is a mere act of 
power, and in our circumstances highly excusable. I would, therefore, 
recommend that the captain and crew be discharged, and the vessel 
be permitted to depart as soon as the flag has sailed, and got beyond all 
danger of being taken. I should be extremely glad if you could con 
tract for any quantity of clothing from the quarter you mention, and I 
will engage to have produce returned for it that is, if it can be spared. 
I have employed Mr. Robert Heriot to take an account of the provisions in the district of <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>; as soon as I can get his return, I 
shall be able to let you know what rice is to be spared. All the south 
ward parts of the country are stripped very bare, and it is very probable 
we shall be obliged to draw some provisions from San tee for this army. 
The same objection lies against paying Mr. Wayne's account. Until I 
can get the return above mentioned, I enclose you an order on Capt. Richardson, at the high hills of Santee, for 500 Ibs. powder and 1,500 
lead, 50 muskets and bayonets, 50 cartouch boxes, and 1,000 flints, which 
you may send for as soon as you please. As to cannon ball, I know 
not where to procure them; if you can point any mode that promises 
a probability of success, I will undertake to have the experiment made. 
I have already wrote you fully respecting Mr. Porcher; also, respecting Maham's and <a href='/results.php?tla=peh' rel='colleague'>Horry's</a> corps, and my determination about impressing 
horses. Mr. John Waring's situation at present being so exceedingly 
distressing, I have given him permission to remain at home, on his 
engaging to join you again as soon as possible. Mrs. Hall sends on a 
horse for his wagon ; I, therefore, request you would furnish the necessary escort, and send it forward without delay.

be disposed of as you shall think .proper. If you think he can be use

</p><p>
SIR: 
</p><p>
The manner in which you mentioned Mr. P , gave me no kind of apprehension of his being on the confiscation list, therefore, wrote to 
you respecting him as one of those who had not been noticed by the 
Legislature. I am, however, very glad you have proceeded no further, 
and this mistake of mine will serve to make me more guarded in future. 
</p><p>
It is utterly out of my power to grant Mr. P any indulgence, as 
the Act in which he is included is clear and positive. Were I to suffer 
him to remain in the country, it would be a partial suspension of the law, which cannot be done; I must, therefore, desire that Mr. P 
be immediately ordered into Charlestown. An application has lately been 
made me in favor of Mr. Alex. Rose, who had been banished the town 
by the British, but I was obliged to refuse it; and, if Mr. Rose should 
come out, you must order him immediately to return. Before this 
reaches you, you will have received my order for the arms and ammunition you want. My reason for ordering the horses to be returned that 
were impressed by order of Col. Maham, was, that <a href='/results.php?tla=peh' rel='colleague'>Horry's</a> horses were 
to be turned over to his regiment. I thought it impossible that more 
horses could be wanted, after having those of a whole regiment. I am 
sorry to find that this regiment has proved so very insignificant, as not 
to be able to supply more than twelve horses ; however, Maham's order 
was for no more than fifteen, which makes a difference of only three 
horses, consequently the service cannot suffer for want of so trifling a 
number of horses. Another reason was, that I found the authority 
put into very improper hands, instead of its being entrusted to very 
discreet persons. The thing in itself is odious, and ought to be avoided 
if possible ; but, if such a necessity arises as renders the measure in
dispensable, it ought to be exercised with caution and lenity. If I am 
rightly informed, the gentlemen who had the press warrant did, by no 
means, confine themselves to taking horses from such only as showed no 
disposition to serve their country; and another reason that induced me 
to countermand the order was, that I found it created very great discontents, to find that horses, which were immediately to be attached to 
your brigade, should be taken out of another; and, as it was likely to 
be productive of many inconveniences, and having already full enough 
to struggle with, and not conceiving the horses to be substantially necessary, I thought it best to put a stop to any further embarrassments on 
this account. As to Col. Maham's threatening to resign, because he is 
not permitted to do as he is pleases, he must use his own pleasure. I 
can assure him these kind of threats are by no means calculated to 
operate with me in the manrer they are intended to do, but the reverse. 
I am very sorry to find so few of the Charlestown militia at <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>. 
There is now a newspaper regularly published. Suppose you issue 
general orders for those men to join their several corps within a certain 
limited time, and such as do not, to send a party to take them into custody; and if, on trial, they are convicted, send them to the Continental 
line a few examples, perhaps, may bring them to their senses. It is 
disgraceful in the highest degree that men should require to be thus 
goaded to their duty. An express is this day arrived from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, 
and brings letters from Gillon, who is arrived at the Havanna with five 
prizes, worth 150,000 hard dollars. It is not unlikely he may send a 
vessel or two to <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a> therefore, could wish a good look-out may 
be kept there, that if they arrive they may not be detained for want of 
a pilot. They talk much at the Northward of the French fleet coming 
either here or to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, early this spring. Let either be the object, 
the issue will be highly important. I could wish Charlestown to be the 
first, not only as most interesting to us, but because I believe the 
attempt here would be successful, and I have very great doubts about 
the other; and, because I fear if our allies were to meet with a rebuff 
in one place, they will not be so ready to attempt another, as success is 
always a stimulus to encounter new dangers. I suppose you will think 
I have little to do, to write so much about politics this is not the fact; 
but my pen naturally run into its old channel before I recollected my 
self. I wish I had time to give you these occurrences oftener than I 
do; however, if you will give me leave, I will subscribe to our news 
paper for you, from whence you will stand a better chance of getting 
JQ^WS than from ray pen.

you an order for arms and ammunition. I think there is something

First, You are to take with you four or five judicious, intelligent 
persons, to meet those appointed on the part of Ganey and others, to 
confer on the business herein committed to your charge, but they are 
not to be considered as joined with you in this commission. Second, 
The said Ganey and others, with whom such truce was made, are to lay 
down their arms as enemies to this State, and are not to resume them 
again until called on to do so, in support of the interest of the United 
States, and of this State in particular. Third, They are to deliver up 
all negroes, horses, cattle, and other property, that have been plundered 
from the inhabitants of this or any other State. Fourth, They are to 
engage to demean themselves as peaceable citizens of this State, and 
submit themselves in future to be governed by its laws, in the same 
manner as the rest of the citizens thereof. Fifth, They are to be 
allowed two, or, if you find it necessary, three months, to remain at 
home, before they are called on to bear arms in behalf of this State. 
Sixth, They are to engage to apprehend and deliver up all persona 
within their district, who shall refuse to accede to these terms, and contumaciously persist in rebellion against the State. Seventh, If these 
terms are accepted by the said Graney and others, you are then to 
promise them a full pardon for all treasons heretofore committed by 
them against the State. Eighth, If these terms are rejected by the 
said Graney and others before mentioned, you are then to have recourse 
to force of arms, or otherwise to compel them to submission. Ninth, 
You are authorized and empowered, if you shall deem it for the public 
service, to apprehend, and send within the enemy's lines, any of the 
families of persons who continue in arms against the State.

Yours of the (no date) I received the last evening. I did not know by whose orders the restrictions on trade at <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a> had been 
adopted; but, it appearing to me to be founded on erroneous principles, 
induced me to give the order I did. As to the Charlestown militia, I 
have given orders so repeatedly about them, that it is needless to reiterate 
them. Except a very few, all these men are resident either in Gen. Marion's or Gen. Barnwell's brigade; and the latter being now under 
the command of Gen. Marion, he has sufficient power over them to do 
what you have requested of me. Gen. Marion has orders for the 
ammunition for your post, which, I suppose, he will deliver to you. I 
will attend to the agreement about the shot as soon as I get your account 
of it. I have directed Heriot and Tucker to apply to you for a party 
of men to take charge of some negroes to be brought from Mr. Smith's 
plantation on Santee. You will, therefore, be pleased to furnish them 
accordingly, on their application to you; and, also, have the negroes 
secured in <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a> until the day of sale.

I observe in your orders to Col. Saunders, he is directed to draft the 
Whole of his regiment. I omitted to inform you that I had directed no 
draws should be made from the John's Island, Wadmelaw, Edisto and 
Stono companies these companies being absolutely necessary to be 
kept at certain points to prevent the commerce between the country 
and Charlestown. I have, therefore, directed Col. Saunders to adhere 
to my former orders respecting these companies, and that I would inform 
you of the same. I suppose Col. Saunders has reported to you the 
refractory spirit that still prevails in his regiment. Unless vigorous 
measures are pursued to bring them to order, I am convinced they will 
do no duty.

I received your letter by Mr. King on the 31st ult. I approve of 
your appointment of Capt. Milligan to the command of the galley, and 
have accordingly enclosed him a commission, and another blank for a 
lieutenant, to be appointed by Milligan himself, as I think one lieutenant sufficient for the present. You must, by some means or other, 
procure Mr. Moore a horse, to come up to me; if it can be done by no 
other means, you must dismount one of your dragoons, and furnish him 
with his horse, as I have business of a very particular nature to transact 
with that gentleman. I have no other instructions for Milligan than to 
use his best endeavors to guard the harbor of <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>. The State

name is on the confiscation list, and is, of course, banished this State. You are, therefore, to order him immediately back to Charlestown, or 
at least within the enemy's lines, on pain of his incurring the pains and penalties of the Act before mentioned, if hereafter found within 
our lines. The same gentleman informs me there is one Wm. Graham, also within your command, who is looked upon as a dangerous person. 
If you should be of this opinion, give him the same orders you do Hair, for an authorised spy is the most dangerous enemy we can have to contend against.

Your letter of the 9th inst., enclosing the articles of agreement entered into with Graney and his party, came safe to me on the 13th. I 
took the earliest opportunity of laying them before the Council for 
their consideration, and, after weighing them with that circumspection 
which was due to their interesting contents, they have signified their 
unanimous approbation of the same. They also meet with my most 
hearty concurrence; and permit me, sir, to express to you the high 
sense I entertain of the services you have rendered to the State on this 
important occasion. The measures adopted by you are so well calculated, that they could not fail to produce the favorable issue which has 
attended them; and I think there is every reason to expect that the 
advantages to be derived to the State from so happy a termination of 
this matter, will be still more diffusive than they have yet appeared to 
be, and will, in a short time, work a total extinction of that spirit of 
discord which has so unfortunately pervaded this State for some time 
past. It is necessary I should have the names of the persons who are 
parties to the agreement, as every man's name must be included in the 
proclamation of pardon ; I should, therefore, be glad you would forward 
them to me as soon as you can, and, in the meantime, inform them of 
the reasons for delaying the proclamation, as they might otherwise suspect an intention of avoiding it. I have no particular orders to give, 
but I must earnestly recommend your earliest attention to be paid to 
the militia of this brigade, who are the most incorrigibly obstinate and 
perverse beings that I have ever met with, and who are absolutely a 
disgrace to the State. I am convinced, from repeated experiments I 
have made of them, that nothing but the most rigid execution of the 
militia law with regard to them, can ever bring them to a proper sense 
of their duty. In speaking of the brigade, it is necessary I should 
inform you that the militia of the islands are by no means to be included 
in the censure ; on the contrary, they merit applause ; for, notwithstanding their exposed situation, they early submitted, and, whilst the other 
parts of the brigade were behaving in the most unwarrantable manner, 
they cheerfully submitted to every order given them, and have repeatedly repulsed the attacks of the enemy on the islands, and, as far as I 
have had occasion to employ them, they have done their duty. I have 
this moment received your letter of the 16th inst. Most of its contents 
have already been observed upon. The mode in which you propose to 
treat Major Skelly, I think may be productive of very good consequences. I sent Mr. "Wilson, the sheriff for Cheraws, his commission 
three months ago, and am surprised to find he has not received it. It 
must be lying somewhere at <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a> ; but, if he cannot get it, I 
will send him another. However, his not having the commission need 
not prevent him from acting. The appointment by the Legislature is 
the substantial part; the commission is more a matter of form. 
I am, sir, your most obedient servant,

The evacuation of <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a>, and the highest probability that St. 
Augustine is likewise evacuated, offer so fair an opportunity of obliging the enemy to abandon the post they hold in this State, that it would 
be criminal not to make the attempt. I must, therefore, desire you 
would immediately draft one-half of your brigade, and as many more 
within eighty miles of Charlestown (agreeably to the law) as will be 
consistent with the safety of the country, and immediately put them in 
motion, and join the army under the command of <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a>. If 
the men will now do their duty with cheerfulness and punctuality, I think 
I may almost venture to assure them this will be the last grand effort 
they will be called upon to make. I hope you have finished the business you are at present upon, before you receive this; if not, pray expedite it as much as possible, so that that may not interfere with the 
great object.

part of the men being immediately required, that I have given the 
necessary orders to these three regiments. The Commanding Officer at 
<a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a> is to forward this letter by express, with all possible expedition.

</p><p>
SIR: 
</p><p>
I received your letter of the 16th late last evening. The officers of 
Col. Maham's corps seem to imitate the principle upon which the incorporation is founded. They appear to imagine it to be an admission of 
Major Conyer's corps into Col. Maham s; but this is not the case. 
There is a material difference between drafting one regiment into 
another, and consolidating two regiments into one. In the first in 
stance, the drafted regiment is either disbanded altogether, or the 
officers sent out to recruit; in the second, there is an indiscriminate 
mixture of men, without giving a superiority in either one or the other, 
and the officers are commonly retained according to their rank; but 
sometimes the arbitrary rule of retaining them, according to their merit, 
has been adopted from this state of the case. The objection that Conyers is disliked by Maham and some of his officers, is frivolous, because Conyers can with equal propriety make the same objection to Maham 
and his officers; and these gentlemen deceive themselves very much 
when they set up a claim of superiority, for they have no manner of 
pretension to it, for the reasons I have given ; and as to the abilities of 
Major Conyers, I believe, sir, you are no stranger to them, and that 
they entitle him to a claim equal to most officers; his merit stands confessed by every impartial man who knows him. If, after these considerations, gentlemen will suffer themselves to be guided by private 
pique, and rather resign their commissions than submit to the established rules of propriety and justice, why, they must do so, and we 
must endeavor to find men that will engage in the service from a pure, 
ardent zeal to love their country. Such will be less governed by pas 
sions, when they can t have their own humour gratified. I send you an 
extract of the minutes of the Council, from which time the commissions 
of Conyers and his officers are to bear date. It is true the corps was 
ordered by Gov. Rutledge to be raised in September; but, as it was 
afterwards rejected by the Legislature, the whole of that arrangement 
was done away, and can only be considered as commencing from the 
re-establishment by me after I came into office. On consulting <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a>, I find Maham's must be considered as a State corps, on Continental pay. I should be very glad to be furnished with a return of Maham's and Conyer's corps as soon as you can procure it with accuracy. 
</p><p>
I am very sorry to hear of poor (rough's fate; but it is astonishing to 
me that gentlemen will venture themselves in that part of the country, 
when they see we cannot afford protection to it, and that it is a nest for 
a great part of the devils in the British service. I have sent you an 
order for 100 stand of arms. I have some faint idea that there is 
some medicine at Richardson s, on the high hills of Santee. When 
you send for the arms, pray enquire if there is no one there. I know 
of no mode of getting them but from <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a> ; I, therefore, enclose 
you a letter to Heriot and Tucker, desiring them to endeavor to procure 
you a supply agreeably to such list as you may send them. The Continental hospitals here are but scantily supplied at present. Your 
presence is very much wanted in this quarter; indeed, every day renders 
it more and more necessary. I enclose you two brevets for Messrs. Huggins and Rothmahler, agreeably to your request, and have left the 
name blank. <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> was completely evacuated on the llth instant. 
Wayne, who is usually very sanguine, supposed, upon the commencement of the evacuation, it would have been pushed forward with great 
rapidity, and this led me to say to you that it was evacuated; indeed, it would have been so in three days, were it not for the Tories, and 
their negroes, whom they were obliged to carry off. Our prospects are flattering, and, if rightly improved, there is reason to expect we shall 
soon be at ease. It affords me very singular pleasure to hear you have finally settled the tranquility of the district of Little Pee Dee; so happy 
a conclusion to an affair, which, in its first stage, wore but a gloomy aspect, reflects great honor on you, sir, and promises lasting advantage 
to the State. Pray, is Graney returned; I wish he may not be playing 
a fast and loose game. Mr. David Rumph has proposed to me to raise a party of militia horse for the protection of the part of the country he 
lives in. I have directed him to apply to you to know whether you approve of the plan.

SIR: 
</p><p>
I herewith send you two copies of the laws passed in the last sessions. 
There are several inaccuracies in the printing, but it luckily happens 
that there is not one in the law giving extraordinary pi wers. In my last 
letter I forgot to take notice of the circumstances of the prisoners. I 
had a complaint made me some time ago, of their severe treatment, and 
represented it to <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a>, who, in consequence thereof, sent down 
the Commissary of prisoners to examine into the affairs, and on his 
return reported that he could find no marks of ill treatment of the 
prisoners, except that some of them were in want of clothing (which 
you know they are not obliged to find them). Whether he was deceived 
in his investigation of the matter, by false appearances, or what, we 
can t tell; but I have again spoken to <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a>, and he will have 
a further enquiry made. As to his taking prisoners out of our hands, 
you know the law of Congress authorises him so to do, and, as one of 
the United States, we are compelled to submit to it, however disagree 
able to our feelings. I have sent you thirty blank commissions, which 
are all I have. You will observe they are printed with <a href='/results.php?tla=jhr' rel='colleague'>Mr. Rutledge</a>'s 
name (and a few with mine); but, for want of others, I am obliged to 
make use of them, for our printer is sick, and I can get nothing done 
by him Ut present; nor has he printed any newspaper for some time 
past.

SIR:

I was not less surprised than concerned on receipt of your letter to 
day, to find you at Wasmasaw, instead of being on the other side of Santee. Mr. Singleton, who was the express that carried the letter 
for you, deserves to be hanged. Pray, find him out, and have him 
confined, for he shall certainly answer for this infamous piece of negligence. Had you received the letter on Sunday morning, which was 
the time you ought to have got it, <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a> might, in all probability, 
have been saved; but it must now, beyond all doubt, be lost. The last 
of the British troops, 170 in number, did not quit Charlestown until 
yesterday afternoon; you could, therefore, have been a full days march 
ahead of them, besides, your then position being so much nearer the 
scene of action than that of the enemy s. On the contrary, they will 
now have a days march of you, consequently the fall of <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a> 
must inevitably follow, and which must be a dreadful stroke to us. 
The whole of the land forces said to be employed on this expedition is 
about 700. If any thing can be done to save the place, or any part of 
the stores, I am sure your utmost endeavors I can depend on. I am 
convinced the opportunity is lost. Pray, let me hear from you as soon 
as anything is done, and what is the fate of the place.

SIR: 
</p><p>
Your letters of the 6th and 9th inst., are come safe to hand, but the 
paper containing the consolidation of Maham's corps you have not sent me, which I suppose was omitted by some mistake. I enclose you 
blank commissions. I very much approve of your plan of removing 
the rice from Santee to <a href='/results.php?city=georgetown' rel='city'>Georgetown</a>, for <a href='/results.php?tla=all' rel='colleague'>Gen. Leslie</a> has this day given 
official information that he is greatly distressed for want of provisions, 
and that unless I will furnish him, he must come and take it; there 
fore, you must expect another visit from him before he goes. As to 
your proposal to send rice to Charlestown for clothing, that is now rendered unnecessary, as we shall be in possession of it in the course of a 
month or six weeks. The rice, &c., which Mr. Selby has permission 
to send to town, is in payment for clothing furnished the officers of our 
line, and the supernumerary officers; therefore, his vessel ought not to 
be detained. I am much surprised at your mentioning that the time 
of Maharn's men will all expire in a little time. I understood you, the 
last time we conversed on that subjtct, that very few were enlisted for 
one year, but most for two and three years. This circumstance has 
given me much uneasiness; and, to relieve my difficulties, I request 
you would forward me the return of the regiment without delay, that I 
might know what to determine on respecting that regiment. Although 
I am clearly of opinion there ought to be two Majors to a regiment, I 
should wish first to see before I make an appointment, that the state of 
the corps is such as to render the creation of another Major necessary. 
I must first see <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a> before I can say anything to you about 
the exchange of prisoners you mention.

SIR: 
</p><p>
I this day received your letter of the 19th inst., enclosing me a return 
of the state of Maham's corps, at which I am exceedingly chagrined 
indeed, for it appears there are no more than seventeen men whose time 
of service will not expire in a month or six weeks. This deficiency, 
together with that in the corps brought into the regiment by Conyers, 
makes the regiment at least but a skeleton, when I expected the State 
would have had the services of a very respectable corps; and, to add 
to the misfortune, I cannot command the means of making it better. 
I have, in two or three instances, involved myself in a vast deal of 
trouble, by making engagements which I thought I should have been 
able to comply with; but, on experience, have found myself deceived, 
and, in consequence of which, I have embarrassed myself exceedingly, 
and brought on myself much unmerited censure, for which reason I 
am determined never to pass my word for a guinea, without I have the 
means in my hands of fulfilling the contract the moment it becomes 
due; therefore, I have no present means in my hands, nor the least 
prospect of any before the meeting of the Legislature. It is utterly 
out of my power to furnish the money to re-engage Maham's men. I 
can only lament the injury the State must be subject to by this unlucky 
circumstance, for it is not in my power to remedy the evil. As a body 
of horse will be what we shall most want when <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a> leaves us 
(which he will do immediately, as the town is evacuated) I think the 
best way of disposing of the regiment will be to select the best of the 
accoutrements and horses, and mount the whole of the men that are 
retained, and form them again into a regiment of cavalry, and let them 
remain thus until the meeting of the Legislature, which I shall call together immediately on the evacuation of the town. As you are well 
acquainted with the state of the corps, 1 should be glad to have your sentiments on the matter. The enclosed is a copy of my letter to you 
by Col. Moultrie, who, being taken and carried into town, suppose the letter is lost.

SIR:

I have every reason to believe the information you enclosed me to be 
well founded. A note I got two days ago, from a person of good 
information, agrees substantially with yours. I think a fortnight more 
will decide the enemy's real intentions. By a woman from town last 
night, I am informed the enemy's plundering fleet sailed for George 
town yesterday morning. I am in hopes they will not be so successful 
there as they were at Santee. I enclose you an order on Mr. Richard 
son for 200 stand of arms, as the presumption is they are arrived, as I 
have notice of their leaving <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> the end of June. I have, 
also, enclosed in the order, a box of sugar for your use, which is now 
there at Richardson s. Enclosed is a brevet for Dr. Neufville. I find 
there is some uneasiness in Maham's corps about rank j I could wish 
you to order a board of officers to sit and determine in the dispute as 
soon as possible, or as circumstances will admit. As you agree with 
me that it is best to mount the whole corps to act as cavalry, it is more 
necessary to have all disputes about rank settled as soon as possible, as 
a new arrangement must necessarily take place; and I suppose the 
youngest officers must go out, as was the case in the late arrangement.

SIR: 
</p><p>
I received yours of the 27th the last evening. The information 
both <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a> and myself had received, agree that there were two 
parties going out one Northwardly, and the other Southwardly. How 
ever, I am very happy to find they have dropped the Northern expedition, which I am in great hopes will leave you at leisure to form some 
plan, if possible, to put a stop to this infamous traffic, that is carried 
on with the town through Goose Creek and down Cooper River. I 
cannot help thinking it reflects no great credit on our cavalry in this 
part, to lie still in their quarters and suffer about a dozen or twenty 
negroes to come out almost every night in the week, and carry off 
cattle, horses, and anything else they want, within twelve or fifteen 
miles of their camp; but I have spoke of it so often, that I am deter 
mined never to mention the matter again. I must entreat you, sir, to 
form some plan which will be most effectual to stop such a shameful 
commerce; it is no less villainous than true that the Charlestown mar 
kets are now daily supplied with the greatest plenty of everything they 
want. There is no political consideration whatever that can induce me 
to alter the substance of my proclamation. I must request you to have 
it carried into the most rigid execution. I am clearly convinced nothing 
will do with the Southern militia until you are at leisure to undertake 
the management of them. The news contained in the paper you sent 
me is very important indeed, and I trust will lead to happy consequences. 
I observe they are contending for a restoration of the confiscated estates. 
This, I knew, would be the case, and told the House of Assembly so 
when they were about passing the Confiscation Act ; for it is a matter 
</p><p>
that must be finally settled by negociation. I enclose you a copy of a letter I have just received from <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague met'>Gen. Greene</a>. Poor <a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague'>Laurens</a> ! I am

SIR: 
</p><p>
Your letter, received yesterday, relieved me from a great deal of uneasiness, as Mr. K. Simons came down two days before and informed me that 
he was apprehensive, from the accounts he had heard, that your brigade had been defeated, a total route ensued, and that they had suffered 
severely. Under these impressions, you may judge what must have been my feelings on receipt of your letter yesterday. I most sincerely 
congratulate you, sir, on your triumph over the deep laid scheme of our inveterate enemies. Their disappointment, in a plan they had 
depended so much upon, must chagrin them far more than their loss. Your account of the behavior of the militia reflects great honor on them, and exhibits an example worthy of imitation by the rest of their 
brethren. With respect to the prize you mention, 1 would have you by all means carry the proclamation into force against her in the most 
rigid manner also, with regard to any others that might be taken ; for, notwithstanding every exertion, the Charlestown markets are amply 
supplied with all kinds of provisions, by a parcel of mercenary, infamous wretches, who make lucre their only object, no matter how diabolical 
the means they pursue to obtain it, or how prejudicial it may be to the interest of their country.

SIR: 
</p><p>
Yours of the 10th inst., came safe to hand yesterday. The mode I 
have adopted in taking substitutes is to oblige all under fifty to furnish 
two substitutes, and all above fifty one substitute, which is conforming 
to the militia law as near as can be. All those who have surrendered 
since the time limited by my invitation, I have parolled till the meeting 
of the Legislature, to be dealt with as they think proper; a copy of the 
parole I now enclose you. I am entirely of opinion with you, that a 
body of good cavalry will be indispensably necessary to restore order 
and good government in the different parts of the country, after the 
enemy have quitted Charlestown; for there are a parcel of infamous 
wretches whom the habit of plundering has taken such fast hold of, 
that nothing but a military force will ever be able to subdue them, and 
that force must be cavalry. But, unfortunately for this country, we 
have not the means of procuring men to put such a corps on the respectable establishment, as it ought to be; however, as Maham's corps 
at present sCauds, I flatter myself we shall be able to put it on a very 
respectable footing as soon as we can get into the town. By the determination of the Council, the substitute money is all to be applied to 
raise recruits for the Continental line of this State; therefore, any 
application of it towards recruiting State troops would be improper. 
You mention those who agree to find substitutes give twenty-five 
guineas; they are to procure the substitutes, cost what they will ; at the 
same time great caution should be used that they do not go beyond 
thirty guineas, otherwise, it would ruin our recruiting service. I, there 
fore, think the best way would be for them to pay the money into your 
hands, and you to recruit the men, by which means you will be able to 
prevent the service being injured by exorbitant bounties. I think the 
State's share of seizures, that are made under my proclamation of the 
14th of March last, cannot better be applied than to the purpose you 
mention that is, recruiting Maham's corps, and which I very much 
approve of; but, I could wish you to reserve as much out of the first 
sales as will pay Harris for the wagon you purchased of him, for I can 
with truth assure you, that 1 have no present means, or a prospect of 
any, until we get into Charlestown, of satisfying this or any other 
demand against the State, as the Council have declined their assent to 
selling any more negroes until the enemy quit the State. I am glad to 
find, by the surrender of the party you mention, that the Northern 
parts of the State are now clear of the disaffected. I don t apprehend 
any danger now from Fanning. Our printer has began to publish his 
paper again, and I enclose you one of them.

SIR:

I have written to you by Major Conyers respecting Mahanrs corps; 
also, what must be done with those persons who come out of Charlestown. Since the time specified in ruy invitation, the refugees have 
obtained permission to remain until the 26th inst. I proposed a plan 
to Col. Lushington, some time ago, for manning the galley at George 
town ; I have not since heard from him on the subject. If that plan 
does not take, I know of no other at present; for, as I have before 
observed to you, I have no money, nor have I the means of commanding any. It would be a mere trifle for the merchants and inhabitants 
in and about that place, to advance as much money, or something else, 
as would fit out the vessel, and they are the most immediately interested 
in it. A few years ago, the public spirit of our people would have stimulated them to do such a thing without being asked; but, alas! that 
seems now to be vanished. Mrs. Matthews is now on her way from 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and I expect she will be at the high hills of Santee about 
the 7th of next month; and, as the road from Laurens Ferry to this 
place is very dangerous^ I must desire an escort might be sent to meet 
her at the ferry, and conduct her down to my quarters. Let the escort 
be at Laurens by the 7th, and send on one of the men to Capt. Richardson's, to wait there until she arrives (if she should not be there 
before) that she might know the escort waits for her; otherwise, she 
may stay there a day or two, and I don t want the men to be absent 
longer than necessity requires. You are a better judge than I am what 
number of horse will be sufficient to render her passage safe ; therefore, 
I shall leave the appointment of the party to you. I think it would be 
well to caution the person who is to command the party, not to say for 
what purpose they are ordered, lest some villains might be tempted to 
waylay the road before she gets to the ferry, for she has only one white 
man and two negro servants with her, and Capt. Richardson informs 
me there are some bad men in that neighborhood, who have lately plundered several people. If it would not be fatiguing the horses too much, 
or attended with particular inconvenience, I would be glad they could 
be sent as far as Capt. Richardson s, to meet her. However, I shall 
leave the matter to you, as I dare say you will be disposed to accommodate her as far as the service will admit. Yours, &c.,

SIR: 
</p><p>
Your letter of yesterday's date is just come to hand. There is but 
one way in which the negroes you mention are to be dealt with; that 
is, as they were taken in arms, they must be tried by the negro law ; 
and, if found guilty, executed, unless there are any whose cases are 
so far favorable as to induce the court to recommend them to mercy, 
and the executive authority interpose and pardon them. Exemplary 
punishments on such notorious offenders will have a very salutary effect, 
especially at this time. With regard to the subject of the trade carried on with the town, which you wrote to me about some days ago, I 
have not been able to collect a Council to advise with them on that 
subject, as they have almost all of them been so much indisposed, that 
they have not been able to attend to business; however, it would not 
be amiss still to hold up the threat of subjecting offenders to trial under 
the Sedition Act, and in the meantime to seize and condemn whatever 
is taken from them, in the utmost latitude of my proclamation. The 
enemy have lately sent some of their emissaries in the country, to persuade the people to carry all the provisions into them that they can collect, in consequence of which they are thronging to town in such 
droves, that the guard at Bacon's Bridge, detachments from the army, 
and even individuals, have made a great number of seizures, which 
have been condemned. This timely exertion has so far deterred them, 
that for several days past they seem to have given up their lucrative 
game, as no seizures have been made, so that their execrable policy has 
failed for once. The enemy has abandoned James Island. 
I am, sir, your most obedient servant,

SIR: 
</p><p>
Those gentlemen who have for some time been so much indisposed, 
as to prevent their attendance in Council, having recovered their health, 
enabled me yesterday to convene a Council, when I laid before them 
your letter respecting the propriety of altering the mode of punishment 
for persons carrying on a clandestine trade with the enemy, from that 
pointed out by my proclamation of the 14th March last, to that pointed 
out under the Sedition Act; when, after mature deliberation, the 
Council were of opinion that an alteration in the mode of punishment 
would by no means be advisable at this juncture; but, at the same 
time, earnestly recommended that the proclamation before mentioned 
should be carried vigorously into execution, which, in their opinion, 
was very well calculated to put a stop to that iniquitous commerce. 
I am, sir, your obedient servant,
