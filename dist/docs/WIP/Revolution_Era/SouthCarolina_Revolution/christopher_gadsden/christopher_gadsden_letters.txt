You have my ardent and sincere wishes for your safe and speedy 
junction with our common friends. Our cause is good ; the cause of 
humanity itself, and as it would be blasphemy in the highest degree, 
to think a Good Being would create human nature to make it unhappy, 
and countenance its being deprived of those natural rights without 
which our existence would not be tolerable; our cause may, therefore, be 
justly called the cause of God also. These were my sentiments at the 
time of the Stamp Act, the beginning of our dispute, they have continued 
to be so ever since, and with the blessing of God, I am ready and willing 
to undergo any thing Heaven may still think proper to call me to suffer 
in support of it. We are tried, but I firmly trust not given over, and 
that God will once more restore us to our country and our rights, and 
that soon, when we shall have reason to look up to Him, and be convinced that his correction has been necessary, kind and proper, such as 
no father in our quandam circumstances could avoid giving to his children, unless he had totally delivered them up to their own wild and 
perverse imaginations, and abandoned us altogether. That we may 
pursue every prudent, reasonable, humble and truly political step, devoid 
of passion and vindictive resolutions is my warmest wish, Revenue is 
below a brave man; vengeance belongeth to the Almighty; He has 
claimed it expressly as His right, wisely foreseeing the shocking havoc 
man would make with such a weapon left to his discretion. However, 
a just retaliation, upon an abandoned and cruel enemy, may be some 
times absolutely necessary and unavoidable, but then that necessity 
should glaringly appear, be used sparingly and with propriety, that is, 
as near as possible on the offenders themselves. This even humanity 
may require ; might show steadiness and firmness, and would meet the 
approbation of all the candid part of mankind. Instead of bayoneting 
poor soldiers for the cruelty of their officers, when we have them at our 
mercy when the unexampled cruel treatment of our friends in their 
power absolutely required a return, and when they have unjustly tortured or taken away the lives of any of them, a retaliation in such cases, 
in my humble opinion, would be much better taken of the officers; I 
would save them in the field, and immediately hang a few of the heads 
of them on the lines, in presence of the soldiers taken with them declaring publicly the reasons why it was done, and afterwards if the enemy s 
lines were near, offer them the bodies of such officers to honor them 
with what funeral they thought proper. The higher the rank of the 
officer that fell into our hands, the nearer should we come to and 
punish the cause of the cruelties our friends had suffered, and in my 
opinion show the greater spirit and propriety in taking such a method, 
and the sooner prevent the repetition of their barbarities. Even Lord 
Cornwallis himself, if Fame says true, has been guilty of numberless 
cruelties, in cold blood, and if he fell into our hands, it would be the 
highest justice to make him suffer in an exemplary manner for them. 
</p><p>
You will let our friends know our situation, and that though perhaps 
they cannot without great inconvenience detain all the prisoners they take, and are, perhaps, obliged, from peculiar circumstances, to parole 
must have been the case heretofore, yet such miscreants as have acted in high stations, have done us great mischief 
by the example of their defection, and otherwise are continually playing 
us tricks, and by no means are to be trusted, we hope they will for our 
sakes, keep such perfidous wretches at such a distance from Charlestown, 
and parolled if they think proper, at least, where they can do no more 
mischief. This, common fellow-feeling for our friends absolutely requires ; indeed, a contrary conduct will encourage these worst of enernies, and make them contrive to throw themselves artfully in the way 
to be captured that they may carry on their cool, sly, detestable villainy 
with more security. I beg pardon, my dear friend, for troubling you 
with this long scrawl. My love to all our friends; tell them I hope to 
be with them soon, and to set out from hence as soon as possible after 
my family arrives the beginning of next month at farthest ; particularly make my compliments to Gen. Marion. I am much obliged to 
him for his friendship at my plantation on Black River; entreat he 
will continue it. If you cannot see him, contrive, if you can, to let him 
know it. If any thing from thence, by his means or through any of 
my other friends, can be transmitted to my family here, it would be of 
great service to them, and what they will stand in need of. 
</p><p>
I am, dear sir, your most affectionate humble servant,

under the severe trials we have been witness to, entitle him to particular 
attention.

</p><p>
MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY : 
</p><p>
As your Excellency has taken the whole matter of the late agreement 
with the British on yourself, and that by the executive authority, and 
executive, &c., mentioned in the fourth article, your Excellency is to 
be understood. I was in doubt with myself (and took a day or two to 
consider further of it) whether there would be occasion to trouble your 
Excellency with the little mentioned; but, as I still unhappily differ 
from your Excellency in opinion, and am persuaded, if from nothing 
else, from the want of precision, at least, in the expression of that 
article, the State at large will be led to think the Privy Council are 
made a party thereto, and, of course, myself, a member thereof. As I 
dislike the agreement, very cogent reasons oblige me to send your 
Excellency my formal disapprobation thereof, nearly in the words. I 
drew immediately a rough sketch on seeing it, which I then showed to 
those gentlemen of the Council I mentioned to your Excellency, and 
should have sent it to your Excellency had not the Council been summoned so soon. The doctrine broached at the last Council, which I 
never heard or suspected before, that the Privy Council is in no case 
part of the executive, is, in my opinion, very alarming; it tends to 
make them insignificant, and the next step is, when an opportunity 
offers, to expunge that body altogether from the Constitution, and pre 
pare the way to reduce this Government to a kind of Principality. I 
have frequently, in the Assembly, taken notice how great an eye-sore 
the Privy Council seemed to be to some gentlemen amongst us, and 
what indirect strokes were aimed at them. That the Governor is the 
sole ostensible executive of the State, is readily granted; further, that 
in all acts wherein he is not particularly retrained by law, he may be 
said to be absolutely so; but, in such laws wherein it is expressly 
directed that he shall not act but by the advice and consent of the 
Privy Council, there they are certainly part of the executive. For I 
have ever learned, that whatever is essentially necessary to a thing, that 
that thing cannot exist without it, most belong to it and participate of 
its nature so in this last case, .whenever the law requires that when a 
Governor is inclinable to a certain executive act, that executive act 
shall not be done but by the advice and consent of the Privy Council. 
If it be done without such advice and consent, it is illegal; therefore, 
they are certainly a sine qua non to make the Governor act legally in 
such instance, and, consequently, in such cases, are a necessary part of 
the executive, and the individual members thereof may be said to be 
parties thereof. What confusion this can occasion, or how by this 
omission there can be ten Governors in this State instead of one, not 
withstanding what a learned, or any number of learned lawyers what 
ever may say, I cannot conceive. Besides, in case of the death of a 
Governor, during the recess of the Assembly, will not the Lieutenant-Governor immediately succeed, and, in case of his death, too, one of 
Privy Council? Does not this show they belong to the executive? 
</p><p>
Their participation of the executive is but sometimes in particular cases, 
and that only internally or privately (as a Privy Council) without any 
external authority whatever; this belongs solely to the Governor or 
Commander-in-Chief. This, or something like it, I take to be the intention of the words in the eleventh article of the Constitution " in 
manner herein mentioned," placed immediately after to modify and re 
strain the words " that the executive authority be vested in the Governor and Commander-in-Chief;" otherwise, those words must be altogether nugatory, and put for no purpose whatever. I will now beg 
leave to trouble your Excellency with the letter already mentioned. 
" May it please your Excellency I have seen the agreement with the 
British, dated the 10th, and find by its fourth clause that, as a particle 
of the executive, though unconsulted, I seem to be made a party therein 
to promote its acceptance with the public, which occasions my troubling 
your Excellency by letter, as my conscience and duty oblige me to 
declare that I disapproved almost every article. Indeed, I am not able 
to see any pressing occasion we had for any further meeting with the 
enemy s commissioners, after the last, convened at their request, broke 
up, which I was not sorry for, as we have so greatly the advantage of 
them, in point of British property, to lay our hands on when we please. 
This they well knowing, no doubt occasioned so much anxiety on their 
side for a further meeting. The agreement itself appears to me extremely injurious to the public, and fear it will involve us in endless 
ill consequences. With British lawsuits, no doubt, our courts will be 
filled; but these are trifles to what might be mentioned. The exception in the first article is not only, in my humble opinion, imprudent 
and impolitic with regard to ourselves; but, when taken with the 
second, has an unfriendly (if not inimical) aspect towards our sister 
States. Its eighth article is, in the last degree, humiliating. The greatest and tenderest care seem to be taken of the British interest, honor, 
and even delicacy, throughout the agreement, while our rights, and 
what is essential to our honor and interest, are totally omitted, or not 
mentioned with that unequivocal plainness and precision, and that decisive firmness we had room to expect. The whole agreement carries 
such manifest appearance of timid and over-cautious fear of offending 
the British, that instead of hastening, it has a natural tendency, when 
considered with the situation of the State for this last campaign, to 
retard their departure to the last moment they possibly can, in hopes 
that (as only interior disadvantages on their side oblige them to think 
of an evacuation) some external good luck may turn up in the interim, 
to bring about a recall of their orders. The plentiful markets and 
great trade they have already had with our people during the whole 
summer, the prospect of still greater when the crops come in, together 
with no small advantages they may promise to themselves if they can 
but stay, to dabble through their emissaries at our ensuing election, 
must of themselves be strong allurements to a watchful enemy not to 
hurry away until it is absolutely unavoidable; and must not their inducements be still stronger when they consider what is too glaring to 
escape them, the lax situation of our Government for want of courts, 
notwithstanding the parade of an Assembly sitting at Jacksonborough. 
The preference too currently given them, of all kind of necessaries 
for their specie and goods, rather than to our own army, which has 
been more than once in want, even of our common staple, rice, and 
beef, for several days together (and I wish I may not soon experience 
more alarming wants than any they have hitherto felt, if something 
more vigorous than in terrorem threats are not speedily and resolutely 
fallen upon) is no small addition to their other advantages. Above all, 
are not the enemy sure that our army cannot compel them to go away, 
or restrain them from making incursions almost anywhere for many 
miles, but just about the spot they occupy? These must be great incitements for them to stay, if possible. The first article will be of more 
service than ever, as having experienced, they can put a confidence in 
them, and of the most dreadful consequences to us, by having such 
powerful arguments to induce others to join them, and exert themselves 
to the utmost to do us as much mischief as they possibly can, finding 
they will thereby recommend themselves the more to the British, and 
stand the better chance to insure them protection upon a pinch. In 
my humble opinion, better the whole value of these fellows should be 
lost altogether than that the public should countenance so dreadful a 
mischief. 
</p><p>
" My duty to the State, and regard to my own reputation, (not desiring to be looked upon as a party to promote what I disapprove of,) has 
extorted this letter from me, which I hope will not give your Excellency any offence, which is far from my intention; for believe me, sir, 
no man more sincerely wishes that your administration, in these very 
difficult times, may prove not only serviceable to the public, but also 
honorable to yourself, and meet with general applause, than I do. I 
had some thoughts of reserving my opinion on this measure in my own 
breast till the Assembly sat ; but, upon further consideration, it appeared uncandid to your Excellency, and looked too much like cunning, which 
I abhor. 
</p><p>
I am, with great respect, your Excellency s &c., &c.,

N. B. The former part of this letter does not enter into the merits, 
whether the Governor had a right to exercise that particular act of 
agreement with the British solely of himself; but only takes up Mr. Rutledge's assertion in the Governor's favor, that the Privy Council 
were a part of the executive in no case whatever.

DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 18th I received by Mr. Ferguson, on his return 
from Accabe, his commission about the negroes being at an end. The 
British, it seems, make a pretence that it was because Major Rudolph 
had taken a small party near their lines, and unless <a href='/results.php?tla=nag' rel='colleague'>Gen. Greene</a> returned them, they would not send a negro out; but this is a mere pretence, they had not the least right to make such a demand on the 
General. I should be extremely happy to have it in my power to oblige 
you, and serve <a href='/results.php?tla=peh' rel='colleague met friend'>Col. Horry</a>, whose perseverance, firmness and merit, 
must be evident to everybody. Should the agreement be received, 
which I think there is little probability of, you may be assured that 
nothing in my power shall be wanting to serve him, <a href='/results.php?tla=peh' rel='colleague met friend'>Col. Horry</a>; and, 
as Col. Moncrieff has the negroes, who is one of the principal opposers 
of the agreement being complied with, I will use my endeavors with 
the Governor, if he can do it with propriety, to make a particular demand for them. The measure was certainly amazingly to the advantage of the British nation ; and, if their troops here had not as little 
spirit with regard to them as our people manifestly show with regard to this State (by that d -d communication with the town, which has 
now over-run all bounds) they would gladly have complied with the 
agreement to a title; but private interest on their side has overset it. 
Leslie has been very anxious about it for months past, and seen the 
advantages we had over him, and made several overtures before it was 
brought to a point. For my part, my friend, I was always for keeping 
coolly the ground the Assembly left us, pointing out to the enemy the 
glaring superiority we had, and, at the same time, hinting that, if they 
wantonly distressed us, the Assembly, however willing of themselves, 
would certainly make use of the means in their power to do the State 
justice. This, as often as I had opportunity in private conversation 
with the Governor, I constantly gave as my opinion; however, his 
Excellency thought otherwise, and, without consulting the Privy 
Council at all, made the agreement himself. As soon as I saw it, I 
was very sorry for it, looking upon it as weak in itself, unnecessary, 
impolitic, humiliating, and pregnant with bad consequence to the State. 
Finding by the penning of the fourth article that the Privy Council 
seemed to be made parties thereto, though never consulted upon that 
ground, I took the liberty to write to his Excellency, expressed my disapprobation of it in the warmest terms, and pointed out many of its 
defects. This I mention to you as a friend. We are all indebted to 
you my dear sir, and I shall always be happy to have it in my power 
to discharge part of my public debt to you, by rendering you any agree 
able service. They still talk of the enemy s evacuating soon. I cannot 
but hear of the motions tending thereto as well as others; but seeing 
no reasons from within ourselves to oblige them to go away, but too 
many for their staying, I am still, and shall not think they intend absolutely to go until 1 hear they are over the bar. All their manoeuvring 
seems to be attended with a mixture of as much delay as possible, as if 
they still waited further orders, and were determined not to go a moment 
before they could possibly avoid. 
</p><p>
Pray remember me to <a href='/results.php?tla=peh' rel='colleague met friend'>Col. Horry</a>, and all enquiring friends with you. 
I am, dear sir, your most obedient servant,

</p><p>
DEAR SIR : 
</p><p>
Hearing my friend Ferguson was unwell, I made an elopement to see 
him, and just returned last evening, a little before your express called on 
me, much fatigued, which prevented your favor by him of the 24th. 
I am obliged to you for the paper you sent, and think it would be of 
general information to have it printed ; but Dunlap is so unwell, that 
he has left off printing, and, besides, his paper is so small, and types 
so large, that I am persuaded one of his gazettes could not hold a 
fourth part of it. This would make it far less useful and entertaining 
than if it came out all together. Should any opportunity unexpectedly 
offer of giving it to the public, I will not slip it. The more I consider 
the late intended agreement, the more disgraceful (and that unnecessarily so altogether, in my opinion,) it appears to the State. On the 
Privy Council not being consulted, and yet seeming to be made a party 
thereto, I immediately wrote a letter to his Excellency, to disavow my 
approbation of it; but previous to my sending it, receiving a summons 
to Council, I kept it back till that should be over, expecting the matter 
might be opened there; but finding we were called on a different business, and no probability of its being then touched upon, as I saw, I 
took hold of something that seemed to tend that way, and purposely 
brought it in indirectly in my argument on what was before us, pleading 
as an excuse that as a particle of the executive, by the inaccurate wording of the fourth article, I was brought in as a kind of party to an 
agreement which I almost totally disliked; upon which Mr. E. R., to 
my astonishment, said that the Privy Council was, in no case whatever, 
any part of the executive, which he said was also the opinion of another 
distinguished lawyer he named; and the Governor himself said, that 
old Col. Pinckney, who is conveniently dead, had told him the same. 
This, I think, as well as some other circumstances, leaves great room 
to think, that though the natural Council, appointed by the State, was 
not consulted on that most important occasion, yet that certain lawyers 
at least, if not others, were. This novel and dangerous doctrine, so 
contrary to the spirit of our Constitution and plain letter of many of 
our laws, so roundly and positively asserted, and, although Lowndes 
lieutenant during his administration, and during the greater part of J. Rutledge's, I had never heard a title of, or had the least suspicion that 
any such tenet could be advanced, till this morning I heard it declared 
in the strongest terms in Council, and a little before by that gentleman, 
openly in the GOVERNOR'S porch. This induced me, when I went home, 
to add a note, by way of preface, to the letter I had prepared to send 
to his Excellency, a copy of which I now enclose you; the proceeding 
on the cause of it will serve by way of an explanation thereto. We 
have been wanting, my dear sir, more troops for the General all this 
campaign, but, in my opinion, we have wanted still more an efficacious civil power; and, if the enemy leaves Charlestown, which still is a 
doubt with me notwithstanding I cannot help seeing appearances as 
well as others, their advantages over the country, which at this instant 
are so amazingly beyond any they ever had I say, in case of an evacuation, and the sword has a little rest, we must lose no time to join 
shoulder to shoulder to check the rapaciousness, tyranny and insolence 
of too many of our lawyers, or this State will never be at peace, or in 
a respectable situation again, or the citizens thereof upon an equal footing with regard to the possession of their property, which, in my 
opinion, for many years past, the poor and middling people have only 
held rather from courtesy than right, owing principally to that cause. 
Nothing but the infinite number of our laws, and what is quoted as 
authority in our courts (which, without exaggeration, a room of mode 
rate size would not hold) together with the perplexity and confusion, 
give these gentlemen their importance, or, indeed, any importance at 
all. These may be reduced, I am persuaded, to an octavo volume; at 
most, very few of them will ever help, we may be sure. But the 
business is of such necessity, that it must be done, as soon as possible, or we shall, in all probability, be undone; for otherwise their 
insolence as lawyers will be soon equal to what the famous Roman 
Catholic Bishop Becket said to a gentleman he was not well pleased 
with. He told him very haughtily that he hoped to see the day when 
no jack gentleman would dare to stand with his hat on before the lowest 
priest. Without great care this, or something like it, will be soon the 
case with regard to the lawyers here. I never thought there was much 
riddle and finesse necessary in a good Government that honest men 
of good plain common understanding, who would take pains to judge, 
and always judge for themselves, not suffering their understanding to 
be in any man s keeping, were fully equal to the task; but how is the 
case? The people may appoint whom they think proper (as in a Privy 
Council), these may be consulted occasionally to pick the gilding off 
of gingerbread, or some such trifling matter; but in an affair of the 
utmost consequence to the safety, honor and interest of the State, it 
cannot be expected they are fit judges (though, perhaps, a matter not 
even depending on any difficult principle of law); no! without the 
lawyers have the principal hand in it, or, indeed, the whole cooking of 
it, all is undone. I wish this may not have been nearly the case, my 
friend, on a late occasion, which I think almost as disgraceful to the 
State as was the agreement itself. The public are extremely obliged 
to you for your vigilance with regard to the gentlemen sending provisions to town. I believe I cannot be reckoned a severe man in my 
politics ; but I assure you I have done all in my power, for many 
months, to no purpose, to get means used to have some of them tried 
by the sedition laws. If convicted, perhaps my bowels might yearn 
over a poor necessitous man, so as to endeavor to procure his pardon; 
but if a rich fellow, if I had ten thousand votes they should all go for 
a halter for him, and nothing else. Owing to the too great encouragement of these rascals, the army has given over, since the beginning of 
the campaign, to that villainous, destructive trade with the town ; and 
to that impolitic infatuation, from Christmas last, of propagating the 
enemy s hums about an evacuation, we are brought to the present 
dilemma which is, if the enemy actually goes, they even then leave 
us with the highest contempt, and may return; but, should any external 
advantage to them make Sir Guy revoke his orders, what becomes of 
us all then? In that shocking, corrupted state, the people are now in, 
tis heads or tails with us, and the stake, I am afraid, is no less than 
the whole State. Sir Guy is looked upon as aa excellent officer, having 
the good of his nation disinterestedly at heart. No doubt so wary a 
commander must have men here on whom he can depend to give him 
information of our situation in all respects. Pardon me, my dear sir, 
for troubling you with so long a letter, when your time is so important 
to the public. Believe me to be, with sincere esteem, 
Your obedient servant, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
P. S. I send to the GOVERNOR'S every day for my rations of beef; 
this moment my boy has returned without any, bringing a note that 
there is none, and that the army is dissatisfied about it. I wish these 
dissatisfactions may not increase daily more and more, and bring on some dangerous crisis. The whole proceeds from the d- d town 
trade, where they live in clover. The same note mentions that the 
Augustine fleet is arrived.
