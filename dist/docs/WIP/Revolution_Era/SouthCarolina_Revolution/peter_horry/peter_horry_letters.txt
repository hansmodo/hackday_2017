DEAR GENERAL : 
</p><p>
I commissioned some days, Capt. Seamour, to send me out for our soldiers some clothing say Russia drab; 70 yards coarse blue cloth, 
at 6s.; 22 yards red do., at 5s.; 5 dozen coarse hats, at 30s. a dozen; 
thread, coarse buttons, large and small; about 200 yards coarse linen 
for pants, from 6d. to 2s. per yard ; 3 reams paper, wafers, ink-powder 
and shirt buttons, amounting in the whole to about 107 sterling, prime 
cost. These goods have arrived at Santee. My own men that remain are few, and their time nearly expired. I think it best to give them to your men, as very few of mine have only yet three or four months to serve. You desired me to endeavor to procure such goods for the 
troops. Capt. Seamour entreats you to give him rice, rough even will 
do; indigo and tobacco will not sell. Lockwood is here with orders 
from the Governor to load with rice for goods received; and, as you 
want goods, and they are present, I wish you may find it consistent 
to take these, and make payment agreeably to the adventurer. The 
boat waits your answer. The captain has risked these goods (and with 
out a pass) to serve us, and is willing to send you any quantity you may 
commission him for. 
</p><p>
I am, dear General, your obedient servant,
