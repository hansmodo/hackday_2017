Dear Sir 
</p><p>
The observations you made in our walk yesterday were of so interesting a nature, that I hope you will excuse 
my recurring to the subject of them. About to enter on a scene where I may not be permitted long to remain merely a 
spectator, &amp; in which all my success will be influenced by my first steps, I feel a natural anxiety to prescribe a course of 
conduct which may become the rule of my political life. The 
violence of party x which disgraces our country is indeed discouraging to one who feels no disposition to become the follower of any sect, or to mingle political animosities with the intercourse of society. But I have sometimes thought that 
the interests of the nation might be advanced without joining those who think themselves exclusively its friends, and 
that even the intemperance of party would respect a manly independence founded on honor &amp; maintained with firmness 
without descending to adopt the prejudices or to be guided 
by the passions of others. You Sir more than any other character with whom it has been my happiness to be acquainted 
have passed thro all the stages of political advancement honorable for yourself &amp; useful to your country. From you 
therefore I am particularly desirous of receiving advice which would be useful to a person who like myself has a profession 
the pursuit of which is a primary object, but who from many motives aspires to any political distinction which may be acquired &amp; preserved by honorable means. 
</p><p>
The kindness &amp; confidence with which you have hitherto favored me as they are a principle inducement will I trust be at the same time the apology for this trouble.

D' Sir 
</p><p>
It is so long since I have had the pleasure of hearing from you that I take the liberty of asking news of yourself 
&amp; the family. I should indeed before this have acknowledged your kind letter, but there is you know a tranquil, one might 
say a happy uniformity which gives to American life but little variety of incidents, &amp; it would be superfluous I trust 
to repeat the assurances of my respect &amp; esteem. My young friend Mr Walsh whom you may recollect in London has just returned in the Pacific. With regard to our affairs, he 
left Mr Pinkney under a strong impression that the modification of the Orders in Council was all that England meant 
to concede to this country. He had no idea of the more enlarged arrangement which has been made, or is expected at 
Washington. It seems singular that whilst negociating in London the ulterior views of the British government should 
have been concealed from him, &amp; it would be unfortunate 
if in a matter of such consequence there should be any misapprehension. But the declaration of Mr Erskine appear[s] 
full &amp; explicit. Mr M's observation of the pressure of the embargo rather confirms the opinion that we have only 
revealed the dangerous secret of our impotence yet the experiment tho dear may perhaps be valuable, since nations 
like men should learn to estimate their comparative value. All England is so much occupied with the Duke of York 
that this new war in Austria has attracted very little attention, &amp; excited no expectation of success. Lord Holland still 
remains in Spain. <a href='/results.php?tla=aab' rel=''>Mr Burr</a> was ordered to leave England, not as was stated at the requisition of the Spanish minister but 
from a belief that he was travelling over England for the purpose of collecting information which might render him after 
wards acceptable to the French gov't . He had been at Edinburgh &amp; the gov't understanding his intention of going to Ireland sent orders there to prevent his landing. . . .

My dear sir, 
</p><p>
I have received by this day's mail your letter of the 29th announcing your having nominated me one of the Directors of the Bank of the U.S. I need not say that I consider 
this rememberance a proof of that uniform kindness &amp; friendship on your part which I value so highly, and as such I beg 
you to accept my thanks for it. I have however little concern with Banks &amp; have hitherto declined sharing in the management of the institution when it was proposed to me by the 
stockholders. Yet I am unwilling to avoid any duty by which you think I can be of service. 
</p><p>
The truth is, that with all its faults, the Bank is of vital importance to the finances of the gov. and an object of great 
interest to the community. That it has been perverted to selfish purposes cannot be doubted that it may &amp; must 
be renovated is equally certain. But they who undertake to reform abuses &amp; particularly of that description, must en 
counter much hostility &amp; submit to much labor. To these, the hope of being useful can alone reconcile me and if I should 
undertake the task I shall endeavor to persevere till the character of the institution is reestablished.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
You will I am sure feel some interest in the inclosed 
paper which I have thought it advisable to publish in order 
to correct some deeply rooted prejudices against some of the 
measures of the last war. Having never taken any formal notice of them till now, I believed that after so long a time it 
was right to state distinctly what it was I had really done, to 
excite the violence of that period. As far as I can learn, its effect upon fair &amp; liberal minds has been such as I could wish. 
Nevertheless it will not contribute at all to my election 
which will be decided by very different considerations. Ac 
cording to the unfortunate system of nomination prevailing 
here, it is always in the power of a cabal to take from the 
people all share in the real business of an election. Thus for 
instance I was originally nominated by both sections of the 
Republican party by a Committee of the friends of Mr Findlay &amp; a Committee of the friends of Mr Heister. But the 
latter were so anxious to secure his election, that finding the 
federalists unwilling [to] vote for their candidate Mr Heister 
unless Mr Heister's friends in return would vote for the federal 
members of Congress, they reassembled &amp; in order to secure 
the federal votes for Mr Heister gave up their Congress ticket 
altho it had been formally agreed upon &amp; published. My sup 
port therefore will be from one section only of the republicans 
the other at the head of whom is Duane opposing my election, not as he himself avowed to a friend of mine from any 
personal hostility to me, but because I was well disposed to 
the administration of the general gov. Another very efficient 
motive with that individual is that my nomination excluded 
his own son. Such are the springs which move our election. 
The district is in truth a perfect chaos of small factions &amp; as 
I have shunned all participation in their intrigues I do not 
anticipate the slightest chance of being elected. The only 
object of any importance is to rally the sound part of the 
population against the decided hostility to the general gov. 
which animates some of the demagogues &amp; that I think 
can be accomplished. Will you present my best respects to <a href='/results.php?tla=' rel=''>Mrs Monroe</a> . . . 
</p><p>
The opposition is formed of a union of the federalists with 
the friends of Mr Heister. The latter consist of two divisions, 
one willing to sacrifice every thing for Mr Heister, the other 
at the head of whom is Duane, in addition to the same motive 
are stimulated by the pleasure of opposing one whom they 
know to be friendly to the administration of the general gov. 
This reason is distinctly avowed by their leader who at the 
same time professes to have no personal hostility to me. Such 
are the secret springs which will control the election. 
</p><p>
To the Electors of the City and County of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, 
and the County of Delaware. 
</p><p>
I understand that many estimable persons among you, retain unkind feelings toward me from a belief that during the 
late war, I proposed to establish in Pennsylvania the French 
system of military conscription. This reproach was widely 
circulated at that period. But I was then too anxious about 
the defence of the country, to care about defending myself, 
and I therefore never in any way noticed it, presuming that 
when the violence of party passions should subside, men 
would return to more just and liberal sentiments. I should 
still persevere in the same silence, but I think it due to those 
gentlemen, who have done me the honor to connect my name 
with the approaching election for members of congress, to 
remove an impression which may be injurious. If then it be 
true, that there is any individual, who forgetting the dangers of the war, remembers only its prejudices, he will perhaps 
find in the following statement, some reason to think that he 
has been unjust to me. 
</p><p>
The assertion is, that I proposed to introduce the French 
system of conscription. 
</p><p>
The fact is, that I never proposed any thing resembling the 
French conscription; that what I did propose, was a system 
practised in Pennsylvania, long before the French conscription was in existence; and that the very design and effect 
of it was to avoid a conscription, that is a militia draft which 
is in principle, very nearly the same mode of levying troops. 
</p><p>
A few words will make this evident. The French system of 
conscription is this. All the men between twenty and twenty-five years of age, are divided into classes. When a class is called into service, each man of the class must find a substitute or march, or what to the mass of the citizens is 
precisely the same thing, pay sixteen dollars a month. The 
nature of the two services is of course different, from the 
peculiar circumstances, and the different forms of government 
in the two countries; but as mere modes of military levy 
they are evidently similar. 
</p><p>
Now what I have proposed was this. Every twenty-two 
men above eighteen years of age, were to furnish a soldier to 
serve for the defence of the state, during twelve months. If 
they did not, the proper officer was to provide one, and di 
vide the expense among the twenty-two. But before doing 
this, such of the twenty-two as were liable to military duty 
drew lots. If the person on whom the lot fell consented to 
serve, he received a contribution of two hundred dollars from 
his neighbors. If he did not, the price of a substitute should 
exceed two hundred dollars, he was to pay the excess, which 
was limited to two hundred dollars more. 
</p><p>
All this might be a good or a bad system, but one thing at 
least is clear, that it is totally unlike the French system, and 
much less like the French conscription than our own militia 
law, which it was intended to supercede. 
</p><p>
But in fact, the mode of raising a military force at that 
time, was not a question of general policy, but of immediate 
expediency not how to frame a permanent system, but how 
to provide against a sudden emergency. It was necessary to 
raise within ten weeks, that is between the middle of January, before which no law could pass, and the month of April, 
when <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> might be assailed, an adequate force for 
its protection. To procure these troops by voluntary enlistments, was utterly hopeless; for the United States army had, 
during more than two years, gleaned every idler in the state; 
and even had there been time, the commonwealth had neither 
land to promise, nor bounty money to pay to recruits. To rely 
exclusively on occasional drafts of militia, hastily levied at 
every fresh alarm, was to entrust the fate of the city to a system the most oppressive to the citizen, the most expensive 
to the community, and the least efficient against the enemy. 
Believing then the voluntary enlistment too slow and too 
dear, and the militia draft too weak and too burdensome, 
I proposed that which promised to be at once prompt, equal, 
and efficient. I thought then, and I think still, that it had 
many decided advantages over the other plans. The first, 
and the most important was, that by it, and by it alone could 
nine thousand well officered men be brought into the field in 
six weeks, without any demand on the state treasury the 
second was, that being chiefly composed of substitutes who 
would probably reinlist, the force could be retained as long as 
it should be wanted the third was, that it was much more 
favourable to the poorer citizens, than the militia law. By that 
law, if a militia man leaves home, neither he nor his family 
receive any indemnity; and if he stays at home, he pays for 
a years delinquency, one hundred and ninety-two dollars. 
By the proposed bill, if he left home he received two hundred 
dollars; if he staid at home he paid, except in an extraordinary 
case, only the twenty-second part of the price of a substitute. 
Instead moreover of being a dangerous novelty, it had all 
the merit of successful experience. It was an old Pennsylvania plan. In the year <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>, a law passed dividing the people 
into classes, each of which was to furnish a man to serve in 
the army of the United States during the war, and a delinquent class was to pay fifteen pounds specie or current money, 
equivalent, which was one thousand one hundred and twenty-five pounds currency. 
</p><p>
A second act, passed in <a href='/results.php?year=1781'>1781</a>, by which, if a class was delinquent, a substitute was to be procured without limitation of price, at the expense of the class. 
</p><p>
A comparison of the levy of <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>, with that of <a href='/results.php?year=1815'>1815</a>, will 
show how little reason <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> would have had to com 
plain of the latter. By the law of <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>, the city and county 
of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> was bound to furnish eight hundred and 
ninety-five men, to serve in the United States army during 
the war. By the proposed law, the city and county, with per 
haps three times the population, and twenty times the wealth 
of <a href='/results.php?year=1780'>1780</a>, would have been bound to furnish, for its own exclusive defence during one year, about one thousand, or eleven 
hundred men. 
</p><p>
Let me now ask any fair and candid man, in what part of 
this proposed measure is there any thing unjust or oppressive 
any thing which violates the rights, or wounds the interests 
of a single individual if it be not milder than the militia 
law more practicable than an enlistment system and 
unless the city was prepared to submit quietly to shame and 
pillage, what mode of organizing resistance could be more im 
mediate, energetic and just? But supposing it not to be the 
best plan, supposing it to be a wrong plan. That would be 
a fit reason for preferring some other, but it surely is not a 
fair subject of reproach against the proposer, who could not 
possibly have had any personal or selfish motive, and who, if 
he erred, could have been mislead only by mistaken zeal. So 
unwilling indeed was I, that any mere pride of opinion on my 
part should interfere with the public service, that I at the 
same time, supported and voted for an enlistment bill, under an impression that the few who could be raised by it, would 
be at least so much gained for our defence and when my 
own proposal was lost in the house of representatives, was 
one of a committee who immediately proposed a bill for 
raising volunteers, on which the senate were engaged the 
day when peace was announced. 
</p><p>
I proposed and supported these measures from a conviction, that the state of the country demanded a vigorous 
effort to save it, and I should have consented to any thing 
which would call forth its resources without being very fastidious as to forms. And truly if eight thousand men were 
willing to come from the interior to our assistance, it did 
seem to be a matter of utter insignificance to the citizens 
of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, whether they came out of classes of twenty- 
two, or classes of any other number. That they came at 
all that they came well armed well officered and well 
paid might, I think, have satisfied the most scrupulous, 
and furnished an apology at least for the system which 
brought them. 
</p><p>
I have now finished the original purpose of this note, but 
the subject induces me to add a few words on the general 
measures of that time. 
</p><p>
In the autumn of <a href='/results.php?year=1814'>1814</a>, I was elected to represent this 
district in the senate. You all remember the condition of 
the country. Washington had been taken <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a> at 
tacked a large British fleet and army were on the coast, 
able suddenly to strike any assailable point. Against this 
danger, <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> was totally unprepared. She relied on 
the general government, until the failure of the military 
proposals in congress announced to the states, that they 
must provide for their own safety. From that moment it became my duty to secure the means of defending the capital. It was manifest that unless a force could be collected 
before the navigation of the Delaware opened, Philadelphia was at the mercy of the enemy. We wanted then a 
naval defence we wanted a stationary land force, in 
aid of the militia we wanted arms we wanted money. 
That none of these were neglected, will be seen by the legislative journals of that day, which I cite, because they offer 
a simple and unquestionable statement of facts. 
</p><p>
Extract the Senate Journal, <a href='/results.php?year=1814'>1814</a>-15, p. 104. January 
4th, <a href='/results.php?year=1815'>1815</a>. 
</p><p>
"A motion was made by Mr. Biddle and Mr. Lowrie, and 
read as follows. Resolved, that a committee be appointed 
to inquire into the expediency of raising by drafts from the 
militia, a corps of eight thousand men, to serve during 
twelve months for the defence of Pennsylvania and the 
adjoining states, with leave to report by bill or otherwise. 
Resolved, that the same committee be instructed to in 
quire into the expediency of procuring one or more steam 
frigates, steam batteries, or other means of defence for the 
protection of the shores of Delaware, with leave to report 
by bill or otherwise. Resolved, that the same committee be 
instructed to inquire into the expediency of borrowing a 
sum not exceeding one million of dollars, to be employed 
solely for the defence of this state with leave to report 
by bill or otherwise. 
</p><p>
"On motion, said resolutions were severally read, considered, and adopted, and ordered that Mr. Biddle, Mr. Lowrie, Mr. Forster, Mr. Frailey and Mr. Beale, be a committee for the purpose expressed in said resolutions." 
</p><p>
In two days January 6th, <a href='/results.php?year=1815'>1815</a>. Page no. 
</p><p>
"Mr. Biddle from the committee appointed for the purpose on the fourth instant, reported an act to raise a military force for the defence of this commonwealth." This passed the senate on the I4th of January. 
</p><p>
On the I3th January Page 128. 
</p><p>
"Mr. Biddle from the committee appointed for the pur 
pose on the fourth instant reported a bill entitled an act 
to authorize a loan of one million of dollars, for the defence 
of this commonwealth." The loan was to be at seven per 
cent, and to be applied exclusively "to defray any expenses 
which may be incurred in military or naval preparations 
for the defence of this commonwealth." 
</p><p>
On investigation it appeared that the steam frigates 
could not be built in time, and that the approach to the 
city might be adequately defended, by strengthening the 
United States flotilla in the Delaware. It consisted of 
twenty-seven boats and vessels, but such was the desperate 
state of the recruiting service, that this armament had only 
about one fifth of its complement; and a large part of its 
crew were to be discharged in April. The commander was 
requested to state distinctly, what number of men would 
render his flotilla perfectly efficient, and what bounties 
would procure them. He did so, but, that in a service so 
important nothing should be left to hazard, the number of 
men as well as the bounties, were increased beyond his esti 
mates. 
Accordingly, January 25th, <a href='/results.php?year=1815'>1815</a>: 
</p><p>
"Mr. Biddle read in his place, and on permission presented to the chair a bill, entitled An act granting additional emoluments to seamen, employed in the defence of this commonwealth. " This bill passed February 1st. 
</p><p>
Of arms the state possessed enough to equip the new 
levies, (Senate Journal, p. 21,) but that every thing which 
promised to be useful, might be pressed into the public 
service. 
</p><p>
"On motion of Mr. Biddle and Mr. Graham, the follow 
ing resolution was twice read, considered, and adopted. Re 
solved, That a committee be appointed to inquire into the 
nature and advantages of Chamber's repeating guns, and 
the expediency of employing them in the service of the 
state." Senate Journal, p. 46. 
</p><p>
Page 67. "Mr. Biddle, from the committee appointed 
on the 1 5th, to inquire into the nature and advantages of 
Chamber's repeating guns, made report as follows," &amp;c. 
&amp;c. Concluding with a resolution to purchase fifty swivels, 
and to have five hundred muskets altered to the new plan. 
</p><p>
These documents prove that, within a few days after 
the duty of protecting the capital, devolved on the legislature, an efficient system of defence was proposed and 
passed in the Senate; a system, which before the month of 
April, would have placed between <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> and its enemy, a strong flotilla, capable of being speedily reinforced, 
by all the naval resources of the city; and a well officered army in aid of the local militia; a system, which would 
have shielded the city from all danger and all alarm during the war. 
</p><p>
Of the energy and patriotism of those gentlemen, from 
the interior, who co-operated with me, and who, although 
remote from the capital, readily and zealously took their 
share in its defence, I can never speak nor feel too warmly. 
Nor did I permit myself to question the motives of those 
who opposed any of these measures. I knew them too well, not to ascribe their opposition to a fair and honourable 
difference of opinion. But I also had some right to a liberal 
construction of my own views. In executing the duties as 
signed to me, I had endeavoured to do what was useful, not 
what was agreeable; and never having sought to please, 
not to have pleased, would have been a subject neither of 
surprise, nor mortification. But I could not easily anticipate, that after a laborious and anxious struggle to pro 
vide for the defence of my own native city against foreign 
enemies, after securing the aid of patriotic men from the 
country, willing to partake in the expense and the dangers 
of that defence, I should become an object of denunciation 
in that very city; should have been put under a sort of 
political proscription, avowedly for my activity in striving to protect it. 
</p><p>
There was about the same time another measure, to 
which from my share in it, it may be well to advert. When 
Massachusetts and Connecticut proposed to Pennsylvania, 
the changes in the constitution, originally projected at 
the convention of <a href='/results.php?city=hartford' rel='city'>Hartford</a>, 1 it appeared to me after very 
deliberate examination that their inevitable effect would 
be to loosen the whole structure of the confederation, and 
that they were therefore more dangerous to the country 
than the foreign armies which threatened it. The discussion 
of these proposals had in every quarter, inflamed to their 
utmost violence the feelings of the community. I thought 
then that Pennsylvania, neutral in its position, yet em 
bracing nearly all the interests on which these changes would operate, might usefully interpose its calm strength 
between the passions of its neighbours, and by a course of 
mingled decision and gentleness, reclaim them to milder 
feelings towards each other. The report on the amendments 
was hastily drawn in the midst of other occupations, and 
much of it written on the road to Harrisburgh. It of course 
has no pretension as to form. But if my recollection does 
not deceive me, its general tone was fair and impartial, 
it imputed no unworthy motives, it contained no phrase 
which could wound even any member of that convention, 
it discussed the proposals with candor, nor was there the 
slightest departure from that courtesy, which among in 
dependent states, is at once the proof and the security of 
mutual respect. Yet this paper it seems has been the subject or the pretext of much censure upon its author. 
</p><p>
Of all these things I have never complained. I do not now complain. Their singularity has much oftener tempted 
me to smile at finding myself reproached not by the men 
of the country, for calling them from their homes, but 
by the men of the city, because in suddenly raising nine 
thousand soldiers for its defence, I had been guilty of arranging them into classes of twenty-two. It is right how 
ever, to say that if during the war I persevered in these 
measures in opposition to prejudices, which I saw were 
estranging from me many honest and amiable citizens, and 
if I have suffered nearly six years to pass without any effort 
to remove them, my silence has proceeded rather from a 
disregard of what was merely personal to myself, than from 
any insensibility to the good will of the community. I do 
not feel and I will not affect any such indifference. I have 
lived long enough to know that the kindly feelings of those who surround us, are among our best and safest enjoyments. 
But even that good will may be too dearly purchased, and 
I am quite sure that the applause of others, could never 
console me for the loss of my own esteem. That I should 
have forfeited irretrievably, if at a season of great national 
disaster, when not merely the safety, but the honor of the 
state was menaced, when all the free institutions of this 
country were rocking to their foundations, I should from 
any spirit of faction, or the despicable dread of being what 
is called unpopular, have shrunk from any one duty of the 
station in which your confidence had placed me.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have received your letter of the 26th inst. in relation to the Presidency of the Bank, and shall cheerfully 
give as you request such views of the subject as my service in the Bank &amp; my acquaintance with the community may suggest. 
</p><p>
If the Bank were in a prosperous situation with an efficient Direction &amp; a full complement of experienced officers 
the President might, be as so many Presidents, are, a gentle 
man of high character to do the honors -of the Bank without much attention to its business. But you well know that 
the Bank of the U.S. is deficient in these respects and the 
next President must have such a decided influence over 
its management as very materially to affect its future for 
tunes. He should if possible therefore unite in his person 
these qualifications, talent for business standing with 
the gov. &amp; residence in Phil'a. 
</p><p>
1st. I say talent for business rather than what is commonly 
called a man of business for without meaning at all to 
disparage the knowledge of details which men of business 
are presumed to possess I am quite satisfied from what I 
have myself seen at the Bank that the mere men of business are by no means the most efficient in the administration. The fact is that the misfortunes of the Bank which 
grew principally out of the injudicious extension of the 
Western Branches 1 were actually occasioned by the men of 
business &amp; their errors were precisely the faults into which 
the men of business were most likely to fall. They trusted 
the Western people with money as they trusted them 
with goods and suffered themselves to be deluded by 
the visions &amp; currencies of equalizing exchanges more &amp; 
liberal habits of thinking would have easily dispelled be 
cause without intending reflections, there are not in the 
Bank such a set of officers as there should be &amp; the 
personal inspection of a President is therefore the more

2. He should be known to, &amp; stand well with the Gov fc 
not an active partizan not even a party man but a 
man in whom the gov would confide. I am far from thinking that the gov 1 should have any direct or indirect influence 
over the Bank on the contrary the less of it which exists 
the better for both. But the gov is a great stockholder and 
a great customer and as the gov Directors cannot exercise the same degree of concert &amp; previous communication 
as the rest of the Directors stockholders do. It would be 
not unwise to consult to a certain extent the feelings of the gov* where the great interests of the Bank may depend so 
much on its countenance &amp; protection. 
3. His being a <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>n tho not an essential is yet 
a desirable circumstance. The Bank has by a combination 
of circumstances become so odious in Phil'a., that it is exceedingly difficult as you well know to procure a competent 
Direction. There are certainly all the materials of an excel 
lent Board, if they would consent to rally round any one 
individual and the character of the Bank will wholly 
depend on the local Board, the Distant Directors are in 
fact from the very nature of things rather ornamental than 
useful. Now I fear that a stranger would not easily obtain 
the aid of such a Board as ought to be collected. If yet such 
is the importance of that circumstance that I am not sure 
whether the wisest plan would not be first to make a list of 
20 Directors &amp; the best names of the City &amp; then see under 
what President 15 or 1 6 of them would consent to serve 
and name him accordingly. . . .

[ This letter, although it has no definite address, is undoubtedly written to one of the directors of the Bank. The Biddle Correspondence contains a number of letters from different members of the board urging Biddle to present his views on the qualifications of a President and subtly hinted the desirability of his appearing as a candidate; and it is evidently in reply to one of these requests that the above letter was drafted. ]

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I had the pleasure last night of receiving your letter 
of the 2d inst, thank you with great cordiality for the 
friendly dispositions which dictated it. The course which 
I have hitherto prescribed to myself, has been neither to 
seek nor to shun a situation of so much responsibility, but 
if I am called to share in the administration of the Bank, 
I shall bring to its service at least a laborious &amp; zealous devotion to its interests. This unfortunate institution has 
from its birth been condemned to struggle with the most 
perplexing difficulties, yet even with all its embarrassments 
it has sustained the national currency &amp; rescued the country from the dominition of irresponsible banks, &amp; their 
depreciated circulation. The time has perhaps arrived when 
it may combine its own &amp; the country's security with a more 
enlarged development of its resources and a wider extension 
of its sphere of usefulness. To this object to which my own 
exertions shall be anxiously directed. I have long known and 
appreciated the manly &amp; decisive services which you have 
rendered to the same cause &amp; if I should see any occasion in which the Bank may avail itself of your assistance I 
shall ask it with the same frankness &amp; sincerity with which 
I now assure you of the great personal respect &amp; esteem of

Sir,

Your letter of the 2d . inst: has just reached me. Our mutual friend <a href='/results.php?tla=roc' rel='colleague friend'>Mr. Colt</a> has already apprized me of the 
advantage which I might expect from your confidential communication, &amp; your letter satisfies me that he has not 
overrated the value of them. I beg you to believe that I shall always be gratified at hearing from you whenever any thing 
occurs which you deem interesting and that I am perfectly prepared always to reciprocate your confidence.

It is my anxious desire to see your Office at the head of the business of N. York, and for that purpose not to suffer 
itself to be encumbered with state Bank balances, nor with more debts from Southern Offices than necessarily grow 
out of the receipt of their paper and a profitable and accommodating exchange business. The practice here is this. 
Every morning the Clerks from this Bank and the State Banks meet and inter change the notes received respectively on the preceeding day. The Balances are Struct accordingly but no Bank ever calculates on its Balance remaining for any length of time &amp; whenever it grows a little too large, no Bank ever hesitates to send for ten or 
fifteen or twenty thousand dollars from its debtor. We had the other day a draft for $25,000 from one of our City 
Banks which was paid as cheerfully &amp; with as little sensation as if it had been a check for $25. Whenever there is a 
draft from an individual for Specie to any amount the State Banks are made to pay it if their Balances allow it. Thus it 
goes round no one complains and every one is Satisfied. In truth, it is only when these balances accumulate &amp; remain for any length of time that they become oppressive to both parties and excite mutual ill will. You have now a fine oportunity of establishing and maintaining your preeminence and I hope anxiously that it will not be lost. The other subjects of your letter will receive an early attention, but 
my occupations this morning allow me time only to acknowledge the receipt of it thus briefly &amp; to add that I am

Sir,

. . . The view which I have of the true policy of the 
Bank is this. We have had enough &amp; more than enough of 
banking in the interior. We have been crippled &amp; almost 
destroyed by it. It is time to concenter our business to 
bank where there is some use &amp; some profit in it, and there 
fore (while anxious to do business in the interior the moment there is clear prospect of doing it usefully &amp; safely) 
to make at present the large commercial Cities the principal 
scene of our operations. With this impression my object is 
to give to the Office at <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> the command of the business of N. York to make it the first banking institution 
there. To this it is entitled from its Capital its resources, 
and the character of its Direction. But it never can have the 
power which it ought to possess, if it suffers itself to be 
crowded out of its proper sphere by the State Banks &amp; 
to be constantly preyed upon by them. It would be desirable too that it should keep its means as much as possible to itself except what may be necessary for profit 
able exchange operations, &amp; as far as possible avoid having large balances from Southern Offices. . . .

My Dear Sir 
</p><p>
The frequent experience which we have had of your 
liberality and your attachment to the interest of the Bank, 
has induced us to take a liberty which I persuade myself 
you will not disapprove. Since the Presidency of the Office 
at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> has passed out of the political family where it has 
been so long, there has been a feeling of disquiet at the circumstance, increased by the political cast of a great majority of the Board. These are considerations, which situated as we are we cannot wholly overlook, that they shall 
never be permitted to interfere with more important matters. Still in the effort to attract towards the Bank the good wishes of the country at large it is desirable whenever a 
safe opportunity presents itself, of assuaging feelings which 
may hereafter grow into hostility, to take advantage of it. 
During the present year our two directors from your state 
are both of the same political denomination and as the 
President of the Office is now of that section also it is 
thought well to give to their political opponents, if indeed 
they can be so called, a larger share in the administration. 
This we have done by substituting <a href='/results.php?tla=bwc' rel='colleague'>Mr Crowninshield</a>, for Mr. Mason. To the latter's gentleman his seat at this 
Board is I presume an object of indifference, as his high stand 
ing and character place him beyond the reach of wishing a 
mere compliment, and his occupations prevent his personal 
attendance. <a href='/results.php?tla=bwc' rel='colleague'>Mr Crowninshield</a> is a gentleman of character, 
a large Stockholder, and he will now visit us necessarily 
twice a year. Under these circumstances, <a href='/results.php?tla=tmc' rel='colleague'>Gen'l Cadwalader</a> and myself have thought it was for the interest of 
the Bank to make the change, and we have relied on the 
good feelings of yourself and Mr Mason to understand, and 
appreciate our motives. To that gentleman, whom I have 
not the pleasure of knowing personally, I trust you will be 
good enough to explain the reasons of this change, which in truth has been occasioned by our perfect conviction, that 
in the endeavor to reconcile conflicting interests we have 
some right to claim and are sure of receiving, the indulgence of such gentlemen as Mr Mason and yourself.

My dear Sir,

I have just received your favor of the 14th inst. and 
regret much that it will not be in my power to negotiate 
the note you have forwarded, which is therefore returned 
to you herewith. Since my connection with the Bank I 
have been obliged to make it an invariable rule not to be a 
borrower from the Bank itself and not to be an indorser 
on notes discounted either there or in other institutions. 
To this I have on principle adhered, to the prejudice of my 
own interest, from a conviction that situated as I am, it 
was in all respects proper. I should feel more unwilling to 
act on it upon the present occasion if I did not know that 
it would not incommode you as you will find no difficulty 
in making the arrangement elsewhere. . . .

Sir

Allow me again to invite your attention to the subject of turning the balances with the State Banks, in your 
favor by bringing your discounts within your income. In 
the midst of the speculations J which are abroad, combined 
with the demands for specie, prudence requires that we 
should keep within reasonable limits, and that under all 
circumstances, and at all hazards the Bank should keep 
itself secure and strong. Since the 18th of March when 
I wrote to you on the subject of your ability to do business paper falling due on or about the 1st of July, your 
discounts have increased about $700,000, a fair addition 
to your business which would be attended with no inconvenience did not an extraordinary demand for Specie which 
has arisen render the extension more hazardous by expos 
ing you to calls for Specie against which every consideration of prudence requires you to guard. It is no doubt very 
unpleasant and even painful to decline good business paper, 
but you have already by so large an increase of your discounts contributed your full share to the public accomodation and beyond a certain limit the convenience of the 
customers of the Bank however desirable it may be to pro 
mote it is only a secondary consideration when there is the 
slightest risk that by pushing the spirit of accomodation as 
to require a sudden reduction, which would more than over 
balance the facilities to a few individuals which had occasioned it. In the present state of the office the true course 
I think is, to turn over as quietly as possible to the other 
Banks, any demand which you cannot supply to let the 
diminution of your discounts, and the public revenue as it 
accumulates turn the scale in your favor with the other Banks, and then not to make sudden or very rigid demands 
on them for Specie when you feel satisfied that you can 
claim your balances the moment they are wanted. By pursuing such a system you will I hope soon be able to regain 
your ascendency over the State institutions without risk or 
inconvenience.

I again observe with pleasure your proceedings of 
yesterday. Everything will go as we could wish if we have 
but the firmness to withstand the solicitations of persons 
whose wants or whose interest overcome every other consideration. Our first duty is to take care of the Bank, and 
at the present moment of wild and exaggerated speculation if we suffer ourselves to be borne away by the cur 
rent, if we do not on the contrary, like sober and prudent 
men, resist alike the entreaties or the clamors of individuals 
we shall betray our trust. You are doing now perfectly well. 
Let us not by the hope of doing better or getting more business risk the prosperity and safety of the institution. . . .

Dear Sir,

. . . The truth is simply this. The Bank is doing very 
well. During my connection of six years with it, I have 
never seen its affairs in so satisfactory a state, as at the 
present moment. It will have certainly have earned during the last six months more than three per cent. But then I am 
clearly of opinion that we should never advance our rate 
of dividend, till we are perfectly satisfied that we will never 
have occasion to diminish it. In Jany. <a href='/results.php?year=1823'>1823</a>, we began with 
out one dollar in our pockets and we have been trying 
ever since to accumulate a fund in reserve, so as to equalize 
our dividends. You may be very sure of two things : in the 
first place that no determination with regard to the next 
Dividend has been generally formed, &amp; in the second place 
that whatever that Dividend may be the succeeding dividend will be at least as much. . . .

My dear Sir,

... I have no doubt that we could at once give to 
the Southern &amp; Western sections of the country two or three 
millions of sound &amp; useful circulating medium if we could 
sign that amount of 5 &amp; 10 dollars. But to make two mil 
lions of five dollar notes, it would be necessary to sign my 
name 40x3,000 times, which, to a person whose time is &amp; 
must be absorbed during the day by the duties of his station, is wholly impracticable. The application for this purpose was made to Congress some years ago, but it was ac 
companied by a request that Congress would alter the 
Charter so as to prevent the universal receivability of the 
notes. This I am satisfied from experience, as I was at the 
time from theory, is not desirable; &amp; all that the Bank now 
wants is, that it may carry into execution a purpose useful 
alike to itself &amp; to the community, by assisting in the diffusion of a wholesome currency. I wish therefore to consult 
you as to the best mode of presenting that subject to Congress. I have been for three years past so anxious to keep 
the Bank out of view in the political world &amp; bring it down to its true business character as a Counting House, that I 
have been very reluctant to apply to Congress for anything. ... I believe it to stand better with Congress than it did 
some time ago, but the political odour of sanctity is very evanescent &amp; if our purpose can be obtained without bring 
ing on two weeks debate upon the constitutionality of the Bank, the usurpations of the Supreme Court, &amp; omni scibile 
&amp; quibusdem aliis, it would be a great satisfaction. . . .

My dear Sir,

. . . With regard to our late arrangements, they are 
simply these. It has been impossible hitherto while the officers of the Bank were so fully occupied with local duties to 
know as much as was necessary of a great many matters of the highest importance. For instance we have nearly two 
millions of real estate besides Banking houses, &amp; we have about nine millions of old &amp; new suspended debts. You 
know how apt real estate &amp; bad debts are to suffer for the 
want of looking after after. We therefore appointed an officer here to take care of those two concerns. Again, we have 
never had a sufficient knowledge of the accounts between the officers. It was thus that West the Cashier of New Orleans was enabled to defraud the Bank of $20,000 we 
wish to examine these accounts, &amp; we wish also to have our Exchange business particularly well managed. We have 
therefore appointed another Officer for those two purposes. With a view to attract gentlemen of first rate abilities, as the salaries are low ($<a href='/results.php?year=2500'>2500</a> for one &amp; $2,200 for 
the other) we have called them not Clerks but Assistant Cashiers. . . .

My Dear Sir,

I have had the pleasure of receiving your letter of 
the 18th inst which revived a great many agreeable recollections. In regard to the establishment of a Branch at Port 
land nothing is as yet decided but should it take place the policy of the Bank has been in the appointment of confidential Officers to live at a distance and to execute such 
important trusts to take in preference Officers brought up in the Bank under our own eye whose character &amp; conduct 
are known to us and afford the best guarantee of their capacity to carry into effect the system of the Bank with which 
they are familiar. I have long been satisfied that this is the true policy of the Bank and I think it will be pursued in case 
a Branch is established at Portland. The observation applies of course only to the Cashier. The other Officers are appointed 
by the Directors of the Branch. This is all that I can say at present and although it would be more agreeable to me personally to offer to your nephew more favorable prospects yet this candid explanation is due to you.

. . . With a view to secure the best talents in its service &amp; to reward the meritorious officers, the rule of the Bank 
is that whenever any vacancy occurs it is rilled by promotion, &amp; the person last introduced takes his place at the foot 
of the list, &amp; is gradually advanced if found deserving. The 
salary of the Officers on their first entrance into the Bank is 
seven hundred dollars ($700) a year. A comparatively small 
compensation, but as it is known to lead to more lucrative 
situations, it is sufficient to attract to the service of the Bank 
a great number of applicants of respectability. When a vacancy takes place a selection is made from these by a ballot 
at the Board in which I of course participate as one of the 
members merely. At present there is no vacancy. It is impossible however to say how soon there may be one and if you 
think it desirable after what I have stated to come into the Bank I would recommend this course. . . .

My Dear Sir

In consequence of your letter I wrote to the proper source suggesting the gentleman mentioned by you and 
have this morning an answer of which the following is an extract. 
</p><p>
" In regard to the appointment of Mr it is well known here that he is in embarrassed circumstances and his notes 
now in the Bank are considered discounted on one name, which however is unquestionably good. Repeated efforts 
have been made to obtain an additional name, in which we have failed. It is with much inconvenience he meets even 
his check of 10 per cent and his note for $3330 has recently passed the Board for the same amount (now under protest) 
on condition of his paying 20% on the next renewal. Under these circumstances however happy I should otherwise be 
to have him attached to the Board, I cannot at present consistently recommend him for a Director." This presents a 
strong case. Obliged as we are to look at the pecuniary side of men's characters, to be in embarrassed circumstances and to 
be even under protest, are deemed disqualifications for sitting at the Board which must decide on his own applications for 
loans. It is probable that you are not aware of these facts and I mention the subject thus early, so that in case you wish to 
make any further remarks on it, they may be in time for the election on the 11th of next month. I will only add that as the 
letter to me is in the most entire confidence, you will consider it in the same manner. I should particularly regret that 
your correspondent knew the source of the objection as it might excite personal hostility towards a very worthy man. . . .

Dear Sir,

... I wish Mr. arbour had introduced his motion at 
some other time for just now it is particularly inconvenient. 
I need not tell the Chairman of the Com. of Commerce that 
for the last four or five months the course of trade and ex 
change has carried off a great part of the specie fund of the 
country &amp; that the Banks may probably be obliged to defend 
themselves by diminishing their accomodations to the Community which is you know the ultimate remedy. But it is sometimes a severe one. We have been striving to avoid it 
by very large sales of bills which yet do not supply the demand. Just at this moment it happened very luckily that the 
quotations of the Bank Stock in England were such as to show 
that remittance of it would be as good as specie calculating 
the present rate of exchange &amp; the price of 5.10 in London. 
Accordingly large remittance of Stocks were contemplated 
the effect of which would have been, besides the profit to our 
citizens to furnish an amount of exchange which would relieve by so much the pressure on the Banks by specie. I think 
that a million of dollars would have taken that direction in a 
week or two &amp; would have afforded real relief. The proposal 
to sell 7 millions of course destroys all chance of a sale in England at present prices. Nor is this all. For if the foreign Stock 
holders should take the alarm &amp; throw their stock into the market here it would create a new demand for exchange to 
remit the proceeds, &amp; thus increase the pressure on the Banks. Whatever be the decision of Congress it is desirable that it should be soon made.

out the community at the great promptness &amp; ability which 
have distinguished your course on this occasion. They who 
are directly interested in the result have naturally strong 
sentiments of gratification to one who has averted from them 
a great calamity; but there is a more numerous &amp; impartial

My Dear Sir 
</p><p>
I had this morning the pleasure of receiving your favor 
of yesterday during the session of the Board from which I 
was not released in time to answer it by the return of the mail 
I need not say that it will afford me great satisfaction to assist 
in refuting the injurious representations of your affairs, 
which I remember to have seen without reading, as I should 
have read without believing them. I began by ascertaining 
from the records of the Bank the accuracy of your statement 
but as the returns from the offices represent only the debts 
of the parties, and not the paper which they deposit for collection, I cannot speak on that subject with as much distinctness as I am able to do in regard to the reduction of your debt 
and your fidelity in complying with your engagements to the 
Bank. On reflection I think it better not to publish a formal 
certificate, but to introduce the testimony of the Bank in a 
manner less direct tho equally authoritative. With the reason 
of this, I need not trouble you tho I do not doubt that you would concur with me. You will also I hope agree in the 
opinion that the fittest channel now for such a communication is Mr Walsh. The relation in which he stands to the present contest will under his agency [be] more independent, and 
he will give a pungency &amp; force to the contradiction which will 
probably secure to it a wider circulation than it could obtain 
through any other of our papers. I have accordingly given 
to him a statement which he will embody in a paragraph for 
tomorrow's gazette. You and he I believe do not always 
agree in the upper regions of politics but I regret to see 
estrangements among those whom I esteem &amp; on this occasion he will do you justice frankly &amp; cordially. I trust you 
will be satisfied with the manner in which the subject will be 
presented &amp; believe me very truly

My dear Sir 
</p><p>
I thank you for your favor of the 9 th inst. in regard to 
the <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a> office which we have this day arranged aggreeably to your recommendation. The only departure from it 
is that we have fixed the salary at $800 &amp; the professional 
compensation at $1,200 instead of making each $1,000. 
This was done so as to preserve the symmetry of our system 
of compensation to the Presidents of Offices of similar Capital to that of <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a>, and not to make any invidious distinctions between them. To Mr Mason the form is I presume indifferent. 
</p><p>
It remains now to secure his election. 
</p><p>
You know that the Parent Board indicated their preference of a President by placing him at the head of the list 
and this is usually decisive but the election is actually with the Board of the Office, and altho I have no reason to sup 
pose that there will be any difficulty, yet [it] is always so much 
easier, if possible, to prevent them to overcome obstacles, that 
I wish you would take upon yourself to promote his election by any communication which you may deem judicious 
with the Board of the Office, whose names are subjoined. I 
enclose Mr Mason's letter to you.

... I am very much obliged to you for the intimation of your purpose of mentioning the Bank in your next report. 
Independant of the pleasure of seeing its usefulness recognized from so high a source, it may perhaps be useful with 
regard to others who have hitherto not been so well disposed &amp; who now seemed destined to have an influence hereafter 
over that subject, so far as respects the country I am perfectly satisfied from as intimate a knowledge as I possess of 
any subject, that [but] for the presence of the Bank the currency of the country would in two months time relapse into 
confusion, &amp; that the public revenue, becoming of unequal value at every part of the Union would be subject to loss &amp; 
delay &amp; expence in making transfers which would be incalculable injurious. It occurs to me &amp; I therefore venture the 
suggestion that the subject might be appropriately introduced at that part of the report, which will naturally state 
the amount of debt extinguished during the last four years. It would then be satisfactory to add, that the whole of this 
amount, in addition to the ordinary receipts &amp; disbursements, after being collected in various quarters of this extensive 
country are transferred to the several points where the public debt is payable, &amp; actually disbursed for that purpose 
without the delay of amount, or the expense of a dollar or the slightest risk the Bank being responsible for the con 
duct of the agents while in England, the Gov pay more than a million of dollars annually for the management of its 
debt by the Bank of England. What is scarcely less important is, that from the arrangements made by the Bank for these 
payments, the inconvenience of a great accumulation of money in the vaults of the Gov* followed by an immediate 
distribution of it is entirely obviated. The Bank as the period of payment approaches, anticipates in the form of discounts 
the disbursement of a considerable portion of the Stock and the rest becomes absorbed in the mass of its operations 
so that many millions are paid on a given day, without the slightest previous pressure, or any consciousness on the part 
of the community of such an operation, which unless skilfully made, may produce inconvenient shocks &amp; fluctuations. . . .

I rec'd this morning your favor of the 29th ulto 
which did not reach me until the Committee to whom Mr Gales application was referred had decided upon it &amp; their 
report was adopted by the Board today. 
</p><p>
I have, indeed we all have, very favorable dispositions 
towards Mr Gales, &amp; would gladly assist him if it could be 
done with propriety. But it would be wrong for us to con 
sider the matter in any other than a pecuniary light or to treat 
it on any other than simple business principles. The value 
of his paper &amp; the advantage of its continuance are considerations entirely foreign to us^ and the very circumstance that 
but for the B. U. S. any newspaper would be discontinued, 
or that the Bank had gone out of its way in order to sustain 
any newspaper either in administration or in opposition would 
be a subject of reproach &amp; what alone makes reproach uncomfortable of just reproach to the Bank. I have striven to 
keep the Bank straight &amp; neutral in this conflict of parties, 
&amp; I shall endeavor to persevere in that course. If then the 
support of the Nat 1 Int r . offers no adequate temptation to 
hazard the property of the Bank, the loan is on business principles not a proper one. The responsibilities of the party now 
amount to a little above $50,000 : for this the Bank has it is 
conceived just enough &amp; no more to make the debt secure, &amp; 
all the other means of the parties are already pledged for 
other debts. The only chance there of any accession of means is in the contingency of their receiving the appointment of 
printers to the next Congress a contingency which a politician may regard as surrounded by different degrees of probability but which to a Banker seems an unsteady basis for 
a loan of $15,000. I am very sorry that we were obliged to decline but really saw no other course, unless we were ready 
in all impartiality, to furnish the means for a newspaper under the next administration. I have written thus freely 
because I thought it would interest you to know the fate of his application &amp; the reason of it.

... 3. You ask "whether any of the branches, in 
any way whatever, except the individual votes of the Directors, interfered in the late contest." 
</p><p>
Most certainly not in the slightest degree. There is no 
one principle better understood by every officer in the Bank, 
than that, he must abstain from politics, and I have not seen 
nor heard of any one of them in any part of the Union, who 
has been engaged in this controversy. I remarked the other day a story of a person l in <a href='/results.php?city=cincinnati' rel='city'>Cincinnati</a> who was arrested for 
rent, &amp; it was supposed that the agent of the Bank had done 
it to prevent his going to the Senate &amp; making a Senator of 
the U.S. friendly to <a href='/results.php?tla=anj' rel='adversary'>Gen'l Jackson</a>. I do not consider it possible that he should have had any such design, but the subject is under investigation, &amp; if he shall be found to have 
abused the power of the bank to such an unworthy purpose, 
he shall certainly never have an opportunity of repeating it. 
The course of the Bank is very clear and straight on that 
point. We believe that the prosperity of the Bank &amp; its use 
fulness to the country depend on its being entirely free from 
the control of the Officers of the Gov 1 , a control fatal to every 
Bank, which it ever influenced. In order to preserve that in 
dependence it must never connect itself with any administration &amp; never become a partizan of any set of politicians. 
In this respect I believe all the officers of the institution 
have been exemplary. The truth is that with us, it is considered that we have no concern in politics. Dean Swift, 
said you know, that money is neither, whig nor tory, and we say with equal truth, that the Bank is neither Jackson man nor an Adams man, it is only a Bank. . . .

Dear Sir 
</p><p>
I have had the pleasure of receiving your letter of the 2d inst, in which you mention your being about to make 
a favorable report on the nomination of Directors of the B. U. S, but wished previously to know "what amount of 
accommodation had been granted to each by way of discount." I feel some regret at declining to answer any inquiry 
of yours and as you know have given full &amp; frank in formation on every topic connected with the administration 
of the Bank. But a question involving the private affairs of my colleagues is of a totally different character. The account 
which any individual keeps with the Bank is a private con 
cern between him &amp; the Bank of which it would be a violation of confidence to speak. The information sought more 
over would be useless unless its tendency was to show that the individual had borrowed too much a fact which would 
tend to prove not merely the want of personal independence 
on the part of the borrower, but also fix on the Board of Directors the imputation of suffering him to borrow too much 
to neither of which could I with propriety give countenance without a departure from that course of delicacy in 
regard to the private concerns of individuals which I think due equally to them &amp; to myself. My feeling on that subject 
is very strong. I have for instance been a director of the Bank for nine years I have been its presiding officer for six years. 
I have never borrowed a dollar from the Bank x &amp; trust that I never shall. And yet if it were made a question whether I 
had borrowed one dollar or one million of dollars I would not answer the enquiry, to be made President of the U.S. be 
cause it goes to establish an inquisition into the private affairs of individuals which is equally unjust &amp; invidious. I do 
not think myself at liberty therefore to state any thing with regard to those who keep their accounts in the Bank. . . . 
</p><p>
P.S. We have just made a dividend of 3^ per cent with a surplus on our last six months business of more than $100,000 
so that the operations of the year close with a dividend of 7 per cent &amp; a surplus of profits of $224,000.

Dear Sir 
</p><p>
The annexed list has been sent to me from Washington, as containing the views of several members of Congress 
from Kentucky in regard to a proper direction for your Office. 
It is accompanied by an expression of opinion on their part not to me directly, but thro a common friend that during 
the elections in Kentucky, great facilities were given by the Branches in that State, to persons favorable to the reelection 
of <a href='/results.php?tla=jqa' rel=''>Mr Adams</a>, whilst almost all accommodation was withheld 
from the other side of the contest. I will not believe for a moment that this is not a mistake. The officers of the Bank have 
hitherto so studiously avoided all interference in politics, 
that I think it scarcely possible that any gentlemen connected with it, should so far forget their duty as to become 
partizans, or abuse their delicate trusts to the unworthy purpose of advancing any political object. The statement is how 
ever made, and the nomination subjoined is I presume in tended to prevent the recurrence of similar favoritism in 
future by an union of parties in the Board. As you are about to forward a new list, I will state to you precisely my views on that subject. 
</p><p>
Politics should be rigorously excluded from the administration of the Bank. In selecting Directors, the first considerations [should be] integrity, independence, &amp; knowledge of 
business. No man should be shunned, &amp; no man should be 
sought on account of his political opinions merely. Nevertheless in a community where broad political divisions prevail, 
we must not be wholly insensible to them we must not 
exclude, nor even seem to exclude, any one particular denomination of politicians; but where both present candidates of 
equal merits, we should take them from both parties. But 
still the first question is, their qualifications, distinct from 
their political opinions. I would not however be disposed to 
act on any regular system of equally uniting both parties 
because the inevitable effect of it would be to force upon us 
inferior men, merely because they were politicians. I have 
myself an extreme unwillingness to blend politics with the 
concerns of the Bank. Nearly all its misfortunes may be 
traced to this cause, &amp; in your section of the country we 
have surely had a melancholy experience of the hazard of 
lending to politicians. Since you have been relieved from 
them, your affairs have prospered, and you are doing so 
well that I do not wish to disturb your progress by an infusion of politics. But at the same time, we must avoid the 
odium, which would naturally &amp; justly attach to the exclusion of any party from its proper share in the government 
&amp; the loans of the Bank. . . .

My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
There is one topic in my letter to you of this day, on 
which I did not wish to enlarge lest it might appear invidious, but which is very fruitful of admonition. The truth is, that 
almost all the misfortunes of the Bank of the United States, are traceable, directly or indirectly, to politics. In Kentucky 
the losses were in a great measure incurred by loans to prominent politicians of all sides whose influence procurred them 
undue facilities which ended, as frequently happens, in such cases, by ruining them as well as cripling the Branches. These 
things have made us sensitive on that point, &amp; unwilling to see any great political influence introduced, which might lead 
to a recurrence of similar misfortunes.

</p><p>
My dear Sir 
</p><p>
I thank you very sincerely for your favor of the 5th 
inst. with its inclosures. . . . 
</p><p>
On the general question, I concur entirely in your views, 
which are, in fact, those which prevail in the administration 
of the Bank. Our theory is, that the Bank should studiously 
abstain from all interference in politics, &amp; there is not an 
officer of the Institution who does not know that his stand 
ing &amp; his place too, depend on his strict observance of this 
principle. 1 believe also that they have hitherto been faithful 
to it. I have never heard of any suspicion even, that any 
officer of the Bank has intermeddled with politics, except on 
one occasion, and that suspicion, I am satisfied after inquiry, 
was without foundation. 
</p><p>
In regard to Directors, the first considerations undoubtedly are, integrity, independence &amp; knowledge of business. 
</p><p>
No man should be excluded, no man should be sought, 
merely on account of his political sentiments. Nevertheless, 
in a community where broad political distinctions prevail, 
we must not be insensible to them, we must not reject, 
nor even seem to reject, any denomination of politicians, &amp; 
where we have the means of selecting persons equally competent from all parties, their political opinions ought not to be 
overlooked. Still, however, in choosing Directors, who borrow themselves &amp; who lend to others, the funds belonging to the 
Gov. and to the Stockholders, their personal independence, 
&amp; their fitness for that particular duty must be the primary 
inquiry their political preferences only a secondary concern. 
The great hazard of any system of equal division of parties 
at a Board is, that it almost inevitably forces upon you in 
competent or inferior persons, in order to adjust the numerical balance of Directors. For instance, the Board at Nashville naturally consists of the political friends of <a href='/results.php?tla=anj' rel='adversary'>General Jackson</a> that at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, of the friends of <a href='/results.php?tla=jqa' rel=''>Mr Adams</a> (tho , 
such is the fate of politicians, I am not so sure of that now) 
and this is not from any principle of political selection or exclusion, but because the best agents for managing monied 
concerns, happened to be on that side just as the best 
lawyer or the best merchant of these places, would probably be in favor of their respective candidates but if, 
with a view to redress this inequality, we were to introduce incompetent persons, the Bank might sustain serious injury. 
</p><p>
In the Branches we naturally look to the confidential officers of the Bank (the Cashier who is appointed by the Parent 
Board, and the President of the Branch) to nominate suitable 
persons to fill the vacancies as they occur by rotation, and if, after inquiring from other independent sources, we see no 
reason to distrust their judgment, we generally lean to their nomination. This is the safest general practice, because if we 
at a distance place in the Direction gentlemen without know 
ing their precise pecuniary situation, we may introduce individuals who have already borrowed too much, or wish to 
borrow too much, or who have needy friends whose claims they may urge successfully while sitting at the Board, when 
they might otherwise be resisted. In regard to the Branches in Kentucky, they have met with enormous losses not less 
perhaps than $600,000 and a great portion of this not on business loans, the legitimate object of Banking, but on accomodation paper which should never have found its way 
into the Branches. This melancholy experience has induced us to give a more commercial &amp; business-like character to 
their transactions, and they have naturally fallen into the hands of business men, who have managed their affairs very 
well. These Branches were never in so sound &amp; prosperous a state as at this moment never did business so usefully 
to the community &amp; so profitably to the Bank. Being perfectly satisfied with their progress, &amp; perceiving that the set 
of gentlemen in the Direction are nearly the same who have been there for four or five years, I have not examined their 
relation to the political parties which have grown up principally since they were first introduced into the Boards. I was 
not even aware, until I received your letter, of any political preponderance either way, in the Directions of the Branches, 
nor did I suppose it possible that they would abuse their trusts to any political object. ...

Dear Sir

. . . We are obliged to receive and glad to receive nominations from any respectable quarter, &amp; always treat them 
with respect but you must not suspect that any particular 
consideration is given to nominations from Washington. With 
Washington, in its character as the seat of Gov , the Bank 
has no concern. It has in fact nothing to do with the Gov, 
except that in administering the national finances, it will give 
its aid cordially and sincerely to every administration. But 
with no administration will it have any political connexion. 
Nor would the influence of the President and all the Departments put together be sufficient to appoint a single Director 
who was not considered qualified for his trust. This independence forms the point of honor with the Bank. You must 
not, therefore, believe for a moment, that any influence from 
any quarter could interfere with the regular course of our 
nominations or prevent our consulting you and our friends 
in <a href='/results.php?city=nashville' rel='city'>Nashville</a> on a subject of so much importance as the choice 
of those to whom the prosperity of the Bank is entrusted.

My dear Sir 
</p><p>
I received yesterday your favor of the 13th instant, &amp; 
thank you for its suggestions, which are, I am sure dictated 
by great kindness. But I cannot go to Washington at present. 
I find here a state of things which I really think I had no reason to anticipate. No man, not the noisiest partizan in the 
country has taken more pains to make the financial operations of the administration useful to the country &amp; creditable 
to themselves. And what is the return. Constant abuse of the 
Bank from the press which is the official organ of that Ad 
ministration during my absence the Secretary at War 1 
makes a most extraordinary notation of its rights and now 
I have on my table an official communication of the views 
of the Administration as to the manner in which the Bank 
ought to choose &amp; remove its Officers. For the two first I care nothing, except so far as they may indicate the disposition to condemn &amp; to encroach, but the last cannot be passed 
without notice. It is regarded generally by the Board as show 
ing a determination to injure the independence of the Bank, 
on a point where it is peculiarly sensitive as well from duty as 
from honor, &amp; accordingly they think that it should be resisted at all hazards. And so it shall be. I have sent today 
to the Secretary their unanimous views on the subject, in 
which none of the members concur more heartily than the 
friends of the Administration. 
</p><p>
I regret all this exceedingly. You know my indifference to 
Party &amp; how well disposed I was to act cordially with the 
present Administration &amp; particularly with your new Secretary. But having done my duty to them, I will not give way 
an inch in what concerns the independence of the Bank, to 
please all the Administrations past, present or future. 2 
</p><p>
The bigots of the last reproached me with nothing for them 
the bigots of the present will be annoyed that the Bank 
will not support them. Be it so, I care nothing for either class 
of partizans &amp; mean to disregard both. 
</p><p>
The <a href='/results.php?city=portsmouth' rel='city'>Portsmouth</a> affair I found after an examination of six 
days, to be a very small intrigue to supplant an honest &amp; 
excellent officer, who was of course continued in his place. 
</p><p>
Having by my official letter of to day, satisfied my sense of duty by rejecting all interference in the concerns of the 
Bank, I have no further feeling on the occasion, &amp; shall in any event take care that as far as I am concerned the relations of 
the Bank with the Treasury shall be as kindly as heretofore.

My dear Sir 
</p><p>
The mail of this morning brought me your favor of the 28th inst. the business part of which was immediately arranged. 
</p><p>
I regret, my dear Sir, this controversy as much as you can 
&amp; would gladly have shunned it, but believing that it is safer 
for the country to have no Bank than to have it subject to 
political influences, it was impossible not to resist these pre 
tensions from so many quarters to interfere in its administration. In doing this I am not conscious of having gone 
beyond the limits of a necessary self defence; and no one 
would regret more than I would, if I thought you right in 
believing that the Board had persisted in imputing to Mr Ingham a purpose which he has disavowed. But what the 
Board imputed to him &amp; what has he disavowed? He has in so 
many words, sent to the Board the views of the administration as to the mode in which they ought to choose and dismiss their officers saying that it is his "high public duty" to 
communicate it &amp; their "very high obligation" to conform 
to it. All that the Board have answered is, that he had no 
right to give advice and that if he had, the advice is bad. 
They have never imputed to him a design to acquire undue 
influence they have only said that his theory would lead 
to it. They have never imputed to him a connexion with the 
movements of other people they have only cited these 
movements in illustration of the danger of his theory. I hope most sincerely that he has no such connexion &amp; would be 
the first to render justice to him whenever an opportunity 
occurs. For really he ought not, and I am sure will not ascribe 
to us the least unkindness toward him. To show you the 
temper in which this whole matter has been conducted, I will 
mention a simple fact. The only political character in the 
Board is <a href='/results.php?tla=jse' rel='colleague'>Mr. Sergeant</a> and he was a member of the Committee 
to whom Mr. Inghams first letter was referred. But so fearful 
was I lest any political bias should interfere, that I would not 
communicate with <a href='/results.php?tla=jse' rel='colleague'>Mr. Sergeant</a> nor was he consulted until 
during my absence his professional opinion was asked about 
the removal of the Pension Office, he being the standing counsel of the Bank. Moreover of the five gentlemen composing 
that Committee, two were the political friends of Gen'l  Jackson. All our predispositions therefore were kindly, and it 
was not until the feelings &amp; the spirit of the Board were wounded, that they were compelled to vindicate the independence of the Institution. 
</p><p>
Having done this, all feeling has subsided &amp; it will remain for the Secretary himself to restore the relations of the Bank &amp; the 
Treasury to their former friendly footing. He has only to say that we have misapprehended him that he did not claim 
a right to interfere with the concerns of the Bank and had nothing to do with the movement, of these other people 
and I should immediately say, as I have no doubt the Board would say, that the explanation was very agreeable that 
we regretted any misapprehension, and any expression on the part of the Board which might be considered as applying 
to a supposed design to interfere would of course be inapplicable on the present occasion. This I think he might do with 
great propriety and I am sure that he would be met in the most friendly temper. He ought to do it, because I think he 
began this whole business. My impression is that he would have done well to say in answer to Mr Woodbury that he 
should apply to the Bank and not to the Treasury there being a peculiar awkwardness in any interference on the part 
of the Sec'y . Not having done so he has become inevitably blended with these other movements of a parcel of intriguers, 
all participation in which, he owes it to himself to disclaim. No one will be better pleased than I shall be at his doing so. 
I had intended on my return from the North to explain to the Sec'y the whole machinery of this cabal of which he was 
to have been made the unconscious instrument &amp; to put him on his guard against similar machinations in future. But the 
tone of his second letter made me abstain from any thing which might be misconstrued into an acknowledgement that 
he was entitled to any such explanations. . . .

Dear Sir 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 16th . inst. was very acceptable as it satisfied me of what I could never permit myself to doubt, 
that the views of the President were in perfect accordance with those of the Bank in regard to the exclusion of party 
feelings from its administration. The fact is that among the Directors, it is considered not simply a duty, but a point of 
honor, not to yield to party spirit and they would anxiously &amp; zealously prevent, or punish it should it occur on 
the part of any of their Officers. 
</p><p>
I cannot give you a stronger proof of that disposition than 
this letter will afford. You remark in your favor of the 16th 
inst. that complaint, had reached the President of political feelings shown in the direction of the Branch at New Or 
leans. The Cashier of that Branch is here &amp; on the point of 
sailing for <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a>. But I have instructed him to go 
immediately to Washington, to satisfy the President, which 
I think he can readily do, that the statements he has heard, 
are erroneous, and at any rate to hear precisely what the allegations are in order that on his arrival at New Orleans he may furnish the necessary refutation of them. It 
is the purpose of this letter to request that you will have 
the goodness to put Mr Jaudon in the way of attaining this object. He is a gentleman of high character and capacity 
inferior to no other Officer in the Bank &amp; with very few equals in the country for intelligence and knowledge of business. 
</p><p>
It will afford me great pleasure to see you when you visit Philad'a. &amp; in the mean time I remain

Dear Sir

. . . The best feelings are entertained toward the bank 
by those whose opinions are most valuable and most useful. 
I am very desirous of making &amp; for that purpose, am particularly solicitious to avoid giving, at the present moment, 
any occasion for the revival of a jealousy which has been recently and deeply felt, in regard to the apparent exclusion or 
omission from the Local Boards of persons favorable to the 
present administration. My stay in <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a> was too short 
to allow me to consult with you on the subject, but <a href='/results.php?tla=roc' rel='colleague friend'>Mr. Colt</a> 
mentioned the names of five gentlemen who were to be 
nominated and all of whom, it appeared, were in opposition 
to the present administration so that out of the whole 13, 
there are only two gentlemen who are in political harmony 
with the administration. You know, my dear Sir, how entirely indifferent I am to what are called politics &amp; how unwilling I am to introduce things of that kind into the affairs of the Bank. At the same time, it is proper in itself, as 
well as highly expedient, not to give unnecessary offence &amp; not to do anything which might have the appearance 
of partiality. I am afraid that this great disproportion, tho 
entirely accidental, may be the ground of objection &amp; reproach. . . .

I received this morning your favor of the 10th . inst. 
which I have read with great pleasure. The view it presents 
are quite sound &amp; correspond exactly with those entertained 
here. My impression is that these opinions expressed by the 
President are entirely &amp; exclusively his own, and that they 
should be treated as the honest tho erroneous notions of one 
who intends well. We have never had any idea of applying to 
Congress for a renewal of the Charter at the present session 
and of course should abstain from doing so now. Our

My Dear Sir 
</p><p>
I had this morning the pleasure of receiving your favor of the 14th . You may readily imagine my surprize at 
seeing the remarks in the message after all I had mentioned to you in <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a>. But it is better to try to repair it than to 
regret it and I am not sure whether it may not on the whole do good by satisfying the country of the usefulness of the 
institution &amp; spreading a very salutary dread of the monster whom it is proposed to substitute for it. The consolations on 
the present occasion are, that this is a measure emanating exclusively from the President in person, being the remains 
of old notions of constitutionality, 1 that it is not a Cabinet measure nor a party measure ; that the whole foundation of the 
reproach of the want of a sound currency is so notoriously the very reverse of the fact; and that it has produced in all quarters the most decided disapprobation. ....

My dear Sir 
</p><p>
. . . But seriously, I do not feel the least anxiety about this sortie of the President, who with, I am sure, the best 
intentions, has erred from want of information what I regret &amp; deeply regret, is the loss of individual property which 
it will occasion and the wound it will inflict on the credit of the country. When I look over the list of Stockholders &amp; see 
the number of females, of trust estates, &amp; societies charitable &amp; religious, it is melancholy to see their interest thus 
injured. This is particularly the case with South Carolina which owns, what two weeks ago was worth more than five 
millions of dollars. In regard to public credit, it is very fortunate that the Chief Magistrate of the Country should make 
an official declaration of its insolvency, should pronounce that what it pays to foreigners in dividends &amp; capital &amp; what 
it receives for revenue is an unsound paper. . . .

MEMORANDUM * 
</p><p>
Between Oct., <a href='/results.php?year=1829' rel="origin">1829</a> and Jan. <a href='/results.php?year=1830'>1830</a> 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=' rel=''>Mr Biddle</a> 
</p><p>
(<a href='/results.php?tla=anj' rel='adversary'>Gen'l Jackson</a>) I was very thankful to you for your 
plan of paying off the debt sent to Major Lewis. (N.B.) I 
thought it was my duty to submit it to you. (<a href='/results.php?tla=anj' rel='adversary'>Gen'l Jackson</a>) 
I would have no difficulty in recommending it to Congress, 
but I think it right to be perfectly frank with you I do not 
think that the power of Congress extends to charter a Bank 
out of the ten mile square. I do not dislike your Bank any 
more than all banks. But ever since I read the history of the 
South Sea bubble I have been afraid of banks. I have read 
the opinion of John Marshall 2 who I believe was a great 
&amp; pure mind and could not agree with him though if 
he had said, that as it was necessary for the purpose of the 
national gov* there ought to be a national bank I should have 
been disposed to concur; but I do not think that Congress 
has a right to create a corporation out of the 10 mile square. 
I feel very sensibly the services rendered by the Bank at 
the last payment of the national debt &amp; shall take an opportunity of declarring it publicly in my message to Congress. 
</p><p>
That it is my own feeling to the Bank and Mr Ingham's also. He &amp; you got into a difficulty thro the foolishness 
if I may use the term of Mr. Hill (N.B. writes) observing he was a little embarrassed I said (")oh that has all 
passed now.(") He (Jackson) said with the Parent Board &amp; Myself he had every reason to be perfectly satisfied 
that he had heard complaints &amp; then mentioned a case 
at <a href='/results.php?city=louisville' rel='city'>Louisville</a> of which he promised to give me the particulars. 
</p><p>
(N.B.) I said (") well I am very much gratified at this frank 
explanation. We shall all be proud of any kind mention in the 
message for we should feel like soldiers after an action com 
mended by their General. (") (<a href='/results.php?tla=anj' rel='adversary'>Gen'l Jackson</a>) Sir said he it 
would be only an act of justice to mention it.

. . . The expressions in the message were the President's own not dictated nor suggested by any body else 
&amp; inserted in opposition to the wishes, if not the advice of all his habitual counsellors. It is not therefore a cabinet 
measure, nor a party measure, but a personal measure. As such it is far less dangerous because if the people know that 
this is not an opinion which they must necessarily adopt as a portion of their party creed but an opinion of the 
President alone a very honest opinion though a very erroneous one then the question will be decided on its own merits. . . .

My dear Sir 
</p><p>
In our conversation yesterday, you expressed a wish to know the situation in which the Bank stands with regard to Mess rs . Gales &amp; Seaton of Washington. I will explain it to 
you with pleasure, as I presume the facts will remove an erroneous impression with respect to the Bank as well as those gentlemen themselves. 
</p><p>
They were formerly in succession, Directors of the Branch in Washington, their debt amounted at one time to about 
Sixty thousand dollars. In January <a href='/results.php?year=1828'>1828</a> being myself in 
Washington, I found it about Fifty thousand Dollars, which 
I thought much too high. I therefore resisted a recommendation to place one of them in the Board &amp; advised a reduction 
of the debt which has accordingly been done, so that I believe the whole responsibility of both parties does not now exceed 
between eleven &amp; twelve thousand dollars, there having been paid by a sale of their property since March last more than 
$30,000. Even of the present debt, about $<a href='/results.php?year=5000'>5000</a> was not a loan 
from the Branch but was transferred from the Bank of Columbia in the settlement of its affairs with the Branch so 
that of the sum actually lent, the amount now due is, as you perceive, very small. 
</p><p>
In Nov'r. <a href='/results.php?year=1828'>1828</a>, they applied for a loan of $15,000 from the 
Parent Bank and their application was much recommended 
by their friends on the ground of the usefulness of their paper 
and the probability of its discontinuance if the loan were not 
made. But the Board refused to make the loan. They thought 
that the only true course of the Bank was to lend its money 
</p><p>
on business principles and with adequate security that no 
distinction could be made between its friends and its enemies 
and that to go out of its way to make a loan to the editors 
of a newspaper would be to depart from its system of total 
indifference and entire abstraction, with regard to politics. In 
the present case too, the Bank might place itself in the very 
unbecoming attitude of sustaining at the seat of Government 
a paper opposed to the existing administration. 
</p><p>
You will think well of our impartiality when I mention 
that in running my eye over the Washington Pay List, to 
see the liabilities of Mess" Gales &amp; Sea ton, I remarked that 
our friend the Editor 1 of the Telegraph has between $11 and 
$12,000 an amount about the same as the Editors of the 
Intelligencer. In truth, you know, my dear Sir, how constantly &amp; strenuously the Bank has resisted every thing like 
political influence believing as we all do that the moment the 
Institution is subjected to any party, whether in power or 
out of power, it becomes a curse to the country. 
</p><p>
I have spoken to you freely about the pecuniary affairs 
of these parties circumstances, which as a member of the 
Board I wish you to know &amp; I confide them entirely to your 
judgment and discretion.

Dear Sir 
</p><p>
I have received your friendly letter of the 16th . inst for which I thank you. You ask my opinion about the fate of the 
Bank. I will tell you very frankly. I do not think this attack upon it will do any harm, &amp; I think it will rather benefit it. 
I think so for two reasons First, that the ground of the attack (its failure to produce a sound &amp; uniform currency) 
is well known by every man in the country to be unfounded, 
the currency issued by the Bank being more sound &amp; uniform than that of any country in the world at this moment. 
Second, the substitute proposed for it is one which no man 
who values the liberties of the country could agree to establish. These things will be perfectly understood before long, 
&amp; cannot fail to operate in favor of the Bank. I think therefore that the Stockholders need be under no uneasiness. The 
Bank is at this moment in a high state of prosperity, having during the last year divided 7 per cent, &amp; made all the proper 
reservations and still retaining a surplus profit out of the years work of $223,000. What other Bank has done the same?

My Dear Sir. 
</p><p>
I thank you very much for your favor of the 3d: inst. with the list of names which I must prize, because I know 
that it is dictated by friendly feelings towards the Bank. As 
soon as I receive the nomination from <a href='/results.php?city=nashville' rel='city'>Nashville</a> I shall not fail to consult you about it. 
</p><p>
Since you left us, I have thought very anxiously about a subject which I mentioned to you, I mean the present disposition of the President towards the Bank. Since his opinions 
were stated in the Message, he has had an opportunity of examing more attentively the effects &amp; operations of the 
Institution, of witnessing its utility to the finances of the Government, &amp; of knowing the views of sound &amp; practical 
men from every part of the Country. He is also, I trust, satisfied that the powers of the Bank have not been abused for 
political purposes, &amp; that towards him &amp; his administration, the Bank has acted frankly, fairly &amp; cordially. It would be 
affectation in me not to say that those who conduct the 
Bank were exceedingly hurt &amp; pained by the opinion expressed by the President, that all their efforts to restore the 
Currency had failed. Yet, in the midst of their regrets, they knew too well their duties to suffer themselves to give the 
slightest political bias to the Bank, to be driven or tempted into opposition, or to abate in the slightest degree their zeal 
for the public service. The President has few more decided personal or political friends than many of those who are 
concerned in the administration of the Bank. To them, as well as to a large body of citizens, it would be exceedingly 
gratifying to know the feelings of the President towards the Bank at the present moment, because some of his injudicious 
friends &amp; many of his opponents seek to make an impression that such is his rooted dislike to the Institution, that he would 
refuse his sanction to a Continuance of the Bank, were the Charter renewed by both Houses of Congress. The first class 
say this because they dislike the Bank the second because they dislike the President; but I hope that neither the President nor the Bank will allow themselves to misunderstand 
each other, or to be estranged from each other, by the manoeuvres or the indiscretions of their respective friends or 
enemies. Their true attitude is that of mutual Independence &amp; mutual respect, &amp; as far as I am concerned that attitude 
shall be fairly maintained. 
</p><p>
Whenever you have any thing gratifying on that subject which you can with perfect propriety communicate, 
I shall be obliged by hearing it, &amp; in the mean time, remain as always

</p><p>
Dear Sir. 
</p><p>
Since writing to you this morning it has occurred to me that you may have it in your power to do a great service to 
the Bank as well as to <a href='/results.php?tla=anj' rel='adversary'>Gen'l Jackson</a>. No man can now fail to perceive that the remarks on the Bank in the President's Message were unfortunate, &amp; have tended to make many sober 
men uneasy about the stability of our finances &amp; the soundness of our currency. As respects the Bank, it has gained 
friends by the reports in Congress &amp; by the general discussion 
of its affairs throughout the Country, so that at present I 
consider the Bank decidedly popular with the great mass of 
the Community. As a proof of it we have now before us no 
less than ten applications for branches one in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, 
one in Ohio, one in Virginia, two in South Carolina, one in 
Florida, one in Indiana, &amp; I believe that there is a decided 
majority in both houses of Congress favorable to it. 
</p><p>
Under these circumstances the opposition to the President will naturally endeavor to turn the Bank question against 
him to represent him &amp; his friends as unfriendly to sound currency. 
</p><p>
In this the Bank will give of course no assistance. It means 
to be as it has been perfectly neutral &amp; unpartial minding 
its own business &amp; not medling with other people's &amp; no 
thing shall force it or seduce it from its strict line of duty. 
But it is worthy of great consideration for <a href='/results.php?tla=anj' rel='adversary'>Gen'l Jackson</a> &amp; 
his friends whether it would not be right for them to remove 
the impression of his &amp; their hostility to the Bank. I do not 
believe that <a href='/results.php?tla=anj' rel='adversary'>Gen'l Jackson</a> or his particular friends are hostile 
to the Bank. He expressed his doubts &amp; his belief about it. I 
am sure he was wrong, but I am equally sure that he was perfectly honest, &amp; if I do not much mistake his character he will 
if he thinks he has not done justice to the Bank in the first 
instance, be ready to do it ample justice when on more reflection &amp; examination he becomes satisfied that he can do 
so. This he will have a fine opportunity of doing &amp; at the same 
time of disarming his political antagonists of what they may 
make a powerful weapon at the next meeting of Congress. 
<a href='/results.php?tla=anj' rel='adversary'>Gen'l Jackson</a> does not perhaps know (for persons in high 
stations do not always hear the whole truth) that the part 
of his Message which relates to the Bank has been a source 
of regret to many of his most attached friends &amp; to most if 
not all the political associates around him. He has now a 
fair x opportunity of converting that right into pleasure &amp; 
triumph. 
</p><p>
In his next message he will be able to state that since his last message nearly 10 millions of principal of the public 
Debt were paid off in January &amp; July. In his last message he was kind enough to speak with approbation of the agency 
of the Bank in making that payment without the least in convenience to the Country. Now, what I think his friends 
desire is that he should renew the expression of that approbation to the Bank it would perhaps be an act of justice 
and it would be an act both of justice &amp; policy to himself &amp; 
his friends by correcting an opinion that has gone abroad that he &amp; they are unfriendly to the Institution. He could say 
this without looking to the past or the future without committing himself or his friends &amp; the friends of the Bank 
would be gratified by such an evidence that his feelings were kindly towards the institution. This is a very simple &amp; 
easy thing to do &amp; yet I believe it would be very useful. Now how shall it be brought about? I have an idea that if 
any body can do it you can, &amp; if Judge Overton were disposed to aid he could be very useful. I submit the matter to 
your judgment to do what you may think right. I suggest it to you as a friend of <a href='/results.php?tla=anj' rel='adversary'>Gen'l Jackson</a> &amp; a friend of the Bank 
believing that it would be useful to both but as I have made it a law not to interfere in political matters in case 
you should think the suggestion worth acting upon, you will have the goodness to do it without reference to me.

I could not consistently adopt your suggestion. It seems that out of 9 there are 4 gentlemen friendly to the administration. 
This is accidental, but I am glad of it, for the fact shows that 
there was no principle of exclusion that the business men were taken indiscriminately from all parties &amp; the division is sufficient to prevent any political partiality on either side, which, however, I believe neither side feels nor exercises. To 
introduce new members members so well qualified as those now there for the purpose of making any political balance, 
would be wrong in itself &amp; would expose us to the very imputation we wish to avoid of looking to party considerations. 
On the whole, therefore, I thought it better to let the business considerations prevail over politics. The only regret I feel is, 
that I had it not in my power to agree to what might per haps have gratified you.

My dear Sir 
</p><p>
I have purposely delayed answering your favor of the 11th of Sept'r until I could speak with some degree of confidence as to the course which will be adopted in reference to the 
subject of it. In the mean time I have read repeatedly and with renewed interest all your remarks, proceeding as I know 
they do from one who with ample materials of information &amp; great sagacity in employing them gives the result of his 
reflections with a sincere desire to serve the institution. For this in any event you will accept my grateful thanks. 
</p><p>
After keeping the subject long under advisement in order to observe the latest development of facts, I am now satisfied, that it would be inexpedient to apply at present for the 
renewal of the charter. My belief is from all I have seen &amp; read &amp; heard, that there is at this moment a majority of both 
Houses of Congress favourable to a renewal, and moreover that the President would not reject the bill. The temptation is therefore great to take advantage of a propitious state of feelings like this. But then the Hazard is not to be disguised. 
A great mass of those who if they were obliged to vote at all would vote favourably will prefer not voting if it can be 
avoided, and the dread of responsibility, the love of postponment &amp; the vis-inertia inherent in all legislative bodies would 
combine to put off the question during the approaching 
short session. To pass both houses &amp; be rejected by the President, to be rejected in either house, to be postponed in either 
house, to be brought forward in any shape and not be finally 
and favorably acted upon are degrees of evil but the mildest of them a great evil, much to be deplored &amp; to be avoided 
if possible. My impression then is that nothing but a certainty of success should induce an application now. To this 
I am the more inclined because time is operating in favor of the Bank, by removing prejudices, and diffusing a general 
conviction of its utility. 
</p><p>
Having made up my mind on the subject, I am gratified that this, which is the first expression I have made of this 
opinion, should be communicated to one whose views have so largely influenced my own. It will always afford me great 
pleasure to receive the benefit of your further suggestions on this or any other subject, being with great respect and regard

</p><p>
My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I take the earliest opportunity which my occupations 
have permitted to consult you on the subject of attempting 
the renewal of the Charter during the present session of 
Congress. 
</p><p>
Until the arrival of the President's message my impressions 
were these. I believed that there was a decided majority of 
both houses of Congress who, if they had been obliged to vote 
at all, would have voted for the renewal. But not being 
obliged to vote, they would avoid voting. Many would say 
that the question was premature, that they ought not to forestal the judgment of their successors, that it was a short 
session in short the indifferent &amp; the timid would combine with the opponents of the Bank to postpone the question. Once brought forward &amp; postponed, it would of course 
be blended up with the elections, &amp; become one of those political matters judged exclusively by party considerations. 
</p><p>
On the other hand if it passed through both Houses, &amp; was 
negatived by the Pres e ., from that time forward it would 
become a question between the Bank &amp; him, &amp; if he were 
reflected, he would construe it as a decision by the nation 
against the Bank, &amp; act accordingly. There was also not un- 
mingled with these views the hope that as the President had 
mentioned the subject to Congress he would have left it to 
them, &amp; that time &amp; experience would have made him more 
wise &amp; less pertinacious. Such seemed the state of the case 
in November. 
</p><p>
It is certainly much altered now. 
</p><p>
The President has himself again thrust it before Congress, 
&amp; seems determined to make it an electioneering topic. By 
inviting the State Gov ts . to strengthen themselves by usurp 
ing the whole circulating medium of the country, he will 
probably excite them to instruct their delegations in Con 
gress to oppose the charter, &amp; it is to be presumed that in 
no event will he sanction a bill for the re-charter. . . . 
</p><p>
I believe it greatly for the interest of the country to settle 
this question during the present session. My doubt is whether 
it would be expedient in reference to the ultimate settlement 
of that question for the Bank to ask for a renewal. But the 
benefit of settling it may possibly be obtained without the risk 
of prejudicing the Bank in case of failure by another course 
which is this. 
</p><p>
The Committee of Ways &amp; Means 1 have now the President's Message before them. If that Comm'e. were to say that 
this is a question which must not be left in its present position, that all the great interests of the country are hazarded 
by this suspense, &amp; altho they did not intend to stir it, yet now that it has been agitated it ought to be put to rest if 
they would say this, the way would be open. If the Comm e . 
were to say to the Bank whether it would take at once the renewal &amp; on what terms, we should answer by return of mail 
in a manner no doubt satisfactory, &amp; the Comm e . might 
then report a bill of a single section continuing the Charter 
for twenty years after the expiration of its present charter on 
the payment of the stipulated bonus. In this way the recharter would present itself, not so much in the light of an application by individuals, but as a financial measure, introduced 
by the financial organ of the House. If it succeeded well. If it failed, the Bank might hereafter come forward with 
its proposal without prejudice of its having been once defeated. . . .

views of a subject which is much understood. You will receive herewith a copy of condensed analysis of <a href='/results.php?tla=alg' rel='colleague'>Mr Gallatin's</a>

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
. . . What I can do &amp; will do is this. It is obvious that 
a great effort will be made to array the influence of the Executive &amp; all his party against the Bank. It is not less evident 
that our most effectual resistance is the dissemination of useful knowledge among the people, and accordingly I am 
endeavoring to convey to all classes real &amp; positive information in regard to the working of the institution &amp; its beneficial influence on the prosperity of the nation. To do this 
newspapers must be used, not for their influence, but merely as channels of communication with the people. If you think 
the one in question a useful vehicle of information I will employ it and in this way. 
</p><p>
I have many articles about the Bank articles of interest to a general reader &amp; which would occupy no more space 
than would be necessarily given to articles on other topics, nor occasion I presume any extra expence such for in 
stance as <a href='/results.php?tla=gmd' rel='colleague'>Mr. McDuffie's</a> &amp; Smith's reports or the extracts 
from <a href='/results.php?tla=alg' rel='colleague'>Mr Gallatin's</a> article. For the insertion of these I will pay either as they appear or in advance. Thus for instance if 
you will cause the articles I have indicated and others which I may prepare to be inserted in the newspaper in question, I 
will at once pay to you one thousand dollars. If this may facilitate the arrangement you propose I shall be glad. There 
is as you perceive nothing in this communication which I should care to conceal, but as it might be misconstrued, I 
inclose your letter to me &amp; request that you will have the goodness to return what I have written to you. It will give 
me great pleasure to see you on the 15th , and in the mean time I am with sincere regard &amp; many thanks for your presenting 
the subject to me.

My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I have had the pleasure of receiving your letter of the 8th : inst. inclosing a letter from Mr. Green, expressing his 
wish to borrow from the Bank twenty thousand dollars. I will submit it to the Board at their next meeting. In the mean 
time I can only say that it will receive from them a kind &amp; respectful consideration as a matter of business, without look 
ing to the past or the future. The Bank is glad to have friends from conviction, but seeks to make none from interest. For 
myself, I love the freedom of the Press too much to complain of its occasional injustice to me, &amp; if the loan be made, it 
shall be with a perfect understanding, to be put into the Note if necessary, that the borrower is to speak his mind about the 
Bank, just as freely as he did before which I take to be "ample room &amp; verge enough."

... In the general views expressed in your letter I entirely concur. It is deeply to be regretted that the President 
has taken this course, and we must endeavor as much as possible to counteract its effect. But our weapons are truth and 
reason our appeal is from the passions to the understand 
ing, &amp; the dissemination of correct views of the nature &amp; operations of the Bank is the most efficient engine we can employ. 
Further than this we ought not to go. I should lament deeply that those connected with the Bank should be active or zealous or conspicuous in political contests. This would be wrong 
in itself: it is a violation of that perfect neutrality which is the first duty of the Bank. It would be injudicious too, even 
on calculation, since no advantage to be derived from their efforts would overbalance the general evil from their actual or supposed interference. . . .

Dear Sir 
</p><p>
... On this whole subject of publication, my theory 
is very simple. I believe that nine tenths of the errors of men 
arise from their ignorance and that the great security of 
all our institutions is in the power, the irresistible power, of 
truth. I recollect well when twenty years ago I opposed in the 
Legislature 2 of my State the measures taken to prostrate the former Bank, how much of the opposition to the Bank 
was the result of downright ignorance of its meaning and its 
operations, and I have lived to see the very individuals the 
most zealous in the work of destruction, candidly confess, as 
they have grown older and wiser, that they did not properly 
appreciate the institution. I know what was then wanting 
and I am resolved that it shall not now be wanting. I saw 
the manner in which the small demagogues of that day deceived the community and I mean to try to prevent the 
small demagogues of this day from repeating the same delusion. For this, there is but one course, the free circulation of plain honest truths by means of the press. There is 
one mode in which you can much assist me. It is by the transmission of a list, such as your long practice has enabled you 
to accumulate, of citizens with their respective addresses in various parts of the United States. Your own subscription 
list, with the additions which you propose to make for increased diffusion of your paper, would form excellent materials &amp; I would gladly defray the expence, if necessary, of 
copying that list which, for greater convenience, should be divided into States

Dear Sir 
</p><p>
. . . The President has undertaken to say of the Bank 
that which is wholly without foundation &amp; to denounce the 
institution. The whole influence of his government, &amp; of the 
presses subservient to his government, is employed in endeavoring to break down the Bank. In this situation, the Bank can only find safety in such explanations of its proceedings as will satisfy the country that it has been justly 
assailed &amp; that its operations are highly beneficial. But how 
it is to make these explanations, except thro the press, the 
only channel of communication with the people ? And if it 
employs that channel, why should it ask of printers to insert its explanations gratuitously? If a grocer wishes to ap 
prize the public that he has a fresh supply of figs, the printer 
whom he employs for that purpose never thinks of giving his 
labor for nothing, but charges him for his trouble in inserting 
the advertisement. If the Bank in a like manner wishes a 
printer to insert information about its concerns, why should 
it not pay him for his trouble? The payment for the printing 
of documents thus disseminated is not only so proper but so 
just, that one is amused by the affected squemishness of the 
other printers who do not happen to be employed when they 
denounce the Bank for circulating documents which Congress itself has ordered to be disseminated by means of extra 
copies, and what is worse than all, paying the printers for their labor. . . .

MEMORANDUM 1 BY BIDDLE 
</p><p>
<a rel="month origin" value="10">Oct'r</a> . <a rel='day origin' value='19'>19</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1831' rel="origin">1831</a>. 
</p><p>
About ten o clock today Mr. M c Lane, Sec'y of the Treas'y called to see me at the Bank. He had come to Phil'a  principally for the purpose of conversing with me after he had seen the President. 
</p><p>
He now stated that he had seen the President, and explained 
to him the course which he proposed to pursue in regard to the 
Bank. He had done this in order that there might be no mis 
apprehension on the part of the Pres. of his views &amp; the con 
sequences which might result from what he proposed to say 
in his report. 
</p><p>
He said to the President that he thought the act of Congress which directed the Secretary of the Treasury to report 
annually to Congress made it the duty of that officer to present his own views &amp; on his own responsibility and that the 
Executive stood rather in the light of a mediator between him (the Sec'y ) &amp; the Legislature. That such had always been 
the construction of the powers of the Secretaries. (This was obviously an infusion by Mr Dickins to whom I left a volume 
with all the passages marked which I thought might encourage this opinion.) He proceeded to explain to the Pres. what 
his intentions were. He means to speak of the power of the Gov to pay off the whole of the debt on the 3 d of March <a href='/results.php?year=1833'>1833</a> 
with the aid of the Bank stock; that this stock if sold out 
would occasion alarm in the country &amp; the panic would sink 
its value; whereas he was satisfied that the Bank would take 
it at a reasonable price, not less certainly than eight millions. 
This would give him an opportunity of speaking of the Bank 
in the most favorable manner, recommending the continuance 
of the charter of the present Bank in preference to a new one, 
with such modifications as without injuring the institution 
might be useful to the country &amp; acceptable to the Executive. 
This he meant to present in the strongest manner he could 
to Congress. All this he explained particularly to the President who made no objection whatever. For greater precision 
he had put down the heads of what he meant to say in his report &amp; showed them to the President. Mr Livingston by 
request of Mr. McLane was present at this meeting. 
</p><p>
It had been previously understood between Mr Livingston 
&amp; Mr McLane that the Pres. should say nothing in the 
message about the Bank. The President acquiesced tho reluctantly in this, because he thought he could not well be silent with consistentcy. But in my (N B s) conversations with 
him Mr. McLane I had expressed the opinion that his silence 
would not be so useful as his mentioning the subject. The 
matter was therefore renewed with Mess" Livingston &amp; McLane &amp; the Pres. and it was resolved that he should introduce the subject in this way that having on former occasions brought the question before the Congress it was now left with the representatives of the people. 
</p><p>
Mr McLane with a view to show the Pres. the full extent to which his report might lead, said that perhaps when his 
report was presented &amp; referred to the Comm 66 of Ways &amp; 
130 Correspondence of Nicholas Riddle 
</p><p>
Means <a href='/results.php?tla=gmd' rel='colleague'>Mr. McDuffie</a> in his present mode of thinking in regard 
to the Bank might choose to introduce a bill into Congress for 
continuing the Charter &amp; if so he (M r M c Lane) could not with 
the views which he entertained of the Bank make any opposition to it. The President said he would be sorry if the question were forced upon him in that way. 
</p><p>
I said it would be necessary to scan very accurately the Pres't J's speech so that there might not be a shade of opinion 
expressed against it, or any declaration that having once ex 
pressed his views &amp; having no reason to change them he would 
now leave it to Congress &amp;c. Mr. McLane said certainly no 
such expression could or should be introduced, as it would not 
be in harmony or consistency with his own (M r M s) report. 
</p><p>
Mr McLane said that he would be willing to charter the 
Bank without any bonus, but intimated that he thought a 
large bonus would be required, &amp; said that this should be 
considered in our proposed purchase of Bank stock. 
</p><p>
He said that he thought the greatest danger of the Bank 
was from those who wished to pull down this Bank in order 
to build up another, that a Mr West of Salem had been very 
pressing on that point. I said there were I believed some capitalists in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> &amp; <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> who were anxious about it, 
but I thought they had little political weight. He said that 
the argument was that to continue it would be a monopoly. 
</p><p>
In regard to the period of applying for a renewal, he does not wish to be considered as the adviser of the Bank because 
it might be imputed to him that he was acting in concert with the institution, but he renewed the opinion which he 
expressed at Washington that it was doubtful (indeed he seemed to be more inclined now to think it inexpedient) 
whether it would be expedient to apply this year. His idea was that if it were put to the President as a test, he would 
be more disposed to reject it on that very account. The Pres 1 
is now perfectly confident of his election the only question is the greater or the less majority, but he is sure of success &amp; wishes to succeed by a greater vote than at the first 
election. If therefore while he is so confident of reelection this question is put to him as one affecting his reelection, he 
might on that account be disposed to put his veto on it, if he be as it were dared to do it. For what I see, says Mr McLane of the character of <a href='/results.php?tla=anj' rel='adversary'>Gen'l Jackson</a>, I think he would 
be more disposed to yield when he is strong than when he is in danger. 
</p><p>
The footing then on which the matter stands is this : 
</p><p>
The President is to say that having previously brought 
the subject to Congress, he now leaves it with them. 
</p><p>
The Secretary is to recommend the renewal. 
</p><p>
This latter point pleases me much. When I saw him at 
Washington he did not think he could go so far as to originate a recomendation of the Bank, &amp; I therefore examined 
all the reports of all the Secretaries to show that the proposals for the Bank all originated with them &amp; I left the volumes of these reports in Mr Dickin's hands marked, so that he might urge them on the Secretary's attention. 
</p><p>
He thinks he can present the Tariff question strongly he 
will then press with equal strength the Bank question &amp; if he 
can arrange the question of the public lands (the surrender to 
them of the lands within their limits at a certain price so as 
to make the landholding states pay in stock to the old States 
the proportion which the latter have a right to) the Bank 
would be put in such company &amp; on such a footing that even 
Mr Benton would not attack it. 
</p><p>
On his way to Mr Carroll's with the Pres*. the latter adverted to the inconsistency of those who pulled down the old 
Bank &amp; built up the new &amp; particularly of the objection 
then made that foreigners were stockholders. This he considered an unfounded objection. (He mentioned this to me at Washington.) 
</p><p>
Some surprize was felt by the Pres of the Bank at perceiving in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury the following phrases: 
</p><p>
"It is not perceived that there is any sufficient justification in the grounds of the transaction as assumed by the 
"Bank for an arrangement in any form, by which so large 
" an amount of the public funds should be retained by the 
"Bank at the risk of the Gov't  after it had directed their 
"application to the payment of the public creditor." 
</p><p>
The reason of the surprize was this. On the 14 th of Oct'r. 
<a href='/results.php?year=1832'>1832</a>, the Chief Clerk of the Treasury Department addressed a 
letter to the Pres. . of the Bank written obviously &amp; avowedly 
at the request of the Secretary of the Treasury for the pur 
pose of enabling the Pres. of the Bank to contradict certain 
statements about the three per cents which appeared in a 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> paper of the 12th of October. The letter, tho not 
itself written for publication, was written professedly as the 
basis of a publication by the Pres. of the Bank, and authorized him to vouch certain things. Having no taste for newspaperisms, the Pres. of the Bank never answered and indeed 
never read the <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> paper, but if he had answered it, 
he would have asserted the fact vouched for by the following extract of the letter referred to, a letter written by the 
Chief Clerk of the Treas y at the request of the Secretary 
containing suggestions by the Secretary of what the Pres of the Bank ought to publish. The suggestion was in these words : 
</p><p>
"Nor has the Treasury any reason to object to the course 
"which the Bank has pursued in regard to the European 
"holders of the 3 per cents. On the contrary that measure 
"appears wise &amp; prudent, &amp; well adapted to prevent the 
"embarrassments which the sudden withdrawal of so much 
"foreign capital from the country would necessarily produce." 
</p><p>
This was on the 14th of Oct'r. <a href='/results.php?year=1832'>1832</a>. 
</p><p>
Another reason of the surprize of the Pres. of the Bank was that on the of November <a href='/results.php?year=1832'>1832</a> he was waited upon by 
</p><p>
the Chief Clerk of the Treasury who announced himself as 
coming from the Secretary of the Treasury to make enquiry 
about the Certificates of stock. The Chief Clerk stated not 
once nor casually, but frequently &amp; emphatically, what he 
had written on the 14 th of October, that the Secretary was 
perfectly satisfied with the measure itself, but only desired 
that the Certificates should appear soon in order that the 
doubts of others might be removed, &amp; he pressed the Pres. 
of the Bank to write a letter to the Secretary explaining the 
matter. In consequence of this request, the Pres. of the Bank 
wrote a letter to the Secretary on the . If it had not 
</p><p>
been clearly &amp; repeatedly stated that the Secretary was 
entirely satisfied &amp; wanted only the means of satisfying 
others undoubtedly this letter would never have been writ 
ten. The Pres*. of the Bank did not know did not wish to 
know, &amp; certainly would never have asked to know what the 
opinions of the Secretary were on the subject. The communication therefore to him that the Treasury deemed the measure wise &amp; prudent, and that the Secretary was satisfied 
with it was wholly gratuitous and in truth it might as well 
have been spared, since really it does not seem strictly proper 
to treat the Bank in this way to denounce its measures in 
public at the same time that you praise them in private. 
</p><p>
The Pres. of the Bank was also surprized at that passage 
in the report of the Secretary he states that various considerations "have suggested an enquiry into the Security of the 
Bank as the depository of the public funds." 
</p><p>
His surprize arose from two circumstances. 
</p><p>
The first was that on the 3 I st of Oct'r. <a href='/results.php?year=1832'>1832</a>, the Secretary 
addressed to him a letter requesting to know what the Bank 
would give for 3,919,666.66 francs about $700,000 being 
the first instalment of the French indemnity. In that letter 
he stated that " it would be sufficient for the Treasury to receive a credit for the amount in the Bank of the U.S. one 
month after the payment of the bill in Paris say on the 2d of 
March next," adding that " if as I presume an arrangement 
for the transfer May be best made with the Bank, I will 
thank you to state the terms." 
</p><p>
It seems strange, that the Secretary at the same time that 
he announces to Congress his fears about the solvency of the 
Bank, should ask that very Bank to take in its own hands 
$700,000 additional money of the public, not to be paid for 
until the 3 d of March next. 
</p><p>
The other reason of surprize is that the Secretary on the 
</p><p>
requested to know of the Bank what it would give 
</p><p>
for a bill on London for the 3 d instalment of the Danish indemnity amounting to about $244,000. Here then the Secretary, in the midst of his anxiety for the safety of the public 
monies in the Bank, actually proposes to place no less than a million of dollars more of that very public money in that very Bank sure never was insolvency so much flattered before.

My dear Sir

Without having come to any determination in regard 
to an application to Congress at the aproaching session for 
a recharter of the Bank, it is thought better to provide against 
such a contingency by relieving our friends in both houses 
from an embarrassment which might grow out of their connexion with the Bank. With this view in the elections of Directors for the present year, we have omitted those who are members of Congress. In writing today to Mr Greene I have suggested the same course in respect to yourself. As we have 
already claimed your services whenever we could obtain them, 
&amp; I hope we will long continue to enjoy them, it is unnecessary to say a word in regard to this omission, which under 
existing circumstances, I am sure you will perfectly understand, and I trust appreciate. Hoping soon to see you on 
your passage southward, I remain with great respect and regard.

. . . Mr. c Lanes report is all that his friends could

fitter for a President's message than the President's message 
itself &amp; I wish with all my heart that the writer of it was

the Bank, with the commentary of the Globe, the <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>

Your favor announcing your arrival &amp; your second giving the result of your first interview are received. I have 
not had yet an opportunity of apprizing our friends S. &amp; C. 1 
of the state of things but shall do so this afternoon. The views

I inclose a paper of which I have no other copy which therefore you will have the goodness to send back when you 
have no further occasion for it, or to bring it if you come soon. It is an extract from the minutes of the old Bank of the U.S. 
by which you will perceive that as early as the 6th of Jan y <a href='/results.php?year=1807'>1807</a> 
four years before the expiration of the charter, and when it had nearly as long to run as ours has, the stockholders met 
&amp; prepared a memorial which was not however presented until 
the following session of Congress say <a href='/results.php?year=1808'>1808</a> (as this is the 
substance of the extract it is not worth while to send it)* 
</p><p>
* Whence may be argued that if they began so early, we 
involved or provoked as we have been, cannot be reproached 
with a premature movement. I am particularly anxious to

My dear General, 
</p><p>
The mail which should have arrived this morning did 
not reach us till night, so that I have just received your favor of the 22 d inst which is very interesting. On this whole matter 
I have heard much &amp; thought more since you left us. I of course abstain from forming any definite opinion, but I will mention to you exactly my present state of mind. It is this. 
If <a href='/results.php?tla=gmd' rel='colleague'>Mr. McDuffie</a> could insure a reference to the Committee of Ways &amp; Means, &amp; a favorable report of that Committee, I 
would not hesitate to try it, if I could rely on a majority of one only in each house. Once fairly launched by the Com ee 
</p><p>
1 think we could succeed by a larger vote but this you 
know better than I do. I have not said this to anybody except 
yourself but all my reflections tend that way. With your

</p><p>
My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
You will hear, I am afraid with regret, tho not with surprize, that we have determined on applying to the present 
Congress for a renewal of the Charter of the Bank &amp; that a memorial for that purpose will be forwarded tomorrow or the 
next day. To this course I have made up my mind after great reflection &amp; with the clearest convictions of its propriety. The 
reasons I will briefly explain. I. The Stockholders have devolved upon the Directors the discretion of choosing the time 
of making the application. If we should omit a favorable opportunity we would commit an irreparable error, &amp; would be 
permanently reproached with it by the Stockholders. Now these Stockholders are entirely unanimous in their opinions 
and in a case of such grave responsibility their wishes are entitled to great consideration. Unless therefore there should 
be some very strong reason against it, the application should be made. 2. Independent however of this, I believe That this 
is the proper time. The Charter will expire in March <a href='/results.php?year=1836'>1836</a> 
Unless the present Congress acts upon it, we must wait till 
the Congress of December <a href='/results.php?year=1833'>1833</a>, &amp; could not expect from 
them any decision before after March <a href='/results.php?year=1834'>1834</a> which would bring 
the Bank within two years or 18 months of the expiration of its charter. Now whether the institution is to be continued 
or destroyed that time is too short. Until the question is settled every thing will be uncertain. No man can look ahead 
in either public or private affairs as to the state of the currency &amp; there will be constant anxiety about our whole monied 
system. The Bank too ought to know its fate so as to close its affairs without inflicting deep &amp; dangerous wounds upon 
the community by sudden shocks &amp; changes. I believe therefore that this is the best time for settling the question. If the 
Bank is to be continued the country ought to know it soon. If the Bank is to be destroyed the Bank &amp; the country ought both to know it soon. 
</p><p>
The only objection I have heard to it, is, as far as I understand, this : that in about a year hence there is to be an election for a President of the U.S. and if the application is 
now made, the gentleman who is now President will take it amiss &amp; negative the bill while if the Bank will refrain from 
applying until after his election is secured, he will probably 
be permitted to abstain from negativing it. This seems to embrace the whole case Let us look at it. In the first place 
then, neither I nor any of my associates have any thing what ever to do with the President or his election. I know nothing 
about it &amp; care nothing about it. The Bank has never had any concern in elections it will not have any now. To abstain 
from anything which it would otherwise do, on account of an election, is just as bad as doing anything on account of an 
election. Both are equal violations of its neutrality. There are 
many politicians who want to bring it on because it would benefit their side. There are many other politicians who 
want to put it off because that would benefit their side. Hitherto they have been urged to bring it before the last 
Congress in hopes that it would injure the present incumbent now they are urged to postpone it because postponement 
would benefit him. The Bank cares not whether he is benefited or injured. It takes its own time &amp; its own way. 
</p><p>
In the next place what appears to me I confess wholly in 
explicable is why the friends of the present incumbent who 
are also friends of the Bank, if they think the Bank question 
likely to injure the President, do not at once take the question 
out of the hands of their adversaries. If the President's 
friends were to come forward &amp; settle the Bank question 
before the election comes on, they would disarm their antagonists of their most powerful weapon. I am very ignorant of party tactics, &amp; am probably too much biased to be a fit 
judge in this case, but such a course has always seemed to me so obvious that I have never been able to comprehend why it was not adopted. 
</p><p>
But again what is the reason for supposing that the present 
incumbent will be offended by bringing it forward now? What 
possible right has he to be offended ? What too has he meant 
by all these annual messages declaring in <a href='/results.php?year=1829'>1829</a> that he 
could not "too soon present it" to Congress repeating the 
same thing in <a href='/results.php?year=1830'>1830</a> and reiterating it in <a href='/results.php?year=1831'>1831</a>. Was this all 
a mere pretence? that the moment the Bank accepts his own 
invitation he is to be offended by being taken at his word. 
</p><p>
But moreover he is to negative the bill. That is to say, he 
will agree to the bill hereafter, but because he thinks it will 
interfere with his election he will negative it now. Truly this 
is a compliment which I trust he does not deserve from his 
friends, for even I who do not feel the slightest interest in him 
would be sorry to ascribe to a President of the United States 
a course much fitter for a humble demagogue than the Chief 
Magistrate of a great country. He will sign a bill, which of 
course he must think a good one, when his election is over 
but he will not sign this bill, which he thinks a good one, if 
it is likely to take votes from him at an election. And after all, 
what security is there that when his election is over, he will 
not negative the bill ? I see none. On the contrary I am satisfied 
that he would be ten times more disposed to negative it then 
than now. Now he has at least some check in public opinion 
some in the counsels of those around him then he will 
have neither. And now, my dear Sir, I have tired myself as 
I have certainly you with these opinions which you think very 
erroneous &amp; very disrespectful perhaps to the President. But I wanted to explain precisely the course of thinking which has 
brought me to my present conclusion. The only regret which 
accompanies it is that it has not the concurrence of Mr M c Lane &amp; yourself to whom the Bank as well as myself personally owe much for the manner in which you have both 
sustained the institution. I cannot express to you how much 
I am concerned at not being able to adopt the suggestions of Mr McLane who has behaved so handsomely in this matter. 
But we must each in our respective spheres of duty follow our own convictions with mutual regret but still with mutual respect. 
</p><p>
To you I always looked forward as a friend &amp; advocate of 
the Bank whenever the question of its renewal was agitated. 
I shall be very sorry on many accounts that from a difference 
of opinion in regard to time you will be constrained to with 
hold your aid but I assure you it will abate none of the 
regard for you &amp; the fullness of these explanations will I 
hope satisfy you of my anxiety to State to you frankly &amp; 
distinctly the motives which lead me to a conclusion, differing 
I believe for the first time from Your's on the Subject of 
the Bank.

The Bank having after great consideration presented 
a memorial for the renewal of the charter, the citizens of Philad are forwarding petitions on the subject of a similar 
measure [which] will be transmitted by the State Banks. It 
would be greatly desirable to have the same thing done else

</p><p>
My dear sir 
</p><p>
In regard to the bonus for a renewal of the Charter my views are these 
</p><p>
As the bonus is in fact only another name for a tax, and like all other taxes disables the Bank to the extent of it from 
giving facilities to the community, a Bonus should not be 
pressed by Gov 4 beyond a very moderate limit, particularly 
as the Gov* is now very rich instead of being needy as it was 
at the time of granting the Charter. 
</p><p>
But if the Bank must pay, I do not think it ought to pay 
more than the sum of $1,500,000: nevertheless it would not 
be proper to decline the charter because more was asked &amp; I 
should be disposed to go as high as two millions or if necessary three; between this last limit &amp; the original sum of a 
million &amp; a half lies the debateable ground. I think you might 
at once agree to any sum not exceeding three millions. If 
more were required or more were insisted upon during the 
passage of the Bill through the House it would be a subject 
of further reference to the Board. To the extent I have mentioned, I am sure there would be no difficulty.

My dear Sir

It strikes me that the resolutions of our legislature will 
place Mr. Dallas in an attitude equally new, and imposing ; 
offering an opportunity of distinction, which a young states 
man could scarcely hope for in his dreams, &amp; which the oldest 
statesman might pass a whole life without encountering. It 
seems to me, his position is precisely this He wishes to 
be the Pennsylvania candidate for the Vice Presidency and then 
</p><p>
"Glamis and thane of Cawdor 
"the greatest is believed." 
</p><p>
The Pennsylvanians are disposed to assist him and to exclude 
Mr. V Buren. To promote this Mr. Dallas should identify 
himself with all the Pennsylvania interests, more especially 
those interests to which <a href='/results.php?tla=mvb' rel='adversary'>Mr. Van Buren</a> is supposed to be 
hostile. He should therefore go immediately to the President 
with these resolutions of Penn. 1 in his hand he should 
warn him against irritating our State, especially as the of 
fence to her is wholly gratuitous. He should say to him you 
are not opposed to this bank essentially; you mean to agree 
to it with certain modifications. Now let me mediate between 
you and the Bank; let us agree on the modifications; the Bank 
will consent to them, and I will report them, the rechartering 
of the Bank will thus become a measure of yours you will 
gratify Penn a . you will take from your adversaries their 
most formidable weapon, and secure the ascendancy of your 
friends. If the President will do this his success is certain, if Mr. Dajlas will do this, besides sustaining his father's work 
&amp; conferring a great blessing on the Country, he will assure/ 
to himself distinguished consideration through the nation. 
</p><p>
I do not know how he is disposed for such an enterprize, but he ought to give ten years of his life for this chance of attaining it. Tell him so, and if in half an hour afterwards he is not 
on his way to the Presidents, why then the stars have conjoined for him in vain.

... I cannot doubt, whatever may be the result, that we have done well in applying at the present session. When 
we were first warned against it lest it should affect the interests of one of the candidates for the Presidency, such a course 
seemed so entirely foreign to the duties of the Bank that we could not acquiesce in it for a moment. At a later period 
when we were counselled to abandon it, lest the influence of that candidate should crush the institution; that course 
seemed equally inadmissable, and we determined, that having begun, we would go through at all hazards; and that 
it was better even to be defeated in a fair field than to retreat. Into that field you have now probably led us; and on 
you much of the fate of the institution will depend. I have 
often heard the contemporaries of <a href='/results.php?tla=jcc' rel='colleague'>Mr Calhoun</a>, in the Congress of <a href='/results.php?year=1816'>1816</a>, speak with admiration of the talent, and tact,

the union of the same qualities will enable you to be equally successful now. . . .

My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
. . . Here am I, who have taken a fancy to this Bank &amp; having built it up with infinite care am striving to keep it I 
from being destroyed to the infinite wrong as I most sincerely &amp; conscientiously believe of the whole country. To me all other considerations are insignificant I mean to stand by 
it &amp; defend it with all the small faculties which <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> 
has assigned to me. I care for no party in politics or religion 
have no sympathy with <a href='/results.php?tla=anj' rel='adversary'>Mr Jackson</a> or <a href='/results.php?tla=hec' rel='colleague'>Mr Clay</a> or <a href='/results.php?tla=wiw' rel='colleague'>Mr Wirt</a> or <a href='/results.php?tla=jcc' rel='colleague'>Mr Calhoun</a> or Mr Ellmaker or <a href='/results.php?tla=mvb' rel='adversary'>Mr Van Buren</a>. 
I am for the Bank &amp; the Bank alone. Well then, here comes <a href='/results.php?tla=anj' rel='adversary'>Mr Jackson</a> who takes it into his head to declare that the Bank 
had failed &amp; that it ought to be superceded by some ricketty machinery of his own contrivance. <a href='/results.php?tla=anj' rel='adversary'>Mr Jackson</a> being the 
President of the U.S. whose situation might make his ignorance mischeivous, we set to work to disenchant the country of their foolery &amp; we have so well succeeded that I will venture to say that there is no man, no woman, &amp; no child in U.S. who does not understand that the worthy President was in a great error. . .
</p><p>
It remains to see how its evil consequences may be averted. 
It seems to me there is no one course by which his friends may 
extricate him not merely safely but triumphantly. He has 
made the Bank a Power. He has made the Bank a deciding 
question as to his own selection. Now let him turn this power 
to his own advantage. As yet the Bank is entirely uncommitted the Bank is neither for him nor against him. In 
this state let his friends come forward boldly, &amp; taking the 
Bank out of the hands of their enemies, conciliate back the 
honest friends whom their rashness has alienated, and who 
think that the only difficulty which he has yet to overcome 
is the dread of their internal convulsion to which the prostration of the Bank will lead. The most extraordinary part 
of the whole matter is that the President &amp; the Bank do not 
disagree in the least about the modifications he desires. He 
wishes some changes The Bank agrees to them and yet 
from some punctilio which is positively purile his rash friends 
wish him to postpone it. Do they not perceive that his enemies are most anxious to place him in opposition to the Bank ? 
And should not every motive of prudence induce him to disappoint their calculations ? The true &amp; obvious theory seems 
to me to disarm the antagonists of their strongest weapon 
to assume credit for settling this question for the administration. If the present measure fails, it carries bitterness into 
the ranks of the best part of the opposition. If it succeeds without the administration it displays their weakness. If the 
bill passes &amp; the President negatives it, I will not say that it will destroy him but I certainly think it will &amp; moreover 
I think it ought to. I can imagine no question which seems 
more exclusively for the representatives of the people than 
the manner in which they choose to keep &amp; to manage the 
money of the people. 
</p><p>
... I suppose the President has been made to believe that 
the Bank is busy in hostility to him you know how wholly 
unfounded this is. For myself I do not care a straw for him 
or his rivals I covet neither his man servant nor even 
his maid servant, his ox nor any of his asses. Long may he live 
to enjoy all possible blessings, but if he means to wage war 
upon the Bank if he pursues us till we turn &amp; stand at 
bay, why then he may perhaps awaken a spirit which has 
hitherto been checked &amp; reined in and which it is wisest--^ 
not to force into offensive defence.

My dear Sir 
</p><p>
. . . Here is the Bank which most assuredly has been 
in its proper sphere, perfectly true, and faithful, to the ad 
ministration; and which has never suffered itself, even while 
it believed itself very unkindly treated, to be betrayed into 
the slightest departure from its duty to the Govt. All the 
members of the Govt. can bear witness to this. The President 
himself has no hostile feeling towards the Bank, he is dis 
posed to agree to its renewal with certain modifications, and 
the Bank is disposed to accept these modifications. And yet 
with no real difference between them, they are now playing 
into the hands of his enemies, who desire nothing better than to see us at variance. This certainly cannot be right. Is it not 
wiser for the Presidents friends to disarm at once his antagonists, of their strongest weapon, to settle the question at 
once; and thus unite all the Presi friends before the next election? This seems so clear, and obvious, that I am astonished that his friends do not immediately take the matter into their own hands, and settle it their own way. 
</p><p>
Now what should prevent this reconciliation ? If the President is restrained from making any advances, I have no such 
&gt;feeling, &amp; I will make them myself. You know that I care nothing about the election. I care only for the interests confided to my care, and so far from having the least ill will 
toward the President, so far from wishing to embarrass his administration, I will do every thing consistent with my 
duty, to relieve it from trouble, and will go nine tenths of the way to meet him in conciliation. This is very easy. The whole can be settled in five minutes. 
</p><p>
For instance, the President wishes some modifications in the charter. Well, let him take the charter and make any 
changes he likes, let him write the whole charter with his 
own hands, I am sure that we would agree to his modifications; and then let him and his friends pass it. It will 
then be his work. He will then disarm his adversaries, he 
will gratify his friends, and remove one of the most uncomfortable and vexatious public questions that can be stirred. 
</p><p>
Now why could not this be? The moment is propitious and if done soon it will be done triumphantly. Do think of all 
these things, &amp; if as a friend of the President, as well as of the Bank, you can accomplish this work of peaceful mediation, 
you will relieve both parties from an apparent misunderstanding, you will confer a real benefit upon the country &amp; 
especially gratify,
 
Yours with great regard

My dear Sir 
</p><p>
I yesterday wrote a hasty letter explaining my views in regard to the modifications suggested of the Charter of the 
Bank. In addition to what was then said of the disposition of the Bank, to acquiesce in any modification which may 
protect the rights of the States from any encroachment by the Bank I will now add that if the President wishes to 
stipulate that no new Branch shall be established without demeanour and vivacity of speech, added to great powers of work, and acuteness 
in detecting the foibles of others, made him a formidable opponent. Further, his 
marriage with the sister of Bischoffswerder, until lately the King's favourite adviser, added to his influence, which, as was natural with a foreigner, inclined 
toward the attractive and gainful course. Long afterwards the saviour of Prussia, 
Baron von Stein, classed him among the narrow, selfish, insincere men who had 
been the ruin of nations." Cf. Rose, J. H., William Pitt and the Great War (Lon 
don, <a href='/results.php?year=1912'>1912</a>), p. 203; also cf. Seeley, Stein, vol. I, p. 65.

From Charles Jared Ingersoll 1 8 7 
</p><p>
the assent of the State in which it is proposed to locate it, 
I think there would be no objection to it on the part of the 
Bank 
</p><p>
In truth I believe there is no change desired by the Presi 
dent which would not be immediately assented to by the 
Bank. And this it is which gives me so much regret, to find 
the President &amp; the Bank apparently estranged while there 
is really no difference between them, and to see the Presidents 
friends lose the present opportunity of settling the question 
so well, &amp; so advantageously for him.

... On the subject of printing &amp; printers I have no difficulty &amp; no reserve as you may have seen in the course 
of the enquiry. The press is the channel of communication 
between the Bank &amp; the Country, and I have no more difficulty about remunerating privately for the work done on 
account of the Bank, than I would for paying the passage of the clerks of the Bank, in a steam boat or a stage when they 
were travelling on the business of the Bank. Why should we? If the grocer at the corner wishes to apprize the Community that he has some fresh figs, he is obliged to pay the Editor 
of the Newspaper by the inch, it would not be fair therefore to let the Editor do work in every respect similar for the 
Bank, without any remuneration, while he has to pay for paper &amp; types &amp; printing. I will thank you therefore to ask 
Mr Gales to print six thousand extra copies of his paper containing <a href='/results.php?tla=jqa' rel=''>Mr Adams</a> &amp; your report together, and send them to proper persons in proper places. . . .

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
On my arrival I began with a full and frank conversation with Mr. McLane on the subject of the Bank and at 
his suggestion saw Mr. Livingston after which they conferred and I saw Mr. Livingston. 
</p><p>
The general purport of my communication was this. The investigation has given a new aspect to our affairs it disarms, or ought to disarm some of the hostility hitherto entertained toward it, and furnishes a new motive for pressing a 
decision. Under these circumstances it would be very agreeable if the Executive would concur in promoting the object 
which we would gladly attain by accepting such modifications as would be agreeable to the administration. I stated 
moreover the extreme awkwardness of having such a measure before Congress while the Department to which it belonged 
had no cognizance of it and my anxiety to cooperate with the Executive in modifying and perfecting the measure. I need 
not detail peculiarity of their situation which makes them passive and all that I could learn from Mr. Livingston was 
that the awkwardness was irretrievable and that it only remained to make the bill as unexceptionable as possible. 
</p><p>
We have then parted good friends.

My dear General, 
</p><p>
For the last week I have been expecting daily to return home, &amp; was willing therefore to spare you &amp; myself the 
trouble of corresponding, when we could so much more readily converse about the matter. It has been a week of hard 
work anxiety &amp; alternating hopes &amp; fears, but I think that we may now rely with confidence in a favorable result. You 
know how many difficulties are to be overcome how many 
hostilities are to be encountered; how many friendly indiscretions and weaknesses are to be repaired, in a work like this. 
I think moreover that it has reached a point where we may promise ourselves some rest. The Senate are now occupied 
with what I consider the most decisive point of the whole question and being obliged to leave the capitol to prepare 
for some company to dine with me, I write these views as preliminary to the news which the Senators who are to be my 
guests may bring with them. They have come. This day like yesterday has been consumed in rejecting a very distract 
ing &amp; dangerous proposal to exchange a bonus for the obligation to discount at five per cent. I have been at work all 
day to get rid of it and we have succeeded by a vote of 26 to 1 8 in excluding it. Tomorrow we shall have something decisive.

My dear Sir 
</p><p>
I had this morning the pleasure of receiving your favor of the 12th inst. &amp; thank you for the suggestions it 
contains, which are I am sure dictated by the most friendly disposition to the Bank. The subject, as you may readily 
suppose, has occupied much of my thoughts, so that I am able to speak of it at once but after very deliberate reflection. 
</p><p>
I am very sensible of the value to the Bank of the result contemplated &amp; fully aware of the importance of what you 
mention in accomplishing that result. But the agency of the 
Bank in contributing to it is a matter of very grave consideration. When the Bank was denounced by the President, &amp; all 
the influences of his patronage arrayed against it, it was an 
obvious duty not to suffer the institution to be crushed by 
the weight of power but to appeal directly to the country 
and as the whole channel through which the understandings of the community could be reached was the press, we 
strove to disseminate widely correct information in regard 
to the Bank. That object is accomplished. The Bank is fairly 
before the country and large majorities of both houses of 
Congress have decided in its favor. One individual has how 
ever opposed his will to the deliberate reflections of the representatives of the people and the question now is whether 
the Bank ought to exert itself to defeat the reelection of that 
person who is now the only obstacle to its success. On that 
question I have made up my mind that to interfere in the 
election would be a departure from the duty which the 
Bank owes to the country. The first law of its existence is en-\ 
tire and unqualified abstinence from all political connexions j 
&amp; exertions. This it has hitherto practised, and whatever^ 
may be the consequences, must continue to practise. The 
temptations to a contrary course are I feel very great, but I believe it to be the duty of the Bank to resist them. If I 
could permit myself to do otherwise, it would have an additional satisfaction in the prospect of serving one who has 
I think been very hardly and unjustly treated by his political associates. 
</p><p>
You will easily believe that I think our differences of opinion on this subject arise merely from our looking at the 
object from different points of view, for I think in my situation You would probably entertain the same sentiments. I 
shall always be glad to hear from you whenever you have leisure, &amp; remain.

My dear Sir 
</p><p>
You ask what is the effect of the Veto. My impression 
is that it is working as well as the friends of the Bank and of 
the country could desire. I have always deplored making the 
Bank a party question, but since the President will have it 
so, he must pay the penalty of his own rashness. As to the 
Veto message I am delighted with it. It has all the fury of 
a chained panther biting the bars of his cage. It is really a 
manifesto of anarchy such as Marat or Robespierre might 
have issued to the mob of the faubourg St Antoine: and my 
hope is that it will contribute to relieve the country from 
the dominion of these miserable people. You are destined to 
be the instrument of that deliverance, and at no period of 
your life has the country ever had a deeper stake in you. I 
wish you success most cordially, because I believe the institutions of the Union are involved in it.

I send by this mail <a href='/results.php?tla=web' rel='colleague'>Mr. Webster</a>s speech on the Veto Message, and also another article reviewing that message. It

act the injurious impressions which the message was destined

these I have mentioned too long or elaborate for general reading, you can substitute any other matter which may have the same object. All that I wish to caution you against is, that abstaining as the Bank does from all connexion with 
what are called party politics, you will confine your efforts exclusively to the distribution of what may be explanatory 
of the operations and conduct of the Bank. Confined to that 
object exclusively, you may cause to be printed and circulated any amount of such papers as you may consider necessary for the vindication of the Bank and give me an account 
of the expense, which you will of course endeavor to make as reasonable as may consist with the object in view.

. . . The Bank does not mean to commence any systematic reduction of its loans with a view to winding up its 
affairs. It does not mean to begin to close its concerns. It means to go on in its general business just as if no such event 
as the President's negative had ever happened. The only alteration it proposes is rather in the form than in the amount 
of its loans an alteration which under any circumstances, it would be disposed to recommend and it is this to give 
gently and gradually the loans of the Bank the direction of domestic bills, converting where it can be done the line of 
notes discounted, into domestic bills of exchange, which being payable at maturity, will give the Institution a greater command over its funds. . . .

I have received your favor of the 7th inst. I have no information of the intended removal of the deposits, though

I wrote to you to day that Mr L. would be in New

well to see him. The whole question of peace or war lies in 
the matter of the deposits. If they are withdrawn, it is a decla

before any irrevocable step is taken.

My D'r Sir, 
</p><p>
The contents of this letter you will comprehend, when you connect with it a late conversation held by yourself with 
a mutual acquaintance of ours, and to whom an unexpected 
opportunity has been offer d of gaining the following information, on which you may rely as of the highest, &amp; most direct authority. 
</p><p>
You need not be informed of the hostility of the Administration to the Institution over which you preside, but the 
following items must prove interesting. At this moment the opinion of the different members as to the immediate 
withdrawal of the Government Deposites is asked, and their individual opinion stands thus. In the first place the 
President considers that he has conquered all of his difficulties but that of the Bank, &amp; this he is determined to 
accomplish "coute qui coute." Were it left to Kendall &amp; himself they would withdraw the Deposites immediately, 
but believing as they do, that the Bank has 40 or 50 millions discount in the Western Country, which it will be compelled to curtail, whether or no, they prefer the odium to rest 
on its Head, instead of that of the Government. Mr. McLane 
considers that the Government would be prostrated by their 
taking this step, and therefore is adverse to the withdrawal 
at present. The Post Master Gen'l , objects to the step at this 
moment also, but considers the convenience of making his 
Deposits in State Banks so important, that he contemplates 
asking permission (which he thinks will not be refused him) 
of making his separate deposits in them, more especially 
as you will not permit him to overdraw, without a confidential letter from him to that effect. Taney is for immediate withdrawal. And the influence of such men as Com 6 Stewart, 
Whitney, &amp;c, is exerted to effect this object, which will produce the natural consequence of lowering the market value 
of the Stock. The present disposition of the influential party 
is to withdraw the deposits in October next. But the wily 
Magician is for throwing the responsibility on Congress, believing that they will have a sufficient majority to Carry 
their measure. His hostility to the Bank is implacable; and 
the various offers made to them by different State Banks tally's much better with their ulterior views than the security offered by the present mode of Deposit. In a few words, 
if it be not determined on to withdraw the Deposits in 
October, the firm belief is, that the President, instead of 
recommending this measure in his next annual Message, will 
simply state in it some definite period when he is determined 
they shall be withdrawn. 
</p><p>
I give you the above information at the request of Mr. Oliver, and should any thing further be communicated which 
we may deem important, you shall be made acquainted with it. 
</p><p>
I need not point out the source of this information but will merely add, that you may rely on the its correctness.

My dear Sir

... The fact is that the real sin of the Bank in the 
eyes of the Executive is, that it is refractory &amp; unmanageable. When these people first came into power on a current of 
overwhelming popularity, to which they thought every thing 
should yield, they considered the Bank a part of the spoil, 
and one of their first efforts was to possess themselves of the 
institution for the benefit of their partizans. We saw all that 
would follow from the slightest concession and deter 
mined, since there must be War, to begin it in the frontiers 
by letting them know that they were to have nothing to 
do with the Bank. From that time they resolved, that as\ 
they could not bend it they would break it. This is the whole \ 
secret of the opposition to the institution. I know this so well ) 
that I feel myself a much more profound Jurist than all the \ 
lawyers and all the statesmen of Virginia put together, for in / 
half an hour, I can remove all the constitutional scruples in the 
District of Columbia. Half a dozen Presidencies a dozen 
Cashierships fifty Clerkships a hundred Directorships 
to worthy friends who have no character and no money. 
Why, there is more matter for deep reflection in such a sentence than in any twenty of Tacitus or Montesquieu. It 
would outweigh the best argument of your Madisons &amp; Randolphs &amp; Watkins Leigh s. But that sentence, short and easy 
as it seems, shall never be written or said: and so we must go on to the end of the chapter, and the charter. . . .

Dear Sir 
</p><p>
... I have observed with great interest what you have 
written on the subject of the Bank. The truth is, that the 
question is no longer between this Bank &amp; no Bank. It is a 
mere contest between <a href='/results.php?tla=mvb' rel='adversary'>Mr. Van Buren's</a> Government Bank 
and the present institution between Chestnut St and 
Wall St between a Faro Bank and a National Bank. 
You do not perhaps know that soon after these people came 
into power, there was a deliberation in Caucus of the most 
active of the Jackson Party as to the means of sustaining 
themselves in place and the possession of the Bank was 
ranked as a primary object. For this purpose they began in 
<a href='/results.php?year=1829'>1829</a> with an effort to remove an obnoxious President of one 
of the Branches which was to be followed by a systematic 
substitution of their creatures throughout the whole insti 
tution. This experiment failed, owing to the firmness of thev 
Directors who determined that they would not permit the \ 
interference of the Executive Officers. . . . From that moment 
they despared of turning the Bank to their political purposes, 
and have been intent on breaking it down to substitute some 
machinery more flexible. To that spirit, a new impulse has 
been given by a coterie of gamblers who having ascertained the views of the Executive before the last session of Congress 
and believing that they must be fatal to the Bank, made large 
contracts on time. These executive denunciations not hav 
ing sufficiently lowered the stock to render the speculations 
safe or profitable, the parties are now endeavoring to force 
the Executive into the withdrawal of the public deposits, as 
a measure that would cover their retreat. This combination 
of political gamblers and gambling politicians is the key to 
the whole history of the relations between the Bank &amp; the 
executive. Against that coalition, all honest men should exert 
themselves. I am extremely gratified therefore at the opening 
of that battery of yours, and shall be very glad to supply you 
with all the ammunition in my power. . . .

I have had the pleasure of receiving your favor of the 7th inst. and am rejoiced to hear that your avowed purpose 
of acting next winter in the legislature has brought out an expression of corresponding sentiments in other quarters. 
</p><p>
What should be deeply impressed on the minds of the Southern gentleman is, I think, this that the administration people mean to unite in an outcry against any Bank, &amp; 
having thus secured the cooperation of the constitutionalists in the destruction of the present Bank, they will then build 
up one of their own, leaving the Constitutionalists to be laughed at, after having been duped. The question is no 
longer open. It is a question between Chestnut St and Wall St. a question whether the Central Gov't is to have the 
command of the revenues a question between a Treasury Bank or an independent Bank.

Dear Sir

. . . There is at this moment a strange scene before 
our eyes here. Mr. Duane, after much solicitation and with an 
unaffected hesitation accepted the place of Secretary but 
he took it entirely untrammelled &amp; unpledged. He had been a 
little time in Office when he was required to concurr in the schemes of Jackson and the Kitchen Cabinet against the 
Bank by withdrawing the deposits. This he refused. A mission has accordingly been set on foot to make arrangements 
with the State Banks to do the duties now performed by the Bank of the U.S. so as to deprive Mr. Duane of the objection 
that the change would incommode the public business. Of this mission Amos Kendall is the plenipotentiary, and he is 
expected here to-day. If he succeeds the attack will be resumed on Mr. Duane. But that gentleman will I am satisfied 
refuse, as he has already done. He will take a decided, firm, manly stand, and will leave his place rather than prostitute 
it. This will introduce a new state of things. The Kitchen 
Cabinet is already against Mr. Duane &amp; will endeavor to expel him but if he is only firm as I rely on his being, he may 
I do much to break up this nest of gamblers. The result will be soon known. In the mean time I think we may be sure that 
Mr. Duane will be in flagrant opposition to the Kitchen Cabinet, that he has already refused, and will continue to refuse to yield to them. . . .

Altho we do not feel anxious as to the result of the movements at Washington touching the Bank, still it is 
thought prudent to prepare for any adverse event and accordingly we have this day given instructions to the Branches 
to keep their discounts at their present amount and to shorten the time for which they buy bills of exchange. This 
will make the institution strong &amp; if any sudden movement is attempted by the Cabinet, proper or improper, we shall 
be ready. This will, I trust be temporary, as the squall may blow over.

. . . This I know is their design. This very day, a gentleman in whom I have the utmost confidence, repeated to 
me a conversation which a friend of his had with Mr. Woodbury. In the course of it, the latter said, "We are not against 
a bank, but against the Bank" "We went (this was his precise expression) to scrabble for the Stock and to have the 
Offices." "But," said the other, "what will you do with the constitutional question?" "Poh," said Woodbury, "that we 
can use to "suit ourselves." And this is what they all intend. I do not believe that a single member of the Cabinet 
has any constitutional doubts about the matter except Mr. Duane and he, I incline to think, is almost, if not quite as 
firm, in his dislike to State Banks. He is entirely and cordially against the movement of Kendall &amp; I cannot doubt he will 
resist the gamblers. . . .

My dear Sir

I have received this morning your letter of the 3Oth ulto. and have since had a long interview with Mr Rathbone 
to whom I explained our whole situation and views and to whom I must refer you for more particulars than I have leisure to give. 
</p><p>
After a great deal of reflection, we are all satisfied that the best thing to be done is to do as little as possible. 1 The ex 
change operations are placed by the resolutions passed to day on a proper footing. We do not give any instructions as 
to reducing the local discounts, but we shall reduce ours at the Bank, and if you can gradually diminish yours without ex 
citing uneasiness among our customers it would be very good policy. Our wish is not to give an order to that effect lest it 
might create alarm, but to do it quietly and imperceptibly. 
</p><p>
The subject which has given us more anxiety than any other is the treatment of the Branch notes. We are now satisfied 
that our best plan is to continue to receive them as heretofore and that your Office should do the same. The idea we 
have is this. The balances now in Bank will probably be absorbed by the disbursements of the Government and in the 
mean time the accruing revenue will be left with the new receiving Banks. There it may accumulate, and masses of it 
may be held sufficient to incommode some of the smaller Branches, to whom it may be suddenly sent. It is better for 
us therefore to absorb it if we can until the measures in operation at the Branches will reduce their issues so much 
as to make them not trouble us.

The closing of the mail so soon obliges me to stop.

Dear Sir 
</p><p>
. . . My own view of the whole matter is simply this. 
The projectives of this last assault on the Bank regret, and 
are alarmed at it but the ties of party allegiance can only 
be broken by the actual conviction of existing distress in the 
community. Nothing but the evidence of suffering abroad 
will produce any effect in Congress. If the Bank remains 
strong &amp; quiet, the course of events will save the Bank &amp; 
save all the institutions of the country which are now in great 
peril. But if, from too great a sensitiveness from the fear 
of offending or the desire of conciliating, the Bank permits 
itself to be frightened or coaxed into any relaxation of its 
present measures, the relief will itself be cited as evidence 
that the measures of the Govt. are not injurious or oppressive, and the Bank will inevitably be prostrated. Our only 
safety is in pursuing a steady course of firm restriction 
and I have no doubt that such a course will ultimately lead to restoration of the currency and the recharter of the Bank. How 
soon this will take place, it is of course difficult to conjecture 
but I have little apprehension as to the ultimate result.

I have to thank you for four letters, all very interesting &amp; very welcome. The last only requires any answer &amp; that 
I will give very explicitly. You may rely upon it that the Bank has taken its final course and that it will be neither 
frightened nor cajoled from its duty by any small drivelling gjpout relief to the country. All that you have heard on that 
subject from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> is wholly without foundation. The 
relief, to be useful or permanent, must come from Congress &amp; from Congress alone. If that body will do its duty, relief will 
come if not, the Bank feels no vocation to redress the wrongs inflicted by these miserable people. Rely upon that. 
This worthy President thinks that because he has scalped Indians and imprisoned Judges, he is to have his way with 
the Bank. He is mistaken and he may as well send at Lance and engage lodgings in Arabia . . .

I have received today your favor of the 26 th inst. 
with the copy of the Governor's Message. 2 I regret on many 
accounts that paper. It will prolong the distress now existing 
without effecting any good object, and it is melancholy to see 
a Governor of Pennsylvania thus aiding in the destruction of 
Pennsylvania interests. What makes it more shocking is, that 
up to the very moment of sending the message, those who 
visited him left him under the strongest conviction that he 
was decidedly friendly to the Bank. In truth he ought to have 
been, for so far from frustrating his loan, the Bank actually 
furnished to Mess 8 . Allen the means of paying the last instalment, as the Governor well knew. Of the effect of his message 
on the Bank and upon the financial concerns of Penns a . you will form some idea when I mention to you the following fact which is a little singular. 
</p><p>
A Committee from <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> has been visiting the Bank for the purpose of procuring some relief for that city which 
would of course have reacted on our own State. Yesterday the Board was to have decided it, &amp; I have no doubt that the Bank 
would have made an effort to give relief but when we saw the Governors message saw how totally useless the efforts 
of the Bank had been to sustain the credit of the State in appeasing the spirit of the party and how little reliance 
could be placed on the men in power, we determined that it was in vain to make an effort and accordingly, instead 
of sending the relief expected, we wrote to the <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
Committee that the conduct of the Governor of Pennsylvania obliged the Bank to look to its own safety, and that therefore 
we declined doing any thing at present. 
</p><p>
So much for the first effect of the Governors patriotism

Dear Sir 
</p><p>
. . . Your remarks in regard to the proposed reduction of the loans at <a href='/results.php?city=cincinnati' rel='city'>Cincinnati</a> have been read with great 
attention and interest. Situated as the Bank has been for some time past, its first object was necessarily its own protection, for in its safety the whole ultimate security of the 
currency must be found. This we have striven to accomplish with the least possible pressure on the community and 
thus far the reductions compared with the deposits are so small, that our friends rather reproach us with not having 
done enough, than to have curtailed excessively. The de 
posit Banks being now in full possession of the public revenue may employ it in discounts and leave the Bank of the 
United States the opportunity of gently diminishing its business. That with so wide a circulation as 18 or 19 millions 
which the receipts of the public revenue may place in the hands of officers who know that no service more acceptable 
can be rendered than to employ the funds in injuring the 
Bank, and so many vulnerable points to protect, we shall 
deem it expedient to reduce the present amount of our loans, 
cannot be doubted. The Executive, by removing the public 
revenues has relieved the Bank from all responsibility for the 
currency, and imposed upon it a necessity to look primarily 
to the interest of the Stockholders committed to our charge. 
Our friends must therefore bear with us, if in the midst of 
the present troubles, we should endeavor to strengthen the 
Bank so as to make it able here after to interpose effectively 
for the relief of the Country. . . .

</p><p>
Dear sir 
</p><p>
I have had the pleasure of receiving your favor of the 3O th inst. which I deemed so important, that before answering 
it, I consulted the Board at their meeting yesterday in the 
same confidential manner in regard to the subject of it. It is, as you are aware, a very delicate subject, one of which it is 
very difficult, and yet very necessary, to decide in advance, on the best course to be pursued. The opinion of the Board, 
which has my own entire concurrence, is this. 
</p><p>
The Bank of the United States has been compelled in self defence to diminish its business and call upon its debtors, and 
refuse to make loans to a very considerable amount. It is still doing so and shall do so for some time. If it had the means 
of lending, it would lend to its own customers. The State Banks have all had the same warning and should prepare 
themselves in the same way nor is it just that these Banks should call upon the Bank of the U S. for the funds which it 
has been husbanding for itself. If it is not just, neither is it safe. If there be trouble among the Banks, the only security 
is the Bank of the U. S. It holds its power as a trust for the ultimate protection of our banking system, the fate of which 
seems involved in that of the Bank of the U.S. and if we begin by venturing prematurely to the support of institutions 
which may be embarrassed, we may ourselves become too much weakened to make decisive efforts at a later stage of 
the disasters which are coming. 
</p><p>
Under these impressions, the Board have declined invariably for some time past numerous applications for loans from 
Banks. They think it decidedly best to abstain from making such loans. They think also that it is expedient to abstain 
from all pledges or promises of support to the Banks. We know not how far such engagements may lead us and 
until the Bank is strong enough to make some general movement for the benefit of the country: were [such] palliatives 
would rather endanger us than do permanent benefit to them. We have been very anxious to make you strong 
and are very desirous that you should continue so for 
which reason, we wish the Office to avoid every engagement 
that would commit its funds. ... In fact, the examination of 
the subject to which your letter has given rise, has brought to\ 
my notice the circumstance that I have inadvertently omitted! 
to apprize you of the wish of the Bank on the 22 nd of January \ 
last that you should bring your loans down fifty thousand dol 
lars below the amount at which they were fixed in October / 
and I mention it now to show you that we have looked to a/ 
reduction rather than an expansion of your business. On the 
whole we should much prefer that you avoid all engagements 
either for general or particular support of the Banks. 
</p><p>
In respect to the balances too, we are anxious that they 
should not be suffered to accumulate particularly as the 
want of confidence among the State Banks may make the \ 
Office the depository of their notes. Neither the notes nor the \ 
balances should remain long. The explosion of the Bank of 
Maryland found this Bank (at Phil'a ) in possession of $21,000 / 
of its notes and we shall in consequence pursue a course/ 
of more frequent settlements with the State Banks. 
</p><p>
I wish it were in my power to say that we might relieve the\ \ 
wants of the Banks near you. But I much fear that we could } J 
not do much ultimate good and at the present momen&gt; X y/ 
we must avoid diminishing our means, so as to keep thein 
unbroken when they may hereafter be most needed.

The failure of the Bank of Washington confirms the opinion, entertained by you in regard to the District Banks

</p><p>
Dear sir 
</p><p>
I have had the pleasure of receiving your favor of the 5th inst. and shall answer it cheerfully. And yet it is difficult 
to answer with certainty. The question you propose is "will relief be afforded to the country by a restoration of the deposits to the B.U.S. and of harmony between it and the Treasury, and this unconnected with the question of the recharter." Now the mere deposit of accruing revenue in the 
Bank would not of itself justify any immediate expansion of 
the loans, unless taken as an evidence of a change of opinions 
or of feelings toward the Bank on the part of those who govern at Washington. If there was a cordiality there if there 
was merely a concession of the deliberate efforts to destroy the Bank which has been made for several years past, the Bank might be disposed to venture much to produce relief At the same time the question of real and permanent stability to the currency is in fact the question of the recharter of 
the Bank and I am satisfied that any thing short of this can produce only partial and temporary effects. I wish that 
something were done soon, for before long the evils will grow 
entirely beyond our control. For five or six months past the 
Bank has been exerting itself to save Individuals and the 
State Banks, and but for its interposition the evils would 
have fallen upon the country with ten fold severity. These 
efforts however have a natural end and then, when the several hundred State Banks are left to themselves, the confusion will before long [be] irretrievable. This Bank is now 
very strong and shall be kept so it must be beyond the reach of any possible risk, so as to interpose hereafter when 
the confusion is no longer sufferable. Till then it must retain a position of calm and quiet strength and look on 
anxiously but immovably. It will before long have in its vaults nearly one dollar in specie for every dollar of its notes in circulation. 
</p><p>
My impressions then are these: 
</p><p>
If the Bank Charter were renewed or prolonged I believe the pecuniary difficulties of the country would be immediately healed. 
</p><p>
If the deposits were restored and the Bank had a reasonable prospect of not being obliged to draw in its loans 
soon after it had made them, I think the Bank would make an effort to relieve the country, and with the Executive friendly or not hostile, would I think succeed in the attempt. 
</p><p>
If the deposits were merely restored and the Executive continues its efforts to destroy the Bank the institution 
could not either safely or wisely change its present system, which is that of a gentle reduction preparatory to closing its concerns. 
</p><p>
You will see in the frankness of these expressions the evidence of my confidence in your discretion and my expectation that you will consider them as for yourself alone

Dear Sir 
</p><p>
... In respect to the other subject of your letter, you 
will I think readily understand the position of the Bank. Believing as we do that the whole support of the currency must 
devolve on the B.U.S. and seeing as we think we do, that the disorders and troubles are but beginning, our great effort 
is to make the Bank not merely strong, but entirely beyond 
the reach of those who, under the name of the Gov. are 
seeking its destruction In this operation the State Banks 
fall in debt. Now we must either settle with these Banks or 
let the debt increase till it may grow entirely beyond our 
control and beyond their means of payment. This is wrong 
in two respects first, because it is not just to the Stock 
holders of the B.U.S. to give to others the gratuitous use of 
so large a portion of their capital and second because 
these large balances may become unsafe. For example, the 
Banks of the City of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> owe to the Branch Bank 
$700,000. Why should they be allowed to owe that sum? 
and what will become of the debt if it be permitted to in 
crease as it probably will to twice that sum? I believe that 
the State Banks themselves will be benefitted by the restraint of being obliged to settle and so accommodate their business to their means. The Bank, as I am sure you are 
aware, is desirous of protecting the community from the 
mischief which threaten it, and has been constantly engaged 
in relieving the Banks and individuals whose solvency has 
been endangered by the measures of the Treasury. At the 
same time the Bank would injure itself &amp; not benefit the 
country, if, after all the warnings which the State Banks as 
well as individuals have had to diminish their business and provide against the storm, it should venture on the Quixotjsni of preventing all inconvenience to the public from the 
measures intended to destroy the Institution. The course wmch circumstances seem to force upon the Bank is that of 
gradual &amp; gentle diminition of its business, so as to be pre 
pared to expand or to close its affairs as the country may de 
sire hereafter. I pray you to believe that I shall always be 
happy to hear from you and that I am

Dear Sir 
</p><p>
I have had the pleasure of receiving your favor of the 
10th inst. which I assure you requires no apology, as I am al 
ways not merely willing, but anxious to learn the opinion of 
judicious friends of the Bank. 
</p><p>
Since the Bank has ceased to be the depository of the public revenue, the indulgence formerly given to the State } 
Banks could scarcely be expected as it would be unreasonable and unjust to the Stockholders of the Bank of the 
U.S. to let the State Banks have the use of a large part of its capital without interest, while they were making interest
on it. The Board have therefore made a recent order for the J 
periodical settlement of those balances from the State Banks. The general object was to keep down this accumulation of 
debt from those institutions at the same time, nothing was 
more remote from the desire of the Bank than to oppress the 
State Institutions. On the contrary we should be disposed to give every reasonable facility in the settlement of the balances. 
It was probably some misapprehension of the design of the Bank which occasioned the excitement to which you allude 
&amp; which I trust will cease when the nature of these periodical regulations of the balances is better known from practice.

Dear Sir 
</p><p>
The last mail brought me your favor of the II th inst 
which shall not fail to receive immediate attention as soon 
as we hear from the Branch at <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a> on the subject. 
As yet we have had no communication whatever in regard 
to it. 
</p><p>
I regret very much the decision of the House on <a href='/results.php?tla=hec' rel='colleague'>Mr Clay's</a> resolutions : for its effect will I fear be to render the state of 
the country much more embarrassing during the summer. 
The House have it now in their power, by passing those resolutions, to give immediate and general relief to the country. 
If the House by however small a majority, were to order 
the restoration of the Deposits, no matter whether it were 
vetoed or signed by the Pres., it would not only relieve the 
Senate from the reproach of siding against the Pres. and the people but it would establish such a relation between the 
Congress and the Bank, as would induce the latter to make 
great efforts to restore confidence and prosperity. With such 
a vote of Congress, twenty-four hours would be sufficient to 
establish peace, and to insure the return of better times for 
the country. On that subject my convictions are strong 
</p><p>
"and were it not for the misinterpretation to which it would 
be liable, I should go down &amp; talk with you all about it. 
</p><p>
Do you think it practicable to carry the resolutions? The 
majority was 20 which requires a change of only n votes. 
Now I have no doubt that many members like Mr King of 
Georgia, who are well disposed even to recharter the Bank, 
but despairing of the recharter, think the restoration of the 
deposites without being followed by a certainty of a recharter, would benefit neither the country. In this they are mistaken. I think for instance I could venture to say that if such 
a vote were secured, the Bank would feel no reluctance in 
giving one, or if necessary, two millions of loans to Louisiana 
as requested for her relief. This could be done because such 
a vote is peace and harmony &amp; confidence between the Bank 
&amp; the Congress. In truth I know of no way in which all the 
interest on the Western waters could be more immediately &amp; 
substantially advanced than by such a vote, which it would 
be in the power of Eleven men, who are sent to Congress to promote these interests, to give in a few days. Could not that 
resolution be brought up? I should think there were men 
enough in the House to do that good service to their section 
of the country, even if it did cost them a frown at the Palace. 
If you suppose it is at all feasible &amp; that I can promote it,

I have the goodness to let me know and in the mean time

Dear Sir 
</p><p>
Your favor of the 2y th ult was duly received and the letter inclosed in it will not fail to receive the respectful attention due to the signers of it. 
</p><p>
The Board have deemed it inexpedient to change the course 
of the Bank during the session of Congress, but when it was 
ascertained that nothing could be done, upon the adjournment, a Committee was appointed, to consider what measures 
would be necessary in consequence of that event. This Committee will report in a few days, and in their deliberations, 
the views contained in the communication you have for 
warded will have their due weight. In the mean time, I think 
it right to say that the paper is written under an entire misapprehension of the course and situation of the Bank. These 
gentlemen say "it is well understood that the Bank is pursuing a regular system of curtailment apparently at the rate ,. 
of about a million of dollars per month." Now the fact is that the Bank is not curtailing its business a single dollar; no curtailment of any description has been ordered since January 
last, and all that was then directed has with a few exceptions 
been executed, so that the Bank has not I believe a wish to 
reduce its present amount of loans and certainly has adopted 
no regular system of curtailment. In respect to your own 
Office, you know perfectly, that you have been under no 
restriction of any kind as to the amount of your loans, and 
that since the removal of the deposits, <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> is the only point 
in the whole establishment except <a href='/results.php?city=savannah' rel='city'>Savannah</a> (where the business voluntarily fell off after the run upon it) where no reduction was directed, and it is moreover the only place where 
the discounts have increased, they being at this moment 
more than half a million of dollars beyond the amount in 
October. 
</p><p>
What has probably induced the belief of this curtailment is the diminition of the apparent aggregate of Loans in the published statements, but these intelligent men of business must 
perceive that this is the natural result of this season of the 
year of the maturity of the bills from the South, which can 
not be replaced by other bills from the South, as the sea 
son of purchasing them goes by, so that these reductions are 
not compulsory but voluntary and inevitable. Of the nature 
of these presumed curtailments I can offer no better illustration than what is furnished by the accounts up to the I 8t . of 
July now lying before me showing the following comparison 
of the discounts during the last month.

</p><p>
Now there is an actual increase of discounts (for the purchase 
of a foreign Bill is as much a loan as the purchase of an inland 
Bill) amounting to $655,181.07, altho of those two classes 
of Loans, the local discounts and Domestic Bills there is a 
diminition, but this diminition is voluntary, and so far as 
concerns the present subject is worth remarking. 
</p><p>
The whole diminition in local Discounts is 3I5&gt;<a href='/results.php?year=9494'>9494</a>9

of this the diminition at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> is 201,137.13 
</p><p>
Now you are perfectly aware that the diminition was not directed, nor advised, nor suggested by the Bank that as 
I far as the Bank is concerned, it is voluntary and forms no part "of a regular system of curtailment." Again; the diminition of the domestic bills is $860,990.67. This is composed \ 
mainly of the diminished purchases at <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a>, Mobile I 
&amp; <a href='/results.php?city=charleston' rel='city'>Charleston</a> to the amount of 851,024.05, of diminished purchases at other Western and South Western Offices amount-/

Exchange have increased $385,091.28. Your aggregate business in local Discounts &amp; Domestic Bills has increased $127,-

</p><p>
From all this, I think our friends will perceive 1st . That 
the Bank is not pursuing any course of curtailment at all. 
2nd . That the last months operations have been in fact a considerable expansion of Loans and 3 rd . that of all the Cities 
of the United States, that which has the least reason to 
complain is <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> I say emphatically <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, because 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> is the only Branch where no curtailments were 
ordered, the only Branch which has actually and largely 
increased its Loans the only Branch which from the removal of the Deposits to the present day, has had no restriction put upon the amount of its Loans. If the Board have 
found in the situation of the Branch enough to justify the 
exemption from these restraints, it was not certainly to be 
presumed the party most favored should most complain. 
</p><p>
Having said this much, I could wish to go no farther and 
yet I ought to add a few words more in regard to the suggestion that "it may even create a necessity for the whigs self 
defence to separate themselves entirely from that Institution." ! regret extremely the use of such phrases since they 
resolve themselves at last into this, that if the Bank does not 
do what the Gentlemen wish, the political party to which 
they belong will denounce the Bank. Now it is true that the 
Gentlemen who administer the Bank concur in their individual characters with the party just named, and will al 
ways be disposed to cooperate with them for general benefit, nothing could be more immediately &amp; decidedly fatal to 
that cooperation than the appearance of any disposition to 
coerce the Bank by political denunciations. IfjJoerefore any Political party or association desires to separate itself from the 
Bank be it so. The parting will be a source of deep regret, but there would be deeper regret at doing wrong to avoid 
i^ The Bank looks only to what it views the interest of the Stockholders and of the country and it will never yield any 
art of those interests to create or relieve political friends. Already the very suggestion is calculated to be injurious. 
I did not even venture to read that letter to the Board, be 
cause I knew that the tone of it would excite unpleasant feelings and that that portion of the Board connected with the 
Government might turn to the very great injury of the political party, in whose name these Gentlemen speak, the declarations contained in it. For the same reason I make this 
a private letter to you, with liberty to communicate these 
explanations to them. They will I hope perceive in the temper which dictates them a very strong desire that they should 
be satisfied in regard to the general position of the Bank and especially of its disposition towards them and the community 
around them. If we are so unfortunate as to fail in this, and are destined to have the ranks of the enemy swelled by alienated friends, much as we regret the accession of so much respectibility to the adverse party, we certainly will be less inclined to capitulate to their hostility, than to yield to their 
friendly suggestions. In a few days I have to apprize you of the determination of the Board and mean while remain, with great regard

Dear Sir 
</p><p>
I have this morning had the pleasure of receiving your favor of the 8th inst. We have waited for the adjournment of 
Congress before taking any final course in regard to the Bank, because till then the movement of the Government was uncertain. The subject is now under examination by a Commit 
tee of the Board who will probably report in a day or two. My own individual opinion is, that having reached the point 
of entire safety &amp; being in some sort divorced from the Executive, the Bank is now at liberty to consult exclusively the 
interest of the Stockholders and the Community. In such a 
state of things it seems inexpedient to impose or to continue 
curtailments merely for the sake of any effect they might be 
presumed to produce abroad, and I shall not be surprized if 
further reductions of the loans should be suspended. No 
determination, however, is yet made, and therefore nothing 
should be said about it in your journal I should think at present.

Dear Sir

I received yesterday your favor of the 27th inst which was forthwith disposed of as requested. 
</p><p>
On the subject of aid from this quarter the fact is, I under 
stand, that the contributions fall on a very narrow circle of 
not wealthy people and that on the late occasion they have 
been completely exhausted and a little dispirited that their 
exertions have proved so little productive in proportion to 
their expectations. I should not think it at all probable that 
any thing further could be obtained from them. As to the 
Bank itself, I have always made it a point of duty never to 
permit its interference in any manner with our political concerns. It was a refusal to become partizans to the present set in J 
power which has made them its enemies, and it will persevere " 
in the same neutrality to the end altho all the temptations 
to depart from that course are obvious &amp; strong, &amp; however 
much the consequences may be deplored of the present misrule. We shall not look with less anxiety however on your 
great struggle, on which the fate of the country now in a great degree depends. With the hope that you and the 
good cause you support may triumph in that struggle, I remain

</p><p>
Gentlemen, 
</p><p>
I had this morning the pleasure of receiving your letter of the 5th inst in which you apprize me that you had been 
informed that the Stockholders of the U.S. Bank would accept a charter from this State and you request to know from 
me on what terms this can be effected especially mentioning the number of years of the charter with which the Bank 
would be satisfied the amount of capital as well as the premium &amp; other encouragements that would be given to 
the State in consideration of it. 
</p><p>
Having long had reflected much on this subject, I will answer promptly &amp; without reserve. 
</p><p>
For a variety of reasons, which I forbear to state because 
your duties have made you familiar with them, I believe it to 
be of the greatest importance to our State to appropriate to 
its own benefit the Capital of the Bank of the U.S. which is 
about to be distributed &amp; can never be recalled if it once 
leaves the State. 
</p><p>
I believe that considering the general growth of the whole 
Union and the extraordinary resources of Penn a which 
require only capital to develope them the sum of ten mil 
lions which formed the capital of the first Bank in <a href='/results.php?year=1791'>1791</a> 
and the sum of 35 millions which formed the capital of the 
present Bank in <a href='/results.php?year=1816'>1816</a> was not more than the equivalent of 
TOO millions at this time and that the present institution 
might with great safety &amp; with great advantage be gradually 
increased to fifty millions to an amount not disproportionate 
</p><p>
of securing a charter from the State of Pennsylvania. Clarke was a co-worker of 
Peter Force and aided the latter in collecting and publishing the former's great 
work American Archives, a Documentary History of the English Colonies of North 
America. On October 30, <a href='/results.php?year=1832'>1832</a>, Clarke wrote to Biddle as follows: "I need only 
give the outline of what I consider a splendid operation. Only remember / have 
given it. Let our State of Pennsylvania charter the U.S. Bank, less the Gov* Stock 
and in place of Branches, out of the State create Agencies or whatever you 
please to call them. . . . Let the State lay out the Bonus in Internal Improvements 
and make yourself a name &amp; praise among the nations of the Earth. " 
</p><p>
This suggestion evidently impressed Biddle as the above letter and the following actions of the Bank disclose. Moreover, the economic and political aspect 
of the State favored the Bank men at this particular time. Pennsylvania was al 
ready engulfed in the vast internal improvement speculation which characterized . 
these years and was just beginning to feel the effects of her folly. With her commerce sinking beneath the pecuniary agitation of the thirties, her treasury bankrupt, and her citizens overburdened with taxes, the Pennsylvania Legislature was 
willing to listen to Nicholas Biddle. Furthermore, the Anti-Masonic Party had 
elected their man, Joseph Ritner, as governor upon an implied promise not to in 
crease the debt nor the taxes, and as the Whigs and Anti-Masons had been voting 
together on all measures since <a href='/results.php?year=1832'>1832</a> under the able leadership of Thaddeus Stevens, Biddle might well deem the time propitious when it is considered how large a sum could be used for the 
general purposes of trade, manufactures &amp; agriculture how much might be advanced to the State for the completion 
of its great Plans of improvement how large a portion 
might be given to private associations for rail roads &amp; canals 
&amp; other objects of general benefit &amp; how much might be judiciously advanced to individuals in the interior for improvements which tho private in their nature are public in their 
results. I believe that to give permanancy &amp; solidity to the 
fiscal arrangements of the State it would be greatly for its 
interest to extend the charter to thirty years. 
</p><p>
I have accordingly endeavored to estimate the value of such 
a charter &amp; I have made up my mind to this conclusion 
which I mention to you at once because I have not the 
least ambition to make any arrangement not mutually advantageous &amp; because after all the benefit of this measure to 
the Commonwealth in its schemes of improvement is far 
greater than the mere price which may be paid for the charter. The question you will perceive is, what inducement * 
can be offered to the Stockholders in other parts of the U.S. 
or in Europe to leave his funds in Penn a . rather than take 
them home to be employed in other States and then what 
reason can be given for accepting a charter from Penn a rather 
from any other of the 24 States having an equal with Penn a 
to give the charter. As a Pennsylvanian devotedly attached 
to her interests &amp; her fame I would give more to Penn a . than 
to any other State for a Charter and my effort would be to 
induce all the other Stockholders to prefer that arrangement to either a division of the funds or the acceptance of a 
charter from any other State. To do which it would be necessary to render the terms beneficial to the State yet not too 
burdensome to the Stockholder.* 
</p><p>
For a charter from Penn a . for the amount of Stock held 
by individuals with a power of gradual increase to fifty mil 
lions of dollars, and for thirty years, I would recommend to 
the Stockholders the following terms. 
</p><p>
To give to the State $2,000,000 either in cash on the day 
when the charter was accepted, or in instalments one fourth 
cash &amp; the rest in equal payments at six twelve &amp; 1 8 
months, the sum of 2,000,000. To lend to the State when 
ever wanted six millions of dollars taking their Stock, which 
need not be repaid before the expiration of the charter, at 
five per cent, which interest payable semi annually &amp; giving 
a premium of ten per cent or if more agreeable to take a 
four per cent stock at par. 
</p><p>
To subscribe the sum of one million to the stock of any 
rail roads or canal companies which the State might elect as 
worthy of particular patronage and 
</p><p>
To advance at all times to the State a temporary loan of 
Five hundred thousand at five per cent 
</p><p>
Allow me in conclusion to suggest one very important consideration. It is this. The charter of the Bank expires on the 
4th of March. The Stockholders are already summoned to 
meet on the iy th of February to make preparations for the 
dissolution of the Bank &amp; some final decision will probably 
be then made for either the division of the funds or an application for a charter from some other authority. It would 
therefore be highly desirable that the final action of the legislature should be known at that period, so that an immediate acceptance of the charter may be made or ulterior measures be adopted. 
</p><p>
I need not say that in this frank exposition I speak only 
my own sentiments I believe such an arrangement would 
be beneficial to the State and as such it might be offered &amp; 
would be accepted. 
</p><p>
* As far as I understand the financial position of the State 
is that a large amount of funds is invested in improvements 
/which do not yet defray their own expenses, but will do so when 
j the whole scheme of improvements is finished. It is desirable 
therefore to make arrangements for the completion of the 
I improvements and until they become more productive to sup- 
l ply the deficiency of income over expenditure. Both these objects would I think be attained by the following arrangement.

Dear Sir 
</p><p>
I have received your favor of the 8th ins 1 , and shall 
reply to it without the least reserve. 
</p><p>
In closing the concerns of the Bank, my great anxiety is to 
take care of its faithful Officers, and any thing which I can 
do to serve them, I will do most promptly and willingly. In 
your own particular case, I am not the less desirous of serving 
you because you have been comparatively a short time with 
us, for you have connected your fortunes with the Institution, and that is itself a claim upon me. My impression then 
is, that the Branch in Buffalo will be soon closed, and that 
in the contingency of a renewed charter under a state, the 
agencies of the Bank would be confined to the most mercantile points, as the general superintendence of the currency 
will no longer devolve on the Bank: so that the Bank would 
not require your services at Buffalo. I wish therefore that 
you may succeed in your application for the Cashiership of the Bank in <a href='/results.php?city=baltimore' rel='city'>Baltimore</a> and I will do all in my power to 
promote your views by communicating with Mr. Anderson. 
You will receive from Mr. Jaudon by to-days mail a suggestion with respect to another Bank, where he thinks you might 
be well placed. In short I beg you to believe that it will afford me very great pleasure to promote your views, being, 
with sincere regard l

Dear Sir 
</p><p>
... In regard to the offer from the State Bank of the 
Presidency of the Branch at <a href='/results.php?city=fayetteville' rel='city'>Fayetteville</a>, I think you should 
not hesitate to accept it. My great anxiety now is, that the !3fficers of the Bank should be able to separate from it with 
;he least possible inconvenience to themselves and I am anxious particularly that they should lose no opportunity 
&gt;f obtaining proper employment elsewhere. If therefore the 
situation offered be in other respects satisfactory, there is 
nothing in your relations with the Bank that should induce 
you to decline it. 
</p><p>
This brings me to another matter connected with it on 
which I proposed to write to you. We are now making 
arrangements with several of the new Banks to purchase 
the whole establishment of the Office near them banking 
house, debts &amp; all. This plan is very advantageous to the 
new Bank which thus succeeds to the standing, capital, de 
posits &amp; custom of the Office, &amp; to the Bank of the U.S. it 
possesses the attraction of enabling them to close the Office 
at once. As an example of such a settlement, I will mention 
what has just taken place at <a href='/results.php?city=lexington' rel='city'>Lexington</a>, Kentucky. The President &amp; Cashier of the Office have been appointed President 
&amp; Cashier of the Northern Bank of Kentucky and that 
Institution has agreed to take the Banking House at the valuation hitherto put up upon it in our schedules &amp; also to 
take the whole of the current debt not including of course 
the domestic bills at its nominal amount, giving the notes 
of the Bank of Kentucky payable in I, 2, 3, &amp; 4 years with 
interest at five per cent. The suspended debt the Bank of 
Kentucky agrees to manage and collect without charge. 
</p><p>
Now, if you could make a similar arrangement with the 
Bank of the State or any other institution, it would be satis 
factory to us. 
</p><p>
Let me hear from you soon on this subject &amp; believe me 
meanwhile

My dear Sir 
</p><p>
. . . My theory in regard to the present condition of 
the country is in a few words this. For the last few years 
the Executive power of the Govt. has been weilded by a mere 
gang of banditte. I know these people perfectly keep the 
police on them constantly and in my deliberate judgment, 
there is not on the face of the earth a more profligate crew 
than those who now govern the President. The question is 
how to expel them. I believe that a very large majority not 
merely of the intelligence and the property, but of the numbers of our countrymen, are disposed to expel them. It re 
mains to see how that majority can be concentrated so as to 
be effectual. As yet the opinions of the opposition are unformed. No man as yet can combine them : they are not fixed 
on any one man. But they are fixed on several men who are 
acceptable to various sections. Then the obvious course is, to 
make these several men in the first instance embody under 
them the force of these various sections and when the 
common enemy approaches to rally under a leader of their 
own choice. It is manifestly advantageous to let <a href='/results.php?tla=web' rel='colleague'>Mr Webster</a> lead the New England forces, Mr White the Southwest, 
or South and wherever in any one State there is a strong 
opposition man to vote for him as such and settle the 
pretensions of the chiefs afterwards. I have said again and 
again to my friends, I have said it this very morning, "This 
disease is to be treated as a local disorder apply local 
remedies if Gen'l Harrison will run better than any body else in Penns a ., by all means unite upon him." That as far as I 
understand the case, is the feeling very generally of the op 
position &amp; Gen'l Harrison must not suppose that there is in 
this quarter any unwillingness to give him fair play. On the 
contrary, he is very much respected, and if our friends are 
satisfied that he can get more votes in Penns a than any other 
candidate of the opposition they will take him up cheerfully 
&amp; support him cordially. 
</p><p>
I have but one remark more to make. If Gen'l Harrison is taken up as a candidate, it will be on account of the past, not the future. Let him then rely entirely on the past. Let 
I him say not one single word about his principles, or his creed 
V let him say nothing promise nothing. Let no Committee, no convention no town meeting ever extract from 
him a single word, about what he thinks now, or what he will do hereafter. Let the use of pen and ink be wholly forbidden 
as if he were a mad poet in Bedlam. Gen'l Harrison can speak well &amp; write well but on this occasion he should neither 
speak nor write but be silent absolutely and inflexibly silent. . . .

Dear sir

I have just seen a letter from Harrisburg stating that in a bill for chartering the Bank of the U.S. which is under 
stood to be now before a Committee of which you are Chairman, it is contemplated to introduce a provision 1 that if the 
Bank "interferes with politics, its charter may be repealed" 
and another "prohibiting the Bank from publishing documents." I lose no time in stating to you, that if such provisions, or any thing in the remotest degree resembling them 
shall be put into the charter, it will be instantly rejected by the Stockholders. They have not asked for this charter and 
certainly could not accept it on terms which might be construed into a reproach on their past administration of its affairs

to the whole plan. If the Congress of the U.S. passed the 
bill in <a href='/results.php?year=1832'>1832</a> by large majorities in both houses without annexing such conditions, there is no reason why the legislature 
of Penns a . should propose them and still less reason for 
our submitting to them. As restrictions, they are unavailing 
as indications of opinion, they are offensive; and a single 
word on that subject causes the immediate rejection of the 
Act by the Stockholders. I have so written to Mr Reed. Un 
less therefore these ideas be totally abandoned, I wish the 
question of the Bank withdrawn, as it seems useless to pro 
long a negociation which must be abortive.

Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Since writing to you this afternoon, I have heard some matters about the Bill which have changed my views of its 
actual position and produced a corresponding alteration in the intentions announced in my letter. The interests de 
pending on the event are too important to omit any proper opportunity of promoting it and I therefore strengthen

I have always thought that the best thing which <a href='/results.php?tla=mvb' rel='adversary'>Mr Van Buren</a> could do in reference to himself personally, as well 
as to his political party, would be to make peace with the 
Bank and the present state of things furnishes an admirable opportunity of accomplishing that object. Why indeed 
should he not? To all the members of the Cabinet except 
one, 1 I personally have always stood in a friendly relation, 
and in regard to the President himself there is no sort of 
personal difference. The way therefore would be open for 
a general amnesty which for the sake of the country I 
am willing to consent to and I do believe that just now 
the effect would be electric &amp; decisive.

Dear Sir 
</p><p>
I received last evening your favor of the 6th inst. The 
course of the Gov. being I presume settled as according to 
the newspapers, it now remains only to do what we can to 
diminish the sufferings of the country, and for this I shall 
certainly work as hard as if I had caused them. 
</p><p>
You ask whether some plan could not be devised by which 
the issues of the banks &amp; the exchanges could be regulated 
as formerly, by a connection with some large state Bank. I 
have no doubt of it. I have no doubt that at this moment the 
simplest &amp; easiest form of relief would be to make the pres 
ent Bank of the U.S. the depositors of the public revenue. 
It would be only necessary 
</p><p>
1st . To let the Treasury &amp; the Bank agree that the Bank 
should take charge of the public revenue collect and dis 
tribute it relieve the Treasury from all trouble about it. 
</p><p>
2d . To let the Treasury without disturbing or formally 
repealing the specie circular 1 direct the receivers to take 
the notes of the Bank of the U.S. 
</p><p>
3d . The Bank would then appoint its own agents or 
affiliate with it other State Banks being of course responsible for them all &amp; the whole system of the public revenue 
as it was in <a href='/results.php?year=1830'>1830</a> which, now we may speak of it historically, was an admirable one would be all restored. 
</p><p>
The Western State Banks have mostly officers of the late 
Bank the whole country asks nothing better than its notes 
which are now every where at a premium, and both at home 
&amp; abroad the Bank has a reputation which it can put at the \ 
service of the Government. 
</p><p>
I sincerely believe that in a week's time such an arrangement would restore confidence &amp; credit. 
</p><p>
The very prospect of it would stop many of the evils which 
are impending. 
</p><p>
And why should it not be? If the thing promises well, why 
should we be deterred from attempting it? Why should <a href='/results.php?tla=mvb' rel='adversary'>Mr Van Buren</a> &amp; <a href='/results.php?tla=jof' rel='colleague'>Mr Forsyth</a> &amp; Mr Dickerson &amp; Mr Woodbury 
&amp; yourself not agree to any project which promises relief, 
even tho the name of the Bank be connected with it. I am 
sure you are all above the indulgence of any feeling on that 
score and for myself, I am perfectly willing to forget all 
the quarrels with the last administration, which neither party 
would desire to have perpetuated. 
</p><p>
Politically the effect would undoubtedly be good. Pennsylvania would be pleased, and the whole country would regard it as a proof of returning peace. 
</p><p>
It would require a little time to mount again the machinery, 
but it could be done without much delay, &amp; in the mean time 
the very knowledge that it was intended, would be infinitely 
soothing in the present initated condition of things. 
</p><p>
Now, my dear sir, there is a project for you. If you can bring 
it to bear, you will have done great good to the country a 
work in which you will always find a ready cooperation.

Dear Sir 
</p><p>
In a letter which I have written by this mail to Mr Poinsett, I have suggested a measure which I think would be 
a brilliant stroke of policy, &amp; give immediate confidence to the country. It is simply this, that the Gov . should make the Bank of the U.S. the depository of the public funds, and without repealing the specie circular, authorize the reciept of the 
paper of the Bank for dues to the Government. You will see at a glance the advantages of such a movement. . . . 
</p><p>
What prevents this ? Some old feeling of party ? Certainly 
not. We have fought out the battle with the last administration with what success it is not for me to say but at\ 
least we fought it fairly, and we do not wish to fight it over I with this administration. 
</p><p>
I submit all these matters to you, and if, as I trust, you will 
see them in the same light, I would ask your immediate concurrence in carrying it into effect. I care not how it begins, or 
who proposes it, but if it be necessary for me to commence, 
I am agreed. I am too proud to think my step humiliating 
which may benefit this poor bleeding country of ours.

I have had the pleasure of receiving your favor of the

style which I have admired for five &amp; twenty years. I hope 
it may carry you through many Presidential Olympiads.

1 The Van Buren MSS. in the Library of Congress show clearly that Van Buren 
thought he ought to follow in the footsteps of President Jackson. 
</p><p>
I thank you for your approbation of my public conduct, 
which, whatever may be the result, has been dictated by a 
very honest desire to protect the great interests of the country. 
</p><p>
In relation to the friendly suggestion which forms the pur 
pose of your letter, I have received from various quarters 
intimations of a disposition to connect my name with the 
next election of President. These I have never considered 
seriously, nor indeed noticed at all : but to you I will speak 
for the first time &amp; without reserve. 
</p><p>
I believe that the prosperity &amp; the character of the country 
require that those who now govern it should be removed and 
that all true men should unite to expel them each taking 
the position, either of chief or subaltern, which the general 
voice assigns to him. I am quite sure that I have not the 
least affectation in saying, that to myself personally, the office 
has not the slightest attraction. Its dignity has been degraded 
by the elevation to it of unworthy men and as to mere 
power, I have been for years in the daily exercise of more 
personal authority than any President habitually enjoys. But 
I stand ready for the country's service. If therefore you think 
that my name can be productive of good, I am content to 
place it as I now do, at your disposal under a conviction 
of the friendly &amp; discreet manner in which alone it will be 
employed.

My dear Sir 
</p><p>
You ask my views about the mode in which the Bank 
of the U.S. could assist in restoring the currency. I will tell 
you in a few words. 
</p><p>
The present design of those who govern the Government 
at Washington is, I understand, to draw all the funds out of 
the Banks then cut all connection with them and establish subtreasuries where each receiver is to sit upon his 
small heap of gold &amp; silver. This is the newest, &amp; therefore 
the favorite, foolery. Congress, I think will not agree to this, 
or to any other experiment and will incline to either a real 
downright Bank of the U.S. chartered by the Genl Gov or to 
the present Pennsylv 3 . Bank. . . . 
</p><p>
If the Treasury &amp; the Bank could come to an understand 
ing as to the terms on which the Bank would do this business 
everything would soon come right. 
</p><p>
But I can do nothing at present which would not work 
more harm than good. This very proposition I made before 
the suspension. Had it been adopted the Suspension would 
have been I believe, averted. I cannot now renew it. My 
purpose now is to be perfectly quiet to be ready but 
not impatient &amp; wait the action of Congress. If that body 
adopts any measure which promises relief I shall cordially 
concur in it If not, having done my duty I remain wl 
I was. My great object is to heal the wounds inflicted upon the country. I will spare no effort for that purpose. No misguided feeling of pride, no remembrance of past injustice to myself shall prevent me from a sincere &amp; cordial cooperation with any public men who will honestly labor in the public service. These are the simple views and the frank opinion of

My Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I had last evening the pleasure of receiving your letter of the 21st inst. and immediately hasten to perform the 
sacred duty of defending the character of an honest man from the reptiles who avenge themselves for his superiority while 
living, by crawling over his dead body. I think we shall be perfectly successful in presenting the following results. 
</p><p>
The argument in the case of McCullock &amp; the State of Maryland began, according to your statement on the 22d of 
Feb'y <a href='/results.php?year=1819'>1819</a>, &amp; the decision of the court was pronounced on the 17th of March <a href='/results.php?year=1819'>1819</a>. 
</p><p>
Now of the 17 shares owned by the Judge Marshall on the 
1st of Jan'y . <a href='/results.php?year=1819'>1819</a>, 12 were transferred on the 8th of Feb'y. 
<a href='/results.php?year=1819'>1819</a>, under a power given by Judge Marshall on the 5th of 
Feb'y. <a href='/results.php?year=1819'>1819</a>. 
</p><p>
For the remaining 5 he gave a power to transfer them on 
the 21st of Jan'y . <a href='/results.php?year=1819'>1819</a>, though the transfer was not actually 
made on the Books until the 26 th of March <a href='/results.php?year=1819'>1819</a>. 
</p><p>
So that in point of fact he was ostensibly the owner of five 
shares at the time of the decision. 
</p><p>
Finding this I sent for Mr Cope, one of the Director's of 
the Bank of the U.S. and nephew of the Mr Thomas V. Cope 
named in the power of Atty. &amp; requested him to examine 
the books of the House &amp; endeavored to find the evidences of 
what I have no doubt was the fact, that Judge Marshall sold 
the Stock at the time of giving the power of Attorney on the 
21st of January, and that the purchaser neglected to send it 
on till March to be transferred. 
</p><p>
I have kept my letter open in order to give the result of Mr Cope's enquiries, but as the period is so remote he has not 
been able to complete his examination, &amp; promises to let me 
know further tomorrow. He thinks however that he has ascertained that this stock was sent to the House by some per 
son in Virg a with other parcels of stock to be transferred, &amp; 
that the probility is that the correspondent in Virg a had purchased these five shares &amp; paid for them. 
</p><p>
I will postpone till tomorrow therefore the further examination, &amp; in the meantime send inclosed a certificate from 
the Transfer Office &amp; certified copies of the powers of Attorney on file. It may be well to add, that in the power of Att y 
of the 21st of Jany. <a href='/results.php?year=1819'>1819</a>, there is a blank for the name of the 
Att'y and that the blank is filled up with the name of Thomas P Cope in the handwriting of Th 03 P Cope himself, whence I 
infer that the power was given in blank by Judge Marshall 
with the certificate &amp; sent to Mr Th os P Cope by his correspondent in Virg a . . .

As you asked my opinion, I deem it right to Say that 
I think that neither your Bank nor any other Bank Should 
take the loan and that it would be very hazardous for an 
individual since he would have to prove to the purchaser in 
Europe that it had not been originally purchased by a Bank. 
I believe that the best thing to do for you therefore both 
officially &amp; individually is to abstain from it altogether, &amp; 
so apprize the parties at once.

I had a long conversation to day with Mr Hunt the Minister from Texas and suggested to him various changes

My dear Sir,

You may readily suppose that we are not idle whilfcy &gt;/ 
this insane Sub Treasury scheme is urged forward to break] 
down all the great interests of the country and preparations are made to obtain from our legislature at Harrisburgh 
instructions to our representatives in Congress to oppose it. 
I learn from a friend who has just left me on his arrival from Harrisburgh to night, that the resolutions for that purpose 
were to be introduced into the House of Rep 3 this day. If so, 
they will be taken up on Monday &amp; if then passed will be 
sent to the Senate &amp; passed finally on Tuesday. 
</p><p>
I lose no time therefore in suggesting that you would keep \ 
up the debate in the Senate for a few days until the resolutions can reach you. I attach great importance to this measure 
as separating our State from these desperadoes, and the country looks to you eminently to exert your great powers as 
they have been so often before displayed for its protection.

On January 29, <a href='/results.php?year=1838'>1838</a>, Webster wrote to Benjamin D. Lilliman as follows: 
"We begin the proceeding on the S.T. Bill tomorrow. It will probably pass this 
House, without amendment, by 2 or 3 votes. Its fate in the other House is greatly 
doubtful. The decision on the Mississippi election is expected to day or to morrow. 
The Sub Treasury Bill may, perhaps, be a good (deal) dependent on the decision."

My dear Sir 
</p><p>
. . . The Bank of the U. States owes about six millions of dollars to the Gov't  payable by instalments due in Sept 
nxt Sep. i839~Sep. <a href='/results.php?year=1840'>1840</a>. Now the Bank might anticipate 
these payments at once, and put the Gov't  in funds for its 
pressing wants. In this Settlement, as it is the payment of a 
debt and does not come under the Same line as the ordinary 
revenue there need be no operation of specie payment or 
any other payment, for the public creditor would be too 
happy to receive a draft on the Bank with the option of asking 
specie for it if he choose to demand it, just as the Secretary 
of the Navy last year paid the pensioners. 
</p><p>
The first effect of such an arrangement would be to quiet the 
minds of the people as to what is regarded as the hostility of 
the Govt. to the Banks the most serious obstacle at present to a general restoration of the Currency and it would 
go further than any other measure I know to promote that object. An easy consequence of this would be a return to some 
thing like the ancient habits of inter course between the Bank 
&amp; the Govt. which would lead to this result. I think that the 
Gov*. may be satisfied that no System could work better than 
that of the late Bank of the U.S. Now the present Bank is only 
the late Bank with no change except in the origin of its char 
ter. Its whole machinery can be remounted in twenty four 
hours and thence forward it can, without difficulty, engage 
to receive &amp; disburse the public funds in every part of the 
U.S. without any charge whatever, in specie or its equivalent, at the option of the public creditor. If therefore by a simple 
arrangement of that Kind with the Bank, you can restore 
the administration of the funds to its former footing, you 
accomplish several objects. The first of course is that the work 
of the Govt. is well done. The second is that you are relieved 
from all connection in detail with a multitude of banks, the 
fruitful source of trouble &amp; political danger. Then you get rid 
of the debatable question of the National Bank You avoid 
the embarrassment of retracting any fixed opinions you 
restore in the most effectual way you can, at least you con 
tribute as far as you can to restore, the currency. 
</p><p>
Finally, you thus get peace not a bad thing at any time 
but a remarkably good thing at this time. For myself 
this business of Texas, and a much more important matter 
which I project, make me desire to close up these old sources 
of discontent. I am therefore singularly pacific &amp; amiable 
just now. 
</p><p>
It seems to me then, that you have an opportunity of making a political movement a coup d etat worth trying. 
I believe that at this moment a reconciliation between the Bank &amp; the Govt. would do more both at home &amp; abroad to 
settle our troubles than any other measure that could be 
adopted. Its influence here in disarming the hostility of those 
who consider the Govt. as indisposed to the credit system, you 
may estimate better than I can. This could be done simply 
by putting aside the Sub treasury bill, and all other projects, 
and leaving the whole matter on the footing of the resolution 
of <a href='/results.php?year=1816'>1816</a>, which would make it the subject of treasury regulation. 
</p><p>
Having thus unburdened my mind, I leave the rest to you, 
if you think the suggestion worth following out. If not, it ofcourse rests between ourselves, as no one will be aware of the &gt;. 
contents of this letter. The negociation for anticipating the ^ 
first instalment is going on under the auspices of the gentle 
man who has had charge of it but the occasion seems a 
good one to follow out the mere intended arrangement here suggested.

My dear Sir,

. . . The tide now has begun to turn, and the Bank 
has received to day a triumph such as it never enjoyed in any 
part of its career. You know that the stand taken by the Bank 
was, that it would not resume until the Govt. changed its 
course, as there could be no security for specie payments 
while the Gov't  itself made the distinction between specie &amp; 
notes. Accordingly the contest has literally been between 
the Bank &amp; the Executive. With what result you will see by 
the proceedings of yesterday when on the very same day the 
Specie Circular was repealed in the Senate by a vote of 34 to 
9, and in the House by 154 to 29. I have immediately endeavoured to justify the confidence of the country by issuing \ 
a note to <a href='/results.php?tla=jqa' rel=''>Mr Adams</a> 1 in which suppressing all feelings of triumph, I merely announced the fact that we should now 
proceed to take measures for resumption. At the same time 
we resolved to yield to our <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> friends who wished us 
to have a Branch there under the new Banking law. This 
application is itself one of the most extraordinary symptoms 
of the good feeling which pervades the commercial community of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. I send you an extract from the newspaper of to-day containing a notice of it, as well as my letter to 
<a href='/results.php?tla=jqa' rel=''><a href='/results.php?tla=jqa' rel=''>Mr. Adams</a></a> &amp; I will inclose, if they can be prepared in 
time, copies of the correspondence with <a href='/results.php?tla=jqa' rel=''>Mr Adams</a> on the 
subject. 
</p><p>
I now mean to turn my immediate attention to making a simultaneous movement in the South &amp; West, so as to make the resumption really worth having &amp; I hope I to be able to rally up the whole country to an efficient exertion. 
</p><p>
The efforts made here to injure the Bank and which are 
echoed on your side, have ceased to have any effect here, &amp; 
the Bank will probably be in a more desirable situation than 
it ever was. 
</p><p>
I shall even not be very much surprized if some coquetting 
passes between our administration friends and the Bank, as 
we are in a singularly amiable humour. 
</p><p>
You know that Woodbury is appointed Chief Justice of 
New Hampshire &amp; leaves the Treasury, being in fact turned 
out in the shape of a resignation; so that according to Euro 
pean ideas, the President's ordinance being repealed, by both 
Houses of Congress, &amp; the Minister who issued it being dis 
missed, it may be regarded as a civil revolution on the side of 
the Bank.

My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
We received yesterday your letter of the 5th ulto. I am not surprized that the echo in London of all the trash circulated here has annoyed you. But we have surmounted them 
on this side and I think the Bank stands even better now 
than it ever did in the general estimation. You will have seen 
that we hailed the first glimpse of sunshine offered by the 
repeal of the Specie Circular. But as soon as it passed, the 
party of the Administration rallied upon the Sub Treasury 
Bill. That bill, as you know, passed the Senate, but is now 
in such a position in the House that it cannot be reached with 
out a vote of two thirds. Accordingly Mr Cambreling has 
brought in a fresh bill which a majority can control, &amp; which 
the Administration mean to push thro the House. If this be 
the case, it will undo all that has hitherto been done. <a href='/results.php?tla=jse' rel='colleague'>Mr Sergeant</a> is here on a visit, and he thinks the matter so critical, 
&amp; is so anxious to obtain even a single vote that we are about 
sending down some people to Washington to explain to the 
representatives from our State how extremely injurious to its 
interests such a bill would prove, and urging them to defeat 
it. With what success a week will determine. ...

... I think now we are approaching the end of our 
war. The repeal of the Specie Circular was an actual surrender by the Administration but since then, they have rallied in great force on the Sub-Treasury bill which was supposed to be dead &amp; buried. The real political secret of this bill is that the most of the Adm'n . party do not like it 
that <a href='/results.php?tla=jcc' rel='colleague'>Mr Calhoun</a> is driving them into it in order to promote his own advancement. I think however it will be defeated. 
Then we shall come to some modification of the deposit system. What I wish to establish is that the business of the country &amp; the public revenue shall pass through Banks &amp; not thro mere receivers and this I think we shall establish at last. . . .

My dear Sir,

I have but a moment, as usual, to write, as the Bank is closing, &amp; the mail for the Sirius going. 
The repeal of the Specie Circular has been followed by a fresh defeat in the rejection of the Sub-Treasury. Mr Buchanan has renewed the matter of the special deposit, but it will fail. 
</p><p>
In England we should have seen an instant change of ministry. Here ministers are engaged on wages for a year &amp; 
however they may misbehave, will serve out their term. On the 9th of July, Congress will adjourn and then the Administration, poor &amp; dispirited, will be brought to reason as wild beasts are tamed by hunger. 
</p><p>
Remember that whatever you may read to the contrary, the repeal of the Specie Circular &amp; the defeat of the Sub 
Treasury are the results, exclusively, of the course pursued 
by the Bank of the U.S. If we had done as the <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
Banks had, succumbed to the Gov't  &amp; resumed when they did, it would have been a surrender at discretion. I was 
willing to risk the temporary overshadowing to have a permanent sunshine; and I think we shall soon have it. . .

Dear Sir 
</p><p>
Mr Kimble of the House of Representatives called upon me today and expressed to me a wish on your part to 
know whether the bonds of the Bank could be made available for the use of your Department. I hasten to say that from a 
desire to promote the public service, as well as from considerations personal to yourself, it will afford me great pleasure 
to do anything which may contribute to the successful ad ministration of your Department. 
</p><p>
There are, as you are aware, three bonds payable on the 1st of October of <a href='/results.php?year=1838'>1838</a>-39 &amp; 40, respectively. The two which it 
is proposed to sell cannot be sold either in this country or in 
Europe, and the money can be furnished for them by the Bank only. But I should be disposed to advance the money 
on the first, second, and perhaps third of them, if it could be made the interest of both the Department and the Bank. 
If therefore you can in the first instance so arrange it as to have the bonds placed at your disposition to raise the money 
on them, and let me know how and where and when your disbursements are to be made, I will at once tell you what I can do.

I will thank you to take charge of a little matter which may become important unless wisely managed. The Bank 
has just made a settlement, mutually advantageous to both parties, with the Gov't  To you, who know all the bearings 
of such a measure, I need not say, that I regard it as the termination of the war, &amp; therefore of great benefit alike to the 
Bank,and to the country. But if it be a matter of advantage to the Bank, or of triumph to its friends, like all triumphs it should 
be enjoyed with moderation. In noticing it therefore, by the press, I would specially avoid everything like exultation 
everything like rep roach to the administration as being forced, at last, to resort to the Bank. But on the contrary the administration should be treated as having done a good thing, and should have credit for a pacification which cannot fail to 
be useful to the country. It may be of some consequence to the Adm'n . to see that they do not expose themselves, by this 
step, to sneers and sarcasms from their political opponents. 
</p><p>

My dear Sir 
</p><p>
Leaving to our friends Mess". Cowperthwait &amp; Dunlap to give you all the details, I shall employ the only few 
moments of leisure I can command before the sailing of the Steamship, to say two or three things which may interest you. 
</p><p>
I . We have settled with Govt. for our bonds, and settled 
in a way particularly agreeable. You know my opinion, which 
I have never concealed, in regard to the individuals who 
have for the last ten years governed the country. These 
opinions are confirmed rather than changed. But looking, as 
I do, to what I deem the great interests of the country, &amp; 
Specially bound to protect the interests committed to my 
charge, my object has been to bring the existing Govt. to 
such a course of measures as would remedy present evils, 
until some political revolution should restore wiser counsels 
at Washington. To bring this about, there was no safe course but one of open and decided defiance, to show that the Bank 
was not at all afraid of the administration, and would not 
depart from its own policy until the Govt. had renounced 
the follies which it was laboring to propagate. Accordingly 
it became necessary to say that the Bank U.S. and the other 
banks would not resume specie payments until the Govt. had 
announced its own policy. The parties stood in that attitude, 
</p><p>
the good cause weakened by the desertion &amp; the weakness 
of those <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 21/2 per cent patriots but still strong 
enough to face the enemy. Our efforts were of course directed 
to the repeal of the specie circular, &amp; when that was done, 
and the Adm'n . made a last rally on the sub treasury bill, by 
great exertion they were defeated on that point. This settled 
the matter. The real question, as you know perfectly well, 
was, whether the Govt. should carry on its finances by the instrumentality of banks, or of special receivers of Gold &amp; Silver only; and the vote of the H. of Rep's . decided that the 
sense of the country was for the old mode. The adjournment 
of Congress hastened the process of repentance, by leaving 
the Adm'n . without any means of carrying on the public business, unless by the sale of the Bonds. I had taken my own 
position in that narrow defile, thro which I was sure they 
would have to pass, and where accordingly we met. What befell, you may imagine, since we have come out good friends ; 
and after a little coquetry and a little flirtation, I think it 
not improbable that Mr (not Mrs ) Woodbury &amp; I will be tender &amp; true, after the Douglass fashion. 
</p><p>
The settlement is in this form : 
</p><p>
The first bond due in September next, will be divided into three instalments, payable on the 15th . of August, September and October, respectively. 
</p><p>
The second bond, due in September <a href='/results.php?year=1839'>1839</a>, is immediately cashed on the 1st ins*. 
</p><p>
The third; the Sec'y is not yet sufficiently pressed to sell but when he does sell, we are to have the refusal. 
The money is placed at once to the credit of the Treasurer 
of the United States, &amp; remains on deposit with us with 
out interest and the See 7 gives a List, &amp; the Sec'y of War 
gives another list, of the points where he wants the disbursements made, which embrace the whole West &amp; South West, 
and the warrants of the Treasurer are drawn on the Bank of 
the United States, payable in Missouri, Arkansas &amp;c &amp;c. 
</p><p>
The benefit of time and exchange are thus apparent and 
the Bank is now actually a depository of the public money; 
/ so that the result is, that, after all the nonsense of the 
last few years, the Govt. takes in payment of a bond, a credit 
in a bank which does not pay specie yet, and which had declared that it did not mean to pay specie until that very 
Gov had abandoned its course. Our Washington friends 
are scarcely aware of the concession which this involves, and 
I have taken pains, throughout the country, that the opposition should indulge in no exultation no sarcasm nothing which should startle the treasury and blight our budding 
loves; for my present intention is to make the Bank a 
general depository of the funds of the Govt. You know what 
a difficult and almost incredible work that will be, but 
there is no room for despair after what has occurred, for 
the partizans of the Gov are not yet recovered from the 
amazement caused by this recent inexplicable movement. 
</p><p>
You see that we resume on the 13th of this month. We be 
gin without having sacrificed any great interest. We begin 
with a wide circle of resumers, whom our delay has enabled to prepare; and we begin after having fairly beaten down the\ 
Gov., and secured the ascendency of reason for the future./ 
We arrive in port without having been under the necessity 
of throwing over any of our cargo. We arrive, for every useful 
purpose, just as soon as our neighbours, who lost over board 
a large part of the passengers; and we only stopped on the 
way to sink a pirate. So that, on the whole, I have no reason 
to be dissatisfied with our course. 
</p><p>
2. Just as we were preparing our machinery for the New 
York concern, we found, to our great surprize, that under the 
law it was doubtful whether the Bank, as a corporation, could 
become an associate, and we were obliged to give up our 
plan. I think it very probable, however, that the object will 
be accomplished, even in a better form, if we make an arrangement with a small association to do our business in New 
York. We say nothing of this on our side of the water; but I 
think that the arrival after you receive this, will give you de 
tails. I mention it now, merely that you may know that we 
shall probably soon do the largest commercial business in 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. . . .

</p><p>
My dear Sir 
</p><p>
I have little to add to what I wrote by the Royal William, of which I enclose a copy. 
</p><p>
Our arrangements with the Govt. are in very satisfactory progress. We have placed to their credit the proceeds of the 
two first bonds, and they indicate the points of disbursements, which, being very remote and numerous, afford the ad 
vantages of circulation &amp; exchange. But the greatest satis faction of all is, that this arrangement brings back the Gov't 
to its old position of doing its business thro Banks, and by means of Bank credits. So, the triumph, is, I think, complete. The two political parties, meanwhile, are confounded, 
and are not yet able to comprehend it. The Adm'n people believe that I must have bought <a href='/results.php?tla=mvb' rel='adversary'>Mr Van Buren</a>, the opposition fearing that this will strengthen the ministry and work against the interests of <a href='/results.php?tla=hec' rel='colleague'>Mr Clay</a>. You know that my owfk 
course has reference merely to the service of the Country and if these people are beaten into measures that are beneficial, I shall not permit myself to avoid co-operating with them, lest it should injure the prospects of our political party. 
The great power of the Bank lies in its total independence of all of them. 
</p><p>
Our resumption on the 13th works very well, the demand for specie being very small.

I stated to you, last year, my views in regard to Texas; and you then thought that if the plan of annexation to the 
United States could be abandoned, every consideration of feeling &amp; interest would conspire to make us desire its prosperity. That question is now settled. Mr Jones, the new 
Minister, arrived two days ago in Phil'a ., and he is instructed to withdraw the proposal of union. This troublesome part 
of the question being thus disposed of, I am much inclined to think that if their loan of Five millions were taken in the 
United States, it would be far better than if they were obliged to seek it in England. I do not however wish to mix 
myself with the political contests of the day nor to interfere in matters which have been the subject of party warfare; and V 
I should like to have the benefit of the opinions of judicious friends before doing something final in respect to it. Will you 
then say, whatever you feel at liberty to say, in the question, whether it would not be greatly for the interest of our common country that Texas should continue independent of all foreign nations, that she should be protected by this country and not permitted, if possible, to owe her prosperity to any other aid than ours. Say, too, whether your opinion is 
that Texas can maintain its independence, or whether, in the 
last extremity, this country would permit her to be conquered, or reconquered; and, being free, whether you think 
a loan to her would be perfectly safe. You will readily understand, by the strain of these remarks, that I am predisposed 
Go serve Texas, because I believe I should benefit our country by it; but, before taking any decisive step, I would wish 
to have your judgment, because I know that your opinion will be an impartial and a patriotic one. If any circumstance, 
public or private, indisposes you to answer, I request that you will not answer. But if you incline to speak, speak for 
I think the occasion worthy of you. and so speak that if, when I have decided, I should want the benefit of your judgment to 
sanction my course, I may have it and use it publicly or privately. I will only add that what you say I wish you to say quickly.

My dear Sir 
</p><p>
Your introduction of Mr Burnley, Commissioner of Texas, makes it not unnatural to confer with you on the subject of the loan which he is endeavoring to negotiate. 
</p><p>
The subject of Texas is one familiar to me since my connection in Paris, thirty three years ago, with the treaty of Louisiana, the execution of a great portion of which fell under my own personal inspection. On that subject I hold very decided opinions. But the question which now occupies my attention is this : The Minister of Texas, just arrived &amp; in this city, 
means to withdraw, formally, the proposal to enter the Union. 
So far, the embarrassments and troubles which that measure 
threatened are, for the present at least, removed. The question then becomes an open one, and it offers for consideration this point: Whether, if we are to consider the revolution 
there as complete, if this country will not permit Texas to be conquered by a new master, or reconquered by its old 
one, then it is not of great importance that her prosperity should be of our own creation, and that she should not be 
obliged to incur obligations to any other country? She now wants money to consolidate her power &amp; fix her institutions. 
Is it not better far better that she should obtain it from us than from any other power? Now I am inclined to make 
the loan. At the same time I mean to do nothing rashly 
nothing which shall not, in my judgment, be highly beneficial to our Country. But I do not wish to take any decided 
step without the opinion of some friends on whose judgment I rely. Allow me then to ask what you think of the question ? 
Do you think that Texas will maintain its independence, or that the United States would permit any power to deprive 
her of it. Do you think it would be wise to take the loan and not suffer her to owe her success to England ? 
</p><p>
If you feel any the slightest reluctance to say anything about the matter, you will of course say nothing. But if you 
feel disposed to give any opinion, let it be such as, hereafter, if I deem it useful to use your authority as confirming my 
own views, I may quote, and if necessary, make public. I mention this that you may limit, precisely, the nature &amp; extent of your communication.

. . . Everything goes on very comfortably here. You may judge of the relation in which the Govt. and the Bank 
stand when I tell you that a few minutes ago a gentleman left me having come directly from Washington charged with 
a communication from Mr Poinsett. Among other things he said Mr Poinsett took occasion to speak to Blair in the 
presence of Mr Van Beuren, about the Bank; and that the President desired Blair not to attack the Bank or myself 
any more. Mr. Poinsett himself moreover wrote an article for the Globe, explaining the late Circular issued by the 
Cover 1 ., directing the Officers to disburse the notes of the Bank. This article Blair was obliged to publish, adding some 
remarks of his own, just enough to save his own consistency. I will try to enclose the two articles. . . .

My dear Sir 
</p><p>
I have been wanting for some days past to go and talk with you; but I presume that I must pay the penalty of 
my notoriety by abstaining from being in Washington just now, and accordingly I write what I would much rather say. What I wanted to speak of was 
</p><p>
1. Texas. 
</p><p>
I mentioned when you were here, the intention of that Govt. to withdraw its application for admission into the 
Union. That is now done, and it is very important that the President in his message should speak kindly and if possible 
cordially about that country, intimating that this withdrawal does not abate any of our good feelings towards 
Texas, and that we wish her prosperity. One kind word might do her good ; and that word may now be hazzarded with 
out much risk, for I have reason to know that it will be repeated and approved by some of the most prominent leaders 
of the opposition. I wish therefore you would see that the message is kindly on that point. 
</p><p>
The other matter was 
</p><p>
2. That part of the message which relates to money. I do 
hope that he will not vamp this worn out foolery of <a href='/results.php?tla=jcc' rel='colleague'>Mr Calhoun</a>, and say any more about the Sub Treasury. The coun 
try is disgusted with the subject, It cannot possibly do any good to the country, it will do great harm to Mr Van 
Buren ; and if he will only say nothing about it we may get along very well; but if we are to have any more such 
nauseous stuff, men now well disposed to the President will be alienated, and it will not be easy to forsee all the consequences. 
</p><p>
Now upon these two matters I pray you to take order. You are politically responsible for the acts of this administration; you may be personally responsible for the next administration, if you do not permit these experiments to be continued.

My dear Sir 
</p><p>
... 2. I have received a visit of many hours from a 
friend who has just returned after passing several weeks in the midst of the most confidential circle of the President 
Elect and his friends a disinterested cool observer and I 
have no doubt of the truth of his observations. He says decidedly that in the opinion of all that circle Mr W. is the 
person who will have much more influence with the President than Mr. C 
</p><p>
4. My friend came full of another idea. He says that the 
same knot are of great friends of mine that the President 
himself when lately at <a href='/results.php?city=louisville' rel='city'>Louisville</a> made a very strong &amp; decided eulogium upon me, and that this circle of friends believe that he wishes me to go into the Treasury. When I told 
him my determination on that head, he concluded with this 
declaration Well I assure you, you can make the Secretary 
"of the Treasury." Now I would not go into the Treasury 
for all the money in it but if I could help to put a good man 
there I would do so. But where is the man ? If in this turmoil 
of Pennsylvania candidates, the President wants to get over 
a difficulty by naming a Penn a man &amp; wishes to name me I will refuse by return mail, and then we can find some competent person. I mention this, that you may understand exactly the footing on which Mr. H and I are . . .

My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I understand, tho at second hand, that a gentleman 
has arrived from Cin 1 who states that he heard the inaugural 
read and that it speaks of the necessity of a national 
Bank, &amp; almost recommends it. You may have heard this 
elsewhere but I mention it that you might be prepared to 
modify it if you think it should be modified. On the whole I 
should think the expediency of announcing that purpose so 
early was questionable. It does not seem to me necessary in 
the inaugural however it may do in the message to the 
new Congress and I should think it might rally at once the 
opposition on topics that might be turned to mischief against 
the new administration before it had time to strengthen itself.

My dear sir, 
</p><p>
In my quiet seclusion I watch with great anxiety the progress of things at Washington and as lookers on at the 
game sometimes see a move which may escape the busy players, I venture to make a suggestion. It is prompted by 
an intense sensitiveness to the present state of the country by my desire to see your administration prosper and more 
especially by the instinctive wish to come to the aid of one [for] whom I have long entertained a sincere personal z regard 
at the moment when he is overcome by numbers. 
</p><p>
It is manifest that your opponents are striving to make you odious as an enemy to the interests protected by the 
Tariff 3 which you are ready to sacrifice in order to gratify your personal dislike to <a href='/results.php?tla=hec' rel='colleague'>Mr Clay</a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=hec' rel='colleague'>Mr Clay's</a> favorite measure. 
</p><p>
Now if I understand your last veto You do not dislike 
the Tariff bill itself &amp; you would have signed it but for its 
connection with the Distribution clause. If this be so, you 
have a chance of striking one of those master strokes which 
decide instantly the fate of the campaigns. It is this : 
</p><p>
To send immediately a message to Congress, urging, in consideration of the exhausted State of the Treasury a revenue bill 
exactly like that vetoed bill word for word, or as near as you can to it without saying anything about the Distribution 
clause. Look at the effect of it. If it succeeds, if your adversaries dare not vote against it it is your triumph your 
measure a popular measure for the country cares only for the Tariff &amp; comparatively little for the Distribution. 
But if it fails if your opponents vote against it, you will have done your duty. . . .

I beg you to listen to the following oracular sentences 
which if they have no other inspiration are dictated by a 
public regard for you &amp; for the Country. 
</p><p>
Do not leave your present position!

If you do, you descend

You can do nothing abroad which you cannot do better

Then if you go who is to take your place?

</p><p>
My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
I wish to make a suggestion to you &amp; as in all cases 
the plainest course is the best, I proceed at once to my purpose. How it may accord with your own views I do not know 
but your conduct in <a href='/results.php?year=1834'>1834</a> has given me a very strong feel 
ing towards yourself &amp; your administration, and it is as the friend of both that I speak. 
</p><p>
The subject most canvassed at present is the retirement 
of <a href='/results.php?tla=web' rel='colleague'>Mr Webster</a> a question of much importance to the 
country &amp; of great interest to yourself. Looking at it in 
both aspects, I have reached these conclusions 
</p><p>
1st as regard's the country 
</p><p>
I take it for granted that there is no fitter man for the place. 
</p><p>
This is settled by acclamation 
</p><p>
His successor must be his inferior 
</p><p>
Now his value lies in being precisely where he is. If he went to England he would be only a single minister now 
he is the instructor of all your ministers. Even in England the strength of his name would be greater as Secretary of 
State giving your instructions to the resident minister in England, than if he were there in person while to all other 
foreign governments that strength would be lost. 
</p><p>
Then 
</p><p>
2. as regards himself, 
</p><p>
You could not find a successor who would be so valuable 
&amp; faithful an assistant to you. 
</p><p>
There is no man sufficiently] prominent to justify his selection who would not be liable to more personal and political 
objections, than he has. Yet he has now but shown them. He 
has run that gauntlet He is seasoned and is acknowledged on all hands to do honor to your choice. Besides 
and this is the great matter for you personally he is the 
Secretary of State and nothing more. He has no political 
party, no body of political adherents. All these he has left for 
you. He has therefore no political aspirations. His strong 
hold on the country is that he can do the duties of the 
Department better than any one else and he will do it. 
He must work cordially with you without any cross purposes or intrigues having no political objects of his own. I 
remember well how my old friend <a href='/results.php?tla=jam' rel='colleague'>Mr. Monroe</a> was annoyed 
by having in his Cabinet three aspirants * for the Presidency. 
</p><p>
I would therefore not let him go from the Department of 
State whether he wishes it or not. 
</p><p>
Yet after all, these may be the thoughts of a retired person who is entirely wrong: for I do not sufficiently under 
stand the personal footing upon which you are &amp; which in truth, must decide the question. But if there be no private 
reasons for your separation, all the public considerations are against it. 
</p><p>
Allow me to request that you will not answer this note. 
It is a subject easy for one to write about not easy for you 
</p><p>
and my purpose is merely to convey the very sincere sentiment of a friend without troubling you with an increase of correspondence.
</p><p>
MEMORANDUM 2 OF BIDDLE TO DANIEL WEBSTER 
</p><p>
<a rel="month origin" value="4">April</a> 	<a rel='day origin' value='5'>5</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1843' rel="origin">1843</a> 
You are going to resign that you think inevitable 
</p><p>
well 
</p><p>
But the matter of resignation is less important than the manner. 
</p><p>
In parting with the President the programme will of course 
be perfectly amiable. Nothing will be visible on either side 
but reciprocal good will and you are hereafter to be the 
object of a friendship much cemented by separation. That 
settled, the next question is what do you retire to? and by 
what route? 
</p><p>
You retire of course to absolute private life. Any thing 
else will be a fall obvious and incurable. 
</p><p>
Then by what route do you retire ? 
</p><p>
If you have any political engagement with any one of the 
candidates, I have no more to say you must of course 
abide his fortunes. 
</p><p>
But if you are entirely uncommitted the three roads of retreat are open the route of <a href='/results.php?tla=jot' rel='colleague'>Mr Tyler</a> the route of the Loco Focos, the route of the Whigs. 
</p><p>
Now I take the route of <a href='/results.php?tla=jot' rel='colleague'>Mr Tyler</a> to be entirely impossible. The moment you leave him, you cease all political sympathy with his administration. 
</p><p>
The route of the Locofocos is equally impracticable. They will never leave their own leaders they will never move 
cordially under the banner of him against whom they have all their lives been fighting. 
</p><p>
There remains only the route of the Whigs. 
</p><p>
Now I have studied that part of the map with less judgment of course but with more impartiality perhaps than you 
have done because your own sensitiveness has made you more alive to the conduct of that party. 
</p><p>
They have had jealousies and heart burnings with regard 
to you they have treated you unkindly &amp; unjustly. Coldness there has been shyness, alienation, soreness at the 
injury done to them by your ceasing to act with them. But 
in my judgment there is no bitterness no wound not easily 
healed and the prevailing sentiment is rather regret &amp; sorrow 
than hostility. 
</p><p>
Believing therefore that you must fix yourself somewhere, 
that seems to be the best place. 
</p><p>
And I have imagined this course 
</p><p>
One of these days and soon before your motives are 
misinterpreted go to some public meeting not apparently made for the purpose, and say 
</p><p>
Six months ago I told you in Fanueil Hall that I was a 
Whig unchangeably. I repeat it now you separated from 
me, not I from you because I staid in power. But I did not 
so, because I thought I could do good. I think I did do good in making the English Treaty * and you agreed that I was right. 
</p><p>
Well, I thought by staying a little longer I could do more 
good. 
</p><p>
I told you so, and tried. 
</p><p>
But I find that I cannot do the good I proposed and therefore I would not remain in place a moment longer than I could serve the country. 
</p><p>
And so I have come back to you. 
</p><p>
I ask nothing I want nothing I take my stand in the ranks of the party willing to work with you, to support our measures, and our men. 
</p><p>
Such a step will be decisive it would be hailed with a shout throughout the country. 
</p><p>
It would make a brilliant retreat it would extricate you from your present awkward position and make your future 
path public &amp; private as smooth as you could desire. 
</p><p>
Think of this 
</p><p>
I offer it because I wish you to know my views before I know yours. 
</p><p>
If you have decided or shall decide otherwise I will bring myself to think it best, but now : 
</p><p>
this line of retreat both in a military &amp; civil aspect is the best in my judgment. 
</p><p>
You would think so too, if you studied the retreats of Lord Wellington in Spain. 
</p><p>
If possible, I would say nothing or what is equivalent to nothing at parting. 
</p><p>
The fear is that you may seem to approve too much of the past which is much to be avoided.

</p><p>
My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Knowing how anxious you are [to] serve the country it strikes me that you might be useful now. 
</p><p>
I look with infinite regret at the prospect of a separation between <a href='/results.php?tla=jot' rel='colleague'>Mr Tyler</a> &amp; <a href='/results.php?tla=web' rel='colleague'>Mr Webster</a>. I think <a href='/results.php?tla=web' rel='colleague'>Mr Webster</a> is not 
disinclined to stay if he were made to stay, &amp; he ought to be made to stay. I believe moreover that all the expectations 
ascribed I trust unjustly to <a href='/results.php?tla=jot' rel='colleague'>Mr Tyler</a> of making the democratic party his party are wholly fallacious. No matter who 
thinks so such a belief will only mislead him. His patronage has not yet made him a single friend. No. He must take his 
own course make his own party of the best men of the country but not seek to win over any existing class of 
politicians. He has before him a noble career if he will make an administration of his own exclusively. But if Mr W. goes 
away I think he will lose the chief strength &amp; the great ornament of his administration. 
</p><p>
He spent 24 hours here last week &amp; r seeing unbroken vigor of his understanding I could not avoid feeling it a 
public misfortune that he should be withdrawn from the public counsels. 
</p><p>
Help to prevent it if you can.

My dear Sir 
</p><p>
When I had the pleasure of seeing you here we conversed about the benefit which might accrue to the Country 
from the union of <a href='/results.php?tla=hec' rel='colleague'>Mr Clay</a> &amp; <a href='/results.php?tla=web' rel='colleague'>Mr Webster</a> &amp; their respective friends so as to ensure their triumphant election &amp; a strong 
&amp; cordial administration of public affairs I continue of the same mind I believe that the thing most desirable now 
would be the nomination of <a href='/results.php?tla=hec' rel='colleague'>Mr Clay</a> for Pres t &amp; <a href='/results.php?tla=web' rel='colleague'>Mr Webster</a> for Vice Pres. &amp; this rather because it would shew both in 
this country &amp; in Europe the cordial union of these two American statesmen in whom the most confidence is placed 
in Europe than because of any adaptation of <a href='/results.php?tla=web' rel='colleague'>Mr Webster</a> for that Station which is one of mere pagent. 
</p><p>
Should however this union be impracticable, the next best thing in my judgment would be that <a href='/results.php?tla=web' rel='colleague'>Mr Webster</a> should be 
wholly unconnected with <a href='/results.php?tla=hec' rel='colleague'>Mr Clay</a>s administration, should not I mean be a member of his Cabinet there is not room 
enough for two such men in so small place. In that event his proper place is the Senate where he would I have no doubt 
go &amp; where he might occupy Mr Choats place. . . .

My dear Sir, 
</p><p>
The impression which I have that the coming administration will be in fact your administration : one which I can 
honorably support &amp; be connected with has revived a project in which I have for some time indulged but which I have 
never mentioned to any one even of my own family. You will therefore receive it in the same confidence in which it is written. 
I have retired as you know from all active affairs : 2 I do not wish to return to them. Whatever share I may have had 
in the war now happily ended by the elevation of my friends, I have no pretensions and shall stand in no man's 
way. It is a great wish of my family to travel in Europe, and I should incline to indulge it. But as you know travelling in 
Europe to a mere private gentleman is a dull business. If a man had a high public station &amp; a higher public fame, as you 
had, he gets along well, but a private gentleman delivering cold letters of introduction &amp; making his way into what is 
called society has a task extremely repugnant to his pride. 
I am too old for that &amp; I am satisfied that the only way of 
being comfortable is to have some public character which 
at once settles your rank &amp; places you above the necessity 
of groping your way. Of these stations some are troublesome 
from the business to be done &amp; from the crowds of country 
men with whom one comes into contact : others give less rank 
but less labor. Now my object being to travel I would not be 
willing to remain in London or Paris or Petersburgh but I 
would prefer some position within striking distance of all the 
places on the continent, which would form the circle of 
travel and on the whole the place which seems best adapted 
for that purpose is Vienna. In regard to fitness, I have nothing to say I began my career as Secretary in Paris &amp; after 
wards in London. I was to have been sent by Mr Madison as Minister to London at the close of the last war, &amp; was not 
sent because I was not a member of Congress the Far I have never made any suggestion about it, I did not know 
even of the design till some years afterwards, &amp; as I should be "able" &amp; able from my own private means to do all the 
external honors of a legation &amp; have already been at Vienna. I think I might be not a very bad successor * to the recent incumbent. That place too happens to be vacant so that 
no one need be removed and it is moreover ought of the sphere of ordinary competition among political men. The 
great interest to be encouraged there is the introduction upon better terms of our own tobacco and this I think I could manage better, perhaps than any mere planter who would carry about him the odour of his "business in this state." 
</p><p>
And now my story is told. I wish to travel &amp; deeming some public character essential I have thought of one which might 
enable me to do some good, &amp; to represent not unworthily the new administration &amp; the new Secretary for foreign affairs 
both of which I suspect have been misrepresented in more sense than one abroad. To my objects position not salary is 
what I desire not so much a place as a passport. Now tell me what you think of all this? Is it a reasonable thing? Is it a probable thing?

their friends in Congress who may thus unite in promoting the object. Here again I rely on your judgment &amp; skill so conspicuously displayed hitherto.
