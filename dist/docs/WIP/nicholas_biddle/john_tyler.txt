Dear Sir, 

I thank you most sincerely for your letter of the 19th . Before it reached me the House of Representatives as you 
have seen by the papers, had passed the Tariff Bill, which I had vetoed without the distribution clause. The Bill is now 
before the Senate, where it may undergo some amendments, in which event the probability is in favour of its passage. 
The suggestion you make had occurred to me, and I was strongly impelled to take the step, but upon informing myself 
with some degree of accuracy of the state of opinion which 
prevailed here, I abandoned it. A violent contest as I learned had arisen between the tariffites and the distributionists, 
which fully manifested itself in the final voting in the House, so that the tariffites were driven to look to the democrats for 
aid, in order to enable them to carry through any measure. The democrats looked to some measure more moderate in 
its provisions than those of the bill, which I had returned to 
the House, and being really anxious to have a good, sound and permanent measure passed, I feared evil rather than 
good. ... I have therefore resolved to rest on my oft repeated recommendations to Congress, and leave it to assume 
all the responsibilities, growing out of and connected with that delicate but important question. . . .
