NICHOLAS BIDDLE 



Preface 



No APOLOGY is necessary in presenting to the public the follow 
ing correspondence of Nicholas Biddle, President of the Second 
Bank of the United States. From 1804 to 1839 he was almost 
constantly engaged in some official capacity with national or 
state administrations; and throughout his whole life, until his 
death in 1844, he was intimately in touch with the leading 
statesmen of the day. These years embrace a most eventful 
epoch in the history of our nation. The purchase of Louisiana, 
the War of 1812, the financial and commercial readjustment 
following the conflict, the establishment of the Second Bank of 
the United States, the organization and development of its 
power, the long struggle with President Jackson, the re-charter 
of the institution by the State of Pennsylvania, the panic of 
1837, the Sub-Treasury and President Van Buren, the appeal 
of Texas for annexation, the whirlwind election of 1840, the 
rupture between Tyler and the Whigs, the Webster-Ashburton 
Treaty, and the preparation for the heated campaign of 1844 
all fall within the scope of Nicholas Biddle s life; and with 
all these movements the great financier was more than an inter 
ested spectator. Not only was he in close communication with 
those in power, but in many instances he was the center of 
operations; and on all occasions he displayed the sterling, stal 
wart qualities which have marked the Biddies of Pennsylvania 
one of the most distinguished families in our land. 

Since their entrance into America, now more than two centu 
ries ago, the Biddies have been active in the service of the coun 
try. Their advent was contemporaneous with that of William 
Penn, for the original ancestor, William Biddle, accompanied 
Penn to the new province. They bore their part in the priva 
tions and aspirations of the early settlers; and in the Revolution 
they gave their best in blood and brains to further the cause of 
democracy. Charles Biddle, the father of Nicholas, was, at the 



Preface 



birth of the latter, Vice-President of the Supreme Executive 
Council of Pennsylvania; Edward Biddle, an uncle, was a rep 
resentative from Pennsylvania in the Continental Congress of 
1774, and later Speaker of the House of Representatives of Penn 
sylvania; Nicholas Biddle, another uncle, distinguished himself 
during the war while commanding the frigate Randolph by at 
tacking a British gunship of double the number of guns and 
losing his life in the cause for which he fought. With such ances 
tors as these, Nicholas Biddle could not help being imbued with 
patriotism, loyalty, and devotion to his native land. His life, 
as illustrated in his correspondence, records his adherence to 
these lofty principles. In the following pages Nicholas Biddle, 
in his own words, relates his participation in the events of his 
period; and the editor has trespassed on the account only with 
such notes as might help the halting memory of the reader in 
uniting the broken links of the narrative. But in view of the 
grave deficiency of an adequate life of this distinguished man 
which the editor hopes to remedy in the near future a short 
sketch of his life and a brief analysis of the salient contributions 
to our historical knowledge disclosed in the ensuing letters, 
seems not inappropriate. 

Nicholas Biddle was born in Philadelphia, January 8, 1786. 
He began his education at the academy, whence he went to the 
University of Pennsylvania. He was about to take his degree 
from the latter institution in 1799, when, owing to his extreme 
youth being then but thirteen years of age he determined 
to enter Princeton. In 1801, after a two-and-a-half-year course, 
he was graduated at the head of his class, dividing the distinc 
tion with Mr. Edward Watts of Virginia. He then commenced 
the study of law, and soon attracted the attention of some of 
the leading men in the land by his diligence and skill. He was 
called from the pursuit of his profession by General Armstrong, 
a friend of the family, when the latter was appointed Minister 
of the United States to France in 1804. In that year, as private 
secretary to the Minister, Nicholas Biddle embarked upon his 
public career. 



Preface 



XI 



From 1804 to 1807, Mr. Biddle was in Europe. As secretary 
to General Armstrong, he was involved in the financial trans 
actions necessitated by the sale of Louisiana; and in this capac 
ity he began to exhibit those phenomenal abilities which later 
marked him as one of the greatest financiers of his age. At the 
conclusion of his service with General Armstrong, he traveled 
extensively in Europe, visiting with particular interest Greece 
and England. In England he met our Minister, James Monroe, 
and there began the friendship between these two which con 
tinued throughout their lives. He returned home in 1807 and 
began the practice of law in Philadelphia. However, his innate 
love for literature could not be quelled, and he occupied his 
spare moments in editing the "Journal of Lewis and Clark," 
writing a great deal for periodicals on various subjects, and 
finally associating himself with Dennie in the editing of the 
Portfolio, one of the landmarks in American literature. Between 
1810 and 1818, he served two terms in the state legislature, 
where he distinguished himself in his advocacy of adequate 
education for Pennsylvania, in behalf of the re-charter of the 
United States Bank, and in military legislation during the War 
of 1812. He was chosen a Government director of the Bank of 
the United States in 1819; in 1822 he was elected President of 
the institution. He continued in this office until 1836, when he 
was elected President of the new corporation organized under 
the laws of Pennsylvania. But until the close of his life, in 1844, 
he took an active interest in current events. 

This brief sketch of Nicholas Biddle s life, however, fails to 
disclose the man or his achievements. Only a close reading of 
his entire correspondence can do this. When one peruses the 
numerous letters from such men as James Monroe, Henry Clay, 
Daniel Webster, John C. Calhoun, Dr. Thomas Cooper, Horace 
Binney, John Tyler, George McDufne, Edward Everett, John 
McLean, Edward Livingston, asking and seeking advice on 
public questions, the manifold activities of the great financier 
begin to appear. Agricultural societies, literary clubs, educators, 
colleges, philanthropists, financiers, and public men besought

Preface 



his assistance and counsel. To all he showed the same courtesy 
and interest while carrying on his business transactions and his 
titanic struggle with President Jackson. From this great mass 
of correspondence the editor has selected only those letters per 
taining to national affairs, and these naturally fall into the 
following groups: those relating to the long bank controversy; 
the re-charter of the bank by the State of Pennsylvania; the 
possibility of Biddle as a Presidential candidate in 1840; the 
panic of 1837 and the Sub-Treasury problem; additional in 
formation on the McCullough versus Maryland case; the elec 
tion of 1840; the framing of Harrison s cabinet; the split be 
tween Tyler and the Whigs; the position of Webster in the 
Tyler cabinet and the reasons for his stand; and the prepara 
tions for the Presidential conflict of 1844. In all these affairs 
Nicholas Biddle was either the center of interest or a close 
observer, and his letters throw much light upon many disputed 
points in connection with these topics. In giving these for the 
first time to the general public, the editor has rigidly adhered 
to their original form, without changing either content or spell 
ing. With reference to punctuation the editor has not of course 
tried to "modernize" it in any way, nor to interfere with it at 
all, except to substitute periods at ends of sentences, where the 
writer has simply placed a stroke. In other places the editor 
has stricken out some superfluous commas when they seemed 
to interfere with the reading of the sentence. But, generally 
speaking, he has done as little as seemed possible. 

In the preparation of this volume the editor desires briefly 
to mention the great assistance he has received from a number 
of persons. First and foremost, he wishes to express his extreme 
gratitude for the courtesy and friendly cooperation at all stages 
of the work of the grandsons of Nicholas Biddle Messrs. 
Edward and Charles Biddle. In 1913, the members of the family 
deposited a large portion of their grandfather s correspondence 
in the Library of Congress. Permission was freely granted the 
editor to cull from this mine of information; and later, at the 
home of Mr. Edward Biddle at Philadelphia, and at the old 



Preface xiii 



homestead at Andalusia, Mr. Charles Biddle rendered invalu 
able aid in placing at his disposal the intimate family collection. 
To both of these gentlemen he takes this opportunity of ac 
knowledging their scholarly and hearty interest in the project. 
The debt which all historical students owe to Mr. Gaillard 
Hunt, chief of the Division of Manuscripts of the Library of 
Congress, and especially to his able and ever-courteous assist 
ant, Mr. John C. Fitzpatrick, for their efficient services, have 
been but increased in the present instance. To his former teacher 
and continual counsellor, Professor William E. Dodd, of the 
University of Chicago, the editor is deeply indebted for reading 
the manuscript and offering many valuable suggestions. His 
former instructors and present associates, Professors Merrick 
Whitcomb and I. J. Cox, by their advice and daily encourage 
ment have added to the heavy obligations which he already 
owes them. The editor s wife at all stages in the preparation of 
this volume has rendered indispensable assistance.

DEALING WITH NATIONAL AFFAIRS 



THE CORRESPONDENCE 
OF NICHOLAS BIDDLE 

BIDDLE TO JAMES MONROE 

London July 6 th 1807 
Dear Sir 

The observations you made in our walk yesterday 
were of so interesting a nature, that I hope you will excuse 
my recurring to the subject of them. About to enter on a 
scene where I may not be permitted long to remain merely a 
spectator, &amp; in which all my success will be influenced by my 
first steps, I feel a natural anxiety to prescribe a course of 
conduct which may become the rule of my political life. The 
violence of party x which disgraces our country is indeed dis 
couraging to one who feels no disposition to become the fol 
lower of any sect, or to mingle political animosities with the 
intercourse of society. But I have sometimes thought that 
the interests of the nation might be advanced without join- 

1 In 1806 James Monroe with Pinkney negotiated a treaty with England; and 
on October 29, 1807, he left England. On his return to America he "drew up an 
elaborate defense of his diplomatic conduct in England in a letter to Madison, 
which covers ten folio pages of the State papers. The enthusiasm with which he 
might have been received immediately after the Louisiana Purchase was damp 
ened by his failure in the English negotiations. Politicians were already discuss 
ing the presidential succession, the Republican party being divided in their 
preferences for Madison and Monroe. Jefferson endeavored to remain neutral; 
Wirt was in favor of Madison; at length the legislature of Virginia settled the 
choice by pronouncing in favor of the latter. Monroe s friends acquiesced. Soon 
afterwards Madison was placed and Monroe, after a brief interval, was reflected 
to the post of governor." Oilman, Daniel C., James Monroe (Boston, 1898), pp. 
105, 106.

ing those who think themselves exclusively its friends, and 
that even the intemperance of party would respect a manly 
independence founded on honor &amp; maintained with firmness 
without descending to adopt the prejudices or to be guided 
by the passions of others. You Sir more than any other char 
acter with whom it has been my happiness to be acquainted 
have passed thro all the stages of political advancement 
honorable for yourself &amp; useful to your country. From you 
therefore I am particularly desirous of receiving advice which 
would be useful to a person who like myself has a profession 
the pursuit of which is a primary object, but who from many 
motives aspires to any political distinction which may be ac 
quired &amp; preserved by honorable means. 

The kindness &amp; confidence with which you have hitherto 
favored me as they are a principle inducement will I trust be 
at the same time the apology for this trouble.

it is so long since I have had the pleasure of hearing 
from you that I take the liberty of asking news of yourself 
&amp; the family. I should indeed before this have acknowledged 
your kind letter, but there is you know a tranquil, one might 
say a happy uniformity which gives to American life but 
little variety of incidents, &amp; it would be superfluous I trust 
to repeat the assurances of my respect &amp; esteem. My young 
friend M r Walsh x whom you may recollect in London has

just returned in the Pacific. With regard to our affairs, he 
left M r Pinkney * under a strong impression that the modifi 
cation of the Orders in Council was all that England meant 
to concede to this country. He had no idea of the more en 
larged arrangement which has been made, or is expected at 
Washington. It seems singular that whilst negociating in 
London the ulterior views of the British government should 
have been concealed from him, &amp; it would be unfortunate 
if in a matter of such consequence there should be any mis 
apprehension. But the declaration of M r Erskine 2 appear[s] 
full &amp; explicit. M r M s observation of the pressure of the 
embargo rather confirms the opinion that we have only 
revealed the dangerous secret of our impotence yet the ex 
periment tho dear may perhaps be valuable, since nations 
like men should learn to estimate their comparative value. 
All England is so much occupied with the Duke of York 3 
that this new war in Austria has attracted very little atten 
tion, &amp; excited no expectation of success. Lord Holland still 
remains in Spain. M r Burr was ordered to leave England, not 
as was stated at the requisition of the Spanish minister but 
from a belief that he was travelling over England for the pur 
pose of collecting information which might render him after 
wards acceptable to the French gov fc . He had been at Edin 
burgh &amp; the gov fc understanding his intention of going to Ire 
land sent orders there to prevent his landing. . . .

ROBERT WALSH TO BIDDLE 

Baltimore July II th 1809 
My Dear Friend 

... I proceeded to our Capitol two days after my ar 
rival here, in order to fulfill my mission &amp; was greeted with 
all the courtesy I could wish. Fortunately the House had not 
terminated its sittings &amp; accordingly afforded me an oppor 
tunity of forming some judgment of its character. I attended 
two long debates &amp; could [have] desired to have you at my 
side at the time. Never most assuredly was there exhibited a 
more disgusting caricature of legislation. I did not expect to 
find much wisdom among them, but was truly surprised to dis 
cover that the affairs of any nation could by any possibility 
be managed by men such as the members of the House of 
Representatives. I had several meetings with the President 
and Secretary of State * &amp; saw much reason to be satisfied 
with the intentions of both. I can not venture to give an opin 
ion as to their talents. In my conferences with the Presi 
dent, I discovered a feeling towards England much more 
conciliatory than his former policies entitled me to expect. 

ROBERT WALSH TO BIDDLE

My Dear Biddle 

... I had some conversation with M r Erskine on his 
way to your city; but not on his return to Washington. As I 
never entertained a doubt concerning the fate of his arrange 
ments, I was not a little surprized at the satisfaction and con 
fidence which he manifested on that subject. If our admin-

istration were admitted to a view of his instructions, they 
must have foreseen the result &amp; were in my opinion highly 
censurable for acquiescing in so extraordinary an assumption 
of authority on the part of the Minister. M r Madison, to 
whom I communicated my apprehensions, seemed perfectly 
sure of the validity of the whole negociation. There must be 
still some lurking fallacy in this business I confess that the 
whole is a mystery to me. Whoever has been in England or 
has attended to the management of affairs in that country, 
must at once see the impossibility of a collusion between the 
ministry &amp; their envoy or of perfidy in the former. Neither 
could escape the sagacity of the opposition &amp; no ministry 
could expect to weather the storm which the exposure of so 
detestable a fraud would collect over their heads. It may, 
moreover, be easily shewn, that no views whatever of public 
or private utility could be answered by such a proceeding; or 
could have been in the contemplation of sensible men. I re 
gret, therefore, that any federalist should countenance an 
idea every way unjust and eminently injurious to the good 
cause among ourselves.

think be improper to suffer our squadron to sail for the Medi- 
teranean or to disband our army, untill we saw more distinctly 
what were likely to be the consequences of those events, es 
pecially as to the U States. It is probable, or rather certain, 
that Boniparte will claim to the Rhine; and that will produce 
a war with England, if she can form such a combination of 
force as promises to make head against him. If Austria is on 
his side I should not be surprised if there should be a general 
acquiescence in his restoration, provided all France is in his 
favor(?), as circumstances indicate. The British nation must 
be fatigued with the war in Europe, with that with the U 
States, and its disasterous termination at N. Orl: Their 
finances are embarrassed. Repose has been caught at with 
avidity, and the mortification must be extreme when it is 
seen that the prospect of it is snatched from them, and that a 
new struggle is to be encountered, more burthensome perhaps 
than that through which they have already passed, to place 
them at the point at which they lately stood, if it is (?) even 
practicable. It is equally doubtful, whether, as Russia may 
have relinquished her claims on Poland, she can be brought 
to bear on France, and without her aid, the attempt of Eng 
land &amp; Prussia would be a desperate one. I think it is not im 
probable that Spain will be neutralized, by events at home.

against that gov*., and against that movement. The restora 
tion of Bonaparte by the will of the nation, operating as 
it were by free suffrage, will revive revolutionary feelings in 
France, which may extend to Spain, under the existing cir 
cumstances there. If however Bonaparte takes to the Rhine, 
&amp; Egld declares war, she may strike at us as in the former 
wars. This is the moment when we may fix our entring in 
such a struggle, sho d . it occur; for on the part which we now 
act, it may depend, whether we shall [have] pass d successfully

of their contempt. . . .

My dear Nicholas, 

Your letter of the 20. inst. for which, permit me to 
thank you, was rec d . yesterday. I shall avail myself of your 
kind intimations respecting the letters, and forward them 
to you by the first private hand. 

I cannot but exceedingly regret the failure of your bill for 
an immediate levy of a regular State force, satisfied, as I am, 
of the insufficiency of any scheme by voluntary enlistment, of 
obtaining the men (independent of their proper organization, 
and discipline fit for service) before the middle of the ensuing 
summer, if even by that time. My opinion is formed from 

1 Clement C. Biddle, a cousin of Nicholas Biddle and a son of Clement Biddle 
of Revolutionary fame. Commanded the Pennsylvania Regiment of Light Infan 
try Volunteers in 1812-1814, afterwards distinguished in civil life.

my own experience in the recruiting service, when we were 
abundantly supplied with funds, and from conversations 
which I have recently had with the officer (col. Clemson) 
now superintending that service in this district. 

From a perusal of the Bill, which is now before you, the 
following objections objections have presented themselves 
to me. Sect. I st Line 4 th . In lieu of a Regiment say a Battalion 
of Artillery, which will conform to the organization of the 
U.S. Artillery: they having no Regiments, but twelve Bat 
talions of four companies each, commanded by a Lieut. Col. 
or Major. This will give a large proportion of Artillery for 
four Reg ts . of Infantry, viz. one tenth of the Inf^. General 
Scott says one twentieth is sufficient. Sect. 2 d . line 6 th after the 
organization of a Reg*, let that of the Battalion of Artillery 
come according to the U.S. viz. Four Companies Field 
of Staff, i Lieut. Col. i Adjut. I Quarter Master, i Pay 
Master, the Surgeon, the surgeon s mate, I Sergeant Major, 
i Quarter Master Sergeant and 2 Principal musicians. Line 
9 th . The U.S. organization of a Company of Artillery is much 
better than that of the Bill : it is I captain, i first Lieut. 2 
second lieut s (one of which is Conductor oj Military Stores, 
and has charge, and is responsible, for the ordnance &amp;c &amp;c.) 
I third lieut. i quarter master sergeant, 5 sergeants, 8 cor- 
porals, 4 musicians and 100 privates. Line II th . The number 
of Non Commissioned officers and privates of a company of 
Riflemen should be the same as that of Infantry. It is in the 
U.S. service the five officers are quite sufficient for the com 
mand of ninety men, and a company, which when full had but 
sixty eight men, w d not generally have in the field above forty, 
which are too few, particularly where there are so many com 
pany officers. There is an additional reason for increasing the

1 1 



strength of the Rifle corps, to wit, in the French and most of 
the European services, the Tiraileurs or Light Infantry bear 
to the Infantry of the Line, at least the proportion of one to 
three, whereas even after this augmentation, they w d in this 
Bill only bear the proportion of one to four, and without it of 
one to six, only half that of the French, when our Coun 
try requires a greater proportion. Sect. 3 Line 5 th . In order 
to make this enumeration complete Brigade Majors sh d be 
added, and besides Assistants and Deputies, there sh d be As 
sistant Deputies, there being officers with that title in the 
U.S. service. This section seems to imply that in the U.S. 
service the Adjutant &amp; Inspector Generals must be taken 
from the line of officers, which is not the case, and they are 
frequently taken from Citizens, as in the cases of Col 3 . 
Duane, Drayton, Powell &amp; others. The U.S. regulations re 
quire their Assistants to be taken from the line of officers. 
Also in the Quarter Master s Department in the U.S. service, 
none of the officers can be taken from the line of officers. Ac 
cording to the U.S. regulations Six Regiments should make 
three Brigades. 

Should there not be an additional section giving the officers 
rank over all officers of the militia and Volunteers of the same 
grade ? 

It may be observed that wherever this Bill differs from the 
organization of the U.S. army as to the number of officers, 
non-commissioned officers and privates in a Reg* or comp y 
it is defective, as great attention has been paid to that subject 
in the U.S. service, and many alterations made before the 
present organization was adopted. 

In lieu of the six companies of artillery which it is proposed 
to strike out, let there be jour troops of Dragoons, formed

into a Squadron under a major, organized as in the U.S. serv 
ice, which will then complete the formation of a "Legion," 
which this Bill contemplates. A Small corps of Cavalry will 
be much wanted.

are drawn up, &amp; beleive me with perfect esteem &amp; regard

My dear sir, 

I have received by this day s mail your letter of the 
29 th announcing your having nominated me one of the Direc 
tors of the Bank of the U.S. I need not say that I consider 
this rememberance a proof of that uniform kindness &amp; friend 
ship on your part which I value so highly, and as such I beg 
you to accept my thanks for it. I have however little con 
cern with Banks &amp; have hitherto declined sharing in the man 
agement of the institution when it was proposed to me by the 
stockholders. Yet I am unwilling to avoid any duty by which 
you think I can be of service. 

The truth is, that with all its faults, the Bank is of vital 
importance to the finances of the gov* and an object of great 
interest to the community. That it has been perverted to 
selfish purposes cannot be doubted that it may &amp; must 
be renovated is equally certain. But they who undertake 
to reform abuses &amp; particularly of that description, must en 
counter much hostility &amp; submit to much labor. To these, the 
hope of being useful can alone reconcile me and if I should 
undertake the task I shall endeavor to persevere till the 
character of the institution is reestablished.

BIDDLE TO JAMES MONROE 

Andalusia October 8. 1820. 
My dear Sir, 

You will I am sure feel some interest in the inclosed 
paper which I have thought it advisable to publish in order 
to correct some deeply rooted prejudices against some of the 
measures of the last war. Having never taken any formal no 
tice of them till now, I believed that after so long a time it 
was right to state distinctly what it was I had really done, to 
excite the violence of that period. As far as I can learn, its ef 
fect upon fair &amp; liberal minds has been such as I could wish. 
Nevertheless it will not contribute at all to my election 
which will be decided by very different considerations. Ac 
cording to the unfortunate system of nomination prevailing 
here, it is always in the power of a cabal to take from the 
people all share in the real business of an election. Thus for 
instance I was originally nominated by both sections of the 
Republican party by a Committee of the friends of M r 
Findlay &amp; a Committee of the friends of M r Heister. But the 



To James Monroe 1 5 

latter were so anxious to secure his election, that finding the 
federalists unwilling [to] vote for their candidate M r Heister 
unless M r Heister s friends in return would vote for the federal 
members of Congress, they reassembled &amp; in order to secure 
the federal votes for M r Heister gave up their Congress ticket 
altho it had been formally agreed upon &amp; published. My sup 
port therefore will be from one section only of the republicans 
the other at the head of whom is Duane opposing my elec 
tion, not as he himself avowed to a friend of mine from any 
personal hostility to me, but because I was well disposed to 
the administration of the general gov*. Another very efficient 
motive with that individual is that my nomination excluded 
his own son. Such are the springs which move our election. 
The district is in truth a perfect chaos of small factions &amp; as 
I have shunned all participation in their intrigues I do not 
anticipate the slightest chance of being elected. The only 
object of any importance is to rally the sound part of the 
population against the decided hostility to the general gov* 
which animates some of the demagogues &amp; that I think 
can be accomplished. Will you present my best respects to 
M rs Monroe . . . 

The opposition is formed of a union of the federalists with 
the friends of M r Heister. The latter consist of two divisions, 
one willing to sacrifice every thing for M r Heister, the other 
at the head of whom is Duane, in addition to the same motive 
are stimulated by the pleasure of opposing one whom they 
know to be friendly to the administration of the general gov*. 
This reason is distinctly avowed by their leader who at the 
same time professes to have no personal hostility to me. Such 
are the secret springs which will control the election. 



6 Correspondence of Nicholas Biddle 



To the Electors of the City and County of Philadelphia, 
and the County of Delaware. 

I understand that many estimable persons among you, re 
tain unkind feelings toward me from a belief that during the 
late war, I proposed to establish in Pennsylvania the French 
system of military conscription. This reproach was widely 
circulated at that period. But I was then too anxious about 
the defence of the country, to care about defending myself, 
and I therefore never in any way noticed it, presuming that 
when the violence of party passions should subside, men 
would return to more just and liberal sentiments. I should 
still persevere in the same silence, but I think it due to those 
gentlemen, who have done me the honor to connect my name 
with the approaching election for members of congress, to 
remove an impression which may be injurious. If then it be 
true, that there is any individual, who forgetting the dan 
gers of the war, remembers only its prejudices, he will perhaps 
find in the following statement, some reason to think that he 
has been unjust to me. 

The assertion is, that I proposed to introduce the French 
system of conscription. 

The fact is, that I never proposed any thing resembling the 
French conscription; that what I did propose, was a system 
practised in Pennsylvania, long before the French conscrip 
tion was in existence; and that the very design and effect 
of it was to avoid a conscription, that is a militia draft which 
is in principle, very nearly the same mode of levying troops. 

A few words will make this evident. The French system of 
conscription is this. All the men between twenty and twenty- 
five years of age, are divided into classes. When a class is 



70 James Monroe 1 7 

called into service, each man of the class must find a sub 
stitute or march, or what to the mass of the citizens is 
precisely the same thing, pay sixteen dollars a month. The 
nature of the two services is of course different, from the 
peculiar circumstances, and the different forms of government 
in the two countries; but as mere modes of military levy 
they are evidently similar. 

Now what I have proposed was this. Every twenty-two 
men above eighteen years of age, were to furnish a soldier to 
serve for the defence of the state, during twelve months. If 
they did not, the proper officer was to provide one, and di 
vide the expense among the twenty-two. But before doing 
this, such of the twenty-two as were liable to military duty 
drew lots. If the person on whom the lot fell consented to 
serve, he received a contribution of two hundred dollars from 
his neighbors. If he did not, the price of a substitute should 
exceed two hundred dollars, he was to pay the excess, which 
was limited to two hundred dollars more. 

All this might be a good or a bad system, but one thing at 
least is clear, that it is totally unlike the French system, and 
much less like the French conscription than our own militia 
law, which it was intended to supercede. 

But in fact, the mode of raising a military force at that 
time, was not a question of general policy, but of immediate 
expediency not how to frame a permanent system, but how 
to provide against a sudden emergency. It was necessary to 
raise within ten weeks, that is between the middle of Janu 
ary, before which no law could pass, and the month of April, 
when Philadelphia might be assailed, an adequate force for 
its protection. To procure these troops by voluntary enlist 
ments, was utterly hopeless; for the United States army had, 



1 8 Correspondence of Nicholas Bid die 

during more than two years, gleaned every idler in the state; 
and even had there been time, the commonwealth had neither 
land to promise, nor bounty money to pay to recruits. To rely 
exclusively on occasional drafts of militia, hastily levied at 
every fresh alarm, was to entrust the fate of the city to a sys 
tem the most oppressive to the citizen, the most expensive 
to the community, and the least efficient against the enemy. 
Believing then the voluntary enlistment too slow and too 
dear, and the militia draft too weak and too burdensome, 
I proposed that which promised to be at once prompt, equal, 
and efficient. I thought then, and I think still, that it had 
many decided advantages over the other plans. The first, 
and the most important was, that by it, and by it alone could 
nine thousand well officered men be brought into the field in 
six weeks, without any demand on the state treasury the 
second was, that being chiefly composed of substitutes who 
would probably reinlist, the force could be retained as long as 
it should be wanted the third was, that it was much more 
favourable to the poorer citizens, than the militia law. By that 
law, if a militia man leaves home, neither he nor his family 
receive any indemnity; and if he stays at home, he pays for 
a years delinquency, one hundred and ninety-two dollars. 
By the proposed bill, if he left home he received two hundred 
dollars; if he staid at home he paid, except in an extraordinary 
case, only the twenty-second part of the price of a substitute. 
Instead moreover of being a dangerous novelty, it had all 
the merit of successful experience. It was an old Pennsyl 
vania plan. In the year 1780, a law passed dividing the people 
into classes, each of which was to furnish a man to serve in 
the army of the United States during the war, and a delin 
quent class was to pay fifteen pounds specie or current money, 



To James Monroe 1 9 

equivalent, which was one thousand one hundred and twenty- 
five pounds currency. 

A second act, passed in 1781, by which, if a class was de 
linquent, a substitute was to be procured without limitation 
of price, at the expense of the class. 

A comparison of the levy of 1780, with that of 1815, will 
show how little reason Philadelphia would have had to com 
plain of the latter. By the law of 1780, the city and county 
of Philadelphia was bound to furnish eight hundred and 
ninety-five men, to serve in the United States army during 
the war. By the proposed law, the city and county, with per 
haps three times the population, and twenty times the wealth 
of 1780, would have been bound to furnish, for its own exclu 
sive defence during one year, about one thousand, or eleven 
hundred men. 

Let me now ask any fair and candid man, in what part of 
this proposed measure is there any thing unjust or oppressive 
any thing which violates the rights, or wounds the interests 
of a single individual if it be not milder than the militia 
law more practicable than an enlistment system and 
unless the city was prepared to submit quietly to shame and 
pillage, what mode of organizing resistance could be more im 
mediate, energetic and just? But supposing it not to be the 
best plan, supposing it to be a wrong plan. That would be 
a fit reason for preferring some other, but it surely is not a 
fair subject of reproach against the proposer, who could not 
possibly have had any personal or selfish motive, and who, if 
he erred, could have been mislead only by mistaken zeal. So 
unwilling indeed was I, that any mere pride of opinion on my 
part should interfere with the public service, that I at the 
same time, supported and voted for an enlistment bill, under 



20 Correspondence of Nicholas Bid die 

an impression that the few who could be raised by it, would 
be at least so much gained for our defence and when my 
own proposal was lost in the house of representatives, was 
one of a committee who immediately proposed a bill for 
raising volunteers, on which the senate were engaged the 
day when peace was announced. 

I proposed and supported these measures from a con 
viction, that the state of the country demanded a vigorous 
effort to save it, and I should have consented to any thing 
which would call forth its resources without being very fas 
tidious as to forms. And truly if eight thousand men were 
willing to come from the interior to our assistance, it did 
seem to be a matter of utter insignificance to the citizens 
of Philadelphia, whether they came out of classes of twenty- 
two, or classes of any other number. That they came at 
all that they came well armed well officered and well 
paid might, I think, have satisfied the most scrupulous, 
and furnished an apology at least for the system which 
brought them. 

I have now finished the original purpose of this note, but 
the subject induces me to add a few words on the general 
measures of that time. 

In the autumn of 1814, I was elected to represent this 
district in the senate. You all remember the condition of 
the country. Washington had been taken Baltimore at 
tacked a large British fleet and army were on the coast, 
able suddenly to strike any assailable point. Against this 
danger, Philadelphia was totally unprepared. She relied on 
the general government, until the failure of the military 
proposals in congress announced to the states, that they 
must provide for their own safety. From that moment it

became my duty to secure the means of defending the capi 
tal. It was manifest that unless a force could be collected 
before the navigation of the Delaware opened, Philadel 
phia was at the mercy of the enemy. We wanted then a 
naval defence we wanted a stationary land force, in 
aid of the militia we wanted arms we wanted money. 
That none of these were neglected, will be seen by the legis 
lative journals of that day, which I cite, because they offer 
a simple and unquestionable statement of facts. 

Extract the Senate Journal, 1814-15, p. 104. January 
4th, 1815. 

"A motion was made by Mr. Biddle and Mr. Lowrie, and 
read as follows. Resolved, that a committee be appointed 
to inquire into the expediency of raising by drafts from the 
militia, a corps of eight thousand men, to serve during 
twelve months for the defence of Pennsylvania and the 
adjoining states, with leave to report by bill or otherwise. 
Resolved, that the same committee be instructed to in 
quire into the expediency of procuring one or more steam 
frigates, steam batteries, or other means of defence for the 
protection of the shores of Delaware, with leave to report 
by bill or otherwise. Resolved, that the same committee be 
instructed to inquire into the expediency of borrowing a 
sum not exceeding one million of dollars, to be employed 
solely for the defence of this state with leave to report 
by bill or otherwise. 

"On motion, said resolutions were severally read, con 
sidered, and adopted, and ordered that Mr. Biddle, Mr. 
Lowrie, Mr. Forster, Mr. Frailey and Mr. Beale, be a com 
mittee for the purpose expressed in said resolutions."

22 Correspondence of Nicholas Biddle 

"Mr. Biddle from the committee appointed for the pur 
pose on the fourth instant, reported an act to raise a mili 
tary force for the defence of this commonwealth." This 
passed the senate on the I4th of January. 

On the I3th January Page 128. 

"Mr. Biddle from the committee appointed for the pur 
pose on the fourth instant reported a bill entitled an act 
to authorize a loan of one million of dollars, for the defence 
of this commonwealth." The loan was to be at seven per 
cent, and to be applied exclusively "to defray any expenses 
which may be incurred in military or naval preparations 
for the defence of this commonwealth." 

On investigation it appeared that the steam frigates 
could not be built in time, and that the approach to the 
city might be adequately defended, by strengthening the 
United States flotilla in the Delaware. It consisted of 
twenty-seven boats and vessels, but such was the desperate 
state of the recruiting service, that this armament had only 
about one fifth of its complement; and a large part of its 
crew were to be discharged in April. The commander was 
requested to state distinctly, what number of men would 
render his flotilla perfectly efficient, and what bounties 
would procure them. He did so, but, that in a service so 
important nothing should be left to hazard, the number of 
men as well as the bounties, were increased beyond his esti 
mates. 
Accordingly, January 25th, 1815: 

"Mr. Biddle read in his place, and on permission pre 
sented to the chair a bill, entitled An act granting addi 
tional emoluments to seamen, employed in the defence of 
this commonwealth. " This bill passed February ist.

Of arms the state possessed enough to equip the new 
levies, (Senate Journal, p. 21,) but that every thing which 
promised to be useful, might be pressed into the public 
service. 

"On motion of Mr. Biddle and Mr. Graham, the follow 
ing resolution was twice read, considered, and adopted. Re 
solved, That a committee be appointed to inquire into the 
nature and advantages of Chamber s repeating guns, and 
the expediency of employing them in the service of the 
state." Senate Journal, p. 46. 

Page 67. "Mr. Biddle, from the committee appointed 
on the 1 5th, to inquire into the nature and advantages of 
Chamber s repeating guns, made report as follows," &amp;c. 
&amp;c. Concluding with a resolution to purchase fifty swivels, 
and to have five hundred muskets altered to the new plan. 

These documents prove that, within a few days after 
the duty of protecting the capital, devolved on the legis 
lature, an efficient system of defence was proposed and 
passed in the Senate; a system, which before the month of 
April, would have placed between Philadelphia and its en 
emy, a strong flotilla, capable of being speedily reinforced, 
by all the naval resources of the city; and a well officered 
army in aid of the local militia; a system, which would 
have shielded the city from all danger and all alarm during 
the war. 

Of the energy and patriotism of those gentlemen, from 
the interior, who co-operated with me, and who, although 
remote from the capital, readily and zealously took their 
share in its defence, I can never speak nor feel too warmly. 
Nor did I permit myself to question the motives of those 
who opposed any of these measures. I knew them too well, 



24 Correspondence of Nicholas Bid die 

not to ascribe their opposition to a fair and honourable 
difference of opinion. But I also had some right to a liberal 
construction of my own views. In executing the duties as 
signed to me, I had endeavoured to do what was useful, not 
what was agreeable; and never having sought to please, 
not to have pleased, would have been a subject neither of 
surprise, nor mortification. But I could not easily antici 
pate, that after a laborious and anxious struggle to pro 
vide for the defence of my own native city against foreign 
enemies, after securing the aid of patriotic men from the 
country, willing to partake in the expense and the dangers 
of that defence, I should become an object of denunciation 
in that very city; should have been put under a sort of 
political proscription, avowedly for my activity in striving 
to protect it. 

There was about the same time another measure, to 
which from my share in it, it may be well to advert. When 
Massachusetts and Connecticut proposed to Pennsylvania, 
the changes in the constitution, originally projected at 
the convention of Hartford, 1 it appeared to me after very 
deliberate examination that their inevitable effect would 
be to loosen the whole structure of the confederation, and 
that they were therefore more dangerous to the country 
than the foreign armies which threatened it. The discussion 
of these proposals had in every quarter, inflamed to their 
utmost violence the feelings of the community. I thought 
then that Pennsylvania, neutral in its position, yet em 
bracing nearly all the interests on which these changes

would operate, might usefully interpose its calm strength 
between the passions of its neighbours, and by a course of 
mingled decision and gentleness, reclaim them to milder 
feelings towards each other. The report on the amendments 
was hastily drawn in the midst of other occupations, and 
much of it written on the road to Harrisburgh. It of course 
has no pretension as to form. But if my recollection does 
not deceive me, its general tone was fair and impartial, 
it imputed no unworthy motives, it contained no phrase 
which could wound even any member of that convention, 
it discussed the proposals with candor, nor was there the 
slightest departure from that courtesy, which among in 
dependent states, is at once the proof and the security of 
mutual respect. Yet this paper it seems has been the sub 
ject or the pretext of much censure upon its author. 

Of all these things I have never complained. I do not 
now complain. Their singularity has much oftener tempted 
me to smile at finding myself reproached not by the men 
of the country, for calling them from their homes, but 
by the men of the city, because in suddenly raising nine 
thousand soldiers for its defence, I had been guilty of ar 
ranging them into classes of twenty-two. It is right how 
ever, to say that if during the war I persevered in these 
measures in opposition to prejudices, which I saw were 
estranging from me many honest and amiable citizens, and 
if I have suffered nearly six years to pass without any effort 
to remove them, my silence has proceeded rather from a 
disregard of what was merely personal to myself, than from 
any insensibility to the good will of the community. I do 
not feel and I will not affect any such indifference. I have 
lived long enough to know that the kindly feelings of those 



26 Correspondence of Nicholas Bid die 

who surround us, are among our best and safest enjoyments. 
But even that good will may be too dearly purchased, and 
I am quite sure that the applause of others, could never 
console me for the loss of my own esteem. That I should 
have forfeited irretrievably, if at a season of great national 
disaster, when not merely the safety, but the honor of the 
state was menaced, when all the free institutions of this 
country were rocking to their foundations, I should from 
any spirit of faction, or the despicable dread of being what 
is called unpopular, have shrunk from any one duty of the 
station in which your confidence had placed me. 1

And a . Oct r . 29. 1822 
Dear Sir, 

I have received your letter of the 26 th inst. in rela 
tion to the Presidency of the Bank, and shall cheerfully 
give as you request such views of the subject as my service 
in the Bank &amp; my acquaintance with the community may 
suggest. 

If the Bank were in a prosperous situation with an effi 
cient Direction &amp; a full complement of experienced officers 
the President might, be as so many Presidents, are, a gentle 
man of high character to do the honors -of the Bank with-

Rise of American Nationality (New York, 1907), pp. 161-166. 

2 This letter, although it has no definite address, is undoubtedly written to 
one of the directors of the Bank. The Biddle Correspondence contains a number 
of letters from different members of the board urging Biddle to present his views 
on the qualifications of a President and subtly hinted the desirability of his ap 
pearing as a candidate; and it is evidently in reply to one of these requests that 
the above letter was drafted.

out much attention to its business. But you well know that 
the Bank of the U.S. is deficient in these respects and the 
next President must have such a decided influence over 
its management as very materially to affect its future for 
tunes. He should if possible therefore unite in his person 
these qualifications, talent for business standing with 
the gov*. &amp; residence in Phil a . 

1st. I say talent for business rather than what is commonly 
called a man of business for without meaning at all to 
disparage the knowledge of details which men of business 
are presumed to possess I am quite satisfied from what I 
have myself seen at the Bank that the mere men of busi 
ness are by no means the most efficient in the administra 
tion. The fact is that the misfortunes of the Bank which 
grew principally out of the injudicious extension of the 
Western Branches 1 were actually occasioned by the men of 
business &amp; their errors were precisely the faults into which 
the men of business were most likely to fall. They trusted 
the Western people with money as they trusted them 
with goods and suffered themselves to be deluded by 
the visions &amp; currencies of equalizing exchanges more &amp; 
liberal habits of thinking would have easily dispelled be 
cause without intending reflections, there are not in the 
Bank such a set of officers as there should be &amp; the 
personal inspection of a President is therefore the more 
necessary. 

2. He should be known to, &amp; stand well with the Gov fc 
not an active partizan not even a party man but a 
man in whom the gov 4 would confide. I am far from think- 

1 On the administration of Langdon Cheves, cf. Catterall, R. C. H., The 
Second Bank of the United States (1903), chap. in. 



28 Correspondence of Nicholas Bid die 

ing that the gov 1 should have any direct or indirect influence 
over the Bank on the contrary the less of it which exists 
the better for both. But the gov 4 is a great stockholder and 
a great customer and as the gov* Directors cannot exer 
cise the same degree of concert &amp; previous communication 
as the rest of the Directors stockholders do. It would be 
not unwise to consult to a certain extent the feelings of the 
gov* where the great interests of the Bank may depend so 
much on its countenance &amp; protection. 
3. His being a Philadelphian tho not an essential is yet 
a desirable circumstance. The Bank has by a combination 
of circumstances become so odious in Phil a ., that it is ex 
ceedingly difficult as you well know to procure a competent 
Direction. There are certainly all the materials of an excel 
lent Board, if they would consent to rally round any one 
individual and the character of the Bank will wholly 
depend on the local Board, the Distant Directors are in 
fact from the very nature of things rather ornamental than 
useful. Now I fear that a stranger would not easily obtain 
the aid of such a Board as ought to be collected. If yet such 
is the importance of that circumstance that I am not sure 
whether the wisest plan would not be first to make a list of 
20 Directors &amp; the best names of the City &amp; then see under 
what President 15 or 1 6 of them would consent to serve 
and name him accordingly. . . .

esteem. 

BIDDLE TO JOHN C. CALHOUN 

Phil a . Dec 1 6, 1822 
Dear Sir, 

I had the pleasure last night of receiving your letter 
of the 2 d inst, thank you with great cordiality for the 
friendly dispositions which dictated it. The course which 
I have hitherto prescribed to myself, has been neither to 
seek nor to shun a situation of so much responsibility, but 
if I am called to share in the administration of the Bank, 
I shall bring to its service at least a laborious &amp; zealous de 
votion to its interests. This unfortunate institution has 
from its birth been condemned to struggle with the most 
perplexing difficulties, yet even with all its embarrassments 
it has sustained the national currency &amp; rescued the coun 
try from the dominition of irresponsible banks, &amp; their 
depreciated circulation. The time has perhaps arrived when 
it may combine its own &amp; the country s security with a more 
enlarged development of its resources and a wider extension 
of its sphere of usefulness. To this object to which my own 
exertions shall be anxiously directed. I have long known and 
appreciated the manly &amp; decisive services which you have 
rendered to the same cause &amp; if I should see any occa-

shall ask it with the same frankness &amp; sincerity with which 
I now assure you of the great personal respect &amp; esteem of

Feb. 3, 1823 
Sir, 

Your letter of the 2 d . inst: has just reached me. Our 
mutual friend M r . Colt 2 has already apprized me of the 
advantage which I might expect from your confidential 
communication, &amp; your letter satisfies me that he has not 
overrated the value of them. I beg you to believe that I shall 
always be gratified at hearing from you whenever any thing 
occurs which you deem interesting and that I am perfectly 
prepared always to reciprocate your confidence. 

It is my anxious desire to see your Office at the head of 
the business of N. York, and for that purpose not to suffer 
itself to be encumbered with state Bank balances, nor with 
more debts from Southern Offices than necessarily grow 
out of the receipt of their paper and a profitable and ac 
commodating exchange business. The practice here is this. 
Every morning the Clerks from this Bank and the State 
Banks meet and inter change the notes received respec 
tively on the preceeding day. The Balances are Struct ac 
cordingly but no Bank ever calculates on its Balance

Colt was undoubtedly the closest financial adviser of Biddle and one to whom the 
latter always referred in time of trouble. He was in touch with all the financial 
conditions of the country and the correspondence shows that Nicholas Biddle 
frequently followed his advice on political as well as financial affairs.

remaining for any length of time &amp; whenever it grows a 
little too large, no Bank ever hesitates to send for ten or 
fifteen or twenty thousand dollars from its debtor. We had 
the other day a draft for $25,000 from one of our City 
Banks which was paid as cheerfully &amp; with as little sensa 
tion as if it had been a check for $25. Whenever there is a 
draft from an individual for Specie to any amount the State 
Banks are made to pay it if their Balances allow it. Thus it 
goes round no one complains and every one is Satisfied. 
In truth, it is only when these balances accumulate &amp; re 
main for any length of time that they become oppressive to 
both parties and excite mutual ill will. You have now a fine 
oportunity of establishing and maintaining your preemi 
nence and I hope anxiously that it will not be lost. The other 
subjects of your letter will receive an early attention, but 
my occupations this morning allow me time only to acknowl 
edge the receipt of it thus briefly &amp; to add that I am

Sir,

Bank is this. We have had enough &amp; more than enough of 
banking in the interior. We have been crippled &amp; almost 
destroyed by it. It is time to concenter our business to 
bank where there is some use &amp; some profit in it, and there

ment there is clear prospect of doing it usefully &amp; safely) 
to make at present the large commercial Cities the principal 
scene of our operations. With this impression my object is 
to give to the Office at New York the command of the busi 
ness of N. York to make it the first banking institution 
there. To this it is entitled from its Capital its resources, 
and the character of its Direction. But it never can have the 
power which it ought to possess, if it suffers itself to be 
crowded out of its proper sphere by the State Banks &amp; 
to be constantly preyed upon by them. It would be de 
sirable too that it should keep its means as much as pos 
sible to itself except what may be necessary for profit 
able exchange operations, &amp; as far as possible avoid having 
large balances from Southern Offices. . . .

My Dear Sir 

The frequent experience which we have had of your 
liberality and your attachment to the interest of the Bank, 
has induced us to take a liberty which I persuade myself 
you will not disapprove. Since the Presidency of the Office 
at Boston has passed out of the political family where it has 
been so long, there has been a feeling of disquiet at the cir 
cumstance, increased by the political cast of a great ma 
jority of the Board. These are considerations, which situ 
ated as we are we cannot wholly overlook, that they shall 
never be permitted to interfere with more important mat 
ters. Still in the effort to attract towards the Bank the good

wishes of the country at large it is desirable whenever a 
safe opportunity presents itself, of assuaging feelings which 
may hereafter grow into hostility, to take advantage of it. 
During the present year our two directors from your state 
are both of the same political denomination and as the 
President of the Office is now of that section also it is 
thought well to give to their political opponents, if indeed 
they can be so called, a larger share in the administration. 
This we have done by substituting M r Crowninshield, 1 
for M r . Mason. 2 To the latter s gentleman his seat at this 
Board is I presume an object of indifference, as his high stand 
ing and character place him beyond the reach of wishing a 
mere compliment, and his occupations prevent his personal 
attendance. M r Crowninshield is a gentleman of character, 
a large Stockholder, and he will now visit us necessarily 
twice a year. Under these circumstances, Gen 1 Cadwal- 
ader 3 and myself have thought it was for the interest of 
the Bank to make the change, and we have relied on the 
good feelings of yourself and M r Mason to understand, and 
appreciate our motives. To that gentleman, whom I have 
not the pleasure of knowing personally, I trust you will be 
good enough to explain the reasons of this change, which in

Phila. March 15, 1825 
My dear Sir, 

I have just received your favor of the I4th inst. and 
regret much that it will not be in my power to negotiate 
the note you have forwarded, which is therefore returned 
to you herewith. Since my connection with the Bank I 
have been obliged to make it an invariable rule not to be a 
borrower from the Bank itself and not to be an indorser 
on notes discounted either there or in other institutions. 
To this I have on principle adhered, to the prejudice of my 
own interest, from a conviction that situated as I am, it 
was in all respects proper. I should feel more unwilling to 
act on it upon the present occasion if I did not know that 
it would not incommode you as you will find no difficulty 
in making the arrangement elsewhere. . . .

favor by bringing your discounts within your income. In 
the midst of the speculations J which are abroad, combined 
with the demands for specie, prudence requires that we 
should keep within reasonable limits, and that under all 
circumstances, and at all hazards the Bank should keep 
itself secure and strong. Since the i8th of March when 
I wrote to you on the subject of your ability to do busi 
ness paper falling due on or about the I st of July, your 
discounts have increased about $700,000, a fair addition 
to your business which would be attended with no incon 
venience did not an extraordinary demand for Specie which 
has arisen render the extension more hazardous by expos 
ing you to calls for Specie against which every considera 
tion of prudence requires you to guard. It is no doubt very 
unpleasant and even painful to decline good business paper, 
but you have already by so large an increase of your dis 
counts contributed your full share to the public accomoda-

slightest risk that by pushing the spirit of accomodation as 
to require a sudden reduction, which would more than over 
balance the facilities to a few individuals which had occa

I think is, to turn over as quietly as possible to the other

accumulates turn the scale in your favor with the other

May 12th 1825 
Dear Sir 

I again observe with pleasure your proceedings of 
yesterday. Everything will go as we could wish if we have 
but the firmness to withstand the solicitations of persons 
whose wants or whose interest overcome every other con 
sideration. Our first duty is to take care of the Bank, and 
at the present moment of wild and exaggerated specula 
tion if we suffer ourselves to be borne away by the cur 
rent, if we do not on the contrary, like sober and prudent 
men, resist alike the entreaties or the clamors of individuals

Dear Sir, 

. . . The truth is simply this. The Bank is doing very 
well. During my connection of six years with it, I have 
never seen its affairs in so satisfactory a state, as at the 
present moment. It will have certainly have earned during 



From Walter Bowne 37 

the last six months more than three per cent. But then I am 
clearly of opinion that we should never advance our rate 
of dividend, till we are perfectly satisfied that we will never 
have occasion to diminish it. In Jany. 1823, we began with 
out one dollar in our pockets and we have been trying 
ever since to accumulate a fund in reserve, so as to equalize 
our dividends. You may be very sure of two things : in the 
first place that no determination with regard to the next 
Dividend has been generally formed, &amp; in the second place 
that whatever that Dividend may be the succeeding divi 
dend will be at least as much. . . .

... A foolish report has been going about that a 
combination of persons who have obtained an influence in 
several of our local moneyd institutions have commenced 
an arrangement to attack the USB, obtain votes and 
effect a change in the direction the thing in my mind is 
altogether preposterous that is as to success one favorite 
argument with them to weak stockholders is a promise of 
better dividends. 

P.S. some increase of div d . at this time in the opinion of 
many of our best friends will most materially subserve the 
best interest of the Bank. 2

have acted, with the most fastidious care, it is, to treat the

asserting the rights of the Bank, with the utmost courtesy

My dear Sir, 

... I have no doubt that we could at once give to 
the Southern &amp; Western sections of the country two or three 
millions of sound &amp; useful circulating medium if we could 
sign that amount of 5 &amp; 10 dollars. But to make two mil 
lions of five dollar notes, it would be necessary to sign my 
name 40x3,000 times, which, to a person whose time is &amp; 
must be absorbed during the day by the duties of his sta 
tion, is wholly impracticable. The application for this pur 
pose was made to Congress some years ago, but it was ac 
companied by a request that Congress would alter the 
Charter so as to prevent the universal receivability of the 
notes. This I am satisfied from experience, as I was at the 
time from theory, is not desirable; &amp; all that the Bank now 
wants is, that it may carry into execution a purpose useful 
alike to itself &amp; to the community, by assisting in the dif 
fusion of a wholesome currency. I wish therefore to consult 
you as to the best mode of presenting that subject to Con-

some time ago, but the political odour of sanctity is very 
evanescent &amp; if our purpose can be obtained without bring

My dear Sir, 

. . . With regard to our late arrangements, they are 
simply these. It has been impossible hitherto while the offi 
cers of the Bank were so fully occupied with local duties to 
know as much as was necessary of a great many matters of 
the highest importance. For instance we have nearly two 
millions of real estate besides Banking houses, &amp; we have 
about nine millions of old &amp; new suspended debts. You 
know how apt real estate &amp; bad debts are to suffer for the 
want of looking after after. We therefore appointed an offi 
cer here to take care of those two concerns. Again, we have 
never had a sufficient knowledge of the accounts between 
the officers. It was thus that West the Cashier of New Or 
leans was enabled to defraud the Bank of $20,000 we 
wish to examine these accounts, &amp; we wish also to have our

Exchange business particularly well managed. We have 
therefore appointed another Officer for those two pur 
poses. With a view to attract gentlemen of first rate abil

the other) we have called them not Clerks but Assistant

My Dear Sir, 

I have had the pleasure of receiving your letter of 
the 1 8 th inst which revived a great many agreeable recol 
lections. In regard to the establishment of a Branch at Port 
land nothing is as yet decided but should it take place the 
policy of the Bank has been in the appointment of confi 
dential Officers to live at a distance and to execute such 
important trusts to take in preference Officers brought up 
in the Bank under our own eye whose character &amp; conduct 
are known to us and afford the best guarantee of their ca 
pacity to carry into effect the system of the Bank with which 
they are familiar. I have long been satisfied that this is the 
true policy of the Bank and I think it will be pursued in case 
a Branch is established at Portland. The observation applies 
of course only to the Cashier. The other Officers are appointed 
by the Directors of the Branch. This is all that I can say at 
present and although it would be more agreeable to me per 
sonally to offer to your nephew more favorable prospects yet 
this candid explanation is due to you. 2

BIDDLE TO JAMES CROMMELIEU 1 

Phila a . May 7, 1827 
Dear Sir, 

. . . With a view to secure the best talents in its serv 
ice &amp; to reward the meritorious officers, the rule of the Bank 
is that whenever any vacancy occurs it is rilled by promo 
tion, &amp; the person last introduced takes his place at the foot 
of the list, &amp; is gradually advanced if found deserving. The 
salary of the Officers on their first entrance into the Bank is 
seven hundred dollars ($700) a year. A comparatively small 
compensation, but as it is known to lead to more lucrative 
situations, it is sufficient to attract to the service of the Bank 
a great number of applicants of respectability. When a va 
cancy takes place a selection is made from these by a ballot 
at the Board in which I of course participate as one of the 
members merely. At present there is no vacancy. It is impos 
sible however to say how soon there may be one and if you 
think it desirable after what I have stated to come into the 
Bank I would recommend this course. . . .

Dear Sir, 

Tomorrow s paper will give you a resolution intro 
duced to day by M r . Barbour, and the remarks with which 
he accompanied it, instructing the ComnV*. of Ways and 
Means to enquire into the expediency of selling the Gov 13 . 
stock in the Bank. It ought to have been decided at once, 
and I think might have been, but before I could get the floor, 
a motion was made to lay it on the table which supersedes 
debate. I believe it will be rejected. In the mean time, however, 
it will do some mischief, and, if considered as the beginning of 
an attack, lead to permanent distrust in the stability of the 
institution which will somewhat enfeeble it. The motion will 
have the effect, too, of putting the Bank among the topics 
to be handled by those who are seeking popularity. I am 
sorry for it. 

I have never heard a word about our cause, from which I 
am afraid there was nothing pleasant to say.

sometimes a severe one. We have been striving to avoid it 
by very large sales of bills which yet do not supply the de 
mand. Just at this moment it happened very luckily that the 
quotations of the Bank Stock in England were such as to show 
that remittance of it would be as good as specie calculating 
the present rate of exchange &amp; the price of 5.10 in London. 
Accordingly large remittance of Stocks were contemplated 
the effect of which would have been, besides the profit to our 
citizens to furnish an amount of exchange which would re 
lieve by so much the pressure on the Banks by specie. I think 
that a million of dollars would have taken that direction in a 
week or two &amp; would have afforded real relief. The proposal 
to sell 7 millions of course destroys all chance of a sale in Eng 
land at present prices. Nor is this all. For if the foreign Stock 
holders should take the alarm &amp; throw their stock into the 
market here it would create a new demand for exchange to 
remit the proceeds, &amp; thus increase the pressure on the Banks. 
Whatever be the decision of Congress it is desirable that it 
should be soon made.

I consider this vote as definitively settling, in advance of its 
agitation, the question of the renewal of the charter, as well 
as the subordinate question to which it [is] more immediately 
related. All my fear, now is that the Stock will again, as 
once it has before, mount too rapidly; a consequence of the 
late decision which I trust, if it appear probable, the Mother 
Bank will occasionally check by throwing into Market por

My dear Sir 

You may have observed in the Telegraph of the 20*.

array of my mortgages and debts is made with a view of mak 
ing me out a bankrupt. Among the mortgages are two, one to 
the Bank of the U.S. to secure payment of $22,000, and the 
other to J. Harper Cash r . &amp;c to secure payment of $1666:66.

The latter is wholly discharged. Of the former debt all is 
paid but about $4000 to meet which there is deposited with 
the Lexington office paper payable to me, and which becomes 
due this fall. I have every reason to anticipate its punctual 
payment, and thus the entire extinction of the mortgage. The 
truth is that my private affairs, materially affected by a re 
sponsibility I incurred about ten years ago, as indorcer, have 
been in a state of progressive improvement since, and now 
stand better than they have done during any portion of that 
time. They are such that, if I were to die tomorrow, my re 
sources are abundant to meet all my engagements, and to 
leave my family comfortable. 

I have thought it might be benefitial to me if you would 
cause a paragraph to be unveiled, in some paper in your 
City, making concisely the above statement in regard to the 
two mortgages, or simply saying that a small balance only 
is due on the large mortgage which paper is in deposit to 
meet this fall, and that the small one is discharged. It would 
be no more than an act of justice to add that, in all my rela 
tions with the bank, I have practised the greatest fidelity to 
my engagements; and that whilst most of your Western 
debtors have been allowed to pay off their debts in property, 
no such easement was ever extended or asked by me. I 
presume the returns from the office at Lexington are such 
as to admit of the insertion of such a paragraph which 
might be signed by yourself or Mr. M llvaine, 1 or be pub-

I need not say that it will afford me great satisfaction to assist 
in refuting the injurious representations of your affairs, 
which I remember to have seen without reading, as I should 
have read without believing them. I began by ascertaining 
from the records of the Bank the accuracy of your statement 
but as the returns from the offices represent only the debts 
of the parties, and not the paper which they deposit for col 
lection, I cannot speak on that subject with as much distinct 
ness as I am able to do in regard to the reduction of your debt 
and your fidelity in complying with your engagements to the 
Bank. On reflection I think it better not to publish a formal 
certificate, but to introduce the testimony of the Bank in a 
manner less direct tho equally authoritative. With the reason 
of this, I need not trouble you tho I do not doubt that

You are doubtless aware of the opposition to your ad

and to regulate the Currency of the Country at their cost.

receive the salary of President of the Bank, but it does not

I thank you for your favor of the 9 th inst. in regard to 
the Portsmouth office which we have this day arranged aggree- 
ably to your recommendation. The only departure from it 
is that we have fixed the salary at $800 &amp; the professional

This was done so as to preserve the symmetry of our system 
of compensation to the Presidents of Offices of similar Capi 
tal to that of Portsmouth, and not to make any invidious dis 
tinctions between them. To Mr Mason 2 the form is I pre

It remains now to secure his election.

and this is usually decisive but the election is actually with

M r . Asbury Dickins, 3 who has had an accommoda

by our Board, either to reduce this debt by curtailments, 
or to give additional security therefore. This demand has

not be able to comply with the call, unless at very great in 
convenience to himself &amp; to his family, &amp; without being un 
just to his other creditors. In a confidential conversation with 
him, I have learned that there are pressing claims hanging 
over him to the amount of about $2500, &amp; that every dollar 
which he can spare from the economical support of his family, 
&amp; from the interest on his debts in this office, is applied to the 
liquidation of his debts. If, in addition to the sum already

ing order to be filed in the Treasury, &amp; to be recognised by the 
Secretary, to pay us $1,000 annually out of his salary, until 
his whole debt should be paid off. The security which he could 
give would not be adequate to cover this sum; but if he 
lived, and continued in office, the Bank would be sure to 
receive the whole amount of his debt. 

There are other considerations of a delicate nature, which 
would induce me [to] accede to this proposition. They cannot 
be communicated to the Board of Directors, perhaps, but 
must readily occur to you. M r Dickins fills the confidential 
station in the Treasury, which has the management of the 
Bank accounts. He has already evinced the most friendly 
disposition towards the Bank, &amp; has in many instances, to 
my certain knowledge, rendered services materially impor 
tant to its interests. I do not say, nor do I believe, that he has 
in a single instance, gone contrary to his duty to the Trea 
sury; but I know that it is very important to have the per 
son filling his station, well disposed to the Bank, as the view 
which may be taken of the subjects referred to him, may be 
materially affected by the feelings by which he is governed. 
The report on the subjects of Government deposits in the 
Bank, made to the Senate last winter by Gen 1 . Smith, 1 
was in a great measure made from materials furnished by 
M r Dickins, from suggestions obtained from me. This of 
course, must not be talked of, nor should I have mentioned 
it, but to illustrate the idea of M r . Dickins usefulness. Such 
is my opinion of the services rendered by him, I should 
think it good policy to give up entirely, the whole $5000, 
sooner than not to retain his friendly disposition. . . .

RICHARD RUSH l TO BIDDLE 

private and confidential. Washington Nov: 19, 1828 

My dear sir. 

... I am about setting down to the preparation of my 
annual report, always a work of importance, but the materials 
for which, as you well know, cannot be got in, until just be 
fore congress assembles. I must prepare it, too, amidst the in 
evitable interruptions of daily business, drawing me aside. 
The receipts for the current year are likely, I think, to ex 
ceed by a million and a half (perhaps more) my estimate of 
them this time last year. 

It is my present intention to take some notice of your Bank. 
This has never yet been done, as far as I recollect, as a vol 
untary duty by the secretary of the treasury in his annual 
reports. But if these reports are to consist of nothing but an 
account current of the receipts of the year, set off in ruled 
lines and columns, any copying clerk in the department 
might annually save the secretary the trouble of drawing 
them up. 

Please to consider this communication as confidential, and 
believe me dear Sir,

about this reference to the Bank in the Secretary s report.

shall not have my business letter ready before Bank closes, 
I send specially to you. 

Since seeing you I have by mere accident learned that, in 
the last contest for the Presidency, 1 you have been of the 
opinion opposed to that which we have felt it to be our duty 
to maintain. I think it proper to say, that my belief was, until 
otherwise informed, that if you had inclined to either side, 
it was in favor of the present Administration. I advert to the 
fact for no other purpose than to say that I did not speak so 
freely as I did, during our interviews, with the remotest ap 
prehension that anything falling from me in allusion to the 
contest could be unpleasant to you. I wish not to be con 
sidered as one who disregards the common rules of good so 
ciety. As for the rest, having conversed with you as I would 
with my most intimate political friend, I am satisfied to leave 
it to your determination whether I am either as violent or as 
bad a man as my political enemies would make me out to be.

My dear Sir 

... I am very much obliged to you for the intimation 
of your purpose of mentioning the Bank in your next report. 
Independant of the pleasure of seeing its usefulness recog 
nized from so high a source, it may perhaps be useful with 
regard to others who have hitherto not been so well disposed 

1 This letter is highly significant as it shows that Gales was surprised that 
Biddle did not warmly support Adams. If this was true, can it be possible that 
Biddle was favorably disposed to Jackson? Parton and von Hoist both cite Jack 
son s interest in the Bank in 1821 and 1828; while Catterall claims that Biddle had 
been warned in 1828 by Mcllvaine of the incoming President s hostility. However, 
it seems from this letter that Biddle s friends thought he was not opposed to 
Jackson. 



To Richard Rush 5 7 

&amp; who now seemed destined to have an influence hereafter 
over that subject, so far as respects the country I am per 
fectly satisfied from as intimate a knowledge as I possess of 
any subject, that [but] for the presence of the Bank the cur 
rency of the country would in two months time relapse into 
confusion, &amp; that the public revenue, becoming of unequal 
value at every part of the Union would be subject to loss &amp; 
delay &amp; expence in making transfers which would be incal 
culable injurious. It occurs to me &amp; I therefore venture the 
suggestion that the subject might be appropriately intro 
duced at that part of the report, which will naturally state 
the amount of debt extinguished during the last four years. 
It would then be satisfactory to add, that the whole of this 
amount, in addition to the ordinary receipts &amp; disbursements, 
after being collected in various quarters of this extensive 
country are transferred to the several points where the pub 
lic debt is payable, &amp; actually disbursed for that purpose 
without the delay of amount, or the expense of a dollar 
or the slightest risk the Bank being responsible for the con 
duct of the agents while in England, the Gov fc pay more 
than a million of dollars annually for the management of its 
debt by the Bank of England. What is scarcely less important 
is, that from the arrangements made by the Bank for these 
payments, the inconvenience of a great accumulation of 
money in the vaults of the Gov* followed by an immediate 
distribution of it is entirely obviated. The Bank as the period 
of payment approaches, anticipates in the form of discounts 
the disbursement of a considerable portion of the Stock 
and the rest becomes absorbed in the mass of its operations 
so that many millions are paid on a given day, without the 
slightest previous pressure, or any consciousness on the part

My dear Sir 

I rec d this morning your favor of the 29 th ulto 
which did not reach me until the Committee to whom Mr 
Gales application was referred had decided upon it &amp; their 
report was adopted by the Board today. 

I have, indeed we all have, very favorable dispositions 
towards Mr Gales, &amp; would gladly assist him if it could be 
done with propriety. But it would be wrong for us to con 
sider the matter in any other than a pecuniary light or to treat 
it on any other than simple business principles. The value 
of his paper &amp; the advantage of its continuance are considera 
tions entirely foreign to us^ and the very circumstance that 
but for the B. U. S. any newspaper would be discontinued, 
or that the Bank had gone out of its way in order to sustain 
any newspaper either in administration or in opposition would 
be a subject of reproach &amp; what alone makes reproach un 
comfortable of just reproach to the Bank. I have striven to 
keep the Bank straight &amp; neutral in this conflict of parties, 
&amp; I shall endeavor to persevere in that course. If then the 
support of the Nat 1 Int r . offers no adequate temptation to 
hazard the property of the Bank, the loan is on business prin 
ciples not a proper one. The responsibilities of the party now 
amount to a little above $50,000 : for this the Bank has it is 
conceived just enough &amp; no more to make the debt secure, &amp; 
all the other means of the parties are already pledged for 
other debts. The only chance there of any accession of means

is in the contingency of their receiving the appointment of 
printers to the next Congress a contingency which a politi 
cian may regard as surrounded by different degrees of prob 
ability but which to a Banker seems an unsteady basis for 
a loan of $15,000. I am very sorry that we were obliged to 
decline but really saw no other course, unless we were ready 
in all impartiality, to furnish the means for a newspaper 
under the next administration. I have written thus freely 
because I thought it would interest you to know the fate 
of his application &amp; the reason of it.

Dear sir, 

I beg leave to enclose you a copy of my annual report. 
In framing it on this occasion, I have had reference to its mak 
ing a good impression abroad, satisfied that [if] it should have 
this effect, in any degree, it will render it but the more valu 
able at home. Hence in the part about the debt, as well indeed 
as in other parts, I have been somewhat more elementary, 
or rather, I should say, explanatory, than would be neces 
sary for home readers alone. I had written out the first sketch 
of the whole, including the part about the bank, before I was 
favored with your letter of the 25 th of November, and had an 
ticipated some of its suggestions. Others that it contained, and 
that I also found in your late letter to Mr Dickins, I adopted, 
and now make you my acknowledgments for them. At the 
time the Bank was attacked last winter, for so it was in effect,

naught. The finances of the state are the state. So said Burke. 
Every thing that can be brought to bear upon the wealth and 
prosperity of the nation, commerce, manufactures, agri 
culture, the shipping interest, the currency, banks, the coin, 
tariffs, Internal works legislation as it may affect all or 
any of these topics, are open, so I hold it, to the scrutiny 
or recommendations of a secretary of the treasury, in his an 
nual reports to the national Legislature. He may review in 
them, if he pleases, the financial systems of any part of the 
world, past or present, and ought to, if by it he can help our 
own. True he must be responsible to his own character for 
the manner in which he may do all this, and more, for every 
thing is open to him. His scope is boundless. I have at least 
desired to give to the law under which the annual report is 
made, an enlarged interpretation. I would lift up its dignity, 
as well as its importance, leaving it for others, more able, 
who are to come after me, to improve to great national bene 
fits my mere conception of the duties which it imposes. . . . 

You have probably as much or more to fear for the Bank, 
from New York, as from Virginia, and with even less excuse. 
In Virginia, there are still constitutional scruples. In New 
York, none. But the frog of Wall Street, puffs himself into 
the Ox of Lombard street, and will not have you abuse him.

GEORGE HOFFMAN * TO BIDDLE 

Baltimore Decem 2Oth 1828 
My dear Sir 

. . . You appear to be going on so smoothly and satis 
factorily in the management and operations of the Bank 
that no room or need of remark or advice is necessary, and 
this here to fore much abused and unpopular Bank may now 
be hoped, and said to stand so well with the public, or of all 
well informed communities and experienced men, that its 
enemies may become its friends. I hope we may so find it 
when we go forward for a renewal of its charter. Mr Rush 
has at least come out, and has done his duty well. It has 
given me surprise that he, and indeed the President, as also 
former Secretaries of the Treasury have not usually said 
something of the truth of this matter in their reports. 

I would think well of an application for a new Charter 
some time (years) before the expiration of the present, and 
would choose a tranquil fortunate session to make it in, an 
early application is reasonable &amp; proper, as a Machine of its 
extent, and Loans should know its course, and have ample 
time to its closure if necessary. I cannot doubt a renewal will 
be had the terms may give you difficulty and trouble. I 
have read with great dissatisfaction the assertions ensinu- 
ations and threats of Duff Green in his Telegraph of the 4th 
Instant, does M r Clay owe the Bank now a large sum? This

no administration would venture to set the monied concerns

... 3. You ask "whether any of the branches, in 
any way whatever, except the individual votes of the Direc 
tors, interfered in the late contest." 

Most certainly not in the slightest degree. There is no 
one principle better understood by every officer in the Bank, 
than that, he must abstain from politics, and I have not seen 
nor heard of any one of them in any part of the Union, who 
has been engaged in this controversy. I remarked the other

day a story of a person l in Cincinnati who was arrested for 
rent, &amp; it was supposed that the agent of the Bank had done 
it to prevent his going to the Senate &amp; making a Senator of 
the U.S. friendly to Gen 1 Jackson. I do not consider it pos 
sible that he should have had any such design, but the sub 
ject is under investigation, &amp; if he shall be found to have 
abused the power of the bank to such an unworthy purpose, 
he shall certainly never have an opportunity of repeating it. 
The course of the Bank is very clear and straight on that 
point. We believe that the prosperity of the Bank &amp; its use 
fulness to the country depend on its being entirely free from 
the control of the Officers of the Gov 1 , a control fatal to every 
Bank, which it ever influenced. In order to preserve that in 
dependence it must never connect itself with any administra 
tion &amp; never become a partizan of any set of politicians. 
In this respect I believe all the officers of the institution 
have been exemplary. The truth is that with us, it is con 
sidered that we have no concern in politics. Dean Swift, 
said you know, that money is neither, whig nor tory, and we 
say with equal truth, that the Bank is neither Jackson man 
nor an Adams man, it is only a Bank. . . .

submit them to you, as recommended by himself, and renewal 
of the delegation from Kentucky, for the appointment of Di 
rectors of the Branches of the United States bank, at Lex 
ington and Louisville. The members of Congress from Ken 
tucky favourable to the new Administration, are under the 
impression, that during the late elections in that State, great 
facilities, by the state banks, were given to those persons, who 
were favourable to the re-election of Mr Adams, whilst al 
most all accomodation was withheld from the other side of the 
contest. This impression may have arisen, perhaps, from the 
fact, that the Directors were favourable to the Administra 
tion, and on that account injustice may have been done them. 
It is to be expected, where party spirit has no limit, that 
jealousies of every kind will be cherished against political op 
ponents, and by this means, the fairest course of conduct, may 
be grossly misrepresented. But, where the impression of un 
fairness exists, the effect on society and on our institutions 
may be deeply injurious, without any substantial foundation. 
It would therefore seem to be sound policy, to guard against 
every appearance of Wrong. And it is submitted with great 
deference, whether it would not be advisable to make the 
selection of Directors for the branches in Kentucky, from 
both political parties, where persons can be found belong 
ing to both, who are equally competent and entitled to the 
public confidence. 

Being friendly to the Bank myself, I should regret to see 
a political crusade got up against it. Some, I know are ready 
to engage in this course, but I wish there number may be 
small. 

I have no doubt, you will agree with me, that every monied 
institution should remain free from political connections, and

that every just measure, which may be calculated to pre

Dear Sir 

I have had the pleasure of receiving your letter of the 
2 d inst, in which you mention your being about to make 
a favorable report on the nomination of Directors of the 
B. U. S, but wished previously to know "what amount of 
accommodation had been granted to each by way of dis 
count." I feel some regret at declining to answer any inquiry 
of yours and as you know have given full &amp; frank in 
formation on every topic connected with the administration 
of the Bank. But a question involving the private affairs of 
my colleagues is of a totally different character. The account 
which any individual keeps with the Bank is a private con 
cern between him &amp; the Bank of which it would be a viola 
tion of confidence to speak. The information sought more 
over would be useless unless its tendency was to show that 
the individual had borrowed too much a fact which would 
tend to prove not merely the want of personal independence 
on the part of the borrower, but also fix on the Board of Di 
rectors the imputation of suffering him to borrow too much 
to neither of which could I with propriety give counte 
nance without a departure from that course of delicacy in 
regard to the private concerns of individuals which I think 
due equally to them &amp; to myself. My feeling on that subject

is very strong. I have for instance been a director of the Bank 
for nine years I have been its presiding officer for six years. 
I have never borrowed a dollar from the Bank x &amp; trust that 
I never shall. And yet if it were made a question whether I 
had borrowed one dollar or one million of dollars I would not 
answer the enquiry, to be made President of the U.S. be 
cause it goes to establish an inquisition into the private af 
fairs of individuals which is equally unjust &amp; invidious. I do 
not think myself at liberty therefore to state any thing with 
regard to those who keep their accounts in the Bank. . . . 

P.S. We have just made a dividend of 3^ per cent with a 
surplus on our last six months business of more than $100,000

Dear Biddle 

I saw a friend in New York who is intimate with 
Cambreleng &amp; speaking about the Presidents message, he 
told me that three months ago Cambreleng advised him to 
sell out his Bank Shares for that the Administration were 
hostile to the Bank that the Bank had not meet the public 
estimation, by producing an uniform currency &amp; that its 
charter would not be renewed &amp; that the Gov 1 would creat 
a new Bank a National one to be located at Washington 

1 Protection against the personal affairs of the Bank was the keynote of 
Biddle s administration. At all times the President refused to allow investigation 
of the internal workings of the institution until the Bank war broke out in all its 
fury. Then, in order to show that the Bank had nothing to conceal, he allowed 
it to take place. But, as a rule, he gave the inquisitor little assistance with the re 
sult that the latter was overwhelmed with a mass of abstract data.

Dear Sir 

The annexed list has been sent to me from Washing 
ton, as containing the views of several members of Congress 
from Kentucky in regard to a proper direction for your Office. 
It is accompanied by an expression of opinion on their part- 
not to me directly, but thro a common friend that during 
the elections in Kentucky, great facilities were given by the 
Branches in that State, to persons favorable to the reelection 
of Mr Adams, whilst almost all accommodation was withheld 
from the other side of the contest. I will not believe for a mo 
ment that this is not a mistake. The officers of the Bank have 
hitherto so studiously avoided all interference in politics, 
that I think it scarcely possible that any gentlemen con 
nected with it, should so far forget their duty as to become 
partizans, or abuse their delicate trusts to the unworthy pur 
pose of advancing any political object. The statement is how 
ever made, and the nomination subjoined is I presume in 
tended to prevent the recurrence of similar favoritism in 
future by an union of parties in the Board. As you are about 
to forward a new list, I will state to you precisely my views 
on that subject. 
Politics should be rigorously excluded from the adminis-

tration of the Bank. In selecting Directors, the first consider 
ations [should be] integrity, independence, &amp; knowledge of 
business. No man should be shunned, &amp; no man should be 
sought on account of his political opinions merely. Neverthe 
less in a community where broad political divisions prevail, 
we must not be wholly insensible to them we must not 
exclude, nor even seem to exclude, any one particular denomi 
nation of politicians; but where both present candidates of 
equal merits, we should take them from both parties. But 
still the first question is, their qualifications, distinct from 
their political opinions. I would not however be disposed to 
act on any regular system of equally uniting both parties 
because the inevitable effect of it would be to force upon us 
inferior men, merely because they were politicians. I have 
myself an extreme unwillingness to blend politics with the 
concerns of the Bank. Nearly all its misfortunes may be 
traced to this cause, &amp; in your section of the country we 
have surely had a melancholy experience of the hazard of 
lending to politicians. Since you have been relieved from 
them, your affairs have prospered, and you are doing so 
well that I do not wish to disturb your progress by an infu 
sion of politics. But at the same time, we must avoid the 
odium, which would naturally &amp; justly attach to the exclu 
sion of any party from its proper share in the government 
&amp; the loans of the Bank. . . .

There is one topic in my letter to you of this day, on

but which is very fruitful of admonition. The truth is, that 
almost all the misfortunes of the Bank of the United States, 
are traceable, directly or indirectly, to politics. In Kentucky 
the losses were in a great measure incurred by loans to prom 
inent politicians of all sides whose influence procurred them 
undue facilities which ended, as frequently happens, in such 
cases, by ruining them as well as cripling the Branches. These 
things have made us sensitive on that point, &amp; unwilling to 
see any great political influence introduced, which might lead 
to a recurrence of similar misfortunes. 

BIDDLE TO JOHN MCLEAN 

Bank of the U. States. 

Jan y . u, 1829. 
My dear Sir 

I thank you very sincerely for your favor of the 5 th 
inst. with its inclosures. . . . 

On the general question, I concur entirely in your views, 
which are, in fact, those which prevail in the administration 
of the Bank. Our theory is, that the Bank should studiously 
abstain from all interference in politics, &amp; there is not an 
officer of the Institution who does not know that his stand 
ing &amp; his place too, depend on his strict observance of this 
principle. 1 believe also that they have hitherto been faithful 
to it. I have never heard of any suspicion even, that any 
officer of the Bank has intermeddled with politics, except on 
one occasion, and that suspicion, I am satisfied after inquiry, 
was without foundation. 1 

In regard to Directors, the first considerations undoubt 
edly are, integrity, independence &amp; knowledge of business. 

1 Cf. letter of Biddle to George Hoffman, November 22, 1829. 



70 Correspondence of Nicholas Biddle 

No man should be excluded, no man should be sought, 
merely on account of his political sentiments. Nevertheless, 
in a community where broad political distinctions prevail, 
we must not be insensible to them, we must not reject, 
nor even seem to reject, any denomination of politicians, &amp; 
where we have the means of selecting persons equally compe 
tent from all parties, their political opinions ought not to be 
overlooked. Still, however, in choosing Directors, who borrow 
themselves &amp; who lend to others, the funds belonging to the 
Gov 4 . and to the Stockholders, their personal independence, 
&amp; their fitness for that particular duty must be the primary 
inquiry their political preferences only a secondary concern. 
The great hazard of any system of equal division of parties 
at a Board is, that it almost inevitably forces upon you in 
competent or inferior persons, in order to adjust the numeri 
cal balance of Directors. For instance, the Board at Nash 
ville naturally consists of the political friends of General 
Jackson that at Boston, of the friends of M r Adams (tho , 
such is the fate of politicians, I am not so sure of that now) 
and this is not from any principle of political selection or ex 
clusion, but because the best agents for managing monied 
concerns, happened to be on that side just as the best 
lawyer or the best merchant of these places, would prob 
ably be in favor of their respective candidates but if, 
with a view to redress this inequality, we were to intro 
duce incompetent persons, the Bank might sustain serious 
injury. 

In the Branches we naturally look to the confidential offi 
cers of the Bank (the Cashier who is appointed by the Parent 
Board, and the President of the Branch) to nominate suitable 
persons to fill the vacancies as they occur by rotation, and if, 



70 John McLean 7 1 

after inquiring from other independent sources, we see no 
reason to distrust their judgment, we generally lean to their 
nomination. This is the safest general practice, because if we 
at a distance place in the Direction gentlemen without know 
ing their precise pecuniary situation, we may introduce in 
dividuals who have already borrowed too much, or wish to 
borrow too much, or who have needy friends whose claims 
they may urge successfully while sitting at the Board, when 
they might otherwise be resisted. In regard to the Branches 
in Kentucky, they have met with enormous losses not less 
perhaps than $600,000 and a great portion of this not on 
business loans, the legitimate object of Banking, but on ac- 
comodation paper which should never have found its way 
into the Branches. This melancholy experience has induced 
us to give a more commercial &amp; business-like character to 
their transactions, and they have naturally fallen into the 
hands of business men, who have managed their affairs very 
well. These Branches were never in so sound &amp; prosperous 
a state as at this moment never did business so usefully 
to the community &amp; so profitably to the Bank. Being per 
fectly satisfied with their progress, &amp; perceiving that the set 
of gentlemen in the Direction are nearly the same who have 
been there for four or five years, I have not examined their 
relation to the political parties which have grown up princi 
pally since they were first introduced into the Boards. I was 
not even aware, until I received your letter, of any political 
preponderance either way, in the Directions of the Branches, 
nor did I suppose it possible that they would abuse their 
trusts to any political object. ...

Dear Sir 

. . . We are obliged to receive and glad to receive nom 
inations from any respectable quarter, &amp; always treat them 
with respect but you must not suspect that any particular 
consideration is given to nominations from Washington. With 
Washington, in its character as the seat of Gov fc , the Bank 
has no concern. It has in fact nothing to do with the Gov*, 
except that in administering the national finances, it will give 
its aid cordially and sincerely to every administration. But 
with no administration will it have any political connexion. 
Nor would the influence of the President and all the Depart 
ments put together be sufficient to appoint a single Director 
who was not considered qualified for his trust. This independ 
ence forms the point of honor with the Bank. You must 
not, therefore, believe for a moment, that any influence from 
any quarter could interfere with the regular course of our 
nominations or prevent our consulting you and our friends 
in Nashville on a subject of so much importance as the choice 
of those to whom the prosperity of the Bank is entrusted. 2

there is any foundation for them. . . .

My Dear Sir 

Your favor of the 6th inst is before me. I have long 
been aware of the existance of the uneasiness which prevails in 
Portsmouth. I knew it would exist as long ago as when I was 
there last Summer and at the time the appointment was made 
and the Salary fixed any man that would do his duty under 
the Circumstances that exist, would be unpopular; but as the 
old saying is, "one man may Steal a Sheap while another 
dare not look over the fence." . . .

Dear Sir 

In a confidential conversation with John Tilford * 
Esq r . a few days ago, I learned that a charge of partiality had 

ready written to Levi Woodbury, later Secretary of the Treasury, in reply to 
charges against Mason and it was to follow up this complaint that he now wrote 
to Lenox.

been made against the Cashier and directory of the Branch 
of the United States Bank, at this place, in the administration 
of the business of the office: of discounting more freely the 
paper of the friends of the administration than that of their 
political opponents, and thereby permitting political feelings 
to influence them in loaning the money of the Bank. 

I was, as you know, appointed, last winter, a director of 
that office; and I am the only one, in the direction, who was 
in favor of the election, and who is friendly to the adminis 
tration, of General Jackson. Since my appointment I have 
been pretty punctual in my attendance at the meetings of the 
board; and I am happy to be able to say that, since my attend 
ance there, the charge of partiality is entirely groundless : in 
no single instance have the political opinions of applicants 
for discounts, ever been mentioned by any gentleman in the 
direction; the solvency and punctuality, of the drawers and 
endorsers of offered paper, are the only questions that have 
been discussed there. In cases, too, of indulgence, the direc 
tors, in granting or refusing them, have been influenced by 
reasons affecting the interest of the Bank, and not by politi 
cal considerations. I can say more: from the character of the 
paper which became due after my appointment, but which 
was discounted before, I am certain that equal impartiality 
governed the board at the time it was discounted. 

So far, then, as my observation extends, no charge can 
be more unfounded; nor can I believe, from my acquaintance 
with the gentlemen in the direction, and particularly with 
Mr. Tilford the President, and M r Harper the Cashier, that 
the charge was ever true. With the greatest respect I am, 

friend of R. M. Johnson of Kentucky, later Vice-President under Van Buren. Cf.

whole is a paltry intrigue got up by a combination of small 
bankrupts &amp; smaller Demagogues that if the choice were

(Private) Philada: Septr. 1 6, 1829 

My dear Sir 

I received yesterday your favor of the 13 th instant, &amp; 
thank you for its suggestions, which are, I am sure dictated 
by great kindness. But I cannot go to Washington at present. 
I find here a state of things which I really think I had no rea 
son to anticipate. No man, not the noisiest partizan in the 
country has taken more pains to make the financial opera 
tions of the administration useful to the country &amp; creditable 
to themselves. And what is the return. Constant abuse of the 
Bank from the press which is the official organ of that Ad 
ministration during my absence the Secretary at War 1 
makes a most extraordinary notation of its rights and now 
I have on my table an official communication of the views 
of the Administration as to the manner in which the Bank 
ought to choose &amp; remove its Officers. For the two first I

care nothing, except so far as they may indicate the disposi 
tion to condemn &amp; to encroach, but the last cannot be passed 
without notice. It is regarded generally by the Board as show 
ing a determination to injure the independence of the Bank, 
on a point where it is peculiarly sensitive as well from duty as 
from honor, &amp; accordingly they think that it should be re 
sisted at all hazards. And so it shall be. I have sent today 
to the Secretary their unanimous views on the subject, in 
which none of the members concur more heartily than the 
friends of the Administration. 1 

I regret all this exceedingly. You know my indifference to 
Party &amp; how well disposed I was to act cordially with the 
present Administration &amp; particularly with your new Sec 
retary. But having done my duty to them, I will not give way 
an inch in what concerns the independence of the Bank, to 
please all the Administrations past, present or future. 2 

The bigots of the last reproached me with nothing for them 
the bigots of the present will be annoyed that the Bank 
will not support them. Be it so, I care nothing for either class 
of partizans &amp; mean to disregard both. 

The Portsmouth affair I found after an examination of six 
days, to be a very small intrigue to supplant an honest &amp; 
excellent officer, who was of course continued in his place. 

Having by my official letter of to day, satisfied my sense 
of duty by rejecting all interference in the concerns of the 
Bank, I have no further feeling on the occasion, &amp; shall in any 
event take care that as far as I am concerned the relations of 
the Bank with the Treasury shall be as kindly as heretofore.

BIDDLE TO A. DICKINS ESQ 

Phil a . Septr. 3O th . 1829 
My dear Sir 

The mail of this morning brought me your favor of the 
28 th inst. the business part of which was immediately ar 
ranged. 

I regret, my dear Sir, this controversy as much as you can 
&amp; would gladly have shunned it, but believing that it is safer 
for the country to have no Bank than to have it subject to 
political influences, it was impossible not to resist these pre 
tensions from so many quarters to interfere in its admin 
istration. In doing this I am not conscious of having gone 
beyond the limits of a necessary self defence; and no one 
would regret more than I would, if I thought you right in 
believing that the Board had persisted in imputing to M r 
Ingham 1 a purpose which he has disavowed. But what the 
Board imputed to him &amp; what has he disavowed? He has in so 
many words, sent to the Board the views of the administra 
tion as to the mode in which they ought to choose and dis 
miss their officers saying that it is his "high public duty" to 
communicate it &amp; their "very high obligation" to conform 
to it. All that the Board have answered is, that he had no 
right to give advice and that if he had, the advice is bad. 
They have never imputed to him a design to acquire undue 
influence they have only said that his theory would lead 
to it. They have never imputed to him a connexion with the 
movements of other people they have only cited these 
movements in illustration of the danger of his theory. I hope

most sincerely that he has no such connexion &amp; would be 
the first to render justice to him whenever an opportunity 
occurs. For really he ought not, and I am sure will not ascribe 
to us the least unkindness toward him. To show you the 
temper in which this whole matter has been conducted, I will 
mention a simple fact. The only political character in the 
Board is M r . Sergeant and he was a member of the Committee 
to whom M r . Inghams first letter was referred. But so fearful 
was I lest any political bias should interfere, that I would not 
communicate with M r . Sergeant nor was he consulted until 
during my absence his professional opinion was asked about 
the removal of the Pension Office, he being the standing coun 
sel of the Bank. Moreover of the five gentlemen composing 
that Committee, two were the political friends of Gen 1 . 
Jackson. All our predispositions therefore were kindly, and it 
was not until the feelings &amp; the spirit of the Board were 
wounded, that they were compelled to vindicate the inde 
pendence of the Institution. 

Having done this, all feeling has subsided &amp; it will remain for 
the Secretary himself to restore the relations of the Bank &amp; the 
Treasury to their former friendly footing. He has only to say 
that we have misapprehended him that he did not claim 
a right to interfere with the concerns of the Bank and had 
nothing to do with the movement, of these other people 
and I should immediately say, as I have no doubt the Board 
would say, that the explanation was very agreeable that 
we regretted any misapprehension, and any expression on 
the part of the Board which might be considered as applying 
to a supposed design to interfere would of course be inappli 
cable on the present occasion. This I think he might do with 
great propriety and I am sure that he would be met in the

most friendly temper. He ought to do it, because I think he 
began this whole business. My impression is that he would 
have done well to say in answer to M r Woodbury that he 
should apply to the Bank and not to the Treasury there be 
ing a peculiar awkwardness in any interference on the part 
of the Sec y . Not having done so he has become inevitably 
blended with these other movements of a parcel of intriguers, 
all participation in which, he owes it to himself to disclaim. 
No one will be better pleased than I shall be at his doing so. 
I had intended on my return from the North to explain to 
the Sec y the whole machinery of this cabal of which he was 
to have been made the unconscious instrument &amp; to put him 
on his guard against similar machinations in future. But the 
tone of his second letter made me abstain from any thing 
which might be misconstrued into an acknowledgement that 
he was entitled to any such explanations. . . .

D. Sir, 

Your letter of the I4th Inst. inclosing one from M r 
Dun of Lexington, was received by the mail of yesterday 
morning. I have not the pleasure of being personally ac 
quainted with M r Dun, but am told by those who know him, 
that he is a highly reputable gentleman. His letter, as re 
quested, has been shown to the President who, with compli 
ments, desires me to express to you his thanks for the in 
formation it contains. He certainly has been led to believe, 
from the complaints of his friends, during the pendency 
of the presidential election, that the Lexington Branch in

disbursing its golden favours, in the way of discounts, had 
manifested great partiality. It is gratifying to him however, 
he says, to learn that probably there was no just cause for 
those complaints, or at least, that they probably had been 
much exaggerated. He requests me to say, that he has too 
much confidence in you to believe, for a moment, that you 
should knowingly tolerate such conduct in the Branches of 
your Bank; but from the complaints which are still made with 
regard to some of them, particularly the one at New Orleans, 
he thinks it not improbable that party feeling may yet have 
some influence upon their operations. He hopes this may 
not be the case, but an inquiry into the cause of those com 
plaints, and a removal of the ground if there be any for them, 
is an object, he thinks, worthy the attention of the Parent 
Bank. The President thinks, as you do, that the Bank of the 
U. States should recognise no party; and that, in all its opera 
tions, it should have an eye single to the interest of the Stock 
holders and the good of the country. . . .

Dear Sir 

Your favor of the i6 th . inst. was very acceptable as it 
satisfied me of what I could never permit myself to doubt, 
that the views of the President were in perfect accordance 
with those of the Bank in regard to the exclusion of party 
feelings from its administration. The fact is that among the 
Directors, it is considered not simply a duty, but a point of 
honor, not to yield to party spirit and they would anx 
iously &amp; zealously prevent, or punish it should it occur on 
the part of any of their Officers. 



From Matthew L. Bevan 8 1 

I cannot give you a stronger proof of that disposition than 
this letter will afford. You remark in your favor of the i6 th 
inst. that complaint, had reached the President of politi 
cal feelings shown in the direction of the Branch at New Or 
leans. The Cashier of that Branch is here &amp; on the point of 
sailing for New Orleans. But I have instructed him to go 
immediately to Washington, to satisfy the President, which 
I think he can readily do, that the statements he has heard, 
are erroneous, and at any rate to hear precisely what the al 
legations are in order that on his arrival at New Or 
leans he may furnish the necessary refutation of them. It 
is the purpose of this letter to request that you will have 
the goodness to put M r Jaudon 1 in the way of attaining this 
object. He is a gentleman of high character and capacity 
inferior to no other Officer in the Bank &amp; with very few 
equals in the country for intelligence and knowledge of 
business.

SAMUEL JAUDON TO BIDDLE 

Philadelphia, Oct r 26 th 1829 
Dr Sir, 

Agreeably to your instructions, I proceeded on Thurs 
day last to Washington City, for the purpose of inquiring 
into the reports which had reached the Government of the 
exercise at the Office in New Orleans of a political influence 
unfavorable to the present Administration. In this visit, I 
had the good fortune to be accompanied by John Hagan, 
Esquire, one of the Directors of our Office, and a personal as 
well as political friend of the President. 

Immediately after our arrival there on Friday morning, we 
called on Major Lewis, to whom I handed your letter, which 
introduced a free and full conversation. In reply to my in 
quiries he stated, that letters had been received from New 
Orleans containing accusations, in general terms, that the 
Board of the Office there were actuated in the performance 
of their duties by political feelings hostile to the Administra 
tion, but that no specific charges had as yet been made. I re- 



From Samuel Jaudon 8 3 

marked, that we could only meet general accusations by gen 
eral denials, and that I did deny in the most unqualified man 
ner that there was the least ground for the charge; that I 
could appeal confidently to the Books of the Office to shew 
that no paper had been rejected but upon sufficient commer 
cial grounds; that if any specific charges should be preferred, 
I should be able to give the most convincing proofs that our 
Board had acted only on the strictest Banking principles with 
out the least reference to party views or partialities and 
that I knew that I should be fully borne out in these asser 
tions by those of our present as well as former Directors 
who are the personal and political friends of the President. 
These statements, and others which I urged of a similar na 
ture, were unhesitatingly seconded and confirmed by M r 
Hagan. Major Lewis expressed himself perfectly satisfied, 
and promised to communicate to the President your letter 
and our representations; and he invited us to call upon the 
President in the evening. 

We accordingly did call, and were received by the Presi 
dent in the most friendly manner. After conversing for some 
time upon general subjects, the President remarked, that 
some letters had been received from New Orleans containing 
charges against the Office there of the perversion of its in 
fluence to party purposes, but that he was pleased to find 
from your letter to Major Lewis, and from the assurances of 
Mr. Hagan and myself, that there was no foundation for 
these charges; that party feelings, he knew, often blinded the 
judgment, and led us to imagine faults where none existed, 
and that men were particularly apt to make a charge of the 
kind alluded to against a Bank which, with however good 
reason, withheld from them its favors; that he was entirely 



84 Correspondence of Nicholas Biddle 

convinced that no hostility to his administration was exer 
cised by the Board of the Parent Bank, and that in reference 
to yourself particularly he had the most unbounded confi 
dence in the purity of your intentions; that the support which 
you had given to the financial operations of the Government 
was of the most gratifying as well as effectual kind, and that 
he wished for nothing from the Bank but its cordial and lib 
eral cooperation in matters of this nature. He should have 
been satisfied, he said, by your letter alone of the want of 
any foundation for the accusations against the Office at New 
Orleans; and from my unqualified denials as well as my readi 
ness to meet the charges, and from the testimony of M r Hagan, 
not the least doubt remained on his mind. He appeared to be 
much gratified, that we should have paid this visit with the 
sole view of obliterating unfounded impressions, evincing as 
it did the wish of the Bank to remove all obstacles to the most 
perfect good understanding. 

Throughout our interview, which lasted for an hour, the 
tone and manner of the President were of the most mild 
and friendly character, and both M r Hagan and myself 
took our leave under the full conviction that we had to 
the extent of our wishes accomplished the object of our 
visit. I do not pretend, to have given you the precise lan 
guage of the President, tho I have followed it as far as my 
recollection serves.

Washington Nov r . 15 th 1829 
D. Sir, 

I wrote last evening to Mr H. Toland 3 informing 
him that some of his friends here were anxious that he should 
be run for the appointment of Clerk to the House of Repre 
sentatives in Congress. I think, if he will consent to serve, 
he can be elected, and he should not, it seems to me object to 
it. I wish you would see and advise with him on this subject. 
There is a very large majority of the members of the next 
Congress in favour of the present Administration, and I am 
sure there can be no wish on their part to reelect M r Clark(e) 4 
nor do 1 believe the opposition members have any partiality 
for him. If Toland will consent to let his friends place his 
name before the House, you can serve him very efficiently, 
I have no doubt, by speaking to Webster and enlisting him 
and other New England members in his behalf. I am sure

they can have no predelections in favour of Clark, and with 
a little pains could be got to vote for Toland. M r Ingham 
for particular reasons will support M r Clark, and such of the 
Penn a . delegation as are under his influence (D r Sutherland 1 
and two or three others) will vote for him; but I have no 
doubt, a decided majority would support our friend. It will 
be well to see M r Hemphill, 2 and converse with him upon 
the subject, and if he should be favourably disposed, get 
him to write to his friends particularly Judge Wilkins 3 of 
Pittsburgh, and old M r Ross. You will have a fine opportu 
nity of seeing your Eastern friends (I mean such as you can 
venture to speak to) as they pass thro Phil a . on their way to 
Congress, and enlisting them in the support of Toland. 

I have taken the liberty, my dear sir, of writing to you upon 
this subject, because I know you feel, as I do, a deep interest 
in the welfare of M r Toland, and will most cheerfully aid in 
whatever may tend to his benefit. Should he be appointed 
Clerk to the House it may lead to results still more impor 
tant to him it may ultimately be the means of relieving 
him from his pecuniary embarrassments. 

I intimated in my letter to him, of last night, that should 
he consent to be a candidate, it might be well to let it be an 
nounced in one of your papers &amp;c. On reflection I am inclined 
to think it would be best to say nothing about it in the papers 
- instead of that course it would be better for Toland to write 
to some of the leading members elect. 

I have no hesitation in saying that he will be supported by 
all the leading and personal friends of the President here

I am very desirous of making &amp; for that purpose, am par 
ticularly solicitious to avoid giving, at the present moment, 
any occasion for the revival of a jealousy which has been re 
cently and deeply felt, in regard to the apparent exclusion or 
omission from the Local Boards of persons favorable to the 
present administration. My stay in Baltimore was too short 
to allow me to consult with you on the subject, but M r . Colt 
mentioned the names of five gentlemen who were to be 
nominated and all of whom, it appeared, were in opposition 
to the present administration so that out of the whole 13, 
there are only two gentlemen who are in political harmony 
with the administration. You know, my dear Sir, how en

willing I am to introduce things of that kind into the affairs

exception of Mr. Hemphill, determined to support Mr. Clarke. Accordingly To-

of this letter lies in the fact that Lewis broached Biddle on the subject. The letter 
indicates that Lewis was trying to get in touch with Biddle on political affairs and 
that he fully realized the latter s influence.

Dear Sir. 

If, after the receipt of your first letter, sufficient time 
had remained for any valuable interference, on your part, at 
Washington, and you had not appeared quite so confident in 
your conclusions, I should have endeavoured to prove, that 
you were under a delusion. The die is now cast; 2 it there 
fore, only remains for you, to make the best of an unpromis 
ing cause. I have no doubt the executive was perfectly sin 
cere, and of this there is internal evidence sufficient, in the 
alternative he proposes. I am confident, had the subject been 
examined by him, without influence, he never would, for a 
moment, have entertained the project of establishing a Na 
tional Bank, the dangerous tendencies of which are so entirely 
at variance with his patriotism. 

As I have trespassed thus far, I feel, as if I would rather 
proceed, than retreat, with an assurance of my best re 
spects.

From Alexander Hamilton 89 

In presenting to your consideration, the reflections that 
have occurred in my mind, I can forsee no injury, and conse 
quently offer them gratuitously. In the first place, I would 
suggest the propriety of abstaining from the expression of 
any opinion intimating a want of fairness and integrity in the 
President; I am satisfied he feels no personal hostility and 
consequently no conduct of the bank ought to create such a 
feeling. I would next observe, have no confidence in Van 
Beuren; * as an aspirant for the Chief Magistracy, he is with 
out principle, and totally destitute of sincerity. In the West, 
especially in Kentucky, the friends of the Administration are 
against you, &amp; on the majority in this State, you can make as 
little calculation; these are sufficient causes to govern this 
gentleman; he may smile and seem gratious, it will only be 
to deceive. Under these circumstances, do you not think it 
would be very unwise policy to make any application to Con 
gress, in relation to the Bank at the present session? You can 
lose nothing by the delay, and may acquire, independent of 
the opportunity to explain the character of your operations, 
the nature of the exchanges and the absolute impossibility, 
in any well regulated and decently administered Institution, 
to equalize the currency, the chance of some political changes, 
either here or in Europe, which may have propitious influence 
on the measures of our government. To anticipate any con 
gressional patronage, in the existing state of things, in direct 
opposition to the President s avowed sentiments, the secret 
but artful hostility of aiming intriguers, with the whole host 
of Jackson Papers, would be to encourage expectations, cer 
tain to be disappointed, and if unsuccessful, ruinous. There 

1 This is the accepted view of Van Buren by the followers of the Bank, as is 
shown by the later correspondence. 



90 Correspondence of Nicholas Bid die 

can be no doubt as to the difficulties you will have to encoun 
ter, and there is as little question that precaution is your only 
dependence. 

The affairs of the Bank must not be brought under discus 
sion, through any friendly suggestion; if its opponents should 
commence the charge, the defence would afford a fair oppor 
tunity for explanation, and one a less ungracious to expose the 
anti republican scheme of a government bank, and the absurd 
expectation that the currency could be equalized by any, 
however organized. It would not be more absurd to contend 
that the government ought or could regulate our exchanges 
on Europe. These variations are the rights and consequences 
of free commercial intercourse, and any influence that pre 
vents extravagant changes affects all that is desirable; and 
I venture to predict, if a perfect equality ever be established, 
it will be of short duration, a deleterious stagnation; the paper 
fountains would overflow, until the country was deluged with 
irresponsible emissions. It is not improbable, M r Barbour, 
encouraged by the Executive thrust, may renew his proposi 
tion to sell the stock held by the Government, which would 
afford a favourable opportunity for every necessary explana 
tion; acting on the defensive, you avoid the natural preju 
dices of the mind, to prejudge and exclude information, and 
may make friends, instead of creating enemies. The nation 
can have no interest in the sale of the stock, for whatever 
may be its present price; without the interference of the 
bank, it would bring par value; if such be the fact well un 
derstood, the proposition would be defeated and the Bank 
will have gained, without risk, the opportunity for expla 
nations. 

To them who have observed the political horizon with

attention, there is no part of our internal history better 
established, than that the present affords no certain index 
of the future, lest it be to teach the lesson of prudence. 

I wish not to trespass longer; in the cause of the public, I am 
a volunteer, and while I do not transgress too far, harmless, 
in which situation I have the honor to be your

are quite sound &amp; correspond exactly with those entertained 
here. My impression is that these opinions expressed by the 
President are entirely &amp; exclusively his own, and that they 
should be treated as the honest tho erroneous notions of one 
who intends well. We have never had any idea of applying to 
Congress for a renewal of the Charter at the present session 
and of course should abstain from doing so now. Our

institution &amp; spreading a very salutary dread of the monster 
whom it is proposed to substitute for it. The consolations on 
the present occasion are, that this is a measure emanating 
exclusively from the President in person, being the remains 
of old notions of constitutionality, 1 that it is not a Cabinet 
measure nor a party measure ; that the whole foundation of the 
reproach of the want of a sound currency is so notoriously the 
very reverse of the fact; and that it has produced in all quar 
ters the most decided disapprobation. ....

. . . But seriously, I do not feel the least anxiety about 
this sortie of the President, who with, I am sure, the best 
intentions, has erred from want of information what I 
regret &amp; deeply regret, is the loss of individual property which 
it will occasion and the wound it will inflict on the credit of 
the country. When I look over the list of Stockholders &amp; see 
the number of females, of trust estates, &amp; societies chari 
table &amp; religious, it is melancholy to see their interest thus 
injured. This is particularly the case with South Carolina 
which owns, what two weeks ago was worth more than five 
millions of dollars. In regard to public credit, it is very fortu 
nate that the Chief Magistrate of the Country should make 
an official declaration of its insolvency, should pronounce 
that what it pays to foreigners in dividends &amp; capital &amp; what 
it receives for revenue is an unsound paper. . . .

Memorandum 93 

MEMORANDUM * 

Between Oct., 1829 and Jan. 1830 
Mr Biddle 

(Gen l Jackson) I was very thankful to you for your 
plan of paying off the debt sent to Major Lewis. (N.B.) I 
thought it was my duty to submit it to you. (Gen l Jackson) 
I would have no difficulty in recommending it to Congress, 
but I think it right to be perfectly frank with you I do not 
think that the power of Congress extends to charter a Bank 
out of the ten mile square. I do not dislike your Bank any 
more than all banks. But ever since I read the history of the 
South Sea bubble I have been afraid of banks. I have read 
the opinion of John Marshall 2 who I believe was a great 
&amp; pure mind and could not agree with him though if 
he had said, that as it was necessary for the purpose of the 
national gov* there ought to be a national bank I should have 
been disposed to concur; but I do not think that Congress 
has a right to create a corporation out of the 10 mile square. 
I feel very sensibly the services rendered by the Bank at 
the last payment of the national debt &amp; shall take an oppor 
tunity of declarring it publicly in my message to Congress. 

1 This memorandum is in Nicholas Biddle s handwriting of a conversation 
he had with General Jackson in Washington. This letter Professor Catterall took 
for a letter of President Jackson (cf. Catterall, op. cit., p. 184), which was later 
corrected by Professor Bassett in the latter s Life of Jackson (vol. n, pp. 599, 600). 
However, as published in Professor Bassett s Life of Jackson the memorandum does 
not bring out the significance of the extract. In order to do this it is necessary to 
keep the two parties distinct; and with this in view the editor has designated, in 
parenthesis, whether it is Biddle or Jackson who is talking. For the correction and 
final statement on this most important point the editor is indebted to Mr. Edward 
Biddle.

. . . The expressions in the message were the Presi 
dent s own not dictated nor suggested by any body else 
&amp; inserted in opposition to the wishes, if not the advice 
of all his habitual counsellors. It is not therefore a cabinet 
measure, nor a party measure, but a personal measure. As 
such it is far less dangerous because if the people know that 
this is not an opinion which they must necessarily adopt 
as a portion of their party creed but an opinion of the 
President alone a very honest opinion though a very er 
roneous one then the question will be decided on its own 
merits. . . .

BIDDLE TO JOHN POTTER ESQ. 

Phil a . Jan^ 9 th . 1830 
My dear Sir 

In our conversation yesterday, you expressed a wish to 
know the situation in which the Bank stands with regard 
to Mess rs . Gales &amp; Seaton of Washington. I will explain it to 
you with pleasure, as I presume the facts will remove an er 
roneous impression with respect to the Bank as well as those 
gentlemen themselves. 

They were formerly in succession, Directors of the Branch 
in Washington, their debt amounted at one time to about 
Sixty thousand dollars. In January 1828 being myself in 
Washington, I found it about Fifty thousand Dollars, which 
I thought much too high. I therefore resisted a recommenda 
tion to place one of them in the Board &amp; advised a reduction 
of the debt which has accordingly been done, so that I believe 
the whole responsibility of both parties does not now exceed 
between eleven &amp; twelve thousand dollars, there having been 
paid by a sale of their property since March last more than 
$30,000. Even of the present debt, about $5000 was not a loan 
from the Branch but was transferred from the Bank of Co 
lumbia in the settlement of its affairs with the Branch so 
that of the sum actually lent, the amount now due is, as you 
perceive, very small. 

In Nov r . 1828, they applied for a loan of $15,000 from the 
Parent Bank and their application was much recommended 
by their friends on the ground of the usefulness of their paper 
and the probability of its discontinuance if the loan were not 
made. But the Board refused to make the loan. They thought 
that the only true course of the Bank was to lend its money 



96 Correspondence of Nicholas Biddle 

on business principles and with adequate security that no 
distinction could be made between its friends and its enemies 
and that to go out of its way to make a loan to the editors 
of a newspaper would be to depart from its system of total 
indifference and entire abstraction, with regard to politics. In 
the present case too, the Bank might place itself in the very 
unbecoming attitude of sustaining at the seat of Government 
a paper opposed to the existing administration. 

You will think well of our impartiality when I mention 
that in running my eye over the Washington Pay List, to 
see the liabilities of Mess" Gales &amp; Sea ton, I remarked that 
our friend the Editor 1 of the Telegraph has between $11 and 
$12,000 an amount about the same as the Editors of the 
Intelligencer. In truth, you know, my dear Sir, how con 
stantly &amp; strenuously the Bank has resisted every thing like 
political influence believing as we all do that the moment the 
Institution is subjected to any party, whether in power or 
out of power, it becomes a curse to the country. 

I have spoken to you freely about the pecuniary affairs 
of these parties circumstances, which as a member of the 
Board I wish you to know &amp; I confide them entirely to your 
judgment and discretion. 

BIDDLE TO JOHN McKiM JR ESQR 

Phil a . Jan? i8 th . 1830 
Dear Sir 

I have received your friendly letter of the i6 th . inst for 
which I thank you. You ask my opinion about the fate of the 
Bank. I will tell you very frankly. I do not think this attack

upon it will do any harm, &amp; I think it will rather benefit it. 
I think so for two reasons First, that the ground of the 
attack (its failure to produce a sound &amp; uniform currency) 
is well known by every man in the country to be unfounded, 
the currency issued by the Bank being more sound &amp; uni 
form than that of any country in the world at this moment. 
Second, the substitute proposed for it is one which no man 
who values the liberties of the country could agree to estab 
lish. These things will be perfectly understood before long, 
&amp; cannot fail to operate in favor of the Bank. I think there 
fore that the Stockholders need be under no uneasiness. The 
Bank is at this moment in a high state of prosperity, having 
during the last year divided 7 per cent, &amp; made all the proper 
reservations and still retaining a surplus profit out of the 
years work of $223,000. What other Bank has done the same? 

WILLIAM B. LEWIS TO BIDDLE 

(Confidential) Washington 3 May 1830 

My D. Sir, 

I rec d . yours of the 27 ultimo the day previous to 
Judge Overtons departure, and consulted him with regard 
to the appointment of suitable persons to fill the places 
of those directors of your Nashville Board as will have shortly 
to retire. We found considerable difficulty in making proper 
selections, but have agreed to recommend the following 
named gentlemen. 

Thomas Crutcher 

Alexander Porter 

Francis B Fogg, or E. H. Foster 

Bernard Vanlier 

Joseph Vaulx. 



98 Correspondence of Nicholas Biddle 

The first named gentleman is one of the earliest settlers 
in the Country a man of great moral worth, and is at this 
time and has been for nearly thirty years, one of the Treas 
urers of Tennessee. You cannot, I should think, do better 
than to appoint him. M r . Porter was a member of the Nash 
ville Board when it was first organized an Irishman by 
birth, but has been a resident of the State upwords of thirty 
years and has lived, I should think, 25 years in Nashville 
a man of good moral character, of wealth, and needs none 
of your money. I have served with him and know he makes 
a good and safe director. Fogg and Foster are partners in 
law, both men of business and of high standing Foster 
was a member of your first Board. M r Vanlier is concerned 
in some of the iron works of this State he is a native of 
Penn a . a man of good moral character, well off, safe 
and judicious at least this was his character when I left 
Nashville, and I have no reason to believ it has undergone 
any change. Mr. Vaulx must be known to you as he has 
served two years as a director. He is a safe judicious man 
has married into an influential connection, and is doing a good 
business as a merchant. When he was first appointed some ob 
jection was made to him on account of his age; but as he has 
once been a member of the Board, and is several years older 
than he was, I presume no objection could now be made to 
him on that account. 

I am of opinion that Judge Overton himself would serve 
if appointed, tho I am not authorised to say so, never having 
heard him speak upon the subject. If it would not be incon 
venient for him to attend, living 5 or 6 miles from town, it 
would be good policy to appoint him; he is a brother-in-law 
of Judge White of the Senate, and a particular friend of the 



To William B. Lewis 99 

President. If his living in the Country should be an ob 
jection, I would advise you to put him in the place of 
Harding next Year, who also lives in the Country. Two of 
the Directors who go out this year should be returned to 
the Board as early as the rule, which governs such cases, 
will admit of. I mean Campbell and Farqueharsen, both of 
whom make good directors particularly the latter. With 
out wishing to disparage others I verily believe that M r . 
Farqueharsen is the very best director you have in your 
Board. 

The President is well, and desires me to present his respects 
to you. 

BIDDLE TO WILLIAM B. LEWIS ESQ 

(Private) Philada. May 8. 1830 

My Dear Sir. 

I thank you very much for your favor of the 3d: inst. 
with the list of names which I must prize, because 1 know 
that it is dictated by friendly feelings towards the Bank. As 
soon as I receive the nomination from Nashville I shall not 
fail to consult you about it. 

Since you left us, I have thought very anxiously about a 
subject which I mentioned to you, I mean the present dis 
position of the President towards the Bank. Since his opinions 
were stated in the Message, he has had an opportunity of 
examing more attentively the effects &amp; operations of the 
Institution, of witnessing its utility to the finances of the 
Government, &amp; of knowing the views of sound &amp; practical 
men from every part of the Country. He is also, I trust, satis 
fied that the powers of the Bank have not been abused for 
political purposes, &amp; that towards him &amp; his administration, 



ioo Correspondence of Nicholas Bid die 

the Bank has acted frankly, fairly &amp; cordially. It would be 
affectation in me not to say that those who conduct the 
Bank were exceedingly hurt &amp; pained by the opinion ex 
pressed by the President, that all their efforts to restore the 
Currency had failed. Yet, in the midst of their regrets, they 
knew too well their duties to suffer themselves to give the 
slightest political bias to the Bank, to be driven or tempted 
into opposition, or to abate in the slightest degree their zeal 
for the public service. The President has few more decided 
personal or political friends than many of those who are 
concerned in the administration of the Bank. To them, as 
well as to a large body of citizens, it would be exceedingly 
gratifying to know the feelings of the President towards the 
Bank at the present moment, because some of his injudicious 
friends &amp; many of his opponents seek to make an impression 
that such is his rooted dislike to the Institution, that he would 
refuse his sanction to a Continuance of the Bank, were the 
Charter renewed by both Houses of Congress. The first class 
say this because they dislike the Bank the second because 
they dislike the President; but I hope that neither the Presi 
dent nor the Bank will allow themselves to misunderstand 
each other, or to be estranged from each other, by the ma 
noeuvres or the indiscretions of their respective friends or 
enemies. Their true attitude is that of mutual Independence 
&amp; mutual respect, &amp; as far as I am concerned that attitude 
shall be fairly maintained. 

Whenever you have any thing gratifying on that sub 
ject which you can with perfect propriety communicate, 
I shall be obliged by hearing it, &amp; in the mean time, remain 
as always

... I think it probable I may have mentioned to you 
that it was believ d here by many that M r Van Buren had 
some agency in it, and the reasons assign d if not true are 
at least curious. This he look d upon the U.S. B. as a mass 
of power which might be employ d to bear on any point or ag t 
any point with no inconsiderable force and if a disposition 
sh d exist thus in directing its influence politically he as a 
political man (&amp; having had no agency either in its creation 
or thro its changes &amp; trials) naturally concluded it w d . be 
less likely to oppose old friends than to adopt new ones or 
strangers. Hence it was natural that he sh d not view it with 
a favorable political eye it might be perfectly harmless, or 
it might not and political men are not always satisfied 
with uncertainties. Like the old Gun it was safer out of reach 
&amp; harms way for tho it was said to have neither flint or pow 
der in it still it might go off. At this particular period the

2 Van Buren s career as Governor of New York was very brief. He was in 
augurated January I, 1829, but resigned March 12, to go into the Cabinet. "His 
inaugural message is said by Hammond to have been the best executive message 
ever communicated to the legislature." In this address he outlined the "safety 
fund" system which had been communicated to him by Joshua Forman. "Under 
this system all the Banks of the State, whatever their condition, were to contribute 
to a fund to be administered under state supervision, the fund to be a security for

sometimes are made by the most wise and prudent. These 
are among the leading reasons advanced by the knowing 
ones here touching M r Van Buren and his agency in the 
Message, and if groundless, they are at least curious as 1 
before stated. 

I have a very high opinion * of M r V. Buren. I believe him 
a safe and segacious man, or any way he has the reputation of 
being "mysterious" "dark" and "designing"; but un 
less I am entirely mistaken in my observations of him per 
sonally, I should say this impression is created for him more by 
a negative than a positive course of conduct politically, or 
rather by a peculiar and unusual system of Caution few 
men say less no man writes less on the passing political 

casional failure of Banks to redeem their notes, and making every Bank watchful 
of its associates. In compelling the Banks to submit to some general scheme the 
representatives of the people would, indeed, he said, enter into conflict with the 
claims of the great moneyed interests of the country; but what political exhibition 
so truly gratifying as the return to his constituents of the faithful public serv 
ant after having turned away every approach and put far from him every sinister 
consideration." Shephard, Edward M., Martin Van Buren (Boston, 1891), pp.

I told you in PhiK when you first mentioned the thing to 
me, that there must be some mistake, because the report was 
at variance with what / had heard him say upon the subject. 
In conversing with him a few days ago upon the subject he 
still entertained the opinion that a National Bank might be 
established that would be preferable to the present U.S. Bank ; 
but that, if Congress thought differently, and it was deemed 
necessary to have such a Bank as the present, with certain 
modifications he should not object to it. If the President finds 
that his scheme is not likely to take, I do not believe he will 
be opposed, altogether, to the present Bank. In haste I am 

ROSWELL L. COLT TO BIDDLE 

10 June (1830)? 
Dear Biddle 

Soon after the Presidents first message in which the 
subject of the Bank was mentioned Mr Howard had a conver 
sation with Mr Van Beuren * in which he told the Secretary 
that that part of the message refer y to the Bank had caused 
great surprise. Mr. V. B. answered he knew nothing of it, that 
he had not been consulted on the subject, and disapproaved 
of that part of the message &amp; that he was not hostile to the 
Bank. You recollect I wrote you at the time I was satisfied 
Mr V. B. was the author of those obnoxious paragraphs, &amp; 
Mr Poinsett says he is sure that V. B. is the man who has 
caused us all our trouble. . . . 

1 Van Buren seems to have tried hard to keep aloof from an open attack on 
the Bank. The Bank men always claimed he was the cause of their trouble; but 
Professor Bassett, in his Life of Jackson (cf. chap. 29), shows that Van Buren was 
not anxious to be implicated in the various moves against the institution. 



From Henry Clay 105 

HENRY CLAY TO BIDDLE 

Ashland 14 th. June 1830 
Dear Sir 

. . . Unless I am deceived by information, received 
from one of the most intelligent Citizens of Virginia, the 
plan was laid at Richmond during a visit made to that place 
by the Secy, of State last autumn, to make the destruction 
of the Bank the basis of the next Presidential Election. The 
message of the President, and other indications, are the sup 
posed consequences of that plan. 1 

1 This letter is in Clay s handwriting and is highly significant. It is a well- 
known fact that Jackson was strongly advised by many of his friends not to in 
troduce the Bank question in his message of 1829. On October 22, 1829, Felix 
Grundy wrote to Jackson outlining the main features of a National Bank and con 
cluded as follows: " I hope to be in Washington a week or ten days before Congress 
convenes and will lose no time before I see you. I intend to set out for Richmond 
on the 25th instant to see the Virginia Convention in session thence to the city." 
On November 27, 1829, Ingham wrote to Jackson advising against the Bank 
attack; on December 17, 1829, Benton sent Jackson a copy of Randolph s idea of 
a National Bank; while on the same day the Attorney-General likewise opposed 
introducing the question. (Cf. Jackson MSS. in Library of Congress.) Thus, with 
the single exception of Benton the Jackson MSS. show that all the friends of the 
President cautioned Jackson on the expediency of raising the issue. The Van Buren 
MSS. contain no mention of the Bank message. 

Moreover, it is established that Van Buren was opposed to interfering in the 
struggle. Cf. Bassett, Life of Jackson, vol. n, pp. 631, 640, 740. 

Yet Professor Ambler, in his Life of Thomas Ritchie, p. 131, shows that Van 
Buren visited Richmond about this period. Therefore the question arises, could 
the Southern politicians have induced or suggested to Van Buren the idea of an 
attack on the Bank, holding out to the latter the hope of the next Presidential elec 
tion, while their main idea was to gain time for their own propaganda? It was in 
the Virginia Convention of 1829 that the Calhoun doctrine of defending slavery was 
first enunciated. Therefore the Calhounites, by projecting the Bank and raising 
a hue and cry, might further their own scheme. However, it was spoiled by Jack 
son crushing nullification in 1830. Seeing they had failed in this attempt, they im 
mediately came out clearly for the Bank. Thus, in the view of these late histori 
cal events Clay s letter suggests many interesting points, for if this suggestion is 
sound the Bank controversy shifts from Washington to Richmond.

(reed Aug 4 . 2, 1830) 
Dear Sir 

Yours of the 22 nd ultimo is duly received, and the re 
quest therein contained attended to as far as yet in my power, 
the President of the United States arrived in Town last Tues 
day. I done myself the pleasure of waiting on him, as an old 
friend, and at the request of a number of our most respectable 
citizens made him a tender of apartments in my house during 
his Stay in Town, which he accepted, and left us on Thursday 
last for the Hermitage; during his Stay at my house I had 
frequent opportunities, and did not neglect the subject of 
your letter. I enforced every argument that I could make bear 
on the subject, or that would be of any service in removing 
his prejudice. I brought to his view the improvement of our 
Town and Country since the establishment of this office, and 
Contrasted the year of 1826 with the present year of 1830. 
on the Subject of exchange, in the former year We generally 
paid a premium on Bills drawn on any of the Eastern cities 
of from 9 to 12 per cent; now 1830, We can obtain Checks, 
payable at one day after sight at any place where the United 
States Bank have a Branch at a premium of one half to one 
per cent which is little more than pays postage, he appears 
to be well satisfied with the facilities that the Bank have 
given to Government and individuals, in transferring their 
funds from One point to another, and acknowledges that a 
Bank such as the present only can do so. he appears to be 
genrally pleased with the Management of the United States

and Branches and particularly so with this office. I have 
taken considerable pains and gave him all the information I 
consistently could on Banking Subjects and belive have 
convinced him that the Present Bank and Branches could 
not be dispenced with without Manifest injury to the Coun 
try and particularly so to this Western Country, as no other 
Currency could be Substituted. On the subject of his favour 
ite plan I touched lightly, but let him know that I thought 
it would be more dangerous to Our liberties than than the 
U S. Bank, the Only objection he appears to have to the pres- \ 
ent Bank is that a great part of the Stock is held by For 
eigners consequently the interest is taken from the Coun 
try, he is well satisfied that Politicks have no influence in 
Bank or in the Choice of Directors, and I am well convinced 
that he will not interfer with Congress on the Subject of re 
newing the Charter of the Bank. Altho on this subject he 
keeps his opinion to himself he speaks of You in the most 
exalted terms and says there is No Gentleman that can be 
found would manage the Bank better or do the Bank &amp; 
Country More Justice. I am Sir very respectfully your 

BIDDLE TO JOSIAH NICHOL ESQ. 

(confidential) Philada. Augt: 3. 1830. 

Dear Sir. 

Since writing to you this morning it has occurred to 
me that you may have it in your power to do a great service to 
the Bank as well as to Gen 1 : Jackson. No man can now fail to 
perceive that the remarks on the Bank in the President s Mes 
sage were unfortunate, &amp; have tended to make many sober 
men uneasy about the stability of our finances &amp; the sound 
ness of our currency. As respects the Bank, it has gained 



i o 8 Correspondence of Nicholas Bid die 

friends by the reports in Congress &amp; by the general discussion 
of its affairs throughout the Country, so that at present I 
consider the Bank decidedly popular with the great mass of 
the Community. As a proof of it we have now before us no 
less than ten applications for branches one in New York, 
one in Ohio, one in Virginia, two in South Carolina, one in 
Florida, one in Indiana, &amp; I believe that there is a decided 
majority in both houses of Congress favorable to it. 

Under these circumstances the opposition to the President 
will naturally endeavor to turn the Bank question against 
him to represent him &amp; his friends as unfriendly to sound 
currency. 

In this the Bank will give of course no assistance. It means 
to be as it has been perfectly neutral &amp; unpartial minding 
its own business &amp; not medling with other people s &amp; no 
thing shall force it or seduce it from its strict line of duty. 
But it is worthy of great consideration for Genl : Jackson &amp; 
his friends whether it would not be right for them to remove 
the impression of his &amp; their hostility to the Bank. I do not 
believe that Genl : Jackson or his particular friends are hostile 
to the Bank. He expressed his doubts &amp; his belief about it. I 
am sure he was wrong, but I am equally sure that he was per 
fectly honest, &amp; if I do not much mistake his character he will 
if he thinks he has not done justice to the Bank in the first 
instance, be ready to do it ample justice when on more re 
flection &amp; examination he becomes satisfied that he can do 
so. This he will have a fine opportunity of doing &amp; at the same 
time of disarming his political antagonists of what they may 
make a powerful weapon at the next meeting of Congress. 
Genl: Jackson does not perhaps know (for persons in high 
stations do not always hear the whole truth) that the part 



70 Josiah Nichol 109 

of his Message which relates to the Bank has been a source 
of regret to many of his most attached friends &amp; to most if 
not all the political associates around him. He has now a 
fair x opportunity of converting that right into pleasure &amp; 
triumph. 

In his next message he will be able to state that since his 
last message nearly 10 millions of principal of the public 
Debt were paid off in January &amp; July. In his last message 
he was kind enough to speak with approbation of the agency 
of the Bank in making that payment without the least in 
convenience to the Country. Now, what I think his friends 
desire is that he should renew the expression of that approba 
tion to the Bank it would perhaps be an act of justice 
and it would be an act both of justice &amp; policy to himself &amp; 
his friends by correcting an opinion that has gone abroad 
that he &amp; they are unfriendly to the Institution. He could say 
this without looking to the past or the future without 
committing himself or his friends &amp; the friends of the Bank 
would be gratified by such an evidence that his feelings were 
kindly towards the institution. This is a very simple &amp; 
easy thing to do &amp; yet I believe it would be very useful. 
Now how shall it be brought about? I have an idea that if 
any body can do it you can, &amp; if Judge Overton 2 were dis 
posed to aid he could be very useful. I submit the matter to 
your judgment to do what you may think right. I suggest it 
to you as a friend of Genl : Jackson &amp; a friend of the Bank 
believing that it would be useful to both but as I have 
made it a law not to interfere in political matters in case

you should think the suggestion worth acting upon, you will 
have the goodness to do it without reference to me. 

HENRY CLAY TO BIDDLE 

(confidential) Ashland nth. Sept. 1830 

Dear Sir 

Major Tilford having mentioned to me that you 
were considering whether it was proper to apply, at the ensu 
ing Session of Congress, for a renewal of the charter of the 
B.U.S. and that you entertained some doubts on the subject, 
I had a conversation with him and Mr. Harper, 1 which I in 
formed them that they were at liberty to communicate to 
you. I added that, perhaps, I might address a letter to you on 
the same matter. A leisure hour allows me to fulfill that in 
tention. 

It may be assumed, as indisputable, that the renewal of 
the charter can never take place, as the Constitution now 
stands, against the opinion and wishes of the President of the 
U.S. for the time being. A bill, which should be rejected by 
him for that purpose, could never be subsequently passed 
by the constitutional majority. There would always be found 
a sufficient number to defeat such a bill, after its return with 
the President objection, among those who are opposed to 
the Bank on constitutional grounds, those who, without be 
ing influenced by constitutional considerations, might be op 
posed to it upon the score of expediency, and those who would 
be operated upon by the influence of the Executive. 

I think it may even be assumed that a bill to renew the 

I Charter cannot be carried through Congress, at any time, 

with a neutral executive. To ensure its passage, the Presidents

in 



opinions and those of at least a majority of his Cabinet must 
be known to be in favor of the renewal. 

President Jackson, if I understand the paragraph of his 
message at the opening of the last Session of Congress, relat 
ing to the Bank, is opposed to it upon Constitutional objec 
tions. Other sources of information corroborate that fact. If 
he should act upon that opinion, and reject a bill, presented 
for his aprobation, it would be impossible to get it through 
Congress at the next Session against the Veto. 

That a strong party, headed by Mr. V. Buren, some Vir 
ginia politicians and the Richmond Enquirer, intend, if prac 
ticable to make the Bank question the basis of the next Pres 
idential election, I have, I believe, heretofore informed you. 
I now entertain no doubt of that purpose. I have seen many 
evidences of it. The Editors of certain papers have received 
their orders to that effect, and embrace every occasion to act 
in conformity with them. This fact cannot have escaped your 
observation. 1 

If you apply at the next Session of Congress, you will play 
into the hands of that party. They will most probably, in the 
event of such application, postpone the question, until an 
other Congress is elected. They will urge the long time that 
the Charter has yet to run; that therefore there is no necessity 
to act at the next Session on the measure; and that public 
sentiment ought to be allowed to develope itself &amp;c. These 
and other considerations will induce Congress, always dis 
posed to procrastinate, to put off the question. In the mean 
time, the public press will be put in motion, every prejudice 
excited and appeals made to every passion. The question will

Jackson prints were beginning their strenuous attacks on the Bank.

incorporate Itself with all our elections, and especially with 
that as to which there is so great a desire that it should be in 
corporated. It will be difficult, when Congress comes finally to 
decide the question, to obtain a majority against the accu 
mulation of topics of opposition. 

But suppose, at the next Session, on the contingency of 
your application for a renewal of the Charter, instead of post 
poning, Congress was to pass a bill for that object, and it 
should be presented to the President, what would he do with 
it? If, as I suppose, he would reject it, the question would 
be immediately, in consequence, referred to the people, and 
would inevitably mix itself with all our elections. It would 
probably become, after the next Session, and up to the time 
of the next Presidential election, the controlling question in 
American politics. The friends of the Bank would have to 
argue the question before the public against the official act of 
the President, and against the weight of his popularity. 

You would say what ought the Corporation to do? I stated 
to the above gentleman that, in my opinion, unless you had 
a satisfactory assurance that your application at the next 
Session would be successful, you had better not make it. If, 
contrary to my impressions, you could receive such an assur 
ance from both departments of the Government, who would 
have to act on the case, that would present a different state 
of the question, and would justify the presentation of your 
petition. 

If not made at the next Session, when should it be made? 
I think the Session immediately after the next Presidential 
election would be the most proper time. Then every thing will 
be fresh; the succeeding P. election will be too remote to be 
shaping measure in reference to it; and there will be a disposi- 



From Henry Clay 113 

tion to afford the new administration the facilities in our fiscal 
affairs which the B. of the U.S. perhaps alone can render. 
But suppose Gen 1 Jackson should be again elected? If that 
should be the case, he will have probably less disposition than 
he now has to avail himself of any prejudices against the 
Bank. He will then have also less influence; for it may be 
loosely asserted, at least as a general rule, that the President 
will have less popularity in his second than in his first term. 
And that I believe would emphatically be the fate of the pres 
ent President. At all events, you will be in a better condition 
by abstaining from applying to renew the charter during his 
first term, than you would be in, if you were to make the ap 
plication and it should be rejected. Upon the supposition of 
such a rejection, and that the question should be afterwards 
blended with the Presidential contest, and Gen 1 . Jackson 
should be elected, his re-election would amount to something 
like a popular ratification of the previous rejection of the 
renewal of the charter of the Bank. Indeed, if there be an 
union of the Presidents negative of the Bank bill with the 
next P. election, and he should be reelected, would it not be 
regarded as decisive against any Bank of the U.S. hereafter? 

My opinion, upon the whole, then is, that it would be un 
wise to go to Congress without something like a positive assur 
ance of success at the next Session; and that the Corporation, 
without displaying any solicitude in regard to the continua 
tion of its charter, had better preserve, in the able and faith 
ful administration of its affairs, which it has of late years 
manifested, and go to Congress at the first moments of calm 
which shall succeed the approaching Presidential storm. 

I hope I need say nothing, by way of apology, to satisfy 
you of the friendly feelings which have prompted this letter;

. . . Your institution is destined however to encounter 
a Severe Struggle, for the renewal of its Charter. I see in 
various quarters of the Union evidences of determination to 
resist it, and it is not the least striking of these, that M r Clay 
who we all know is latitudinarian enough to have no con 
stitutional scruples on this, or on any other Subject is un 
willing to Commit himself upon this measure the inference 
is obvious. He doubts the result of the application for the new 
charter, and is unwilling to hazard his popularity by becom 
ing its advocate. But for the course pursued by South Caro

I have been prevented by other occupations from say

I could not consistently adopt your suggestion. It seems that 
out of 9 there are 4 gentlemen friendly to the administration. 
This is accidental, but I am glad of it, for the fact shows that 
there was no principle of exclusion that the business men

were taken indiscriminately from all parties &amp; the division \ 
is sufficient to prevent any political partiality on either side, 
which, however, I believe neither side feels nor exercises. To 
introduce new members members so well qualified as those 
now there for the purpose of making any political balance, 
would be wrong in itself &amp; would expose us to the very im 
putation we wish to avoid of looking to party considerations. 
On the whole, therefore, I thought it better to let the business 
considerations prevail over politics. The only regret I feel is, 
that I had it not in my power to agree to what might per 
haps have gratified you. 

BIDDLE TO HENRY CLAY ESQR 

Philad a Nov r 3 rd 1830 
My dear Sir 

I have purposely delayed answering your favor of the 
II th of Sept r until I could speak with some degree of confi 
dence as to the course which will be adopted in reference to the 
subject of it. In the mean time I have read repeatedly and 
with renewed interest all your remarks, proceeding as I know 
they do from one who with ample materials of information 
&amp; great sagacity in employing them gives the result of his 
reflections with a sincere desire to serve the institution. For 
this in any event you will accept my grateful thanks. 

After keeping the subject long under advisement in order 
to observe the latest development of facts, I am now satis 
fied, that it would be inexpedient to apply at present for the 
renewal of the charter. My belief is from all I have seen &amp; 
read &amp; heard, that there is at this moment a majority of both 
Houses of Congress favourable to a renewal, and moreover 
that the President would not reject the bill. The tempta-

tion is therefore great to take advantage of a propitious state 
of feelings like this. But then the Hazard is not to be disguised. 
A great mass of those who if they were obliged to vote at 
all would vote favourably will prefer not voting if it can be 
avoided, and the dread of responsibility, the love of postpon- 
ment &amp; the vis-inertia inherent in all legislative bodies would 
combine to put off the question during the approaching 
short session. To pass both houses &amp; be rejected by the Presi 
dent, to be rejected in either house, to be postponed in either 
house, to be brought forward in any shape and not be finally 
and favorably acted upon are degrees of evil but the mild 
est of them a great evil, much to be deplored &amp; to be avoided 
if possible. My impression then is that nothing but a cer 
tainty of success should induce an application now. To this 
I am the more inclined because time is operating in favor of 
the Bank, by removing prejudices, and diffusing a general 
conviction of its utility. 

Having made up my mind on the subject, I am gratified 
that this, which is the first expression I have made of this 
opinion, should be communicated to one whose views have so 
largely influenced my own. It will always afford me great 
pleasure to receive the benefit of your further suggestions on 
this or any other subject, being with great respect and regard 1

est of the Bank of the United States to apply for the renewal 
of its charter at the Present Session the reasons for apply 
ing now will be fair &amp; such as must be approved of. If noth 
ing had been said in the Message, perhaps the best policy 
would have been to lay quiet at the present, but now the 
public mind will be uncertain as to the fate of the Bank; Sac- 
rafices may be made by the time &amp; the currency of the Coun

ROBERT SMITH TO BIDDLE 

Confidential Washington Dec 1 ". 13, 1830 

Dear Sir 

I gathered from a conversation with Major Lewis, of 
the President s family, that altho the President is decidedly 
in favor of a Bank such as he recommended to Congress, yet 
if a bill were to pass both houses, renewing the charter of 
the Bank U States with certain modifications, the President 
would not with hold his approval. What these modifications 
were, I could not distinctly understand; but I believe that

the principal one was to take from the Bank the right of es 
tablishing branches in the states, unless with the consent of 
the states, &amp; it was intimated that a provision of the kind 
would really be beneficial to the Bank, in as much as our 
career if the jealousy with which the States regard the Bank 
would be removed, &amp; it was not doubted but that sooner 
or later every state would solicit the establishment of a 
Branch. It was also intimated that the holding of real estate 
by the bank was very objectionable. The right to do so how 
ever, is so essential to the safety of the Bank, that it cannot 
be perceived how the relinquishment of it can be yielded. . . . 

BIDDLE TO JOSEPH HEMPHILL 

Philad. Dec. 14. 1830 
My dear Sir, 

I take the earliest opportunity which my occupations 
have permitted to consult you on the subject of attempting 
the renewal of the Charter during the present session of 
Congress. 

Until the arrival of the President s message my impressions 
were these. I believed that there was a decided majority of 
both houses of Congress who, if they had been obliged to vote 
at all, would have voted for the renewal. But not being 
obliged to vote, they would avoid voting. Many would say 
that the question was premature, that they ought not to fore- 
stal the judgment of their successors, that it was a short 
session in short the indifferent &amp; the timid would com 
bine with the opponents of the Bank to postpone the ques 
tion. Once brought forward &amp; postponed, it would of course 
be blended up with the elections, &amp; become one of those po 
litical matters judged exclusively by party considerations. 



70 yoseph Hemphill 1 1 9 

On the other hand if it passed through both Houses, &amp; was 
negatived by the Pres e ., from that time forward it would 
become a question between the Bank &amp; him, &amp; if he were 
reflected, he would construe it as a decision by the nation 
against the Bank, &amp; act accordingly. There was also not un- 
mingled with these views the hope that as the President had 
mentioned the subject to Congress he would have left it to 
them, &amp; that time &amp; experience would have made him more 
wise &amp; less pertinacious. Such seemed the state of the case 
in November. 

It is certainly much altered now. 

The President has himself again thrust it before Congress, 
&amp; seems determined to make it an electioneering topic. By 
inviting the State Gov ts . to strengthen themselves by usurp 
ing the whole circulating medium of the country, he will 
probably excite them to instruct their delegations in Con 
gress to oppose the charter, &amp; it is to be presumed that in 
no event will he sanction a bill for the re-charter. . . . 

I believe it greatly for the interest of the country to settle 
this question during the present session. My doubt is whether 
it would be expedient in reference to the ultimate settlement 
of that question for the Bank to ask for a renewal. But the 
benefit of settling it may possibly be obtained without the risk 
of prejudicing the Bank in case of failure by another course 
which is this. 

The Committee of Ways &amp; Means 1 have now the Presi 
dent s Message before them. If that Comm e . were to say that 
this is a question which must not be left in its present posi 
tion, that all the great interests of the country are hazarded 
by this suspense, &amp; altho they did not intend to stir it, yet 

1 McDuffie was chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.

now that it has been agitated it ought to be put to rest if 
they would say this, the way would be open. If the Comm e . 
were to say to the Bank whether it would take at once the re 
newal &amp; on what terms, we should answer by return of mail 
in a manner no doubt satisfactory, &amp; the Comm e . might 
then report a bill of a single section continuing the Charter 
for twenty years after the expiration of its present charter on 
the payment of the stipulated bonus. In this way the rechar- 
ter would present itself, not so much in the light of an appli 
cation by individuals, but as a financial measure, introduced 
by the financial organ of the House. If it succeeded well. 
If it failed, the Bank might hereafter come forward with 
its proposal without prejudice of its having been once de 
feated. . . . 

JOHN NORVALL x TO BIDDLE 

Philadelphia, Dec. 1 6, 1830. 
Dear Sir, 

. . . My opinion, if it be worth anything to you, is, 
that the bank ought forthwith to make application for the 
renewal of its charter. If a bill for the purpose should be 
passed, General Jackson will be more afraid to put his veto 
to it than after his re-election. If he should negative such a 
bill, the fact will go far toward preventing his re-election. 
Besides, the present congress is probably more favorable than 
the next will be to the bank. In any event, it appears to me 
to be the interest of the stockholders and officers to bring the 
matter at once to issue. . . .

Philadelphia, Dec. 19, 1830 
Dear Sir, 

I am going on with the examination of the list of mem 
bers, with a view to ascertain who are for, and who are 
against, the renewal of your bank charter. MrLetcher, 1 of 
Kentucky, tells me that there are 74 opposition members, 
who, he is satisfied, will vote in solid phalanx for the bank. 
At least 22 of the 26 members from Pennsylvania will vote for 
it. They, added to the 74 will make 96. Nearly all the South 
Carolina, a portion of Virginia and North Carolina members, 
will vote for it; and scattering Jackson votes in all the other 
states will be obtained for the bank. Upon the most moderate 
calculation, 130 votes may be considered as certain. That 
number will leave, in the house, a minority of 84. In the sen 
ate, of 48 votes, 22 opposition members may be set down 
as certain for the bank. General Barnard 2 of our state, 
and Mr. Livingston 3 of Louisiana, General Hayne 4 and 
Judge Smith 5 of South Carolina, and Mr. Tazewall 6 of Vir 
ginia, Jackson members, are for it. These make 27, leaving 
a minority of 21. There is also General Smith of Maryland, 
making 28, and leaving a minority of 20, with the probability 
of two or three more Jackson votes. The preceding statement 
is the most unfavorable in the project congress for the 
bank. . . .

Dear Sir 

... In respect to Gen 1 Jackson &amp; Mr Van Buren I 
have not the slightest fear of either of them, or both of them. 
Our country-men are not naturally disposed to cut their own 
throats to please any body, &amp; I have so perfect a reliance 
on the spirit &amp; sense of the nation, that I think we can de

Dear Biddle 

. . . Tis said that Van Buren &amp; Calhoun have kissed 
&amp; made up their dispute it is a fact that Calhoun has 
dined with M r Van Buren and now the Secretarys party 
are crowing under the idea, that Calhoun is courting the 
favor &amp; forbearance of Mr V B at which it is Said that M r 
C. is not a little vexed. If Jackson determines to run again 
for the Presidency, &amp; Calhoun does the Same, as he says he 
will, then Van B. &amp; his party will denounce Calhoun &amp; throw 
him off as they have Duff Green. The Clay party are trying 
to get Calhoun to separate himself from Jackson they say 
that heretofore he was sound on the leading questions, U.S. 
Judiciary, Bank U States, Tariff &amp; internal improvements,

and that all he has to do is find some fit &amp; proper occasion to 
come out &amp; declare that his views on these important subjects 
are the same he had formerly entertained this the Clay 
party tell him. Clay is our first Choice You are Second, 
but that we cannot carry our party for You if You are against 
the Judiciary, the Currency, the finding employment at 
home for our surplus Labour, or new avenues through which 
to distribute the product of that Labour and it is hoped 
he will listen. I fear not.

Dear Sir, 

. . . What I can do &amp; will do is this. It is obvious that 
a great effort will be made to array the influence of the Execu 
tive &amp; all his party against the Bank. It is not less evident 
that our most effectual resistance is the dissemination of 
useful knowledge among the people, and accordingly I am 
endeavoring to convey to all classes real &amp; positive informa 
tion in regard to the working of the institution &amp; its bene 
ficial influence on the prosperity of the nation. To do this 
newspapers must be used, not for their influence, but merely 
as channels of communication with the people. If you think 
the one in question a useful vehicle of information I will em 
ploy it and in this way. 

I have many articles about the Bank articles of interest 
to a general reader &amp; which would occupy no more space 
than would be necessarily given to articles on other topics, 
nor occasion I presume any extra expence such for in 
stance as M r M c DufHe s &amp; Smith s reports or the extracts 
from M r Gallatin s article. For the insertion of these I will 



124 Correspondence of Nicholas Riddle 

pay either as they appear or in advance. Thus for instance if 
you will cause the articles I have indicated and others which 
I may prepare to be inserted in the newspaper in question, I 
will at once pay to you one thousand dollars. If this may 
facilitate the arrangement you propose I shall be glad. There 
is as you perceive nothing in this communication which I 
should care to conceal, but as it might be misconstrued, I 
inclose your letter to me &amp; request that you will have the 
goodness to return what I have written to you. It will give 
me great pleasure to see you on the 15 th , and in the mean time 
I am with sincere regard &amp; many thanks for your presenting 
the subject to me.

Philada: Feb: 10. 1831. 
My Dear Sir, 

I have had the pleasure of receiving your letter of the 
8 th : inst. inclosing a letter from Mr. Green, 1 expressing his 
wish to borrow from the Bank twenty thousand dollars. I will 
submit it to the Board at their next meeting. In the mean 
time I can only say that it will receive from them a kind &amp; 
respectful consideration as a matter of business, without look 
ing to the past or the future. The Bank is glad to have friends 
from conviction, but seeks to make none from interest. For 
myself, I love the freedom of the Press too much to complain 
of its occasional injustice to me, &amp; if the loan be made, it 
shall be with a perfect understanding, to be put into the Note 
if necessary, that the borrower is to speak his mind about the 
Bank, just as freely as he did before which I take to be 
"ample room &amp; verge enough."

Phil 3 . Feby 28 th . 1831 
Dear Sir 

... In the general views expressed in your letter I en 
tirely concur. It is deeply to be regretted that the President 
has taken this course, and we must endeavor as much as pos 
sible to counteract its effect. But our weapons are truth and 
reason our appeal is from the passions to the understand 
ing, &amp; the dissemination of correct views of the nature &amp; oper 
ations of the Bank is the most efficient engine we can employ. 
Further than this we ought not to go. I should lament deeply 
that those connected with the Bank should be active or zeal 
ous or conspicuous in political contests. This would be wrong 
in itself: it is a violation of that perfect neutrality which is 
the first duty of the Bank. It would be injudicious too, even 
on calculation, since no advantage to be derived from their 
efforts would overbalance the general evil from their actual 
or supposed interference. . . .

the former Bank, how much of the opposition to the Bank 
was the result of downright ignorance of its meaning and its 
operations, and I have lived to see the very individuals the 
most zealous in the work of destruction, candidly confess, as 
they have grown older and wiser, that they did not properly 
appreciate the institution. I know what was then wanting 
and I am resolved that it shall not now be wanting. I saw 
the manner in which the small demagogues of that day de 
ceived the community and I mean to try to prevent the 
small demagogues of this day from repeating the same de

tion of plain honest truths by means of the press. There is 
one mode in which you can much assist me. It is by the trans 
mission of a list, such as your long practice has enabled you 
to accumulate, of citizens with their respective addresses in 
various parts of the United States. Your own subscription 
list, with the additions which you propose to make for in 
creased diffusion of your paper, would form excellent ma

Dear Sir 

. . . The President has undertaken to say of the Bank 
that which is wholly without foundation &amp; to denounce the 
institution. The whole influence of his government, &amp; of the 
presses subservient to his government, is employed in en 
deavoring to break down the Bank. In this situation, the 



To J. Harper 1 2 7 

Bank can only find safety in such explanations of its pro 
ceedings as will satisfy the country that it has been justly 
assailed &amp; that its operations are highly beneficial. But how 
it is to make these explanations, except thro the press, the 
only channel of communication with the people ? And if it 
employs that channel, why should it ask of printers to in 
sert its explanations gratuitously? If a grocer wishes to ap 
prize the public that he has a fresh supply of figs, the printer 
whom he employs for that purpose never thinks of giving his 
labor for nothing, but charges him for his trouble in inserting 
the advertisement. If the Bank in a like manner wishes a 
printer to insert information about its concerns, why should 
it not pay him for his trouble? The payment for the printing 
of documents thus disseminated is not only so proper but so 
just, that one is amused by the affected squemishness of the 
other printers who do not happen to be employed when they 
denounce the Bank for circulating documents which Con 
gress itself has ordered to be disseminated by means of extra 
copies, and what is worse than all, paying the printers for 
their labor. . . .

MEMORANDUM 1 BY BIDDLE 

Oct r . 19, 1831. 

About ten o clock today M r . M c Lane, Sec y of the Treas y 
called to see me at the Bank. He had come to Phil 3 princi 
pally for the purpose of conversing with me after he had seen 
the President. 

He now stated that he had seen the President, and explained 
to him the course which he proposed to pursue in regard to the 
Bank. He had done this in order that there might be no mis 
apprehension on the part of the Pres* of his views &amp; the con 
sequences which might result from what he proposed to say 
in his report. 

He said to the President that he thought the act of Con 
gress which directed the Secretary of the Treasury to report 
annually to Congress made it the duty of that officer to pre 
sent his own views &amp; on his own responsibility and that the 
Executive stood rather in the light of a mediator between 
him (the Sec y ) &amp; the Legislature. That such had always been 
the construction of the powers of the Secretaries. (This was 
obviously an infusion by M r Dickins to whom I left a volume 
with all the passages marked which I thought might encour 
age this opinion.) He proceeded to explain to the Pres* what 
his intentions were. He means to speak of the power of the 

1 Catterall, op. cit., pp. 209-211, note. This memorandum is quoted in full in 
Catterall s book and the subject discussed in full in the above-mentioned pages. 



Memorandum 1 2 9 

Gov to pay off the whole of the debt on the 3 d of March 1833 
with the aid of the Bank stock; that this stock if sold out 
would occasion alarm in the country &amp; the panic would sink 
its value; whereas he was satisfied that the Bank would take 
it at a reasonable price, not less certainly than eight millions. 
This would give him an opportunity of speaking of the Bank 
in the most favorable manner, recommending the continuance 
of the charter of the present Bank in preference to a new one, 
with such modifications as without injuring the institution 
might be useful to the country &amp; acceptable to the Executive. 
This he meant to present in the strongest manner he could 
to Congress. All this he explained particularly to the Presi 
dent who made no objection whatever. For greater precision 
he had put down the heads of what he meant to say in his 
report &amp; showed them to the President. M r Livingston by 
request of M r M c Lane was present at this meeting. 

It had been previously understood between M r Livingston 
&amp; M r MLane that the Pres* should say nothing in the 
message about the Bank. The President acquiesced tho re 
luctantly in this, because he thought he could not well be si 
lent with consistentcy. But in my (N B s) conversations with 
him M r M c Lane I had expressed the opinion that his silence 
would not be so useful as his mentioning the subject. The 
matter was therefore renewed with Mess" Livingston &amp; M c 
Lane &amp; the Pres* and it was resolved that he should intro 
duce the subject in this way that having on former occa 
sions brought the question before the Congress it was now 
left with the representatives of the people. 

M r M c Lane with a view to show the Pres* the full extent 
to which his report might lead, said that perhaps when his 
report was presented &amp; referred to the Comm 66 of Ways &amp; 



130 Correspondence of Nicholas Riddle 

Means M r M c Duffie in his present mode of thinking in regard 
to the Bank might choose to introduce a bill into Congress for 
continuing the Charter &amp; if so he (M r M c Lane) could not with 
the views which he entertained of the Bank make any oppo 
sition to it. The President said he would be sorry if the ques 
tion were forced upon him in that way. 

I said it would be necessary to scan very accurately the 
Pres tJ s speech so that there might not be a shade of opinion 
expressed against it, or any declaration that having once ex 
pressed his views &amp; having no reason to change them he would 
now leave it to Congress &amp;c. M r M c Lane said certainly no 
such expression could or should be introduced, as it would not 
be in harmony or consistency with his own (M r M s) report. 

M r M c Lane said that he would be willing to charter the 
Bank without any bonus, but intimated that he thought a 
large bonus would be required, &amp; said that this should be 
considered in our proposed purchase of Bank stock. 

He said that he thought the greatest danger of the Bank 
was from those who wished to pull down this Bank in order 
to build up another, that a M r West of Salem had been very 
pressing on that point. I said there were I believed some capi 
talists in Boston &amp; New York who were anxious about it, 
but I thought they had little political weight. He said that 
the argument was that to continue it would be a monopoly. 

In regard to the period of applying for a renewal, he does 
not wish to be considered as the adviser of the Bank because 
it might be imputed to him that he was acting in concert 
with the institution, but he renewed the opinion which he 
expressed at Washington that it was doubtful (indeed he 
seemed to be more inclined now to think it inexpedient) 
whether it would be expedient to apply this year. His idea 



Memorandum 131 

was that if it were put to the President as a test, he would 
be more disposed to reject it on that very account. The Pres 1 
is now perfectly confident of his election the only ques 
tion is the greater or the less majority, but he is sure of suc 
cess &amp; wishes to succeed by a greater vote than at the first 
election. If therefore while he is so confident of reelection 
this question is put to him as one affecting his reelection, he 
might on that account be disposed to put his veto on it, if 
he be as it were dared to do it. For what I see, says M r 
MLane of the character of Gen 1 Jackson, I think he would 
be more disposed to yield when he is strong than when he is 
in danger. 

The footing then on which the matter stands is this : 

The President is to say that having previously brought 
the subject to Congress, he now leaves it with them. 

The Secretary is to recommend the renewal. 

This latter point pleases me much. When I saw him at 
Washington he did not think he could go so far as to origi 
nate a recomendation of the Bank, &amp; I therefore examined 
all the reports of all the Secretaries to show that the pro 
posals for the Bank all originated with them &amp; I left the vol 
umes of these reports in M r Dickin s hands marked, so that 
he might urge them on the Secretary s attention. 

He thinks he can present the Tariff question strongly he 
will then press with equal strength the Bank question &amp; if he 
can arrange the question of the public lands (the surrender to 
them of the lands within their limits at a certain price so as 
to make the landholding states pay in stock to the old States 
the proportion which the latter have a right to) the Bank 
would be put in such company &amp; on such a footing that even 
M r Benton would not attack it. 



132 Correspondence of Nicholas Biddle 

On his way to M r Carroll s with the Pres*. the latter ad 
verted to the inconsistency of those who pulled down the old 
Bank &amp; built up the new &amp; particularly of the objection 
then made that foreigners were stockholders. This he con 
sidered an unfounded objection. (He mentioned this to me 
at Washington.) 1 

Some surprize was felt by the Pres 4 of the Bank at perceiv 
ing in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury the following 
phrases: 

"It is not perceived that there is any sufficient justifica 
tion in the grounds of the transaction as assumed by the 
"Bank for an arrangement in any form, by which so large 
" an amount of the public funds should be retained by the 
"Bank at the risk of the Gov 4 . after it had directed their 
"application to the payment of the public creditor." 

The reason of the surprize was this. On the 14 th of Oct r . 
1832, the Chief Clerk of the Treasury Department addressed a 
letter to the Pres 4 . of the Bank written obviously &amp; avowedly 
at the request of the Secretary of the Treasury for the pur 
pose of enabling the Pres 4 of the Bank to contradict certain 
statements about the three per cents which appeared in a 
New York paper of the 12 th of October. The letter, tho not 
itself written for publication, was written professedly as the 
basis of a publication by the Pres 4 of the Bank, and author 
ized him to vouch certain things. Having no taste for news- 
paperisms, the Pres 4 of the Bank never answered and indeed 
never read the New York paper, but if he had answered it, 
he would have asserted the fact vouched for by the follow- 

1 Biddle evidently added to the Memorandum from this point at a later date 
because the following references are to the Secretary of the Treasurer s report 
of 1832. Cf. Reports of the Secretary of the Treasury, 1829-1836, vol. in, 

P- 295- 



Memorandum 1 3 3 

ing extract of the letter referred to, a letter written by the 
Chief Clerk of the Treas y at the request of the Secretary 
containing suggestions by the Secretary of what the Pres fc 
of the Bank ought to publish. The suggestion was in these 
words : 

"Nor has the Treasury any reason to object to the course 
"which the Bank has pursued in regard to the European 
"holders of the 3 per cents. On the contrary that measure 
"appears wise &amp; prudent, &amp; well adapted to prevent the 
"embarrassments which the sudden withdrawal of so much 
"foreign capital from the country would necessarily produce." 

This was on the 14 th of Oct r . 1832. 

Another reason of the surprize of the Pres 4 of the Bank was 
that on the of November 1832 he was waited upon by 

the Chief Clerk of the Treasury who announced himself as 
coming from the Secretary of the Treasury to make enquiry 
about the Certificates of stock. The Chief Clerk stated not 
once nor casually, but frequently &amp; emphatically, what he 
had written on the 14 th of October, that the Secretary was 
perfectly satisfied with the measure itself, but only desired 
that the Certificates should appear soon in order that the 
doubts of others might be removed, &amp; he pressed the Pres fc 
of the Bank to write a letter to the Secretary explaining the 
matter. In consequence of this request, the Pres* of the Bank 
wrote a letter to the Secretary on the . If it had not 

been clearly &amp; repeatedly stated that the Secretary was 
entirely satisfied &amp; wanted only the means of satisfying 
others undoubtedly this letter would never have been writ 
ten. The Pres*. of the Bank did not know did not wish to 
know, &amp; certainly would never have asked to know what the 
opinions of the Secretary were on the subject. The communi- 



134 Correspondence of Nicholas Biddle 

cation therefore to him that the Treasury deemed the meas 
ure wise &amp; prudent, and that the Secretary was satisfied 
with it was wholly gratuitous and in truth it might as well 
have been spared, since really it does not seem strictly proper 
to treat the Bank in this way to denounce its measures in 
public at the same time that you praise them in private. 

The Pres* of the Bank was also surprized at that passage 
in the report of the Secretary he states that various consider 
ations "have suggested an enquiry into the Security of the 
Bank as the depository of the public funds." 

His surprize arose from two circumstances. 

The first was that on the 3 I st of Oct r . 1832, the Secretary 
addressed to him a letter requesting to know what the Bank 
would give for 3,919,666.66 francs about $700,000 being 
the first instalment of the French indemnity. 1 In that letter 
he stated that " it would be sufficient for the Treasury to re 
ceive a credit for the amount in the Bank of the U.S. one 
month after the payment of the bill in Paris say on the 2 d of 
March next," adding that " if as I presume an arrangement 
for the transfer May be best made with the Bank, I will 
thank you to state the terms." 

It seems strange, that the Secretary at the same time that 
he announces to Congress his fears about the solvency of the 
Bank, should ask that very Bank to take in its own hands 
$700,000 additional money of the public, not to be paid for 
until the 3 d of March next. 

The other reason of surprize is that the Secretary on the 

requested to know of the Bank what it would give 

for a bill on London for the 3 d instalment of the Danish in- 

1 Cf. MacDonald, William, Jacksonian Democracy (New York, 1907), pp.

demnity amounting to about $244,000. Here then the Secre 
tary, in the midst of his anxiety for the safety of the public 
monies in the Bank, actually proposes to place no less than 
a million of dollars more of that very public money in that 
very Bank sure never was insolvency so much flattered 
before.

In a conversation with him a short time ago, he men

Without having come to any determination in regard 
to an application to Congress at the aproaching session for

such a contingency by relieving our friends in both houses

EDWARD SHIPPEN TO BIDDLE 

(Confidential) Louisville 6 Dec. 1831 

Dear Sir 

I have seen a letter from the Private Secretary of the 
President to a gentleman in this City, in answer to a com 
munication addressed to the President on the Subject of a 
renewal of the Bank Charter. The substance of that letter 
is, that the Pres dt does not consider himself pledged against 
a renewal, and that if Congress passes a Bill with proper 
modifications of the Charter his approval will not be with 
held. 

I have taken some pains to ascertain the objections to the 
present Charter, and the modifications which it is thought 
will insure the Executive sanction. I give them to you with 
the only object of putting you in possession of the views held 
on this interesting subject by those who are deep in the se 
crets and favor of the President. 

I st Prohibit the establishment of more than two Branches 
in each State. 

2. The Stock now owned by government to be sold to in- 



From Edward Shippen 137 

dividuals, in a manner that will prevent a few persons from 
monopolizing it. The Sale of the Government Stock will sat 
isfy many in the North, and remove the existing objection 
of the President to a partnership between the Gov*. and a 
Corporation. 

3 rd Limit the power or capacity of the Institution to hold 
real Estate. Say, the value of that description of property in 
possession of the Bank shall not at any time exceed 10 or 
15 millions of dollars. 

4. Take from the Corporation the power to loan money 
on a pledge of merchandize. 

5. Give to the President and Directors of the Bank au 
thority to appoint two individuals to sign all the notes issued 
(for the President &amp; Cashier) and let all the paper emanate 
from the Mother Bank. 

6. The existing provisions in relation to Government de 
posits, and Direction of the Bank, to be preserved. 

7. Render the Corporation Suable in the Courts of the 
Several States by making the service of process on the Presi 
dent or Cashier of the Branch, &amp; where the cause of action 
arose, a service on the Corporation. 

It is believed that the modifications suggested will ensure 
the renewal of the Bank Charter. They are not calculated 
to impair the usefulness or efficiency of the Institution, and 
if proposed by the Corporation, they will really be adopted 
by Congress. By proposing the necessary modifications, the 
Bank will strengthen herself with the people, prevent an 
angry discussion in Congress, which might result in making 
the question of renewing the Charter a party test, and ensure 
the sanction of the Executive to the modifications solicited by 
the Bank, and adopted by Congress. 



138 Correspondence of Nicholas Eiddle 

I give you these suggestions and opinions only on account 
of the source from whence they emanate. They are urged 
with apparent zeal in favor of the Bank, and altho I am for 
bidden to mention names I have no doubt it was expected I 
would communicate their ideas to you. 

My own opinion is that the object is entirely political. The 
popularity of the President must fall in the West, 1 if his 
hostility to the Bank is continued. The letter of the Private 
Secretary urges the necessity of proper modifications, which 
cannot be suggested by the President, and from the tenor of 
that letter, and the anxiety manifested by the party here, I 
think they are desirous to have the Bank question settled by 
a renewal before the next Presidential canvass, with any 
modifications to free the Pres dt from the charge of an entire 
abandonment of his original opposition.

My dear Sir 

I had last night a long conversation with M c Lane 
and I am authorized by him to say that it is his deliberate 
opinion and advice that a renewal of the Charter ought not 
to be pressed during the present session in which I concurr 
most sincerely. The message is as much as you could expect. 
It shows that the Chief is wavering. If pressed into a Corner 
immediately neither M c Lane nor myself will answer for the 
consequences. But we both feel confident of ultimate success 
if time be given for the P fc to convince himself of the Error 
into which opinion long formed (prejudice if you pleased)

of the Treasury we were all lead to believe that the powers 
that be were in favor of re-chartering that invaluable insti 
tution. Now to the facts Barry, 1 Woodbury, &amp; Taney 2 
are hostile. These three are under the influence of Blair, 
Lewis, Kendall &amp; C.O. who still rule our Chief Magistrate, 
and who himself is an enemy to the Bank in despite what he 
is made to say in his message. But on M r . M c Lane s Report 
have we placed our hopes; now the "Globe" denounces his

sentiments, and the Paragraph formed for that purpose was 
so objectionable, that on being shewn to M r M C L. he declared 
that was it published, he would send his resignation the next 
morning it was accordingly modified as it appeared in that 
paper. Neither Barry or Woodbury saw the Report until it 
appeared in print. The President of course had it submitted 
to him, and was persuaded at the time to give it his sanction. 
But has since read with satisfaction the Richmond Enquirer 
which says that it will require a majority of three fourths 
of Congress to carry the measure into a Law. 

I write you these remarks hastily, as they may be of serv 
ice to you to know the actual state of affairs at Wash 1 , in 
order to advance the all important subject which you must 
have so much at heart. I fear you will yet have much trouble 
with our wise governors. You have most heartily my good 
wishes and I am almost prejudiced enough to say and that 
of every honest man in the Community. 

C. F. MERCER x TO BIDDLE 

(-private) Washington D.C. 

Dec r 12 th . 1831 

Dear Sir 

. . . Two years ago I earnestly advised you not to at 
tempt the renewal of the Charter of the Bank of the United 
States, in the hey day of Genl. J ns administration. I told you 
what I dare say you had already discovered that his party, 
I meant its active leaders, would quarrel among themselves, 
and knowing his hostility to the Bank, I advised you to 
await that result. 

I now as confidently recommend it to you to press this 

1 Representative from Virginia. 



\ From C. F. Mercer 141 

Congress at this session for the renewal of your Charter for 
reasons too numerous and important to be compressed in the 
compass of a letter which I really have not time to write. I 
will however present to you a part of them, and my object 
being wholly disinterested I shall study brevity in my lan 
guage rather than effect. Gen 1 . Jackson s popularity has de 
clined much more among men of intelligence than with the 
great body of the people. It has especially declined in Con 
gress. But his election is as certain as his life. He hates your 
Bank and has reason enough to do so. His silly notions re-\ 
specting it have been exposed with your approbation, 
he is mortified or vexed as well as angry. 

Altho I hold his election to be certain every body else 
does not do so. But no one can doubt but that his reelec 
tion will increase the effect of his influence over this Con 
gress. 

Calhoun is friendly to your bank and he will certainly not 
be again Vice President. 1 He has little influence, but where 
it exists it is powerful and it exists among your enemies to the 
South. 

M c Duffy has ability and influence &amp; talents and integrity 
and he is still the the friend of Calhoun, Chairman of the 
very committee to whom your memorial if presented would 
be referred. 

Van Buren your enemy is in England. 2 If a candidate 
four years hence for the presidency his influence will be felt 
to your prejudice. 

If you wait till the next session of Congress remember

C. Calhoun (Boston, 1898), pp. 61-103.

ward M., Martin Van Buren (Boston, 1891), pp. 191-203.

it is the short session and will not allow time to mature 
your bill. Consider also that by that period Jacksons suc 
cess will have been ascertained and his power enlarged and 
invigorated. 

The Sec y of the Treasury and Js Cabinet probably are now 
on your side. They may not continue to be so because the per 
sons who fill these political stations may be changed. . . .

on the Offices. 2 
My dear Sir 

. . . Have you come to any decision about an appli 
cation to Congress at this Session for the renewal of your 
Charter? The friends of the Bank here, with whom I have 
conversed, seem to expect the application to be made. The 
course of the President, in the event of the passage of a bill, 
seems to be a matter of doubt and speculation. My own be 
lief is that, if now called upon he would not negative the bill, 
but that if he should be re-elected the event might and prob 
ably would be different. 

1 On October 4, 1831, Clay wrote to Francis Brooke on the need of re-char 
tering the Bank as follows: "I think the Charter of the B. of the U.S. ought to be 
renewed upon equitable conditions. I am perfectly willing to abide by the rea 
sons which I assigned for a change of my opinion (the only change of opinion I ever 
made on a great pol. question) relative to that institution, and which are to be 
found in my public speeches." And again on December 25, 1831, writing to Brooke: 
"The Executive is playing a deep game to avoid, at this session, the responsibility 
of any decision on the Bank Question. It is not yet ascertained whether the Bank, 
by forbearing to apply for a renewal of their Charter, will or will not conform to 
the wishes of the President. I think they will act very unwisely if they do not 
apply." Cf. Colton, Clay s Works, vol. iv, pp. 316, 322.

From Samuel Smith 1 4 3 

SAMUEL SMITH TO BIDDLE 

Washington, Dec r . 17. 1831 
Dear Sir 

This morning M r . Clay, on returning a visit I had paid 
him, took occasion to broach the subject of the renewal of 
the Charter of the Bank of the U. States, by enquiring 
whether I had any precise information as to its purpose to 
memorialise Congress on the subject. I replied that I had not; 
that I had myself been inclined to think that, as the subject 
was national, and had so repeatedly and recently received 
the notice of the Executive, it might be the best policy to 
let the Gov* act upon it without the special interposition of 
the Bank, as it would in this event be acted upon on large pub 
lic considerations, free from the prejudices which might arise 
on viewing its bearings on private interests. He expressed his 
dissent from this opinion; said the present was the most favor 
able time to get the charter; that a majority of the two Houses 
was for it; that he himself should vote for it; that M r . Buck- 
ner, the new Senator from Missouri, had told him he would 
do so; that the President had unquestionably the last sum 
mer declared (stating the name of the individual to whom he 
made the declaration) that either the Bank or Andrew Jack 
son must go down; that it was probable that, if two Houses 
passed a Bill, the President would approve it previous to the 
next Presidential election, but that if not passed previously 
he did not doubt his rejecting it; in fact, that now or never, 
was the time to act with any chance of success. 

I stated to him that in conversation with several members 
of Congress, personal friends of the President, and others of 
like character, they had expressed great solicitude that the 



144 Correspondence of Nicholas Eiddle 

subject should not at this session be pressed by the Bank, 
declaring at the same time their friendship to the Bank, 
with the fear, if so pressed, the measure would be considered 
by the President as an electioneering one, and would scarcely 
fail to be felt by him as personal, and being so viewed impel 
him, in the assertion of his independence, to put his veto on 
the Bill, that it might not be alleged that he was influenced 
by a regard to a re-election; that the Secretary of the Treas 
ury was adverse to the subject being taken up at this time; 
and that if the discussion were deferred, as public opinion, 
particularly in the West, was becoming more favorable, the 
President, yielding to its influence, would be apt to become 
himself less adverse to a continuance of the Charter. 

He said that his information corraborated mine; but that 
he did not believe the effect on the President would be such 
as was represented; that if the Bank memorialised Congress 
it would be but following in the wake of the President; that if 
they did not, he doubted whether the subject would be effec 
tively brought forward ; that many of the members would avail 
themselves of the circumstance to wave the discussion of the 
subject; that, further, it should be considered that if the press 
ing it by the Bank should be viewed by the friends of the Pres 
ident as an electioneering measure aimed against him, there 
was another aspect of the subject under which those opposed 
to the President, and in general friends to the Bank, might 
consider the delay to memorialise, especially after the actions 
of the stockholders on the subject, as an electioneering step 
against them; that already rumors of a coalition to this effect 
was circulated; and that in regard to the feeling in the West, 
it was quite doubtful; he believed they (the representa 
tives) might without injury vote for a renewal, but there 



From Daniel Webster 145 

would be little sensation there let the decision be what it 
might. . . . 1 

Altho these views are probably familiar to you, and you 
may, thro other channels, be possessed of the facts I have 
stated, I have supposed there might be a use in communi 
cating them, with the opinion . . . that the views and reason 
ing of M r Clay are in the main correct. I may add, that you 
know him sufficiently well to admit, that, however glittering 
the prize of ambition may be, he is remarkable for the habit 
ual exercise of dispassionate judgement and clear perception. I 
would add, however, my aprehension, that, altho the discussion 
will shew a majority in favor of the Bank, there will be a suffi 
cient number of members voting with its enemies for an indefi 
nite postponement to defeat the passage of a Bill this session. 

... I am, with unfeigned respect 

DANIEL WEBSTER TO BIDDLE

Washington Deer 18. 1831 
My Dear Sir 

The state of my health &amp; the severity of the weather 
have prevented me, since my arrival here, from being much 
abroad. Nevertheless, I have seen a great number of per 
sons, &amp; conversed with them, among other things, respecting 
the Bank. The result of all these conversations has been 
a strong confirmation of the opinion which I expressed at 
Philadelphia that it is expedient for the Bank to apply for 
the renewal of its Charter without delay. I do not meet a 
Gentleman, hardly, of another opinion; &amp; the little incidents 
&amp; anecdotes, that occur &amp; circulate among us, all tend to 
strengthen the impression. Indeed, I am now a good deal 
inclined to think, that after Gen 1 Jackson s re-election there 



146 Correspondence of Nicholas Biddle 

would be a poor chance for the Bank. I am well informed, 
that within three days, he has in conversation with several 
Gentlemen, reiterated his old opinions, somewhat vocifer 
ously, &amp; declared them unchangeable. 

I have thought, My Dear Sir, the best advice I could give 
you, is, that you come down here, yourself, &amp; survey the 
ground. You will have access to men of all parties, &amp; can di 
gest your information, compare opinions, &amp; judge discreetly 
upon the whole matter. In my judgment, this is your true 
course, &amp; ought to be immediately followed. 

I am, Dear Sir, always faithfully

My dear Sir, 

. . . M r M c Lanes report is all that his friends could 
wish enlarged liberal, wise, &amp; statesmanlike. It is much 
fitter for a President s message than the President s message 
itself &amp; I wish with all my heart that the writer of it was 
President. The style of the paragraph in that message about 
the Bank, with the commentary of the Globe, the Richmond 
Enquirer, &amp; the Standard, I confess shake my confidence 
much. It is not in such an ambiguous tone that a President 
should speak or make his dependants speak.

Tuesday Eve: 
My dear Sir, 

This is merely to report my arrival &amp; that I am quar 
tered at Barnard s Hotel. 



From Thorn as Cadwalader 147 

I had some talk with my companion, the Senator, 1 who 
seems disposed to give all the aid he can, tho he hangs in 
doubt as to the policy of starting the application now, unless 
it can be ascertained that we have 2/3 ds , in asmuch as he 
has lately had intimations, from a quarter w h he considers 
entitled to full credit, leading him to apprehend a Veto, on 
a smaller vote: at the same time he acknowledges that the 
chances of such negative may be greater after the Election. 
Of his Colleague &amp; Brother in Law (W.) he speaks doubt- 
ingly. He will give me however all he can gather about him, 
as well as about the members below from Penns a &amp; says he 
will help along. I have sent a note to M r M c Lane, asking to 
fix a time tomorrow morning to talk with me, &amp; you shall 
hear from me after seeing him. 2

My dear Sir, 

I yesterday reported my arrival. I have had this morn- 

1 This must refer to the Senator from Pennsylvania. 

* These and the following letters of Cadwalader throw much light upon the 
political moves in Washington in the fall of 1831. Professor Catterall states that 
John Sergeant and Daniel Webster were largely instrumental in Riddle s coming 
to his final decision to memorialize immediately for the re-charter of the Bank. 
However, these statements are not substantiated by any direct proof. It is quite 
correct to say that Sergeant had a great influence on Biddle s moves especially 
in local politics and in the later re-chartering of the Bank by the State of Pennsyl 
vania. But there is no evidence to show Sergeant s or Webster s power in the 
present issue. On the other hand, the Cadwalader correspondence shows almost 
conclusively that Biddle was mainly swayed by what his agent in Washington 
reported. 

* Barnard s Hotel was at the northwest corner of Pennsylvania Avenue and 
Fourteenth Street. Frederick Barnard had succeeded Basil Williamson as pro 
prietor in 1824. Bryan, Wilhelmas B., A History of the National Capital (New 
York, 1916), vol. ii, p. 59, note 6.

ing a long &amp; frank conversation with M r M c Lane. He says 
positively that the President will reject the Bill, if the matter is 
agitated this Session. He (the Pres*.) &amp; those about him w d 
regard the movement, before the election, as an act of hos 
tility, or as founded on the idea that his opinions w* 1 bend to 
personal views, &amp; that his fears w d induce him to truckle. M r : 
ML. is sure that under such circumstances he w d apply his 
veto, even if certain that he w d thereby lose the Election. The 
question he says cannot now be started without being re 
garded as a party one, &amp; the influence of the government w d 
be thrown upon it so that we should lose a large number of 
votes which under other circumstances we should gain 
the rejection not being considered as a final one as the 
question may be renewed at the next session, or a subsequent 
one, the Veto once given the President w d never swerve, &amp; 
that 2/3 ds w d be required on any subsequent trial. Accord 
ingly to the Sec y s view of it, therefore, we are now to see 
whether we can rely on 2/3 ds under the circumstances 
averted to, namely the operation of party feeling, &amp; Gov 4 
influence and to that inquiry I devote myself. M r . M C L. 
seems to have canvassed the Senate thoroughly, &amp; we have

in case of an application at this Session. With that informa

Washington 

Barnard s 22. Dec: 1831 
My dear Sir, 

I yesterday gave you the ideas of M r McLane &amp; have 
to day had a conference with M r McDuffie. He leans strongly 
to an immediate application but is much staggered by what 
I learned from M C L. He now thinks we must ascertain our 
strength carefully &amp; not start the business unless sure of a 
majority under the circumstances adverted to in my last. 
He was entirely candid &amp; confidential has no good will to 
the Administration &amp; is disposed to view their movements 
with doubt &amp; suspicion. He will not give up the idea that the 
P. will be more likely to sign the bill now than after the Elec 
tion, &amp; under any circumstance he thinks we ought to go on, 
if we can poll a certain majority. Let the P. then veto, if he 
finds freedom to do so in the face of his Message &amp; M c L s 
Report &amp; we may bring on the measure with a fair chance 
of the 2/3 ds next year. We are now getting exact informa 
tion as to the vote in w h he will help. Tomorrow after ten, 
I meet Gen 1 Smith &amp; dine with him &amp; M c Duffie at M r 
McLanes. That triumvirate &amp; my unworthy self are to dis 
cuss the subject in conclave at the Sec y s office on Saturday 
Eve. 

All our Penns 3 members of the H. of R. (except Horn, 
Dewart, * &amp; Mann) are said to be for us, even in the teeth of 
the P that part I shall better sift, before I rely on all - 
Ford &amp;King, I do not feel sure of. I shall look closely at those 
of them who voted for Stevenson, 2 fearing their steadiness

in acting counter to Executive influence. M C D. doubts 
whether that feeling will operate as powerfully as has been 
supposed he calculates on the odium it w d produce, affect 
ing equally the acting &amp; the acted upon. 

Observe that I give you, as I go along, what I hear from 
others. When I get all the materials to be gathered, &amp; hear 
all opinions, I shall make up my own. The conference of 
Saturday Eve: may perhaps open new lights tho there 
will be in it more of diplomatic reserve than in my previous 
tete-a-tetes with the Individuals. I keep my eyes &amp; ears 
sharply open &amp; hear a great deal more than seems to be 
worth recollecting 

I am interrupted &amp; must close

Barnards 
My dear Sir, 

Gen. Smith entirely goes with the administration in his 
objections to the agitation of the question at this Session 
it will be made a Jackson &amp; anti-Jackson vote, as he says, 
it being entirely impossible to persuade the Pres t that we 
are acting under any other than a hostile feeling to him. 
Under that view of the subject, in a vote of this Session, Smith 
says, we lose in the Senate 10 votes which we might count 
in our favor next year viz; 

Jersey i. Dickerson 

Penns a 2 (Dallas told S. so. Wilkins is certain for the party) 

Maryland I (Smith* ! ! ! as he himself tells me.) 

N.Car: I. (Mangum) 

Georgia I. (Forsyth) 



From Thomas Cadwalader 153 

Mississippi I . (Pointdexter not certain as he is sound 

with the Pres 1 :) 
Illinois 2 (Kane &amp; Robinson (both supposed friendly 

but strong party men) 

Indiana I (Hendricks doubtful if he w d vote for us at 
10 all another man to be in Hanna s place 
dead contra. 

* Smith failing us, you will think the question settled for 
this session &amp; so it is, unless we can turn the administra 
tion men from their objections to a present movement of it. 
This I shall perhaps know in a few days. The conference with 
M c Lane, Smith &amp; M c Duffie is put off to Sunday. Gen 1 . S. 
&amp; also M C L. &amp; M C D. advert often to the general impression 
that the Bank operates powerfully ag* the Jackson party 
they themselves having no such notion: I have said to each 
of them that your Letter Book J contains the best evidence 
to the contrary &amp; would shew, if it c d be looked into, that we 
not only endeavour to keep the Bank &amp; city offices out of the 
political vortex, but dissuade the officers of the Institution 
from being prominent as party men. I recollect letters to that 
point extracts from which c d be used in a quiet way by Smith, 
as he thinks, with a powerful effect I advise you sending 
them if no objection strikes you to your so doing. . . . 

I therefore now close with one remark that as far as 
my consultations with our friends have gone, the Jackson 
portion of them argue against starting the question at this 
Session and the Clay portion are equally anxious for its 
present agitation. . . . 

1 This is quite true. Cf. Biddle to David Sears, January 5, 1824; Biddle to

Phil a . Dec r . 23. 1831 
My dear Sir, 

Your favor announcing your arrival &amp; your second 
giving the result of your first interview are received. I have 
not had yet an opportunity of apprizing our friends S. &amp; C. 1 
of the state of things but shall do so this afternoon. The views 
of M r M. are sufficiently discouraging, &amp; I shall wait anx 
iously for the further lights which you will give. 

I inclose a paper of which I have no other copy which 
therefore you will have the goodness to send back when you 
have no further occasion for it, or to bring it if you come soon. 
It is an extract from the minutes of the old Bank of the U.S. 
by which you will perceive that as early as the 6 th of Jan y 1807 
four years before the expiration of the charter, and when 
it had nearly as long to run as ours has, the stockholders met 
&amp; prepared a memorial which was not however presented until 
the following session of Congress say 1808 (as this is the 
substance of the extract it is not worth while to send it)* 

* Whence may be argued that if they began so early, we 
involved or provoked as we have been, cannot be reproached 
with a premature movement. I am particularly anxious to 
know the opinion of M r M c Duffie in whose judgment in this 
matter I have the highest confidence.

of the 22 d inst which is very interesting. On this whole matter 
I have heard much &amp; thought more since you left us. I of

mention to you exactly my present state of mind. It is this. 
If M r M c Duffie could insure a reference to the Committee of 
Ways &amp; Means, &amp; a favorable report of that Committee, I 
would not hesitate to try it, if I could rely on a majority of 
one only in each house. Once fairly launched by the Com ee

know better than I do. I have not said this to anybody except 
yourself but all my reflections tend that way. With your

My dear Sir 

My last letter to you was of Friday I have yet 
rec d no communications from you. Yours of the 23 d is just 
brought in &amp; contents noted. This morning was appointed for 
the conference between the Sec y : G 1 Smith M r M c Duffie &amp; 
myself, the Secy: is however ill, in bed &amp; we must await 
his convalescence. 

I have had much talk with M r Webster (who is now at An 
napolis) M r . Silbee present. He (W.) seems decidedly for 
starting the memorial if we are sure of a bare majority in the 

2 Houses &amp; even indeed if we are sure of a majority in H. 
of R. where we of course must begin. He says the Senate 
will not throw out the Bill., if passed below &amp; he thinks the 



156 Correspondence of Nicholas Bid die 

Pres*. will not reject it threaten as he may at present, 
entre nous, it is evident that W s opinions are guided, in some

of my own notions . . .

I shall not consult Dallas &amp; Wilkins as to the policy of act

My yesterdays Letter gave my ideas as to the modus ope- 
randi in the H. of R. if now to go on. I am more in doubt 
as to the course in the Senate when the Bill goes up. As to 
Smith, after his confession to me of adhesion to Palace in 
fluence we must understand with him, in a candid &amp; friendly 
way, that he must hold back, &amp; that some other Champion 
must head our Column who it ought to be is the question 
as to power of talent, we w d at once designate Webster 
but the name carries a deadly bearing of party feeling,

enlighten me in the darkness in w h I confess myself now to 
be enveloped &amp; I mention the difficulty, now in time, to 
you, for the benefit of your views . . . 

Expect, very shortly after that Conference at the Treasury, 
to receive my opinion as to the policy of now presenting the 
memorials or waiting for a less stormy occasion. You may 
as well have the papers ready.

My dear Sir 

Your last letter is of Saturday night (23 d ins 1 ) ans d 
by me yesterday Nothing to day from you. 

M r Peter R. Livingston x (Brother of the Sec y : of State, 
in whose House he is living) came to see me last Eve. He is 
strongly of opinion that we ought to start an application now. 
He says his Brother M c Lane &amp; Cass 2 w d prevent the veto 
tho they are all desirous of saving the Pres fc . from the neces- 

1 Peter Livingston was largely instrumental for the election of William H. 
Seward as Governor of New York in 1834. "Livingston had been a wheel horse 
in the party of Jefferson. He had served in the Senate with Van Buren; he had taken 
a leading part in the convention of 1821, and he had held with distinction the 
speakership of the Assembly and the presidency of the Senate. His creed was love 
of republicanism and hatred of Clinton. At one time he was the faithful follower, 
the enthusiastic admirer, almost the devotee of Van Buren; and, so long as the 
Kinderhook statesman opposed Clinton he needed Livingston. But when the time 
came that Van Buren must conciliate Clinton., Livingston was dropped from the 
Senate. The consequences were far more serious than Van Buren intended. Liv 
ingston was as able as he was eloquent and Van Buren s coalition with Clinton 
quickly turned Livingston s ability and eloquence to the support of Clay. Then 
he openly joined the Whigs." Alexander, De Alva S., A Political History of New 
York (New York, 1909), vol. i, pp. 402, 403. 

2 Lewis Cass did not agree with President Jackson in his attack on the Bank. On 
September 23, 1833, Cass made an appointment with Lewis to discuss the matter 
of the removal of the deposits. "Cass commenced the conversation," wrote Lewis, 
"by remarking that his object in desiring to see me before I left was to inform 
me that he had determined to resign his seat in the cabinet, and wished to con 
verse with me upon the subject before he handed his letter of resignation to the 
President. He said he differed with the President with regard to the measures 
which were about to be adopted for the removal of the public deposits from the 
United States Bank, and as his remaining in the cabinet might embarrass his 
operations, he owed it, he thought, both to himself and the President to with 
draw." Lewis urged him to acquaint Jackson. Cass was finally induced to remain 
in the Cabinet, but in a later Cabinet meeting, when asked his opinon on the meas 
ure, Cass simply and frankly said: "You know, sir, I have always thought that 
the matter rests entirely with the secretary of the treasury." McLaughlin, A. C.,

sity of acting one way or the other, before the Election they 
look to Penns a with great anxiety. M c . Lane calculated in his 
talks with me on half that delegation voting postponement, 
in conformity with the wishes of the administration phalanx. 
Now I do not think they can shake more than four of them, if 
so many &amp; the more I see of the Senators D. &amp; W. the 
more satisfied am I that the opinions lately expressed as to 
their votes are well founded. They are strongly inclined to 
aid the wishes of the Palace men in dissuading from moving 
the question this Session but whenever moved they must 
support it. 

M r . Livingston has been, as you know, an active &amp; power 
ful worker in the politics of N York. He enters zealously into 
this B k question (probably from Party feeling a Mem 
ber of the Clay Convention) besides the 14 favorable votes of 
his State on w h I have before counted, he says he can, &amp; will, 
bring over some of those marked on my list as doubtful 
viz: Angel, Babcock, Cooke, Hogan, Lansing, Lent, Pierson, 
Reed &amp; Soule. He is now engaged in that good work &amp; is to 
report the result. When the subject comes up much warmth, 
say indeed violence, is to be expected &amp; we may find some 
shaking, on whose firmness we now count. I am fully in the 
belief, however, that we shall gain more from those marked 
"uncertain" &amp; now by me counted as adverse, than will 
make up any losses from my present list of yeas. . . . 

BIDDLE TO SAMUEL SMITH 

Phil 3 . Jany 4, 1832 
My dear Sir, 

You will hear, I am afraid with regret, tho not with 
surprize, that we have determined on applying to the present 



1 6 2 Correspondence of Nicholas Riddle 

Congress for a renewal of the Charter of the Bank &amp; that a 
memorial for that purpose will be forwarded tomorrow or the 
next day. To this course I have made up my mind after great 
reflection &amp; with the clearest convictions of its propriety. The 
reasons I will briefly explain. I. The Stockholders have de 
volved upon the Directors the discretion of choosing the time 
of making the application. If we should omit a favorable op 
portunity we would commit an irreparable error, &amp; would be 
permanently reproached with it by the Stockholders. Now 
these Stockholders are entirely unanimous in their opinions 
and in a case of such grave responsibility their wishes are en 
titled to great consideration. Unless therefore there should 
be some very strong reason against it, the application should 
be made. 2. Independent however of this, I believe That this 
is the proper time. The Charter will expire in March 1836 
Unless the present Congress acts upon it, we must wait till 
the Congress of December 1833, &amp; could not expect from 
them any decision before after March 1834 which would bring 
the Bank within two years or 18 months of the expiration of 
its charter. Now whether the institution is to be continued 
or destroyed that time is too short. Until the question is 
settled every thing will be uncertain. No man can look ahead 
in either public or private affairs as to the state of the cur 
rency &amp; there will be constant anxiety about our whole monied 
system. The Bank too ought to know its fate so as to close 
its affairs without inflicting deep &amp; dangerous wounds upon 
the community by sudden shocks &amp; changes. I believe there- 
fore that this is the best time for settling the question. If the 
Bank is to be continued the country ought to know it soon. 
If the Bank is to be destroyed the Bank &amp; the country ought 
both to know it soon. 



To Samuel Smith 1 6 3 

The only objection I have heard to it, is, as far as I under 
stand, this : that in about a year hence there is to be an elec 
tion for a President of the U.S. and if the application is 
now made, the gentleman who is now President will take it 
amiss &amp; negative the bill while if the Bank will refrain from 
applying until after his election is secured, he will probably 
be permitted to abstain from negativing it. This seems to em 
brace the whole case Let us look at it. In the first place 
then, neither I nor any of my associates have any thing what 
ever to do with the President or his election. I know nothing 
about it &amp; care nothing about it. The Bank has never had any / 
concern in elections it will not have any now. To abstain 
from anything which it would otherwise do, on account of 
an election, is just as bad as doing anything on account of an 
election. Both are equal violations of its neutrality. There are 
many politicians who want to bring it on because it would 
benefit their side. There are many other politicians who 
want to put it off because that would benefit their side. 
Hitherto they have been urged to bring it before the last 
Congress in hopes that it would injure the present incumbent 
now they are urged to postpone it because postponement 
would benefit him. The Bank cares not whether he is bene 
fited or injured. It takes its own time &amp; its own way. 

In the next place what appears to me I confess wholly in 
explicable is why the friends of the present incumbent who 
are also friends of the Bank, if they think the Bank question 
likely to injure the President, do not at once take the question 
out of the hands of their adversaries. If the President s 
friends were to come forward &amp; settle the Bank question 
before the election comes on, they would disarm their antago 
nists of their most powerful weapon. I am very ignorant of 



164 Correspondence of Nicholas Eiddle 

party tactics, &amp; am probably too much biased to be a fit 
judge in this case, but such a course has always seemed to me 
so obvious that I have never been able to comprehend why it 
was not adopted. 

But again what is the reason for supposing that the present 
incumbent will be offended by bringing it forward now? What 
possible right has he to be offended ? What too has he meant 
by all these annual messages declaring in 1829 that he 
could not "too soon present it" to Congress repeating the 
same thing in 1830 and reiterating it in 1831. Was this all 
a mere pretence? that the moment the Bank accepts his own 
invitation he is to be offended by being taken at his word. 

But moreover he is to negative the bill. That is to say, he 
will agree to the bill hereafter, but because he thinks it will 
interfere with his election he will negative it now. Truly this 
is a compliment which I trust he does not deserve from his 
friends, for even I who do not feel the slightest interest in him 
would be sorry to ascribe to a President of the United States 
a course much fitter for a humble demagogue than the Chief 
Magistrate of a great country. He will sign a bill, which of 
course he must think a good one, when his election is over 
but he will not sign this bill, which he thinks a good one, if 
it is likely to take votes from him at an election. And after all, 
what security is there that when his election is over, he will 
not negative the bill ? I see none. On the contrary I am satisfied 
that he would be ten times more disposed to negative it then 
than now. Now he has at least some check in public opinion 
some in the counsels of those around him then he will 
have neither. And now, my dear Sir, I have tired myself as 
I have certainly you with these opinions which you think very 
erroneous &amp; very disrespectful perhaps to the President. But 



From Louis McLane 165 

I wanted to explain precisely the course of thinking which has 
brought me to my present conclusion. The only regret which 
accompanies it is that it has not the concurrence of M r 
M c Lane &amp; yourself to whom the Bank as well as myself per 
sonally owe much for the manner in which you have both 
sustained the institution. I cannot express to you how much 
I am concerned at not being able to adopt the suggestions of \ 
M r M c Lane who has behaved so handsomely in this matter. 
But we must each in our respective spheres of duty follow 
our own convictions with mutual regret but still with mutual 
respect. 

To you I always looked forward as a friend &amp; advocate of 
the Bank whenever the question of its renewal was agitated. 
I shall be very sorry on many accounts that from a difference 
of opinion in regard to time you will be constrained to with 
hold your aid but I assure you it will abate none of the 
regard for you &amp; the fullness of these explanations will I 
hope satisfy you of my anxiety to State to you frankly &amp; 
distinctly the motives which lead me to a conclusion, differing 
I believe for the first time from Your s on the Subject of 
the Bank. 

LOUIS McLANE TO BlDDLE 

Washington Jan. 5. 1832 
Dear Sir, 

General Cadwallader has returned to Philadelphia, 
and I apprehend with impressions, favorable to an attempt 
to renew the charter of the Bank of the United States at the 
present session of Congress. When he consulted me upon the 
subject soon after his arrival here, I frankly &amp; distinctly dis 
couraged the attempt and on grounds which I believe well 



1 66 Correspondence of Nicholas Bid die 

entitled to weight. Other Counsels however, and, as I think 
too sanguine expectations of support from Congress, appear 
to have had greater influence: and it has occurred to me as 
proper that I should communicate my opinions directly to you. 

I do not profess to be in a situation to become the adviser 
of the Bank, and I desire to be irresponsible for the future 
decision of the Directors and the stockholders. The position 
I occupy in the Government, however, and that in which the 
late annual report which my sense of public duty constrained 
me to make has placed me in relation to the Bank and may 
possibly place me in relation to any immediate attempt to re 
new the Charter, make it necessary for me to prevent mis 
apprehension from any quarter distinctly to state my own 
opinions. This will at least leave me uncommitted for the 
future whatever weight may be given to my views. 

I feel constrained therefore to say that I am decidedly op 
posed, both on principle and on grounds of expediency, to an 
attempt to renew the Charter of the Bank during the present 
Congress. 

The annual report, for the reasons stated in it, recommends 
the renewal of the charter "at the proper time, 7 thereby ob 
viously excluding any premature renewal which should be 
inconsistent with the principle and term of the charter and 
not necessary to the safety of the stockholders, or the inter 
ests of the debtors and convenience of the community at large. 

The charter of the Bank will not expire until one year 
after the termination of the next Congress : before that period 
Congress has no authority, without the consent of the Stock 
holders, to alter its provisions; and a law passed in the interim 
can only take effect after the expiration of the present charter. 

Unless it could be shown that all the remaining period of 



From Louis McLane 167 

the charter is necessary to accommodate the business of the 
Bank to the ultimate decision of the Government this would be 
no just pretence for requiring that decision at this time, and 
perhaps no greater motive for doing so than there was during 
the last session. To me there appears to be no such necessity; 
and it does not follow that those friendly to the institution 
could be expected to make their final decision at this time. 

In the case of such a Corporation as that of the Bank of 
the United States the Government is entitled to so much of 
the term of the Charter for the benefit of full experience and 
of amply taking the good management of the corporation, as 
may be consistent with the public interest. Independently of 
this right a subject on which there is so great a diversity in 
public opinion, involving so many important interests of all 
classes of the community, and which has already attracted a 
large portion of public attention should not be disposed of 
without again affording an opportunity of a distinct expres 
sion of the will of the people. The present Congress has not 
been chosen with any direct reference to this question, and 
there are no constitutional means of ascertaining the sense of 
the people before the elections preparatory to the 23d. Con 
gress. Favorable as I am to the continuance of the Bank, if I 
could be persuaded that a decided majority of the people of 
the United States were certainly opposed to re-chartering it 
as at present organized, I could not consent, with the prin 
ciple of Government which I hold, to forestall, by any pre 
mature action, the force of public sentiment, or to exclude 
the advantage of other counsels with a fuller knowledge of 
the subject. 

It must be obvious that both the interests of the present 
Banks and the general expediency of such an institution re- 



1 6 8 Correspondence of Nicholas Biddle 

quire that the consideration of the subject should be separate 
from party questions, with which it has properly no concern; 
and it is equally clear that in the present state of political 
parties, whatever may be the motive of the friends of the 
Bank, it must undoubtedly be mixed up with topics alto 
gether unfavorable to a dispassionate judgement. 

It is not unreasonable to infer that these considerations will 
have their weight with the members of the present Congress ; 
who will see nothing in a refusal to legislate at present incon 
sistent with the maintenance of their own views under more 
favorable circumstances. 

I have no right, nor do I profess in any manner, to speak 
for the President; his opinions are before the Country in his 
official messages in each of which he has invited the People of 
the United States to an investigation of the subject. But in 
dependently of the views he has heretofore avowed, and how 
ever they might be ultimately affected by a deliberate ex 
pression of the will of a decided majority of the People of the 
U.S. it would be unreasonable to expect that he could now 
consent finally to foreclose the investigation which he him 
self has invited, before the public sense has been constitu 
tionally declared ascertained. 

For myself I must say that holding the principles I do and 
have here expressed, as one of the constitutional advisers of 
the President I could not consistently interpose an objection 
to the exercise of his negative upon a bill rechartering the 
Bank during the present Congress, unless presented to him 
as one of and in connection with a series of measures for ad 
justing, upon principles of compromise, all the great interests 
of the Country. 

I deem it unnecessary to repeat my opinion of the expedi- 



From John Connell 169 

ency or necessity of a National Bank on the grounds and for 
the purposes I have heretofore publicly stated, but I will not 
disguise the solicitude I feel lest any premature attempts to 
re-charter the present Bank by exposing it to the influence of 
party feeling and prejudice, should hereafter encourage the 
preference to an entirely new institution. 1

I cannot but think you have done exactly right. What 
ever may be the result, it seems to me the path of duty is 
plain. In my opinion, a failure, this session, if there should be 
one, will not at all diminish the chances of success, next session. 
I suppose the memorial will make its appearance, in the 
Senate, thro the V.P. My notion will be to let the adminis

The Bank having after great consideration presented

where. I have written to-day to our friend Col. Perkins &amp; I wish

In regard to the bonus for a renewal of the Charter my 
views are these 

As the bonus is in fact only another name for a tax, and 
like all other taxes disables the Bank to the extent of it from

From Charles Jared Ingersoll 1 7 1 

giving facilities to the community, a Bonus should not be 
pressed by Gov 4 beyond a very moderate limit, particularly 
as the Gov* is now very rich instead of being needy as it was 
at the time of granting the Charter. 

But if the Bank must pay, I do not think it ought to pay 
more than the sum of $1,500,000: nevertheless it would not 
be proper to decline the charter because more was asked &amp; I 
should be disposed to go as high as two millions or if neces 
sary three; between this last limit &amp; the original sum of a 
million &amp; a half lies the debateable ground. I think you might 
at once agree to any sum not exceeding three millions. If 
more were required or more were insisted upon during the 
passage of the Bill through the House it would be a subject 
of further reference to the Board. To the extent I have men 
tioned, I am sure there would be no difficulty.

shall repeat it frequently that General Jackson s antipathy 
is not to the Bank of the United States in particular, but to 
all Banks whatever. He considers all the State Banks uncon 
stitutional and impolitic and thinks that there should be no 
Currency but coin, that the Constitution [was not] designed 
to compel paper altogether as any part of our monetary sys 
tem. This view of his doctrine conforms to a report which you 
shewed me not long ago made by him to the Legislature of 
Tennessee; 1 it coincides with some similar notions that I have 
long indulged myself, and at any rate to be apprised of the 
theory of his sentiments will be useful to me as it supplies 
a platform on which to approach him. If his prejudices are 
honest they may fairly be dealt with. Louis Williams 2 of 
North Carolina says that all his opposition to the Bank of the 
United States was fomented if not created by Van Buren 
who calculated that he could render his ascendancy in New 
York subservient to the prejudices of Virginia, and that 
Pennsylvania would acquiesce, which three States thus united 
would give him a broad basis for the future Presidency. . . .

It strikes me that the resolutions of our legislature will 
place M r . Dallas in an attitude equally new, and imposing ;

offering an opportunity of distinction, which a young states 
man could scarcely hope for in his dreams, &amp; which the oldest 
statesman might pass a whole life without encountering. It 
seems to me, his position is precisely this He wishes to 
be the Pennsylvania candidate for the Vice Presidency and 

then 

"Glamis and thane of Cawdor 
"the greatest is believed." 

The Pennsylvanians are disposed to assist him and to exclude 
M r . V Buren. To promote this M r . Dallas should identify 
himself with all the Pennsylvania interests, more especially 
those interests to which M r . Van Buren is supposed to be 
hostile. He should therefore go immediately to the President 
with these resolutions of Penn. 1 in his hand he should 
warn him against irritating our State, especially as the of 
fence to her is wholly gratuitous. He should say to him you 
are not opposed to this bank essentially; you mean to agree 
to it with certain modifications. Now let me mediate between 
you and the Bank; let us agree on the modifications; the Bank 
will consent to them, and I will report them, the rechartering 
of the Bank will thus become a measure of yours you will 
gratify Penn a . you will take from your adversaries their 
most formidable weapon, and secure the ascendancy of your 
friends. If the President will do this his success is certain, if 
M r . Dajlas will do this, besides sustaining his father s workA 
&amp; conferring a great blessing on the Country, he will assure/ 
to himself distinguished consideration through the nation. 

1 These resolutions carried under the able leadership of Ingersoll, who de 
clared "that the constitution of the United States authorizes and near half a cen 
tury s experience sanctions, a Bank of the United States as necessary and proper 
to regulate the value of money and prevent paper currency of unequal and de 
preciated value."

It occurs to me that the present is a crisis for Gen 1 . 
Jackson, &amp; for the Bank. The Penn a delegation, and emi 
nently Mr Dallas, now have an opportunity of doing great 
good; and of acquiring great distinction. Let them go for 
ward, and mediate between the President and the Bank, 
make him name his modifications; make the Bank agree 
to them, make the re-charter an administration measure. 
You see at a glance all this. Do put them up to it; make

d etat. Try if you cannot bring it about, without loss of

Dear Sir, 

An article signed Tulpe Hocken destined to appear in 
the Sentinel, and another signed incognito sent to the En 
quirer of Philadelphia, each adapted to the various tastes of 
the readers of those different papers, the first designed to cor 
roborate the spirit of Pennsylvania, the second to inculcate a 
beleif that the President has no constitutional objections to

the Bank, but that the Vice President and his adherents are 
opposed to it, will serve to shew you that I have been paving 
the way for just such a coup d etat as your letter of the 6 th 
received to day suggests and after [having] well digested 
my project I went to the Department of State yesterday to 
break ground : But M r Livingston was with the President and 
I was obliged to defer the overture till to day, which I am not 
sorry for, as your letter come to hand in the mean time has 
confirmed my views and shaped them with precision. I now 
proceed with much satisfaction to report to you substantially 
what took place. When I saw M r Livingston, as I did this 
morning soon after the receipt of your letter, I told him that 
I wished to speak freely with him respecting an important 
measure which he had often mentioned with great apparent 
freedom to me, assuring him that he might rely implicitly on 
my confidence and my disposition to render a service to Gen 
eral Jackson s administration consistent with what I deemed 
the welfare of the country: I then explained to him the state 
of parties in Pennsylvania, that the confidence of the people 
in General Jackson is undiminished as is well known to the 
adherents of Governor Wolf, but that they have the whole 
party organization of the State in their hands, and while they 
dare not openly oppose General Jackson s re-election, yet 
that many if not most of them are inclined to be in op 
position to him. I repeated all the circumstances of the 
publication by the Philadelphia members of the Legislature 
last spring in answer to the charge of bribery * which was 

1 C. J. Ingersoll early in 1831 introduced certain resolutions, with the knowl 
edge and consent of Biddle, in favor of the Bank. These resolutions were passed 
by a decisive majority, having at one stage met with serious repulse, and after 
having had a clause added in favor of distribution of the surplus revenue among 
the States, which Ingersoll voted against. Soon after the New Hampshire Patriot

intended to strike at the President, and would have done so 
much more forcibly than it did, but for the mitigation of some 
of whom I was one, and I added that the resent attempt to 
get up a Van Buren party in Pennsylvania had been a com 
plete failure. I then mentioned the recent almost unanimous 
resolutions of the present Legislature sustaining those of the 
last in favor of the bank of the U S and said that he might de 
pend upon it, therefore, that collision between the State and 
the President would be a dangerous &amp; unfortunate occurrence 
for the latter for which surely said I there is not the least 
occasion, for why should he risk any portion of his popularity 
against an object entirely disconnected with politics, and so 
purely fiscal that if the Secretary of the Treasury were to tell 
the President that he found a frying pan the most convenient 
means of managing the finances, I should suppose the Presi 
dent would agree to it, especially as I understood he has no 
constitutional scruples. After more of these preliminaries than 
I can altogether repeat, I asked M r Livingston if under these 
circumstances it would not be the simplest resolution of all 
the supposed difficulties to take the Bank out of the hands of 
M r M c Duffie and the opposition, modifying its charter so as 
to suit it to the President s opinion and passing it as a meas 
ure of the Administration, M r M c Lane taking the place which 
M r Dallas occupied and General Jackson the example of M r 
Madison in [ ] 15-16 when the Bank was created. I further 
more offered to see M r Dallas, expressing my confidence that 
he would cordially cooperate in such a movement. Finally, I 

charged and the Washington Globe reprinted the charge of bribery. To this Inger- 
soll and other members of the legislature from Philadelphia and its vicinity has 
tened to publish an indignant denial. This was dated May 18, 1831, and first ap 
peared in the American Sentinel of Philadelphia and was widely copied. Meigs,

told M r Livingston all that General Smith had told me as 
to the wish of the President s immediate advisors, that the 
Bank question should be put by this Session. M r Livingston 
rec d . my communication with the utmost apparent cordiality, 
acknowledged the force of the argument and said the pro 
posed mode of proceeding was exactly that one which he 
thought ought to be pursued. I then inquired if the Presi 
dent would oppose the Bank on the ground of its unconsti 
tutionally; he answered that he would not, but that he had 
certain notions of his own as to the frame of the charter which 
ought to be complied with. Let his friends frame it as they 
will, said I, provided their alterations are not destructive of 
the Institution. What are they? First that it should hold 
no real estate but what is indespensably necessary. Granted, 
there is no harm in that. Secondly, that the State should not 
be prevented taxing it. Thirdly, some addition to the Capi 
tal so as to let in new subscribers, and Lastly there is another 
provision, which he could not call to mind; very well, said 
I, I have no authority to remould the charter. I interpose only 
as the friend of M r Biddle of the Bank, and the Administra 
tion, but I have no doubt that any reasonable modifications 
will be acquiesced in, only take the subject out of the hands of 
the President s opponents and let it be brought before Con 
gress in such a shape that his friends may support it, and I 
offered to call upon M r Dallas forthwith. M r Livingston de 
sired me to defer doing so for a few days promising in the 
mean while to have a full understanding with the President 
he said he knew there were some who wanted him to veto 
it, and that he does not know what are the present sentiments 
of the Secretary of the Treasury whose official situation puts 
it out of his power to be passive or neutral as General Smith 



1 7 8 Correspondence of Nicholas Eiddle 

had said he designed to be. For himself M r Livingston ac 
knowledged that the President s various messages invited 
the immediate action of Congress upon the subject. I told 
him that as I had no object in view but the public good which 
I considered identified with the re-charter, I had no objec 
tion whatever to wait on the Secretary of the Treasury, or the 
President and speak to them in the same tone of candour and 
earnestness that I had used in communicating with him. 
M r Livingston replied that the President would hear me with 
perfect attention &amp; thankfulness and we agreed that at a 
proper time I should call upon him. In the mean while M r 
Livingston will take the earliest opportunity of a full explana 
tion with him, which he probably could not accomplish today 
because there is a large diplomatic dinner at the President s 
but he will try tomorrow. . . .

My dear Sir 

... I cannot doubt, whatever may be the result, that 
we have done well in applying at the present session. When 
we were first warned against it lest it should affect the inter 
ests of one of the candidates for the Presidency, such a course 
seemed so entirely foreign to the duties of the Bank that 
we could not acquiesce in it for a moment. At a later period 
when we were counselled to abandon it, lest the influence 
of that candidate should crush the institution; that course 
seemed equally inadmissable, and we determined, that hav 
ing begun, we would go through at all hazards; and that 
it was better even to be defeated in a fair field than to re 
treat. Into that field you have now probably led us; and on

you much of the fate of the institution will depend. I have 
often heard the contemporaries of M r Calhoun, in the Con 
gress of 1816, speak with admiration of the talent, and tact, 
the gentleness and the firmness with which he carried the 
present Charter through the H of Reps, and we rely that 
the union of the same qualities will enable you to be equally 
successful now. . . .

from being destroyed to the infinite wrong as I most sin- \ 
cerely &amp; conscientiously believe of the whole country. To me ^) 
all other considerations are insignificant I mean to stand by

has assigned to me. I care for no party in politics or religion 
have no sympathy with M r Jackson or M r Clay or M r 
Wirt l or M r Calhoun or M r Ellmaker 2 or M r Van Buren. 
I am for the Bank &amp; the Bank alone. Well then, here comes 
M r Jackson who takes it into his head to declare that the Bank 
had failed &amp; that it ought to be superceded by some ricketty 
machinery of his own contrivance. Mr Jackson being the 
President of the U.S. whose situation might make his igno 
rance mischeivous, we set to work to disenchant the countryX 
of their foolery &amp; we have so well succeeded that I will ven

in a great error. . . - 1 

It remains to see how its evil consequences may be averted. 
It seems to me there is no one course by which his friends may 
extricate him not merely safely but triumphantly. He has 
made the Bank a Power. He has made the Bank a deciding 
question as to his own selection. Now let him turn this power 
to his own advantage. As yet the Bank is entirely uncom 
mitted the Bank is neither for him nor against him. In 
this state let his friends come forward boldly, &amp; taking the 
Bank out of the hands of their enemies, conciliate back the 
honest friends whom their rashness has alienated, and who 
think that the only difficulty which he has yet to overcome 
is the dread of their internal convulsion to which the pros 
tration of the Bank will lead. The most extraordinary part 
of the whole matter is that the President &amp; the Bank do not 
disagree in the least about the modifications he desires. He 
wishes some changes The Bank agrees to them and yet 
from some punctilio which is positively purile his rash friends 
wish him to postpone it. Do they not perceive that his ene 
mies are most anxious to place him in opposition to the Bank ? 
And should not every motive of prudence induce him to dis 
appoint their calculations ? The true &amp; obvious theory seems 
to me to disarm the antagonists of their strongest weapon 
to assume credit for settling this question for the adminis 
tration. If the present measure fails, it carries bitterness into 
the ranks of the best part of the opposition. If it succeeds 
without the administration it displays their weakness. If the 
bill passes &amp; the President negatives it, I will not say that it

will destroy him but I certainly think it will &amp; moreover 
I think it ought to. I can imagine no question which seems 
more exclusively for the representatives of the people than 
the manner in which they choose to keep &amp; to manage the 
money of the people. 

... I suppose the President has been made to believe that 
the Bank is busy in hostility to him you know how wholly 
unfounded this is. For myself I do not care a straw for him 
or his rivals I covet neither his man servant nor even 
his maid servant, his ox nor any of his asses. Long may he live 
to enjoy all possible blessings, but if he means to wage war 
upon the Bank if he pursues us till we turn &amp; stand at 
bay, why then he may perhaps awaken a spirit which has 
hitherto been checked &amp; reined in and which it is wisest--^ 
not to force into offensive defence. 

Ponder over these things and believe me 

BIDDLE TO CHARLES JARED INGERSOLL, ESQR. 

Phil a . Fe^. 13. 1832. 
My dear Sir 

. . . Here is the Bank which most assuredly has been 
in its proper sphere, perfectly true, and faithful, to the ad 
ministration; and which has never suffered itself, even while 
it believed itself very unkindly treated, to be betrayed into 
the slightest departure from its duty to the Gov*. All the 
members of the Gov*. can bear witness to this. The President 
himself has no hostile feeling towards the Bank, he is dis 
posed to agree to its renewal with certain modifications, and 
the Bank is disposed to accept these modifications. And yet 
with no real difference between them, they are now playing 
into the hands of his enemies, who desire nothing better than 



1 8 2 Correspondence of Nicholas Bid die 

to see us at variance. This certainly cannot be right. Is it not 
wiser for the Presidents friends to disarm at once his antag 
onists, of their strongest weapon, to settle the question at 
once; and thus unite all the Presi friends before the next 
election? This seems so clear, and obvious, that I am aston 
ished that his friends do not immediately take the matter into 
their own hands, and settle it their own way. 

Now what should prevent this reconciliation ? If the Presi 
dent is restrained from making any advances, I have no such 
&gt;feeling, &amp; I will make them myself. You know that I care 
/ nothing about the election. I care only for the interests con- 
/ fided to my care, and so far from having the least ill will 
toward the President, so far from wishing to embarrass his 
administration, I will do every thing consistent with my 
duty, to relieve it from trouble, and will go nine tenths of 
the way to meet him in conciliation. This is very easy. The 
whole can be settled in five minutes. 

For instance, the President wishes some modifications in 
the charter. Well, let him take the charter and make any 
changes he likes, let him write the whole charter with his 
own hands, I am sure that we would agree to his modi 
fications; and then let him and his friends pass it. It will 
then be his work. He will then disarm his adversaries, he 
will gratify his friends, and remove one of the most un 
comfortable and vexatious public questions that can be 
stirred. 

Now why could not this be? The moment is propitious and 
if done soon it will be done triumphantly. Do think of all 
these things, &amp; if as a friend of the President, as well as of the 
Bank, you can accomplish this work of peaceful mediation, 
you will relieve both parties from an apparent misunder-

Dear Sir 

... It is my fortune to have other subjects of confi 
dential liaison with M r . L. which operate favorably as induce 
ment to similar understanding respecting the bank. After 
arranging those subjects yesterday at his house where I saw 
him, when I was about leaving his study without mentioning 
the bank for he had told me the day before that it would 
require some days, and I am very cautious not to torment 
him with it he himself introduced it by saying, I suppose 
you 11 see Biddle at Philadelphia and let him know how mat 
ters are as to the bank. No doubt, said I. Well then, contin 
ued he, I wish you would ascertain from him whether the 
bank will agree to the President s views of the terms for a 
new charter, and he proceeded to recapitulate them. As my 
memory might fail me in some particulars, said I, suppose I 
make a written note of them. Very well, he rejoined and 
accordingly I sat down at his desk, made the enclosed min 
ute, with his assistance, read it to him when done and we 
parted on the footing of his unreserved declaration of his 
desire that I would submit them for your approbation or 
otherwise, as may be. Tho I send the original protocol as 
it may be called, which I have dated and signed that you may 
keep it in Rei Vei testimonium yet I proceed to rewrite

the items, as the memorandum made yesterday is not per 
fectly plain from the hurry of writing it. 

1. Government to have no interest in the bank. 

2. President of the U S empowered to appoint a Director at 
each branch so that government may be represented at each. 

3. States authorized to tax the property both real &amp; per 
sonal of the bank within the said States in like manner as 
the States may tax other property within them. 

4. The bank to hold no real Estate but such as it may be 
constrained to take in payment or security of its debts, and 
to be compelled by law to sell that within stated time. 

The foregoing I understand from M r . L. are the President s 
terms. 

5. A certain proportion of the stock or capital to be thrown 
open to new subscriptions, which may be done by prorata re 
duction of the present capital, or by addition to it. 

This 5 is not the President s requirement: but M r . 
M r . L. seems to be very tenacious of it, always urging that it 
will facilitate very much the recharter. 

6. The Directors to nominate annually two or three per 
sons of whom the President to appoint any one as President 
of the bank. 

This 6 neither the President nor M r . L. like. It is 
the suggestion of others he said. . . .

I yesterday wrote a hasty letter explaining my views 
in regard to the modifications suggested of the Charter of the 
Bank. In addition to what was then said of the disposition 
of the Bank, to acquiesce in any modification which may 
protect the rights of the States from any encroachment 
by the Bank I will now add that if the President wishes to 
stipulate that no new Branch shall be established without 

demeanour and vivacity of speech, added to great powers of work, and acuteness 
in detecting the foibles of others, made him a formidable opponent. Further, his 
marriage with the sister of Bischoffswerder, until lately the King s favourite ad 
viser, added to his influence, which, as was natural with a foreigner, inclined 
toward the attractive and gainful course. Long afterwards the saviour of Prussia, 
Baron von Stein, classed him among the narrow, selfish, insincere men who had 
been the ruin of nations." Cf. Rose, J. H., William Pitt and the Great War (Lon

the assent of the State in which it is proposed to locate it, 
I think there would be no objection to it on the part of the 
Bank 

In truth I believe there is no change desired by the Presi 
dent which would not be immediately assented to by the 
Bank. And this it is which gives me so much regret, to find 
the President &amp; the Bank apparently estranged while there 
is really no difference between them, and to see the Presidents 
friends lose the present opportunity of settling the question 
so well, &amp; so advantageously for him.

CHARLES JARED INGERSOLL TO BIDDLE 

Washington 6 Mch 32 
Dear Sir 

... I think I have gathered a motive for M r . M c Duf- 
fie s 1 almost unaccountable capitulation: if so there was 
more method than madness in it. The Speaker informs me 
that M C D told him that he did not mean nor wish to let the 
bank be discussed before the Tariff. Hence his yielding to an 
inquiry which will just occupy in his reckoning the few weeks 
to elapse before the Tariff becomes the topic. This being so, 
or at any rate, I have another plan to counteract him: that 
is, soon after the bank has invited investigation, as I expect 
it to do tomorrow, and a committee is appointed accordingly, 
to get the subject taken up in Senate and a bill sent to the 
h of R if possible before the Tariff is before them. I had an 
interesting conversation yesterday with M r . Livingston on 
this subject. What do you think of a plan, said I, by which 
Pennsylvania shall yield something of the tariff to the well 
disposed and moderate of Virginia and the Carolinas in equiv 
alent for their uniting with her in support of such a modi 
fied bank as the President approves and thus firmly securing 
tariff bank and union altogether? I like it very much said he. 
But can you accomplish it since M c Duifie has given way to 
the enquiry ? I do not consider that, said I, indespensible. There 
is a very strong spirit in Pennsylvania for the bank, I mean 
in the delegation, and they do not intend to let M r . M c Duffie 
surrender their desire for his views. I am sensible, said he, 

1 Refers to McDuffie allowing the Clayton Resolution of investigation to 
pass. Ingersoll and the other Biddle constituents were thoroughly aroused by Mc 
Duffie s capitulation. Adams declared he was "either a coward or a traitor"; while 
Ingersoll "thought it was want of nerve and coolness."

that your delegation is very much bent on the bank. . . . 
What do you think, said I, of my prevailing on M r . Madison to 
appear before the public recommending such a compromise ? 
I believe I c d get him to do it. Very well, said he: or, I con 
tinued, shall it begin at some primary assembly in Penn 
sylvania ? The difficulty now, after all I have understood from 
you, is not with the Executive, but with Congress. Yes, said 
he, this unlucky resolution of inquiry; but for that I think 
there would be no difficulty. The President would sign such 
a bill as you and I have arranged. I have never heard him 
say so. But I have good reason to rely on it. (I think those 
were his very words.) 

Thus, you perceive, that McDuffie and Clayton agreeing 
in opposition to the Tariff, and that the Tariff is the first 
consideration, have, no doubt without concert, contrived 
between the resolution of the one and the concession of the 
other to postpone the bank lest it should by its combinations 
of votes interfere with their primary object and this sus 
pends all the inclining of the President to give way to what 
he is I am persuaded more alarmingly satisfied is the set 
tled determination of that State without whose hearty good 
will his stan dets. 1 Such is the state of things we have to 
deal with. If a Pennsylvanian capable of taking the lead 
would now do so on the footing of accommodating the Presi 
dent and the South by some modification (which can be well 
afforded) of the Tariff in return for most of them (for I do not 
expect all) yielding their objections to a modified bank, it 
would be that Pennsylvanians certain road to honor, influ 
ence and office. I mean to sound Wilkins about it this very 
day. I shall probably meet him at the Atty Genl 3 dinner or

... On the subject of printing &amp; printers I have no 
difficulty &amp; no reserve as you may have seen in the course 
of the enquiry. The press is the channel of communication 
between the Bank &amp; the Country, and I have no more diffi 
culty about remunerating privately for the work done on 
account of the Bank, than I would for paying the passage of 
the clerks of the Bank, in a steam boat or a stage when they 
were travelling on the business of the Bank. Why should we? 
If the grocer at the corner wishes to apprize the Community 
that he has some fresh figs, he is obliged to pay the Editor 
of the Newspaper by the inch, it would not be fair there 
fore to let the Editor do work in every respect similar for the 
Bank, without any remuneration, while he has to pay for 
paper &amp; types &amp; printing. I will thank you therefore to ask 
M r Gales to print six thousand extra copies of his paper con 
taining M r Adams &amp; your report together, and send them 
to proper persons in proper places. . . .

Dear Sir, 

On my arrival I * began with a full and frank conver 
sation with Mr. McLane on the subject of the Bank and at 
his suggestion saw Mr. Livingston after which they con 
ferred and I saw Mr. Livingston. 

The general purport of my communication was this. The in- 
vestigation has given a new aspect to our affairs it dis 
arms, or ought to disarm some of the hostility hitherto enter 
tained toward it, and furnishes a new motive for pressing a 
decision. Under these circumstances it would be very agree 
able if the Executive would concur in promoting the object 
which we would gladly attain by accepting such modifica 
tions as would be agreeable to the administration. I stated 
moreover the extreme awkwardness of having such a measure 
before Congress while the Department to which it belonged 
had no cognizance of it and my anxiety to cooperate with the 
Executive in modifying and perfecting the measure. I need 
not detail peculiarity of their situation which makes them 
passive and all that I could learn from Mr. Livingston was 
that the awkwardness was irretrievable and that it only 
remained to make the bill as unexceptionable as possible. 

We have then parted good friends.

I think moreover that it has reached a point where we may

question and being obliged to leave the capitol to prepare 
for some company to dine with me, I write these views as pre

yesterday has been consumed in rejecting a very distract

My Dear Sir, 

Mr Biddle left on yesterday. I feel it to be a duty to 
express to those particularly interested in the Bank, my 
sense of the great benefit which has been derived from his 
presence and attention here. We should have done but badly 
without him. His address &amp; ability, in satisfying the doubftt 
of friends, softening the opposition of enemies, &amp; explaining \ 
whatever needed explanation, have been important cause in/ 
producing the result, which has, so far, attended the Bill. 
I can assure you, that this is not only my opinion, but that 
of others, also, the most competent observers &amp; judges. At 
dinner, yesterday, where gentlemen were speaking of the 
subject, a very distinguished person observed, "that it was 
only once in a century that a man was to be found so emi 
nently fitted to be the head of such an Institution as Mr B." 
... I am, Dear Sir, with very true regard.

My dear Sir 

You will perceive by the Papers to day what effect 
the Veto has had upon your Stock, and the Stockholders have 
now the satisfaction of being acquainted with the objections 
which have influenced General Jackson in refusing a renewal 
of the Charter. The period has arrived in which those inter 
ested in the Bank have no hope but from your exertions and 
the only means are to endeavour to defeat his election which 
as far as I can learn may be accomplished by opposing to him 
one or more of those Papers in this State whose influence &amp; 
circulation is great and that this can be arranged I am con 
fident. I am only anxious an immediate attack should be 
made upon him, for to be effective it must be made at once. 
I have had a conversation with Webb 2 who I am sure is 
ready, very little is required to turn this state and I think it 
can be done. I take the liberty of offering you one Suggestion, 
which is, that at the present moment of excitement it would be 
a matter of serious accommodation to the Stockholders many 
of them, if directions were given to the Branch here to lend on 
the Stock either temporarily or on the I st . of October without 
grace when they can have time to make other arrangements. I 
pray you to believe that this is disinterested as regards myself.

To W^illiam G. Bucknor 195 

favor of the 12 th inst. &amp; thank you for the suggestions it 
contains, which are I am sure dictated by the most friendly 
disposition to the Bank. The subject, as you may readily 
suppose, has occupied much of my thoughts, so that I 
am able to speak of it at once but after very deliberate 
reflection. 

I am very sensible of the value to the Bank of the result 
contemplated &amp; fully aware of the importance of what you 
mention in accomplishing that result. But the agency of the 
Bank in contributing to it is a matter of very grave consider 
ation. When the Bank was denounced by the President, &amp; all 
the influences of his patronage arrayed against it, it was an 
obvious duty not to suffer the institution to be crushed by 
the weight of power but to appeal directly to the country 
and as the whole channel through which the understand 
ings of the community could be reached was the press, we 
strove to disseminate widely correct information in regard 
to the Bank. That object is accomplished. The Bank is fairly 
before the country and large majorities of both houses of 
Congress have decided in its favor. One individual has how 
ever opposed his will to the deliberate reflections of the rep 
resentatives of the people and the question now is whether 
the Bank ought to exert itself to defeat the reelection of that 
person who is now the only obstacle to its success. On that 
question I have made up my mind that to interfere in the 
election would be a departure from the duty which the 
Bank owes to the country. The first law of its existence is en-\ 
tire and unqualified abstinence from all political connexions j 
&amp; exertions. This it has hitherto practised, and whatever^ 
may be the consequences, must continue to practise. The 
temptations to a contrary course are I feel very great, but 



Correspondence of Nicholas Biddle 

I believe it to be the duty of the Bank to resist them. If I 
could permit myself to do otherwise, it would have an ad 
ditional satisfaction in the prospect of serving one who has 
I think been very hardly and unjustly treated by his politi 
cal associates. 

You will easily believe that I think our differences of 
opinion on this subject arise merely from our looking at the 
object from different points of view, for I think in my situ 
ation You would probably entertain the same sentiments. I 
shall always be glad to hear from you whenever you have 
leisure, &amp; remain. 

BIDDLE TO HENRY CLAY 1 

(private) Phil a . August I st 1832 

My dear Sir 

You ask what is the effect of the Veto. My impression 
is that it is working as well as the friends of the Bank and of 
the country could desire. I have always deplored making the 
Bank a party question, but since the President will have it 
so, he must pay the penalty of his own rashness. As to the 
Veto message I am delighted with it. It has all the fury of 
a chained panther biting the bars of his cage. It is really a 
manifesto of anarchy such as Marat or Robespierre might 
have issued to the mob of the faubourg St Antoine: and my 
hope is that it will contribute to relieve the country from 
the dominion of these miserable people. You are destined to 
be the instrument of that deliverance, and at no period of 
your life has the country ever had a deeper stake in you. I 
wish you success most cordially, because I believe the insti 
tutions of the Union are involved in it.

. . . The Bank does not mean to commence any sys- 
i tematic reduction of its loans with a view to winding up its 
affairs. It does not mean to begin to close its concerns. It 
means to go on in its general business just as if no such event 
as the President s negative had ever happened. The only 
alteration it proposes is rather in the form than in the amount 
of its loans an alteration which under any circumstances, 
it would be disposed to recommend and it is this to give 
gently and gradually the loans of the Bank the direction of 
domestic bills, converting where it can be done the line of 
notes discounted, into domestic bills of exchange, which be 
ing payable at maturity, will give the Institution a greater 
command over its funds. . . .

the call might be, to ask directions or instructions from the

Washington Jan y 18/33 
Dear Sir 

During the few days of my stay here I have made it a 
point to ascertain from good authority what the probability 
is as to the bank of the U S; the result is an assurance that 
some time during one of the Sessions of the next Congress, 
the Executive will invite their attention to the subject, 1 and 
submit a plan, which, with modifications, such as the Legis 
lative and Executive may eventually agree upon, will become 
the institution. What the plan is I did not inquire. Not with 
standing all that has passed it is impossible to travel ever so 
short a distance as from Philadelphia to Washington without 
perceiving universal preference and undiminished confidence 
in the papers of the bank of the US....

cease, and the composition of Congress be different and less 
favorable, there are still to be discerned the elements of hope. 
The new state of parties will be founded upon a combination 
of the South, and the leaders of it (the Southern party) are 
friends of the Bank upon principle, and will be more so from 
opposition to Jackson. If they succeed in their first object, 
of uniting the South, they will carry the whole of it in favor 
of the Bank, either actively or passively, those who cannot 
act in that direction, becoming neutralised and Quiescent. 
In the middle and Northern States, and in the West too, 
their view as to the Bank question will be an argument to 
gain friends for their party. Against a combination which 
threatens to be so powerful, Van Buren will have to look for 
alliances in the North, I think, and in so doing will be obliged 
to give up his hostility to the Bank. It is quite possible, in 
deed, that he may come into conjunction with some of its 
most decided friends. In the mean time, Jackson s influence 
will be diminishing, and his personal feelings will by no 
means have the same weight as heretofore. And, besides, 
I think he will be pressed by so powerful an opposition, 
that even he will be obliged to behave himself with some 
decency. 

What I have thus hinted at, is no doubt the subject of 
calculation with those who are looking to the future, and I 
shall be surprized if even at the next session there be not 
an altered tone towards the Bank in Congress, less ferocity 
among its opponents, and more confidence on the part of its 
friends, who, by the way, can never be too much commended 
for the zeal and courage they have manifested under the most 
unpromising circumstances. . . .

and myself adds another to the many previous obligations 
under which you had placed me. I concur entirely with you 
in thinking that, on every account, such a change in the 
amicable relations between that gentleman and myself would 
be very unfortunate. 

After the introduction of the Compromise bill, it was mani 
fest at Washington that a few of the Eastern friends of Mr. 
W., supposing that I had taken a step that would destroy 
me in the public estimation, indulged hopes that a new party 
would be formed, of which he might be the sole head. I thought 
that Mr. W. himself made an unprovoked and unnecessary 
allusion to me when, in describing the struggles of Mr. Cal- 
houn in a Bog, he stated that no friend could come to his 
relief without sharing in his embarrassment. Even the female 
part of the audience understood to whom the allusion was 
directed. I need not say to you that I felt myself under no sort 
of obligation to Mr. Calhoun himself or to the State from 
which he came; that I had experienced nothing but unkind- 
ness from both ; and that I have come under no engagement 
whatever with him in regard to the future. If S Carolina 
had stood alone, or if she could have been kept separated 
from the riot of the South in the contest which I apprehended 
to be impending, I should not have presented the measure 
which I did. 

On a subsequent occasion Mr. W. imputed to me, in a man 
ner I thought unfriendly, an abandonment of the Protective 
policy. To that suggestion an immediate reply was made. And 

deavored to change Webster s opinion on the subject; and that while Webster was 
visiting in Philadelphia he had prevented the Senator s friends from giving a 
public dinner for fear it might " furnish an occasion for his less discreet friends to 
do and say things inexcusable at a moment of excitement." Webster left the city 
"in a frame of mind entirely satisfactory." 



204 Correspondence of Nicholas Eiddle 

to his chief attack upon the bill itself a prompt answer was 
given, which you had seen in the public prints. Whatever 
momentary feelings were excited, during the progress of the 
measure, I assure you after it was carried that they entirely 
ceased ; and all my sentiments of attachment to Mr. W. re 
turned in their undiminished strength. I took several occa 
sions to evince to him this state of my heart; and I was happy 
to believe that it was fully reciprocated by him. I assure you 
that on my part these feelings shall be constantly cherished. 

You will have heard from him or others that the Compro 
mise * was not offered until after the fullest and freest con 
ferences with him and others. Two distinct meetings at my 
quarters of n or 12 Senators (at the first of which he at 
tended, and to the last he was summoned) took place, in 
which it was fully discussed and considered. At the last I 
interrogated each Senator individually, and I understood 
every one to agree substantially to the bill (for I had pre 
pared a bill) except one, who finally voted for it. Several of 
those who had, as I supposed, assented to it voted against it. 

I do not now think that the course of Mr. W. and other 
gentlemen from the East and North who voted with him, is to 
be regretted certainly not, if the difference of opinion should 
produce, and it ought to produce, no alienation between 
friends. Many of them I know so voted, from considerations 
of policy, rather than from any positive objections to the bill. 
And the course which they pursued will probably tend to rec 
oncile the South more strongly to a measure, in which it has 
got a nominal triumph, whilst all the substantial advantages 
have been secured to the Tariff States. . . .

I wrote to you to day that M r L. would be in New

well to see him. The whole question of peace or war lies in 
the matter of the deposits. If they are withdrawn, it is a decla

before any irrevocable step is taken. 

ROBERT W. GIBBES TO BIDDLE 

Private Baltimore 13 th * April 1833. 

My D r . Sir, 

The contents of this letter you will comprehend, when 
you connect with it a late conversation held by yourself with 
a mutual acquaintance of ours, and to whom an unexpected 
opportunity has been offer d of gaining the following informa 
tion, on which you may rely as of the highest, &amp; most direct 
authority. 

You need not be informed of the hostility of the Admin 
istration to the Institution over which you preside, but the 
following items must prove interesting. At this moment 
the opinion of the different members as to the immediate 
withdrawal of the Government Deposites is asked, and 
their individual opinion stands thus. In the first place the 
President considers that he has conquered all of his diffi 
culties but that of the Bank, &amp; this he is determined to 
accomplish "coute qui coute." Were it left to Kendall &amp; 
himself they would withdraw the Deposites immediately, 



2 o 6 Correspondence of Nicholas Bid die 

but believing as they do, that the Bank has 40 or 50 mil 
lions discount in the Western Country, which it will be com 
pelled to curtail, whether or no, they prefer the odium to rest 
on its Head, instead of that of the Government. M r M c Lane 
considers that the Government would be prostrated by their 
taking this step, and therefore is adverse to the withdrawal 
at present. The Post Master Gen 1 , objects to the step at this 
moment also, but considers the convenience of making his 
Deposits in State Banks so important, that he contemplates 
asking permission (which he thinks will not be refused him) 
of making his separate deposits in them, more especially 
as you will not permit him to overdraw, without a confiden 
tial letter from him to that effect. Taney is for immediate with 
drawal. And the influence of such men as Com 6 Stewart, 
Whitney, &amp;c, is exerted to effect this object, which will pro 
duce the natural consequence of lowering the market value 
of the Stock. The present disposition of the influential party 
is to withdraw the deposits in October next. But the wily 
Magician is for throwing the responsibility on Congress, be 
lieving that they will have a sufficient majority to Carry 
their measure. His hostility to the Bank is implacable; and 
the various offers made to them by different State Banks 
tally s much better with their ulterior views than the secur 
ity offered by the present mode of Deposit. In a few words, 
if it be not determined on to withdraw the Deposits in 
October, the firm belief is, that the President, instead of 
recommending this measure in his next annual Message, will 
simply state in it some definite period when he is determined 
they shall be withdrawn.

... The fact is that the real sin of the Bank in the 
eyes of the Executive is, that it is refractory &amp; unmanage 
able. When these people first came into power on a current of 
overwhelming popularity, to which they thought every thing 
should yield, they considered the Bank a part of the spoil, 
and one of their first efforts was to possess themselves of the 
institution for the benefit of their partizans. We saw all that 
would follow from the slightest concession and deter 
mined, since there must be War, to begin it in the frontiers 
by letting them know that they were to have nothing to 
do with the Bank. From that time they resolved, that as\ 
they could not bend it they would break it. This is the whole \ 
secret of the opposition to the institution. I know this so well ) 
that I feel myself a much more profound Jurist than all the \ 
lawyers and all the statesmen of Virginia put together, for in /

I am in principle opposed to all Banks, and of course 
to that over which you preside. I wrote the review of that 
question in the Southern review. I have just written the ar

send by this post. I have not varied in my good opinion of 
your personal Character, to which I have not omitted to bear

If I could oppose the banking system with success, I would 
do so; but I cannot. Under these circumstances, I very 
greatly prefer the renewal of your institution, to the Schemes 
of Gen 1 . Jackson and Van Beuren; &amp; I have determined to 
open upon them the battery of the Press here. Have you any 
facts or suggestions that you would be willing to communi 
cate to me confidentially in aid of my design? If so, I will use 
them as I here propose. If not, all is well; I shall go on, with

BIDDLE TO THOMAS COOPER ESQ. 

Phil a . May 6 th . 1833. 
Dear Sir 

... I have observed with great interest what you have 
written on the subject of the Bank. The truth is, that the 
question is no longer between this Bank &amp; no Bank. It is a 
mere contest between Mr. Van Buren s Government Bank 
and the present institution between Chestnut St and 
Wall St between a Faro Bank and a National Bank. 
You do not perhaps know that soon after these people came 
into power, there was a deliberation in Caucus of the most 
active of the Jackson Party as to the means of sustaining 
themselves in place and the possession of the Bank was 
ranked as a primary object. For this purpose they began in 
1829 with an effort to remove an obnoxious President of one 
of the Branches which was to be followed by a systematic 
substitution of their creatures throughout the whole insti 
tution. This experiment failed, owing to the firmness of thev 
Directors who determined that they would not permit the \ 
interference of the Executive Officers. . . . From that moment 
they despared of turning the Bank to their political purposes, 
and have been intent on breaking it down to substitute some 
machinery more flexible. To that spirit, a new impulse has 
been given by a coterie of gamblers who having ascertained 



210 Correspondence of Nicholas Bid die 

the views of the Executive before the last session of Congress 
and believing that they must be fatal to the Bank, made large 
contracts on time. These executive denunciations not hav 
ing sufficiently lowered the stock to render the speculations 
safe or profitable, the parties are now endeavoring to force 
the Executive into the withdrawal of the public deposits, as 
a measure that would cover their retreat. This combination 
of political gamblers and gambling politicians is the key to 
the whole history of the relations between the Bank &amp; the 
executive. Against that coalition, all honest men should exert 
themselves. I am extremely gratified therefore at the opening 
of that battery of yours, and shall be very glad to supply you 
with all the ammunition in my power. . . .

My dear Sir 

I have had the pleasure of receiving your favor of the

of acting next winter in the legislature has brought out an 
expression of corresponding sentiments in other quarters. 

What should be deeply impressed on the minds of the 
Southern gentleman is, I think, this that the administra 
tion people mean to unite in an outcry against any Bank, &amp; 
having thus secured the cooperation of the constitutionalists 
in the destruction of the present Bank, they will then build 
up one of their own, leaving the Constitutionalists to be 
laughed at, after having been duped. The question is no 
longer open. It is a question between Chestnut St and Wall 
St. a question whether the Central Gov 1 . is to have the

sion has accordingly been set on foot to make arrangements

shorten the time for which they buy bills of exchange. This 
will make the institution strong &amp; if any sudden movement

constitutional question?" "Poh," said Woodbury, "that we 
can use to "suit ourselves." And this is what they all in 
tend. I do not believe that a single member of the Cabinet 
has any constitutional doubts about the matter except M r . 
Duane and he, I incline to think, is almost, if not quite as

After a great deal of reflection, we are all satisfied that the 
best thing to be done is to do as little as possible. 1 The ex 
change operations are placed by the resolutions passed to 
day on a proper footing. We do not give any instructions as 
to reducing the local discounts, but we shall reduce ours at 
the Bank, and if you can gradually diminish yours without ex 
citing uneasiness among our customers it would be very good 
policy. Our wish is not to give an order to that effect lest it 
might create alarm, but to do it quietly and imperceptibly. 

The subject which has given us more anxiety than any other 
is the treatment of the Branch notes. We are now satisfied 
that our best plan is to continue to receive them as hereto 
fore and that your Office should do the same. The idea we 
have is this. The balances now in Bank will probably be ab 
sorbed by the disbursements of the Government and in the 
mean time the accruing revenue will be left with the new re 
ceiving Banks. There it may accumulate, and masses of it 
may be held sufficient to incommode some of the smaller 
Branches, to whom it may be suddenly sent. It is better for 
us therefore to absorb it if we can until the measures 
in operation at the Branches will reduce their issues so much 
as to make them not trouble us.

I have this moment read your kind letter of yesterday, 
and am bound to acknoledge that I do not deserve your sup 
port in the way proposed, for, from the immensely increasing 
commerce of this place, the Collector s duties have so much 
increased, that it is quite impossible for him to attend to the 
duties of a Director. Hence, it would be improper for me to 
accept it. I am nevertheless greatly obliged by your kind 
offer &amp; tender you very grateful thanks for it. 

Permit me in this letter to say a word on the subject of 
the present money pressure. It is dreadful here and no hope 
of relief excepting thro your Institution. You must be liberal 
and that to a great extent or you will destroy your friends, 
those who have hitherto sustained your cause and defended 
your course. Let me interest you to take this course, it is due 
to your numerous friends and the public at large would give 
your Institution credit for it. Now that the effect of the late 
measure has been made manifest, you can relieve the whole 
community and rely upon it you would recive due credit &amp; 
consideration for it. I speak to you, my dear Sir, with the 
freedom of a friend. Would to God the Bank would take 
a noble, liberal course and thus justify itself to the world.

were now to open the door to the Commercial Community, it 
would make more friends than it ever had. Its power has

it might be more general.

. . . My own view of the whole matter is simply this. 
The projectives of this last assault on the Bank regret, and 
are alarmed at it but the ties of party allegiance can only 
be broken by the actual conviction of existing distress in the 
community. Nothing but the evidence of suffering abroad 
will produce any effect in Congress. If the Bank remains 
strong &amp; quiet, the course of events will save the Bank &amp; 
save all the institutions of the country which are now in great 
peril. But if, from too great a sensitiveness from the fear 
of offending or the desire of conciliating, the Bank permits 
itself to be frightened or coaxed into any relaxation of its 
present measures, the relief will itself be cited as evidence 
that the measures of the Gov*. are not injurious or oppres 
sive, and the Bank will inevitably be prostrated. Our only 
safety is in pursuing a steady course of firm restriction 
and I have no doubt that such a course will ultimately lead to 

1 President of the Branch at Boston.

. . . My opinion is that no movement should yet be 
made towards a renewal of the Charter, or the establishment 
of a New Bank. The Bank ought to be kept in the rear; the 
usurpation in the front. If we take up the Bank, we play into 
the adversary s hands. We realize his assertions that the only 
question is a renewal of the Charter. It is the usurpation 
which has convulsed the Country. If we put it by and take 
up the Bank, we may &amp; probably would divide about the 
terms of the charter, and finally do nothing leaving things as 
they are. In the other course, the recharter will follow. The 
Country will take care of that.

meet it, either by declarations from the Bank of interested

The first thing of real importance I have heard since 
I came here was communicated this morning by M r . Cal- 
houn. He asked me whether I had heard any thing from 
M r . Southard. I told him no. Well, he said, there is a letter 
from M r . S. in which he states as follows Tliat on his way 
to Baltimore (on Tuesday) a New York Jackson man said 
to him, "As you are going from Washington, I will tell you 
what I would not have told you there. We (meaning himself 
and some of his friends from New York) have been talking 
with the President about the great and increasing distress,

and endeavouring to convince him that this state of things 
cannot continue that some thing must be done. He (Presi 
dent) admitted he had heard some thing, but by no means 
to the extent we stated, of which he seemed to have no idea. 
The result was that the President drew up some questions 
for his cabinet, who were to deliberate upon what was to be 
done." As M r . Southard has been in Philad 3 . you will prob 
ably have heard all this, and heard it more accurately. The 
further fact, stated by M. Calhoun, is material, that there 
are daily meetings of the cabinet. He told me this yesterday, 
and then thought they were about changes in the adminis 
tration. To day, he thinks they are upon the subject of the 
New Yorker s conversation, and considering the question 
"What is to be done." If they have come to that point, we 
shall soon see some movement. Strange as it may seem, I

My dear Sir 

I have received today your favor of the 26 th inst. 
with the copy of the Governor s Message. 2 I regret on many 
accounts that paper. It will prolong the distress now existing 
without effecting any good object, and it is melancholy to see 
a Governor of Pennsylvania thus aiding in the destruction of 
Pennsylvania interests. What makes it more shocking is, that 
up to the very moment of sending the message, those who 
visited him left him under the strongest conviction that he 
was decidedly friendly to the Bank. In truth he ought to have 
been, for so far from frustrating his loan, the Bank actually 
furnished to Mess 8 . Allen the means of paying the last instal 
ment, as the Governor well knew. Of the effect of his message 
on the Bank and upon the financial concerns of Penns a . you 
will form some idea when I mention to you the following fact 
which is a little singular. 

A Committee from New York has been visiting the Bank 
for the purpose of procuring some relief for that city which 
would of course have reacted on our own State. Yesterday the 
Board was to have decided it, &amp; I have no doubt that the Bank 
would have made an effort to give relief but when we saw 
the Governors message saw how totally useless the efforts 
of the Bank had been to sustain the credit of the State in

appeasing the spirit of the party and how little reliance 
could be placed on the men in power, we determined that it 
was in vain to make an effort and accordingly, instead 
of sending the relief expected, we wrote to the New York 
Committee that the conduct of the Governor of Pennsylvania 
obliged the Bank to look to its own safety, and that therefore 
we declined doing any thing at present. 

So much for the first effect of the Governors patriotism

Dear Sir 

. . . Your remarks in regard to the proposed reduc 
tion of the loans at Cincinnati have been read with great 
attention and interest. Situated as the Bank has been for 
some time past, its first object was necessarily its own pro 
tection, for in its safety the whole ultimate security of the 
currency must be found. This we have striven to accomplish 
with the least possible pressure on the community and 
thus far the reductions compared with the deposits are so 
small, that our friends rather reproach us with not having 
done enough, than to have curtailed excessively. The de 
posit Banks being now in full possession of the public reve 
nue may employ it in discounts and leave the Bank of the 
United States the opportunity of gently diminishing its busi 
ness. That with so wide a circulation as 18 or 19 millions 
which the receipts of the public revenue may place in the 
hands of officers who know that no service more acceptable

can be rendered than to employ the funds in injuring the 
Bank, and so many vulnerable points to protect, we shall 
deem it expedient to reduce the present amount of our loans, 
cannot be doubted. The Executive, by removing the public 
revenues has relieved the Bank from all responsibility for the 
currency, and imposed upon it a necessity to look primarily 
to the interest of the Stockholders committed to our charge. 
Our friends must therefore bear with us, if in the midst of 
the present troubles, we should endeavor to strengthen the 
Bank so as to make it able here after to interpose effectively 
for the relief of the Country. . . .

Dear Sir 

I enclose you a letter this day from my assistant Edi 
tor in relation to the Money Market. It is the universal opin 
ion of our friends here, that the recharter of the Bank will 
depend to a great extent, upon the result of the approaching 
election in New York; &amp; I assure you that result, depends 
upon the course of the Bank. If you extend, or if you do not 
curtail, and largely too, you must &amp; will lose the election; 
&amp; I must say in the spirit of frankness, that your friends in 
New York &amp; in Congress loudly complain that you are con 
tinually putting them in the wrong by granting relief and 
thereby rendering their prediction perfectly futile. M r . Mar 
tin late of our State said this morning that many of his 
associates in the House feel very sore on this Lead, and begged 
that when I saw you I would say that to retain the friends it 
has, the Bank must persevere in its curtailments. 1 . . .

April 2 nd . 1834 
Dear sir t 

I have had the pleasure of receiving your favor of the 
3O th inst. which I deemed so important, that before answering 
it, I consulted the Board at their meeting yesterday in the 
same confidential manner in regard to the subject of it. It is, 

1 Biddle received many solicitations from his friends in the same tenor as 
this letter. 

* President of the Branch at Washington, D.C. 



228 Correspondence of Nicholas Eiddle 

as you are aware, a very delicate subject, one of which it is 
very difficult, and yet very necessary, to decide in advance, 
on the best course to be pursued. The opinion of the Board, 
which has my own entire concurrence, is this. 

The Bank of the United States has been compelled in self 
defence to diminish its business and call upon its debtors, and 
refuse to make loans to a very considerable amount. It is still 
doing so and shall do so for some time. If it had the means 
of lending, it would lend to its own customers. The State 
Banks have all had the same warning and should prepare 
themselves in the same way nor is it just that these Banks 
should call upon the Bank of the U S. for the funds which it 
has been husbanding for itself. If it is not just, neither is it 
safe. If there be trouble among the Banks, the only security 
is the Bank of the U. S. It holds its power as a trust for the 
ultimate protection of our banking system, the fate of which 
seems involved in that of the Bank of the U.S. and if we be 
gin by venturing prematurely to the support of institutions 
which may be embarrassed, we may ourselves become too 
much weakened to make decisive efforts at a later stage of 
the disasters which are coming. 

Under these impressions, the Board have declined invari 
ably for some time past numerous applications for loans from 
Banks. They think it decidedly best to abstain from making 
such loans. They think also that it is expedient to abstain 
from all pledges or promises of support to the Banks. We 
/ know not how far such engagements may lead us and 
until the Bank is strong enough to make some general move- 
\ ment for the benefit of the country: were [such] palliatives 
\would rather endanger us than do permanent benefit to 
them. We have been very anxious to make you strong 



To S. H. Smith 229 

and are very desirous that you should continue so for 
which reason, we wish the Office to avoid every engagement 
that would commit its funds. ... In fact, the examination of 
the subject to which your letter has given rise, has brought to\ 
my notice the circumstance that I have inadvertently omitted! 
to apprize you of the wish of the Bank on the 22 nd of January \ 
last that you should bring your loans down fifty thousand dol 
lars below the amount at which they were fixed in October / 
and I mention it now to show you that we have looked to a/ 
reduction rather than an expansion of your business. On the 
whole we should much prefer that you avoid all engagements 
either for general or particular support of the Banks. 

In respect to the balances too, we are anxious that they 
should not be suffered to accumulate particularly as the 
want of confidence among the State Banks may make the \ 
Office the depository of their notes. Neither the notes nor the \ 
balances should remain long. The explosion of the Bank of 
Maryland found this Bank (at Phil a ) in possession of $21,000 / 
of its notes and we shall in consequence pursue a course/ 
of more frequent settlements with the State Banks. 

I wish it were in my power to say that we might relieve the\ \ 
wants of the Banks near you. But I much fear that we could } J 
not do much ultimate good and at the present momen&gt; X y/ 
we must avoid diminishing our means, so as to keep thein 
unbroken when they may hereafter be most needed.

Dear Sir 

The talking will go on in Congress till nothing is done 
and the members and the public become weary. In that case, 
Jackson will hold firm grasp of the public monies, and set the 
opposition at defiance. I have written to suggest a resolution, 
that no Appropriation bill be passed till Congress shall have 
provided by law for some safe deposit of the public monies, 
out of the controul of the President. 

I now venture to suggest, whether in New York and Phila 
delphia, a resolution might not be gotten up, to stop the cus 
tom house collections, in case Congress breaks up, and leaves 
them in Jackson s power. Is there any other possible plan 
that will be efficient? I think the mercantile Interests maybe 
brought to do it. If Jackson obtains controul of the revenue 
we are defeated, and nothing but extensive bloodshed will 
preserve us from a permanent disposition. Assuredly, our 
present war of resolutions and proclamations will do us but 
little good. . . . 

I observe, all our delegation, Pinckney, Clowney, speak 
of your Bank in terms of highest respect, and w d . willingly

but unless the north under Webster coalesce with Calhoun, 1 
nothing will be done this session, if at all. If Jackson seizes 
the revenue in spite of the Senate, and in defiance of a re 
jection of the appropriation bill, the game is up, for he has 
the means and the inclination of buying up not merely politi 
cal but military adherents ; and half measures will only plunge 
us deeper into the whirlpool destined to absorb what little 
of freedom remains. Adieu. 

BIDDLE TO JOHN S. SMITH 

Phil a May 9, 1834 
Dear sir 

I have had the pleasure of receiving your favor of the 
5 th inst. and shall answer it cheerfully. And yet it is difficult 
to answer with certainty. The question you propose is "will 
" relief be afforded to the country by a restoration of the de- 
" posits to the B.U.S. and of harmony between it and the 
"Treasury, and this unconnected with the question of the 
" recharter." Now the mere deposit of accruing revenue in the 
Bank would not of itself justify any immediate expansion of 
the loans, unless taken as an evidence of a change of opinions 
or of feelings toward the Bank on the part of those who gov 
ern at Washington. If there was a cordiality there if there 
was merely a concession of the deliberate efforts to destroy V 
the Bank which has been made for several years past, the \ 
Bank might be disposed to venture much to produce relief^ 
At the same time the question of real and permanent stabil 
ity to the currency is in fact the question of the recharter of 
the Bank and I am satisfied that any thing short of this

can produce only partial and temporary effects. I wish that 
something were done soon, for before long the evils will grow 
entirely beyond our control. For five or six months past the 
Bank has been exerting itself to save Individuals and the 
State Banks, and but for its interposition the evils would 
have fallen upon the country with ten fold severity. These 
efforts however have a natural end and then, when the 
r^feveral hundred State Banks are left to themselves, the con- 
jfusion will before long [be] irretrievable. This Bank is now 
very strong and shall be kept so it must be beyond the 
reach of any possible risk, so as to interpose hereafter when 
the confusion is no longer sufferable. Till then it must re 
tain a position of calm and quiet strength and look on 
anxiously but immovably. It will before long have in its 
vaults nearly one dollar in specie for every dollar of its notes 
in circulation. 

My impressions then are these: 

If the Bank Charter were renewed or prolonged I be 
lieve the pecuniary difficulties of the country would be im 
mediately healed. 

If the deposits were restored and the Bank had a rea 
sonable prospect of not being obliged to draw in its loans 
soon after it had made them, I think the Bank would 
make an effort to relieve the country, and with the Execu 
tive friendly or not hostile, would I think succeed in the 
attempt. 

If the deposits were merely restored and the Executive 
continues its efforts to destroy the Bank the institution 
could not either safely or wisely change its present system, 
which is that of a gentle reduction preparatory to closing its 
concerns.

BIDDLE TO R. M. BLATCHFORD 1 

Phil a June 4 th 1834 
Dear Sir 

... In respect to the other subject of your letter, you 
will I think readily understand the position of the Bank. Be 
lieving as we do that the whole support of the currency must 
devolve on the B.U.S. and seeing as we think we do, that 
the disorders and troubles are but beginning, our great effort 
is to make the Bank not merely strong, but entirely beyond 
the reach of those who, under the name of the Gov 1 . are 
seeking its destruction In this operation the State Banks 
fall in debt. Now we must either settle with these Banks or 
let the debt increase till it may grow entirely beyond our 
control and beyond their means of payment. This is wrong 
in two respects first, because it is not just to the Stock 
holders of the B.U.S. to give to others the gratuitous use of 
so large a portion of their capital and second because 
these large balances may become unsafe. For example, the 
Banks of the City of New York owe to the Branch Bank 
$700,000. Why should they be allowed to owe that sum? 
and what will become of the debt if it be permitted to in 
crease as it probably will to twice that sum? I believe that 
the State Banks themselves will be benefitted by the re 
straint of being obliged to settle and so accommodate their

business to their means. The Bank, as I am sure you are 
aware, is desirous of protecting the community from the 
mischief which threaten it, and has been constantly engaged 
in relieving the Banks and individuals whose solvency has 
been endangered by the measures of the Treasury. At the 
same time the Bank would injure itself &amp; not benefit the 
country, if, after all the warnings which the State Banks as 
well as individuals have had to diminish their business &amp; 
rovide against the storm, it should venture on the Quixot- 
jsni of preventing all inconvenience to the public from the 
measures intended to destroy the Institution. The course 
\ wmch circumstances seem to force upon the Bank is that of 
gradual &amp; gentle diminition of its business, so as to be pre

ways not merely willing, but anxious to learn the opinion of 
judicious friends of the Bank. 

Since the Bank has ceased to be the depository of thex 
public revenue, the indulgence formerly given to the State } 
Banks could scarcely be expected as it would be unrea-/ 
sonable and unjust to the Stockholders of the Bank of the 
U.S. to let the State Banks have the use of a large part of

its capital without interest, while they were making interest\ 
on it. The Board have therefore made a recent order for the J 
periodical settlement of those balances from the State Banks. 
The general object was to keep down this accumulation of 
debt from those institutions at the same time, nothing was 
more remote from the desire of the Bank than to oppress the 
State Institutions. On the contrary we should be disposed tcP 
give every reasonable facility in the settlement of thebalances. 
It was probably some misapprehension of the design of the 
Bank which occasioned the excitement to which you allude 
&amp; which I trust will cease when the nature of these periodical 
regulations of the balances is better known from practice. 

BIDDLE TO ALEXANDER PORTER 1 

Phil 3 . June 14. 1834 
Dear Sir 

The last mail brought me your favor of the II th inst 
which shall not fail to receive immediate attention as soon 
as we hear from the Branch at New Orleans on the subject. 
As yet we have had no communication whatever in regard 
to it. 

I regret very much the decision of the House on M r Clay s 
resolutions : for its effect will I fear be to render the state of 
the country much more embarrassing during the summer. 
The House have it now in their power, by passing those reso 
lutions, to give immediate and general relief to the country. 
If the House by however small a majority, were to order 
the restoration of the Deposits, no matter whether it were 
vetoed or signed by the Pres 1 ., it would not only relieve the 
Senate from the reproach of siding against the Pres*. and the 

1 Senator from Louisiana.

people but it would establish such a relation between the 
Congress and the Bank, as would induce the latter to make 
great efforts to restore confidence and prosperity. With such 
a vote of Congress, twenty-four hours would be sufficient to 
establish peace, and to insure the return of better times for 
the country. On that subject my convictions are strong 

"and were it not for the misinterpretation to which it would 
be liable, I should go down &amp; talk with you all about it. 

Do you think it practicable to carry the resolutions? The 
majority was 20 which requires a change of only n votes. 
Now I have no doubt that many members like M r King of 
Georgia, who are well disposed even to recharter the Bank, 
but despairing of the recharter, think the restoration of the 
deposites without being followed by a certainty of a rechar 
ter, would benefit neither the country. In this they are mis 
taken. I think for instance I could venture to say that if such 
a vote were secured, the Bank would feel no reluctance in 
giving one, or if necessary, two millions of loans to Louisiana 
as requested for her relief. This could be done because such 
a vote is peace and harmony &amp; confidence between the Bank 
&amp; the Congress. In truth I know of no way in which all the 
interest on the Western waters could be more immediately &amp; 
substantially advanced than by such a vote, which it would 
be in the power of Eleven men, who are sent to Congress to 

j promote these interests, to give in a few days. Could not that 
resolution be brought up? I should think there were men 
enough in the House to do that good service to their section 
of the country, even if it did cost them a frown at the Palace.

BIDDLE TO WILLIAM APPLETON 

Phil a . July 4 th 1834 
Dear Sir 

Your favor of the 2y th ult was duly received and the 
letter inclosed in it will not fail to receive the respectful at 
tention due to the signers of it. 

The Board have deemed it inexpedient to change the course 
of the Bank during the session of Congress, but when it was 
ascertained that nothing could be done, upon the adjourn 
ment, a Committee was appointed, to consider what measures 
would be necessary in consequence of that event. This Com 
mittee will report in a few days, and in their deliberations, 
the views contained in the communication you have for 
warded will have their due weight. In the mean time, I think 
it right to say that the paper is written under an entire mis 
apprehension of the course and situation of the Bank. These 
gentlemen say "it is well understood that the Bank is pur 
suing a regular system of curtailment apparently at the rate ,. 
of about a million of dollars per month." Now the fact is that \ 
the Bank is not curtailing its business a single dollar; no cur- J 
tailment of any description has been ordered since January 
last, and all that was then directed has with a few exceptions 
been executed, so that the Bank has not I believe a wish to 
reduce its present amount of loans and certainly has adopted 
no regular system of curtailment. In respect to your own 
Office, you know perfectly, that you have been under no 
restriction of any kind as to the amount of your loans, and 
that since the removal of the deposits, Boston is the only point 
in the whole establishment except Savannah (where the busi 
ness voluntarily fell off after the run upon it) where no re- 



238 Correspondence of Nicholas Biddle 

duction was directed, and it is moreover the only place where 
the discounts have increased, they being at this moment 
more than half a million of dollars beyond the amount in 
October. 

What has probably induced the belief of this curtailment is 
the diminition of the apparent aggregate of Loans in the pub 
lished statements, but these intelligent men of business must 
perceive that this is the natural result of this season of the 
year of the maturity of the bills from the South, which can 
not be replaced by other bills from the South, as the sea 
son of purchasing them goes by, so that these reductions are 
not compulsory but voluntary and inevitable. Of the nature 
of these presumed curtailments I can offer no better illustra 
tion than what is furnished by the accounts up to the I 8t . of 
July now lying before me showing the following comparison 
of the discounts during the last month.

Now there is an actual increase of discounts (for the purchase 
of a foreign Bill is as much a loan as the purchase of an inland 
Bill) amounting to $655,181.07, altho of those two classes 
of Loans, the local discounts and Domestic Bills there is a 
diminition, but this diminition is voluntary, and so far as 
concerns the present subject is worth remarking. 

The whole diminition in local Discounts is 3I5&gt;94949 

of this the diminition at Boston is 201,137.13

/directed, nor advised, nor suggested by the Bank that as 
I far as the Bank is concerned, it is voluntary and forms no

part "of a regular system of curtailment." Again; the dimini-\ 
tion of the domestic bills is $860,990.67. This is composed \ 
mainly of the diminished purchases at New Orleans, Mobile I 
&amp; Charleston to the amount of 851,024.05, of diminished pur- / 
chases at other Western and South Western Offices amount-/ 
ing to 374,540.27. While at Boston your Domestic Bills of 
Exchange have increased $385,091.28. Your aggregate busi 
ness in local Discounts &amp; Domestic Bills has increased $127,- 
932.14 during the month of June moreover the loans of 
the Office are larger, much larger than they generally are at 
this season of the year, thus,

26, 1834 1,248,964.32 1,587,631.16 2,839,595.98 

From all this, I think our friends will perceive I st . That 
the Bank is not pursuing any course of curtailment at all. 
2 nd . That the last months operations have been in fact a con 
siderable expansion of Loans and 3 rd . that of all the Cities 
of the United States, that which has the least reason to 
complain is Boston I say emphatically Boston, because 
Boston is the only Branch where no curtailments were 
ordered, the only Branch which has actually and largely 
increased its Loans the only Branch which from the re 
moval of the Deposits to the present day, has had no re 
striction put upon the amount of its Loans. If the Board have 
found in the situation of the Branch enough to justify the 
exemption from these restraints, it was not certainly to be 
presumed the party most favored should most complain. 

Having said this much, I could wish to go no farther and 
yet I ought to add a few words more in regard to the sugges-

defence to separate themselves entirely from that Institu

resolve themselves at last into this, that if the Bank does not 
do what the Gentlemen wish, the political party to which 
they belong will denounce the Bank. Now it is true that the 
Gentlemen who administer the Bank concur in their indi 
vidual characters with the party just named, and will al 
ways be disposed to cooperate with them for general benefit, 
t nothing could be more immediately &amp; decidedly fatal to 
that cooperation than the appearance of any disposition to

Political party or association desires to separate itself from the 
Bank be it so. The parting will be a source of deep regret, 
butthere would be deeper regret at doing wrong to avoid

Stockholders and of the country and it will never yield any

My Dear Sir 

. . . Without further preface then I assure you, there 
is much dissatisfaction in this City and State among a very 
large portion of the friends of the Bank, and those of influence 
in the Whig party and sure am I that it is increasing every 
day. 

Our Merchants and traders generally have been in hopes 
for some time past that circumstances might occur to pro 
duce a change of Policy on the part of the Government to 
wards the Bank that some happy influence might have 
sprung up at Washington, and that light might have broken 
in upon the chaos, in which the dominant party are un 
doubtedly involved. 

The adjournment of Congress has dissipated this forlorn 
hope, and they now begin to look to the present and the 
future to the former suffering under a painful evil, and to 
the latter with increased anxiety and alarm.

The language is general among them, "We have now no 
chance for relief, but from the Bank of the United States, 
which institution is called upon, we think by every considera 
tion to extend its loans. As regards the Institution itself, the 
best informed Financiers in the City (among whom I name 
Mr Gallatin) declare that this can be done with perfect 
regard to the Safety of the Institution and undoubtedly 
with the best possible policy. The Safety fund Banks of the 
State, under the influence of the Albany Regency, 1 have 
considerably curtailed their issues and refuse to extend 
them throwing all the odium of the present extreme scar 
city of money throughout this State upon your Bank. Gentle 
men from many counties of the State have assured me, that 
the farmers men of much influence, believe that their suf 
fering is owing to that assigned cause. The Regency presses 
are \ daily filled with articles calculated to induce this opin 
ion, and it is fast gaining ground Nay, my informants go 
much further, and declare, that the Regency are delighted 
with the present state of things, and rely exultantly for their 
success upon its continuance, believing that they, through 
the State loan, can turn the relief to their great account. 
These are the opinions of men entirely friendly to the Bank 
and they communicate their information with great re 
luctance. In this City, I pray of you to be assured, such is the 
coincidence among our merchants in this opinion, and the ex 
citement thence resulting, that I have no doubt measures will 
shortly be taken (should things remain as they are) that can 
not fail to have the most unhappy effect upon the Bank, and 
the great cause of Constitutional freedom. Indeed I have

Phil a . July 9 th . 1834 
Dear Sir 

I have this morning had the pleasure of receiving your 
favor of the 8 th inst. We have waited for the adjournment of 
Congress before taking any final course in regard to the Bank, 
because till then the movement of the Government was un 
certain. The subject is now under examination by a Commit 
tee of the Board who will probably report in a day or two. 
My own individual opinion is, that having reached the point 
of entire safety &amp; being in some sort divorced from the Execu 
tive, the Bank is now at liberty to consult exclusively the 
interest of the Stockholders and the Community. In such a 
state of things it seems inexpedient to impose or to continue 
curtailments merely for the sake of any effect they might be 
presumed to produce abroad, and I shall not be surprized if 
further reductions of the loans should be suspended. No 
determination, however, is yet made, and therefore nothing 
should be said about it in your journal I should think at 
present.

Dear Sir 

The success of your exertions at the ensuing election 
will mainly depend on the course to be pursued by the Bank; 
the Colera and the drought have done some service, but you 
alone can prevent an active fall trade in our agricultural prod 
ucts. The regency have resolved, through the Safety Fund 
Banks, to grant every facility to raise, if possible, the price 
of grain about the commencement of October, in order to 
satisfy the farming interest that our embarrassments have 
passed away and that their policy had placed the future 
prosperity of the country on a permanent footing this im 
pression is now gaining ground and unless counteracted will 
give us an uphill labour ... 

... It has been found expedient to abandon the Bank in 
our political pilgramage. The people are now familiarly ac 
quainted with the immense power of a national bank and ap 
prehend all kinds of terrible consequences from its exercise, 
without ever reflecting that in every human institution, pos 
sessing the ability to do much good, their must necessarily 
exist the power to do essential mischief, and that all legisla 
tion is more or less subject to the same charge. . . .

From Roswell L. Colt 245 

On the subject of aid from this quarter the fact is, I under 
stand, that the contributions fall on a very narrow circle of 
not wealthy people and that on the late occasion they have 
been completely exhausted and a little dispirited that their 
exertions have proved so little productive in proportion to 
their expectations. I should not think it at all probable that 
any thing further could be obtained from them. As to the 
Bank itself, I have always made it a point of duty never to 
permit its interference in any manner with our political con-\ 
cerns. It was a refusal to become partizans to the present set in J 
power which has made them its enemies, and it will persevere " 
in the same neutrality to the end altho all the temptations 
to depart from that course are obvious &amp; strong, &amp; however 
much the consequences may be deplored of the present mis 
rule. We shall not look with less anxiety however on your

You the Charter here at once. 

BIDDLE TO * 

Phil a . Jany 7. 1835 
Gentlemen, 

I had this morning the pleasure of receiving your let 
ter of the 5 th inst in which you apprize me that you had been 
informed that the Stockholders of the U.S. Bank would ac 
cept a charter from this State and you request to know from 
me on what terms this can be effected especially mention 
ing the number of years of the charter with which the Bank 
would be satisfied the amount of capital as well as the 
premium &amp; other encouragements that would be given to 
the State in consideration of it. 

Having long had reflected much on this subject, 2 I will 
answer promptly &amp; without reserve. 

1 This letter was evidently a draft of one sent to the committee on banks in 
Harrisburg. 

2 It was Matthew St. Clair Clarke who first suggested to Biddle the advisability 



247 



For a variety of reasons, which I forbear to state because 
your duties have made you familiar with them, I believe it to 
be of the greatest importance to our State to appropriate to 
its own benefit the Capital of the Bank of the U.S. which is 
about to be distributed &amp; can never be recalled if it once 
leaves the State. 

I believe that considering the general growth of the whole 
Union and the extraordinary resources of Penn a which 
require only capital to develope them the sum of ten mil 
lions which formed the capital of the first Bank in 1791 
and the sum of 35 millions which formed the capital of the 
present Bank in 1816 was not more than the equivalent of 
TOO millions at this time and that the present institution 
might with great safety &amp; with great advantage be gradually 
increased to fifty millions to an amount not disproportionate 

of securing a charter from the State of Pennsylvania. Clarke was a co-worker of 
Peter Force and aided the latter in collecting and publishing the former s great 
work American Archives, a Documentary History of the English Colonies of North 
America. On October 30, 1832, Clarke wrote to Biddle as follows: "I need only 
give the outline of what I consider a splendid operation. Only remember / have 
given it. Let our State of Pennsylvania charter the U.S. Bank, less the Gov* Stock 
and in place of Branches, out of the State create Agencies or whatever you 
please to call them. . . . Let the State lay out the Bonus in Internal Improvements 
and make yourself a name &amp; praise among the nations of the Earth. " 

This suggestion evidently impressed Biddle as the above letter and the fol 
lowing actions of the Bank disclose. Moreover, the economic and political aspect 
of the State favored the Bank men at this particular time. Pennsylvania was al 
ready engulfed in the vast internal improvement speculation which characterized . 
these years and was just beginning to feel the effects of her folly. With her com 
merce sinking beneath the pecuniary agitation of the thirties, her treasury bank 
rupt, and her citizens overburdened with taxes, the Pennsylvania Legislature was 
willing to listen to Nicholas Biddle. Furthermore, the Anti-Masonic Party had 
elected their man, Joseph Ritner, as governor upon an implied promise not to in 
crease the debt nor the taxes, and as the Whigs and Anti-Masons had been voting 
together on all measures since 1832 under the able leadership of Thaddeus Stevens, 
Biddle might well deem the time propitious. Cf. Harrisburgh Chronicle, May, 
1836; McCarthy, Charles, The Antimasonic Party, in American Historical Asso 
ciation, Annual Report, vol. I (Washington, 1902), pp. 461, 488. 



248 Correspondence of Nicholas Riddle 

when it is considered how large a sum could be used for the 
general purposes of trade, manufactures &amp; agriculture 
/ how much might be advanced to the State for the completion 
of its great Plans of improvement how large a portion 
might be given to private associations for rail roads &amp; canals 
&amp; other objects of general benefit &amp; how much might be ju 
diciously advanced to individuals in the interior for improve 
ments which tho private in their nature are public in their 
results. I believe that to give permanancy &amp; solidity to the 
fiscal arrangements of the State it would be greatly for its 
interest to extend the charter to thirty years. 

I have accordingly endeavored to estimate the value of such 
a charter &amp; I have made up my mind to this conclusion 
which I mention to you at once because I have not the 
least ambition to make any arrangement not mutually ad 
vantageous &amp; because after all the benefit of this measure to 
the Commonwealth in its schemes of improvement is far 
greater than the mere price which may be paid for the char 
ter. The question you will perceive is, what inducement * 
can be offered to the Stockholders in other parts of the U.S. 
or in Europe to leave his funds in Penn a . rather than take 
them home to be employed in other States and then what 
reason can be given for accepting a charter from Penn a rather 
from any other of the 24 States having an equal with Penn a 
to give the charter. As a Pennsylvanian devotedly attached 
to her interests &amp; her fame I would give more to Penn a . than 
to any other State for a Charter and my effort would be to 
induce all the other Stockholders to prefer that arrange- 

1 New York and later Maryland made generous offers to Biddle when the 
bill to re-charter the Bank was finally presented to the Pennsylvania Legislature. 
Both states were most desirous of securing the institution.

ment to either a division of the funds or the acceptance of a 
charter from any other State. To do which it would be neces 
sary to render the terms beneficial to the State yet not too 
burdensome to the Stockholder.* 

For a charter from Penn a . for the amount of Stock held 
by individuals with a power of gradual increase to fifty mil 
lions of dollars, and for thirty years, I would recommend to 
the Stockholders the following terms. 

To give to the State $2,000,000 either in cash on the day 
when the charter was accepted, or in instalments one fourth 
cash &amp; the rest in equal payments at six twelve &amp; 1 8 
months, the sum of 2,000,000. To lend to the State when 
ever wanted six millions of dollars taking their Stock, which 
need not be repaid before the expiration of the charter, at 
five per cent, which interest payable semi annually &amp; giving 
a premium of ten per cent or if more agreeable to take a 
four per cent stock at par. 

To subscribe the sum of one million to the stock of any 
rail roads or canal companies which the State might elect as 
worthy of particular patronage and 

To advance at all times to the State a temporary loan of 
Five hundred thousand at five per cent 

Allow me in conclusion to suggest one very important con 
sideration. It is this. The charter of the Bank expires on the 
4 th of March. The Stockholders are already summoned to 
meet on the iy th of February to make preparations for the 
dissolution of the Bank &amp; some final decision will probably 
be then made for either the division of the funds or an appli 
cation for a charter from some other authority. It would 
therefore be highly desirable that the final action of the legis 
lature should be known at that period, so that an immediate 



250 Correspondence of Nicholas Biddk 

acceptance of the charter may be made or ulterior meas 
ures be adopted. 

I need not say that in this frank exposition I speak only 
my own sentiments I believe such an arrangement would 
be beneficial to the State and as such it might be offered &amp; 
would be accepted. 

* As far as I understand the financial position of the State 
is that a large amount of funds is invested in improvements 
/which do not yet defray their own expenses, but will do so when 
j the whole scheme of improvements is finished. It is desirable 
therefore to make arrangements for the completion of the 
I improvements and until they become more productive to sup- 
l ply the deficiency of income over expenditure. Both these ob 
jects would I think be attained by the following arrangement.

My Dear Sir 

It appears to me that our political affairs are taking a 
very decided turn, &amp; that if nothing be done to check the cur 
rent, Mr V.B. will be elected President, by a vast majority. It 
is entirely obvious, I think, that the movement of the South 
ern Whigs * (as they call themselves) in Mr White s favor 
has disgusted, deeply, the whole body of our friends in the 
North. Such papers as the Richmond Whig &amp; Telegraph have 
endeavored to persuade the People that the question is nar 
rowed down to a choice between Judge White &amp; Mr. V. 
Buren, &amp; if this be the only issue presented, there is already 
abundant indication that the whole north, east, &amp; middle too,

as I believe, will go for V.B. I do not know whether any thing 
can be done to change the course of things; but I am fully 
persuaded, that if any thing can be done, it is be done in 
Penn a . Your people are awake to political subjects, in conse 
quence of the pendency of an election for Gov r . If those who 
are likely to unite in support of M r Ritner could unite also 
in making some demonstration, on National Subjects, &amp; do 
it immediately, it might possibly have some effect. Whether 
this be practicable is more than I know. 

I have thought it right, My Dear Sir, to express to you 
my opinion, thus freely, on the present State, &amp; apparent tend 
ency, of things. Our friends here receive letters, every day, 
&amp; from P a . as well as from other quarters, calling on them 
to do more, &amp; say more. But they hardly see what more they 
can do, or say. The sentiment of Massachusetts is known; &amp; 
it would seem to be for the consideration of others, whether 
it should be seconded. 

You will of course, burn this, 1 &amp; let no eye but your own 
see it. You can judge whether any thing can be usefully done. 
For my part, I confess, it looks to me as if the whole Whig 
Strength in the Country was either to be frittered away, or 
melt into the support of Mr V. Buren.

Dear Sir 

I have received your favor of the 8 th ins 1 , and shall 
reply to it without the least reserve. 

In closing the concerns of the Bank, my great anxiety is to 
take care of its faithful Officers, and any thing which I can 
do to serve them, I will do most promptly and willingly. In 
your own particular case, I am not the less desirous of serving 
you because you have been comparatively a short time with 
us, for you have connected your fortunes with the Institu 
tion, and that is itself a claim upon me. My impression then 
is, that the Branch in Buffalo will be soon closed, and that 
in the contingency of a renewed charter under a state, the 
agencies of the Bank would be confined to the most mercan 
tile points, as the general superintendence of the currency 
will no longer devolve on the Bank: so that the Bank would 
not require your services at Buffalo. I wish therefore that 
you may succeed in your application for the Cashiership of

My dear Sir, 

The Ohio Legislature is soon to convene. The Whigs 
there are now in a majority. I see in a Pittsburg paper a 
very important Suggestion, which has been repeated or made 
simultaneously in some others, that if the Whigs at Colum 
bus, at this approaching session, would nominate Mr W. and 
Gen 1 . Harrison as Vice P. it would have a very decisive effect. 
If you should be of this opinion, cannot you drop a line to 
some considerate &amp; influential persons, members of the 
legislature or others, at Columbus ? 

There is really strength enough in the Country, to elect Mr 
W., if it could be concentrated &amp; cordially united, in his support.

Phil a . Aug st . 6 th . 1835 
Dear Sir 

... In regard to the offer from the State Bank of the 
Presidency of the Branch at Fayetteville, I think you should 
not hesitate to accept it. My great anxiety now is, that the

!3fficers of the Bank should be able to separate from it with 
;he least possible inconvenience to themselves and I am 
inxious particularly that they should lose no opportunity 
&gt;f obtaining proper employment elsewhere. If therefore the 
situation offered be in other respects satisfactory, there is 
nothing in your relations with the Bank that should induce 
you to decline it. 

This brings me to another matter connected with it on 
which I proposed to write to you. We are now making 
arrangements with several of the new Banks to purchase 
the whole establishment of the Office near them banking 
house, debts &amp; all. This plan is very advantageous to the 
new Bank which thus succeeds to the standing, capital, de 
posits &amp; custom of the Office, &amp; to the Bank of the U.S. it 
possesses the attraction of enabling them to close the Office 
at once. As an example of such a settlement, I will mention 
what has just taken place at Lexington, Kentucky. The Pres 
ident &amp; Cashier of the Office have been appointed President 
&amp; Cashier of the Northern Bank of Kentucky and that 
Institution has agreed to take the Banking House at the valu 
ation hitherto put up upon it in our schedules &amp; also to 
take the whole of the current debt not including of course 
the domestic bills at its nominal amount, giving the notes 
of the Bank of Kentucky payable in I, 2, 3, &amp; 4 years with 
interest at five per cent. The suspended debt the Bank of 
Kentucky agrees to manage and collect without charge. 

Now, if you could make a similar arrangement with the 
Bank of the State or any other institution, it would be satis 
factory to us. 

Let me hear from you soon on this subject &amp; believe me 
meanwhile

BIDDLE TO HERMAN COPE 

Phil a . Aug st II. 1835 
My dear Sir 

. . . My theory in regard to the present condition of 
the country is in a few words this. 1 For the last few years 
the Executive power of the Gov*. has been weilded by a mere 
gang of banditte. I know these people perfectly keep the 
police on them constantly and in my deliberate judgment, 
there is not on the face of the earth a more profligate crew 
than those who now govern the President. The question is 
how to expel them. I believe that a very large majority not 
merely of the intelligence and the property, but of the num 
bers of our countrymen, are disposed to expel them. It re 
mains to see how that majority can be concentrated so as to 
be effectual. As yet the opinions of the opposition are un 
formed. No man as yet can combine them : they are not fixed 
on any one man. But they are fixed on several men who are 
acceptable to various sections. Then the obvious course is, to 
make these several men in the first instance embody under 
them the force of these various sections and when the 
common enemy approaches to rally under a leader of their 
own choice. It is manifestly advantageous to let M r Web 
ster lead the New England forces, M r White the Southwest, 
or South and wherever in any one State there is a strong 
opposition man to vote for him as such and settle the 
pretensions of the chiefs afterwards. I have said again and 
again to my friends, I have said it this very morning, "This 
disease is to be treated as a local disorder apply local 
remedies if Gen 1 . Harrison will run better than any body

else in Penns a ., by all means unite upon him." That as far as I 
understand the case, is the feeling very generally of the op 
position &amp; Gen 1 Harrison must not suppose that there is in 
this quarter any unwillingness to give him fair play. On the 
contrary, he is very much respected, and if our friends are 
satisfied that he can get more votes in Penns a than any other 
candidate of the opposition they will take him up cheerfully 
&amp; support him cordially. 

/ I have but one remark more to make. If Gen 1 . Harrison is 
/taken up as a candidate, it will be on account of the past, 
/ not the future. Let him then rely entirely on the past. Let 
I him say not one single word about his principles, or his creed 
V let him say nothing promise nothing. 1 Let no Com 
mittee, no convention no town meeting ever extract from 
him a single word, about what he thinks now, or what he will 
do hereafter. Let the use of pen and ink be wholly forbidden 
as if he were a mad poet in Bedlam. Gen 1 . Harrison can speak 
well &amp; write well but on this occasion he should neither 
speak nor write but be silent absolutely and inflexibly 
silent. . . .

Dear Sir 

I have just returned from Harrisburg every thing 
looks as favourable as could be expected, through the kind 
ness of the Speaker, Mr Middlesworth 2 I obtained last 
evening a copy of the committees of the House in confidence, 
not to show it in Harrisburg to injure him, before it was an 
nounced from the chair, I send you a proof slip Pen- 
nepacker the chairman on Banks is a very clever country 
member I should think not disposed to throw difficulties in 
the way. Mr Lawrence requested me to give you his best 
respects.

grant you a Charter if Congress declines acting in the mat

1 The movement for re-charter began in November of 1835. In the early part 
of the month Nicholas Biddle began to receive letters from friends both within 
the state and in New York advising him to petition the next session of the Penn 
sylvania Legislature, composed, as it was, of "flexible material." Since New York 
seemed specially anxious for a charter, as the above letter indicates, the President 
used it to good advantage on the home Assembly.

occur provided the State could secure your services and name 
to preside over the Bank but I doubted if you w d . assent 
that from all I can gather, you intended to wind up the 
present institution and then devote yourself to higher 
pursuits than the Story of Banking. It does me good to worry 
the dogs on this point a few evenings since dining at the 
Mayors (where were present the delegation to the Legislature 
&amp; "other leaders of the party") I took occasion to reply thus 
to the Enquiry and as it was a "winder up" it seem d to 
me the "Chateau" tasted better to me afterwards. 

WILLIAM B. REED * TO BIDDLE 

Harrisburg. Dec r . 12. 1835. 
Dear Sir, 

I have intended from day to day to write to you, but 
the very caution and reserve which we are obliged to main 
tain in relation to the Bank measure operate to prevent any 
development of feeling and opinion, worth communicating. 
I now esteem it especially fortunate that a friend of the Bank 
was placed at the head of the Improvement Committee. 
That is the only engine on which we can rely and if it fails we 
have no chance. Every one at all acquainted with matters 
and things here, particularly of late years since the Canal 
policy has been pursued, knows that the temptation of a turn 
pike, or a few miles of canal and rail road as a beginning on a 
favorite route is nearly irresistible, and I am strongly inclined 
to think that now a few of the many members who have toiled 
year after year for branches, and who look to this session as

From William B. Reed 259 

their last chance could vote against legislation that would 
give them their extensions and entrench upon nothing but 
party prejudices and antipathies. If this feeling cannot be 
operated on, none other can. An this applies to those who are 
here not as friends of the state administration and who per 
haps not being unwilling to see it embarassed could not be 
operated upon by the measure, if its effect was to be merely 
a general relief from taxation. A reference to the map and 
the Senatorial Districts will illustrate this. The Southern line 
of Rail Road to connect through York and Gettysburg with 
the Baltimore and Ohio Rail Road and thence down the 
Younghegany to Pittsburg would of itself affect the votes of 
at least three if not four Senators. So with the Erie extension 
the North Branch, the West Branch survey (all that that Dis 
trict wants). With respect to all these new lines it must be 
borne in mind that the commencement of the work is all that 
will be wanted. To be able to go home and boast of having 
made a beginning is all that is needed. . . . There is another in 
terest too which must not be overlooked in the Turnpikes 
relief to them no matter how small a pittance, will be most 
gratefully received. By the bye, I understand the Canal 
Commissioners, in their Report take up the tune of the 
Message and assuming the abundance of funds recommend 
all the extensions as a matter of course. 

With all these views you will easily understand why I con 
sider the Improvement Committee, aided as it may be by 
the Committee of Ways and Means, a powerful engine to ef 
fect our purpose. I shall be glad to have your views in strict 
confidence as to the course which true policy dictates as re 
spects new banks and increased capital. Petitions are rush 
ing in upon us from all quarters. The Chairman of the Com-

mittee on Banks, M r Pennypacker, is one of the soundest 
men we have. His idea is to delay action even in Committee 
upon all these new banks, and having ascertained the precise 
amount of proposed capital to use it as an argument for the 
U.S. Bank. This may do very well so far as our city is con 
cerned but I am inclined to doubt the policy in its general 
application. For example a very strong and respectable ap 
plication has been made for a new bank at Pittsburg where 
it seems to be conceded since the closing of the branch that 
more banking capital is needed. From what I learn from 
third persons I find that all the Pittsburg members and their 
friends in the lobby attribute the dilatory action of the Com 
mittee who have refused thus far to report a bill, to a secret 
design on the part of the friends of the U.S.B. to promote 
its views. They are consequently utterly opposed to the char 
ter. All this I hear indirectly but still I can depend on it. 
Would it not be better in such a case only, for the friends of 
the U.S.B. to gain the Pittsburg influence by aiding their 
project? 

I shall be very glad to have your views on this subject par 
ticularly as well as on all others connected with the great 
object we have in view. Whatever you may write I shall 
consider strictly confidential and for my own guidance. It is 
however essential that I should be fully apprised of all your 
views. . . . 

You are at liberty to show this letter to M r Sergeant &amp; to 
any of our common friends. 1 

1 Biddle had already presented some of the members of the committee with 
an account of a proposed charter according to which the new corporation, with a 
capital of fifty millions, chartered for thirty years, would give two millions in cash 
to the state on the day it was incorporated, and furthermore would make liberal 
concessions to various internal improvement proposals. This outline was "sus-

BIDDLE TO WILLIAM B. REED 

Phil 3 . Jan* 15 th . 1836 
Dear sir 

I have just seen a letter from Harrisburg stating that 
in a bill for chartering the Bank of the U.S. which is under 
stood to be now before a Committee of which you are Chair 
man, it is contemplated to introduce a provision 1 that if the 
Bank "interferes with politics, its charter may be repealed" 
and another "prohibiting the Bank from publishing docu 
ments." I lose no time in stating to you, that if such provi 
sions, or any thing in the remotest degree resembling them 
shall be put into the charter, it will be instantly rejected by 
the Stockholders. They have not asked for this charter and 
certainly could not accept it on terms which might be con 
strued into a reproach on their past administration of its 
affairs 

BIDDLE TO JOSEPH MC!LVAINE 

Phil a . Jan* 15. 1836 
Dear Sir 

I refer you to M r Wallace for the views entertained of 

ceptible of further compression," wrote Biddle to Mcllvaine, Biddle s charge at 
Harrisburg, but the latter was urged to call the attention of the friends of the meas 
ure to the sound reasons why the Bank ought to be re-chartered by Pennsylvania. 
These were: (i) that Pennsylvania would thus become wealthy and surpass New 
York; (2) no fear of foreign capital, since Europeans had already aided Pennsyl 
vania in internal improvements; (3) Philadelphia had always been the seat of the 
Bank and would become the center of finances if she re-chartered the institution ; 
(4) that New York s attacks were only designed to break down the Bank in Penn 
sylvania in order to obtain one in New York; (5) a dissolution would mean the loss 
of thirty-five million, since foreign stockholders would not support a bank in which 
they had no confidence. Moreover, the bill was first discussed only by friends of the 
Bank in the committee without the others being fully informed on the topic. 
1 These provisions were suggested by Governor Ritner and Thaddeus Stevens. 



262 Correspondence of Nicholas Bid die 

the changes in the bill as stated in your letter of the 13 th ins*. 
These are entirely unexpected and I consider them fatal 
to the whole plan. If the Congress of the U.S. passed the 
bill in 1832 by large majorities in both houses without an 
nexing such conditions, there is no reason why the legislature 
of Penns a . should propose them and still less reason for 
our submitting to them. As restrictions, they are unavailing 
as indications of opinion, they are offensive; and a single 
word on that subject causes the immediate rejection of the 
Act by the Stockholders. I have so written to M r Reed. Un 
less therefore these ideas be totally abandoned, I wish the 
question of the Bank withdrawn, as it seems useless to pro 
long a negociation which must be abortive. 

JOHN B. WALLACE TO BIDDLE 

Harrisburg January 18 1836 
Dear Sir 

Upon conferring with M r Stevens to-day he agreed 
without difficulty to waive the section respecting political in 
terferences etc. The Internal Improvement committee are 
now sitting upon the bill it will go through that committee 
to-night &amp; be reported to the House tomorrow as little de 
lay as possible will take place in urging it through the house. 
It may be detained longer in the Senate, but its friends will 
push it as fast as possible. It is expedient to do so as it is 
obvious an organized opposition originating at Washington, 
is getting up and as little time as possible must be allowed 
for it to operate upon the Senate So soon as the bill is 
printed, a copy will be sent you. . . .

Dear Sir 

As you are well informed by others of the state of things 
here, I do not trouble you with a recital of what you know. I 
may however add my decided opinion that the bill * is safe 
unless something entirely unexpected occur Washington 
influence, county meetings etc will not prevent it ... If the 
government of the U.S. had had as able a charge at Paris as 
you have in M c llvaine here, our relations with France 2 would 
have been in a very different situation from what they are. 

BIDDLE TO JOSEPH MC!LVAINE 

Phil a . Jany 31. 1836 
Dear Sir, 

Since writing to you this afternoon, I have heard some 
matters about the Bill which have changed my views of its 
actual position and produced a corresponding alteration 

1 The bill was introduced on this date. The title of the act of incorporation 
was unique. It was styled "An Act to Repeal the State Tax on Real &amp; Personal 
Property and to continue &amp; extend the improvements of the State by Railroads 
&amp; Canals, and to charter a State Bank to be called the United States Bank." In 
other words, the re-charter articles, drawn up with consummate skill by those per 
fectly conversant with the subject, appeared as clauses in a general appropriation 
measure. But this did not deceive the citizens of the state nor the nation at large. 
On January 5, the Richmond Enquirer had called the attention of the people of 
Pennsylvania to the need of stability in the legislature on account of the devious 
maneuvers of the old Bank. The Bank papers might remain silent on the topic, but 
the presence of lobbyists at Harrisburg and the fact that the stock had risen from 
no to ii 8 in a few days were signs that could not be mistaken. Public meetings 
had been held for the purpose of proclaiming that the people had "no principles 
to barter for gold"; and everything had been done to arouse the people to a sense 
of their duties. Cf. American Sentinel, January 21, 25, 1836; Pennsylvanian, Janu 
ary 9. J 5i 18, 22, 1836.

Dear Sir 

Yesterday and to day has been spent in Skirmishing 
the troops being raw thay could not be brought to close 
action a counsel of war has been held and it has been 
resolved to force the matter to-morrow. Burden 3 is to lead 
on and I assure you he is in a happy state of mind to per 
form that service. M r Penrose is now all confidence and in 
conjunction with D r Burden &amp; M r Stevens is now engaged in 
arraigning every thing for to morrow. A test vote will be 
brought to beare upon the matter to-morrow and I think 
will evidence we are Strong, very strong, in the Senate 
success I consider certain. 

1 This letter refers to the chief difficulty encountered by the friends of the 
bill in the committee stage in the Senate. Senator Dickey stated his determination 
to have a branch in Beaver County. This the noble Senator declared was his 
sine qua non, as it was the only possible excuse he could offer his constituents for his 
vote. Mcllvaine acknowledged the justice of the Senator s contention, expecially as 
the latter threatened to vote against the bill and carry two votes with him. Biddle, 
in reply to a request for advice from his charge, stated that he was not opposed to a 
branch at Beaver, but to the naming of a branch anywhere which might lead to 
the naming of others. Still, if the Senator insisted upon it, Biddle was willing to 
agree and wrote the above letter to Mcllvaine. For a careful discussion of this sub 
ject, cf. Report of the Select Committee Relative to the United States Bank together with 
the Testimony taken in Relation thereto (Paterson, 1837), p. 5. 

2 A Whig member later voted against the passage of the bill. A defense of his 
position is given in the Pennsylvanian, February 26, 1836.

266 Correspondence of Nicholas Biddle 

A strange scene has been played off in Senate this day. 
After the usual morning business Mr Fullerton of Franklin 
Co. rose in his place and said, that the Reporter &amp; Journal of 
yesterday contained a direct charge of an offer made to bribe 
an honourable senator, &amp; that he was unwilling to proceed 
untill an investigation was entered into; &amp; moved that the 
Sergant of Arms be directed to bring forthwith to the bar of 
the Senate Samuel D. Patterson &amp; O. Barrett the editors of 
said paper this resolution was adopted with very little 
debate, and in about half an hour these two gentlemen were 
at the Bar. Patterson had not written the article or Knew 
any thing about it, but the other avowed having written 
it &amp; stated that Jacob Krebs, the Senator from Schuylkill 
County was his informant. That he heard from another 
person that such an offer had been made to Krebs about 
ten days ago. That he called on him, asked him if the report 
was true &amp; was informed by him that it was, but that he would 
not tell the name of the individual who made the offer of the 
bribe. The evidence of Barrett was not concluded untill 
dinner time when the Senate adjourned untill half past 3 
o clock. Mr Krebs was then called upon &amp; he read from his 
place a statement of the offer. I did hope to have been able 
to have got a copy of this, but the committee are not willing 
to let it go out. The substance of it is that James L. Dunn of 
Reading came to him in the Senate Chamber on the 28 th of 
last month and stated that if this Bank Bill should pass that 
his (Dunns) coal lands in Schuylkill County would very 
much advance in price, and wished Krebs to vote for the Bill. 
That if he would, he (Dunn) would give Krebs one half of the 
amount of the rise which he estimated at 4,000 dollars but 
that should the lands raise in value ten thousand dollars 



From Samuel R. Wood 267 

which they might, that he would in that case give him five 
thousand dollars. Krebs gave him no answer on that evening. 
Dunn called next morning and pressed it on him but he de 
clined and afterwards avoided Dunn. 

That on the 3&lt;D th of January or first of March Henry W. 
Conrad a member of the House of Representatives from 
Schuylkill County told Krebs that he would insure him 
twenty thousand dollars if he would vote for the Bank Bill, 
and that if he agreed to it Bird Patterson would make the ar 
rangement and that he should have the money in two weeks 
after the Bill passed after the Senator had read his state 
ment a motion was made to appoint a committee with power 
to send for persons &amp; papers which was agreed to &amp; Baker, 
Toland, Leet, Strohm &amp; Langston named as the Committee 
when the Senate adjourned. 

How Dunn will get out of it is doubtful but all believe that 
Conrad was only in jest and that the old man was weak 
enough to take it for earnest for there was two or three per 
sons present when Conrad made the offer. Conrad has been 
one of the most violent and determined opposers of the Bill 
in the House. The violent opposers here have endeavoured to 
produce an excitement out of this matter &amp; are woefully dis 
appointed. They have evidently weakened themselves by it 
and look discouraged &amp; ashamed. The friends of it bore them 
much and are in high spirits as to the result. They will take 
up the Bill to-morrow and I hope nothing will interrupt its 
passage. 1 

1 The "Krebs affair," mentioned in the above letter became the main issue in 
the latter part of the passage of the Bank Bill. Committees were appointed in 
both the Senate and the House. The Senate Report disclosed the fact that Patter 
son had not approached Krebs directly, but indirectly through Conrad; that the 
former had authorized Conrad to request Krebs to offer an amendment to the bill

J. R. INGERSOLL TO BIDDLE 

House of representatives 

Washington March 17 th 1836 
My Dear Sir 

M r Evans of Maine has exhibited to me a letter from 
certain Gentlemen to the East who are anxious to know the 
views of your Bank with regard to the establishment of 
branches or agencies, in other states. They have in view a 
branch or agency in Bangor: and desire to know whether they 

to get an appropriation to the Danville &amp; Pottsville Railroad; but Patterson denied 
that Krebs had been told "he might retire to private life independent if he voted 
for the measure." Therefore the committee reported that they were perfectly 
convinced that neither the Bank of the United States nor any agent of it were 
either implicated in the charge of bribery or had improperly interfered to promote 
its passage. The House Report was along the same lines and reached the same 
conclusion. Cf. American Sentinel, February 15, 1836; National Gazette, February 
18, 1836; Pennsyka-nian, February 18, 1836; New York Journal of Commerce, Feb 
ruary 16, 1836; Niles, April 9, 1836. 

Throughout the whole episode the correspondence of the agents of the bank to 
Biddle had taken about the same stand as that of the House Committee. Mcllvaine, 
writing on February 5, stigmatized the affair of old Krebs as a "humbug"; Todd 
described the case as "all smoke "; while Wallace wrote he was unable to determine 
whether Krebs was "so utterly stupid as not to understand the meaning &amp; nature 
of a bribe or so wicked as to pervert perfectly innocent conversations to political 
profit." 

The bill re-chartering the old Bank was signed February 18. From all sides 
Nicholas Biddle received the congratulations and plaudits of his friends. The stock 
of the Bank rose from 125 to 129 in less than a week, and property in Erie, Penn 
sylvania, doubled in value. (Cf. Russell to Buchler, February 28, 1836, in Wolf 
MSS. in Pennsylvania Historical Society Library.) In the United States Senate 
Ewing of Ohio triumphantly proclaimed the re-charter, while Calhoun renewed 
his attacks on the Administration. But the opponents of the old United States 
Bank did not falter in their opposition. The Ohio Legislature passed a bill pro 
hibiting the establishment of agencies or branches in that state, much to the sur 
prise and alarm of Biddle and his friends (cf. Pennsylvania, March 25, 1836). 
Rumors were likewise circulated regarding the supposed antagonism of Virginia 
and New York (ibid., February 24, 1836). Even President Jackson contemplated 
action against the bill when draftirfg the Specie Circular. This is disclosed in the 
Jackson MSS. in a memorandum containing an addition to the Treasury Circular. 
This is endorsed by Jackson "to be considered as to the present or future time."

could arrange the appointment of individuals by whom it 
would be conducted subject of course to the parental direc 
tion of the Bank. They wish to commence with a capital of 
$500,000 with the right to increase it from time to time as the 
business may warrant. . . . 

While I have been writing at my desk a neighbour of mine 
has asked me whether it was the design of the Bank to estab 
lish an agency at Erie. He resides at Buffalo and thinks that 
the business which has heretofore been conducted at that 
place may be without difficulty transferred to Erie.

Sir, 

As the enclosed memorandum embraces the outlines 
of the Loan for Texas on which I conversed with you this 
morning, I take the liberty of handing it to you. 
^ I should esteem it as a favor, if I could be informed within 
a short time, whether you think any thing could be effected 
in this matter. 

I consider the cause of Texas is the cause of freemen, and of 
mankind, but more emphatically of the people of the United 
States than any other. I flatter myself that you view it in the 
same light, and that the security we offer is good, and there 
fore have no doubt you will give to it the attention which its 
importance merits. 

The leading men of all parties in Washington are favor 
ably disposed towards Texas. A reference to them will, I 
think, satisfy all persons as to this fact.

It is proposed to negociate a Loan for the Government of 
Texas, on the following basis. 

The Commissioners of Texas shall assign to the Bank of the 
United States at Philadelphia, the Bonds of the Government 
of Texas, which they hold, for the sum of 500,000 payable 
in not less than 5 years, and redeemable thereafter at the pleas 
ure of the State at the rate of 20% per annum, and if not so 
redeemed at the end of ten years, to be wholly redeemable at 
6 months notice thereafter, and bearing an interest of 8% 
per annum to be held in Trust by said Bank, for the benefit 
of the holders of a scrip to be issued by the Commissioners, 
based on said Bonds. 

Books of Subscription shall be opened in the cities of Bos 
ton, New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore, for a scrip to be 
issued by the Commissioners in shares of $100, which said 
scrip shall entitle the holder to an interest in said Bonds 
equal to the amount of Scrip thus held by him, and said Scrip 
shall be payable as follows; 

Of all purchases of land at the land offices in Texas, 20% 
of the sums due, may be paid and shall be receivable in said 
scrip. 

Of all customs due at the Custom Houses of Texas 20% 
of the sums due, may be paid, and shall be receivable in said 
Scrip. 

The holder shall be entitled to an interest of 8% per 
annum, payable at the Bank of the United States in Phila 
delphia, on all portions of said Scrip unpaid, and the Gov 
ernment of Texas shall have the privilege of paying the whole 
amount of said scrip, and redeeming their said Bonds, by 



Edward R. Biddle 271 

paying 20% of the principal annually, after the expiration 
uf 5 years, or the whole payable at 6 months notice after the 
expiration of 10 years. 

The payments of the Subscribers to said Scrip shall be made, 
25% at the time of subscription, and the remainder in 3 equal 
payments at 60, 90 &amp; 120 days there after, to be secured at 
the time of subscription, by the notes of the subscribers, en 
dorsed to the satisfaction of the Directors of the Bank of the 
United States, or persons appointed by them, &amp; payable at 
such place as said Directors shall designate, provided the 
same be in the cities when said stock is subscribed. 

The Bank of the United States shall discount the notes 
thus paid in, and pay over the whole amount of the proceeds 
thereof, and the amount of the first instalment thus paid 
in, to the Commissioners of Texas, and hold said Bonds as 
an additional guarantee for the payment of said notes.

Dear Sir 

I wrote a letter to you some time ago on behalf of our 
Iron company: subsequent events have furnished a sufficient 
reply. 

I enter upon my 79 th Year, next October. By the time M r 
Van Beuren s first period has expired, I shall be superannu 
ated. I can have therefore no selfish motive in my present 
proposal. The tide is turning strongly agst the measures of 
the last and present Administration. The poor now groan 
under the financial follies of Gen. Jackson as well as the 
rich. To be sure, over trading and gambling speculation will 
account for three fourths of the present distress, but no one 
can be blind to the effects produced by the desperate igno 
rance of the last President. 

At this moment your judicious conduct has placed you 
prominent as a wise and temperate man, and a public bene 
factor. You can go on pursuing cautiously the same course of 
conduct, and earning on all hands golden opinions. 

Why not look to the Presidency? 

Can your name be brought forward at a time more ad 
vantageous than the present? You are rising, your oppo 
nents are falling: strike the ball on the rebound, and I think 
this is the moment. 

Is there any chance of success for such imbecilles as Ben ton, 
Harrison, or even White? Men without preliminary study, 
without knowledge patiently and laboriously acquired, with

of popular clamour. Think of this : and if needful command 
my services, such as they may be. I am, and so may you be, 
in the odour of political sanctity in this State : and this State is 
the South; for we have earned the character of honesty &amp; 
energy. We have here two men of plausible &amp; fair pretensions : 
of those pretensions I say nothing at present; the subject may 
be discussed, if needful, by and by.

My dear Sir 

I read with great interest M r Coxe s letter, which I 
now return. It confirms the melancholy state of things you 
explained to me as existing in the West, and for which I 
see no present remedy. The suspension of the distribution 2 
presents the most substantial relief: but although we may 
have some legal excuse to suspend that of October, the in 
stalment due the states in July will I understand be paid. 

Can you not in your financial knowledge and experience 
devise some plan by which a wholesome control may be ex 
ercised over bank issues and exchanges be brought back to 
which they were before the destruction of the Bank Some 
measure apart from a national bank even although it might 
be connected with the operations of a great state institu-

tion. I see obstacles to the charter of a national bank that 
are insuperable in the present state of things, and would 
gladly avail myself of your skill to support some measure 
which might save us the repetition of the evils we are now 
suffering. 

BIDDLE TO JOEL R. POINSETT

My dear Sir 

I have always thought that the best thing which M r 
Van Buren could do in reference to himself personally, as well 
as to his political party, would be to make peace with the 
Bank and the present state of things furnishes an admi 
rable opportunity of accomplishing that object. Why indeed 
should he not? To all the members of the Cabinet except 
one, 1 I personally have always stood in a friendly relation, 
and in regard to the President himself there is no sort of 
personal difference. The way therefore would be open for 
a general amnesty which for the sake of the country I 
am willing to consent to and I do believe that just now 
the effect would be electric &amp; decisive. 

BIDDLE TO JOEL R. POINSETT

Dear Sir 

I received last evening your favor of the 6 th inst. The 
course of the Gov*. being I presume settled as according to 
the newspapers, it now remains only to do what we can to 
diminish the sufferings of the country, and for this I shall 
certainly work as hard as if I had caused them.

To Joel R. Poinsett 275 

You ask whether some plan could not be devised by which 
the issues of the banks &amp; the exchanges could be regulated 
as formerly, by a connection with some large state Bank. I 
have no doubt of it. I have no doubt that at this moment the 
simplest &amp; easiest form of relief would be to make the pres 
ent Bank of the U.S. the depositors of the public revenue. 
It would be only necessary 

I st . To let the Treasury &amp; the Bank agree that the Bank 
should take charge of the public revenue collect and dis 
tribute it relieve the Treasury from all trouble about it. 

2 d . To let the Treasury without disturbing or formally 
repealing the specie circular 1 direct the receivers to take 
the notes of the Bank of the U.S. 

3 d . The Bank would then appoint its own agents or 
affiliate with it other State Banks being of course respon 
sible for them all &amp; the whole system of the public revenue 
as it was in 1830 which, now we may speak of it histori 
cally, was an admirable one would be all restored. 

The Western State Banks have mostly officers of the late 
Bank the whole country asks nothing better than its notes 
which are now every where at a premium, and both at homei 
&amp; abroad the Bank has a reputation which it can put at the \ 
service of the Government. 

I sincerely believe that in a week s time such an arrange 
ment would restore confidence &amp; credit. 

The very prospect of it would stop many of the evils which 
are impending. 

And why should it not be? If the thing promises well, why 
should we be deterred from attempting it? Why should M r

&amp; yourself not agree to any project which promises relief, 
even tho the name of the Bank be connected with it. I am 
sure you are all above the indulgence of any feeling on that 
score and for myself, I am perfectly willing to forget all 
the quarrels with the last administration, which neither party 
would desire to have perpetuated. 

/ Politically the effect would undoubtedly be good. Pennsyl- 
/ vania would be pleased, and the whole country would regard 
V it as a proof of returning peace. 

It would require a little time to mount again the machinery, 
but it could be done without much delay, &amp; in the mean time 
the very knowledge that it was intended, would be infinitely 
soothing in the present initated condition of things. 

Now, my dear sir, there is a project for you. If you can bring 
it to bear, you will have done great good to the country a 
work in which you will always find a ready cooperation. 

BIDDLE TO GENERAL ROBERT PATTERSON * 

Phil a May 8. 1837 
Dear Sir 

In a letter which I have written by this mail to M r 

Poinsett, I have suggested a measure which I think would be 

a brilliant stroke of policy, &amp; give immediate confidence to 

/the country. It is simply this, that the Gov . should make the 

/ Bank of the U.S. the depository of the public funds, and with- 

lout repealing the specie circular, authorize the reciept of the 

paper of the Bank for dues to the Government. You will 

see at a glance the advantages of such a movement. . . .

vote of Pennsylvania for Martin Van Buren. One of the largest mill-owners in the 
United States.

What prevents this ? Some old feeling of party ? Certainly 
not. We have fought out the battle with the last adminis 
tration with what success it is not for me to say but at\ 
least we fought it fairly, and we do not wish to fight it over I 
with this administration. 

I submit all these matters to you, and if, as I trust, you will 
see them in the same light, I would ask your immediate con 
currence in carrying it into effect. I care not how it begins, or 
who proposes it, but if it be necessary for me to commence, 
I am agreed. I am too proud to think my step humiliating 
which may benefit this poor bleeding country of ours.

it may carry you through many Presidential Olympiads.

278 Correspondence of Nicholas Biddle 

I thank you for your approbation of my public conduct, 
which, whatever may be the result, has been dictated by a 
very honest desire to protect the great interests of the country. 

In relation to the friendly suggestion which forms the pur 
pose of your letter, I have received from various quarters 
intimations of a disposition to connect my name with the 
next election of President. These I have never considered 
seriously, nor indeed noticed at all : but to you I will speak 
for the first time &amp; without reserve. 

I believe that the prosperity &amp; the character of the country 
require that those who now govern it should be removed and 
that all true men should unite to expel them each taking 
the position, either of chief or subaltern, which the general 
voice assigns to him. I am quite sure that I have not the 
least affectation in saying, that to myself personally, the office 
has not the slightest attraction. Its dignity has been degraded 
by the elevation to it of unworthy men and as to mere 
power, I have been for years in the daily exercise of more 
personal authority than any President habitually enjoys. But 
I stand ready for the country s service. If therefore you think 
that my name can be productive of good, I am content to 
place it as I now do, at your disposal under a conviction 
of the friendly &amp; discreet manner in which alone it will be 
employed.

My friend the Governor of this State, a man of no 
brilliant talents, of no acquirement, but a great worldly 
tact and resource, and extremely popular, will not be here for 



From Thomas Cooper 279 

some days. He is at Charleston where our State Bank have 
acceded to our request to the loan I wrote to you about. I 
shall sound him when he returns, cautiously but I think suc 
cessfully: till then I make no move. Hitherto, he and I have 
acted with no variance of opinion. 

I could write to Noah : but Altho I have no doubt about 
his inclinations, I know not enough how his interest points. 
The Iron is quite hot enough in that furnace, to strike; but 
you have it under your own controul. In that field of battle 
you must trace the line of March. Movements of great dan 
ger &amp; irritation seem to me probable in that quarter, that 
may furnish a favourable occasion for your prudent inter 
ference. 

We have two aspirants here: both able, &amp; both honest men: 
both regarded throughout the State, rather as looking stead 
ily at the central Government, than as guided by a purely 
South Carolinian spirit. They are therefore not popular. 
Calhoun is rather borne with, than supported. He has talent, 
but without tact or Judgement. Remember, I am giving you, 
what leading and thinking men say. 

Preston has more talent, more tact, more judgement, &amp; is 
as honest as Calhoun. They are on the field of political com 
petition. Preston is more approved. But he is too much of a 
diplomat: too much non committal; too Van Beurenish, but 
much superior to V. Beuren. People distrust him from his 
manner, more than they ought. But he is not popular. He 
has not the leading mark of a great man, he cannot attach 
to himself a corps of personal thorough-going friends. Gen 1 
Hamilton of our State could do that. So does our present 
Governor Butler. Preston moreover is a Virginian. He would 
make a good minister at a foreign Court.

Both these Gentlemen are like me, Nullifiers. They could 
not be sustained out of the State, even if they could command 
South Carolina. It is an unfashionable Garb. It sticks like the 
shirt of Nesus. I am content however to wear it as my wind 
ing sheet. 

You will have no opponents of equal talent, energy, &amp; hon 
esty with these two Gentlemen, whom I regard as hors de 
combat. 

Strange times are approaching. Arrangements ought to be 
made to introduce the Subject; when, where, and how? For 
by the time Congress meets, the pressure will be at its acme, 
and the lower classes will feel it severely. 

I trouble you with these preliminary hints, for the plan of 
the Campain must be thought about. 

Webster will be set up as your Opponent: the South will 
not go for him; &amp; they will go for you in preference. Webster 
has a character for talent, but he is not qualified for a leader. 
He has no personal friends. He is a good partizan parliamen 
tary debater, but he cannot trace out the plan of a political 
Campain, nor is he fit to be at the head of it. I see no fearful 
competitor at present, or in prospect. . . . Adieu.

Dear Sir 

... All to whom I have guardedly spoken, agree with 
me in opinion, decidedly. My friend the Governor has set 
tled with to set up a new paper here; for we cannot make use 
of the Telescope, or the other paper of our town; and the 
strange infatuation of M r Calhoun as to the presidency must 
be counteracted. I believe M Duffie would go with us stren-

uously, if it were not for personal regard to M r Calhoun. You 
have gained over Calcock of Charleston. 

Among our people in Congress, White of Tennessee has 
friends ; but White &amp; Clay have been started on the course, 
and are broken down. Neither can succeed if entered again. 

M r Van Beuren, whom I like personally (for he is a Gentle 
man) will I think carry the next Congress with him. I have 
taken full and effectual care both to him &amp; M r Poinsett, to 
render mistake impossible as to my opinions. I have stated 
expressly and decidedly that I am a friend to State inter 
position agst an unconstitutional Law, by Nullification. That 
I disapprove of Gen 1 . Jackson s exprints[?] on the finances of 
the Country, and that I consider the treasury circular as tend 
ing in its results to degrade the national credit and character. 
I have found this distinct explanation on my part, necessary. 

// the Congress called in September should resolve on a na 
tional Bank, (which I doubt, for a majority as yet are Van 
Beurenists) it will be, either the readoption of yours, or a new 
establishment at New York, over which you will probably be 
invited to preside. But the measure of misfortune is not yet 
full enough, to drive the friends of General Jackson from their 
insane attempts. I think M r Van Beuren has committed him 
self to the old man too far; and the call of Congress may be in 
tended to introduce a little welcome force before he yields. . . .

Webster is a dexterous debater, but he has no judgement, 
no energy, or boldness of character. The man has no per

Here, we should decidedly prefer Van Beuren to Webster. 
But the battle is coming on (may be, literally) between 
the ultra radicalists and the Constitutionalists: if Mr Van

My dear Sir 

You ask my views about the mode in which the Bank 
of the U.S. could assist in restoring the currency. I will tell 
you in a few words. 

The present design of those who govern the Government 
at Washington is, I understand, to draw all the funds out of 
the Banks then cut all connection with them and es 
tablish subtreasuries where each receiver is to sit upon his 
small heap of gold &amp; silver. This is the newest, &amp; therefore 
the favorite, foolery. Congress, I think will not agree to this, 
or to any other experiment and will incline to either a real 
downright Bank of the U.S. chartered by the Genl Gov 1 or to 
the present Pennsylv 3 . Bank. . . . 

If the Treasury &amp; the Bank could come to an understand 
ing as to the terms on which the Bank would do this business 
everything would soon come right. 



From B. W. Leigh 283 

But I can do nothing at present which would not work

the country. I will spare no effort for that purpose. No mis- 1

B. W. LEIGH TO BIDDLE 

Richmond, Aug. 21. 1837. 
My dear sir 

I am informed, that the hon e William Smith, formerly 
of South Carolina, now of Alabama, has recently, in a public 
speech to the people of Huntsville, and on other occasions, 
stated that the late chief justice Marshall l owned seven 
teen shares of stock of the Bank of the U.States, at the time 
he decided, in the case of M c Cullock against the State of 
Maryland, that the charter of the Bak was constitutional. 
The argument of that cause was opened on the 22nd Febru 
ary 1819, and the chief justice delivered the opinion of the 
court on the 7 th March; 4 Wheat. 316, 322, 40x3. 

1 For a discussion of the Marshall affair, cf . Niles, September 23, 1837, pp. 50-51 ; 
ibid., December 2, 1837, p. 218; ibid., June 2, 1838, pp. 210-211. 



284 Correspondence of Nicholas Bid die 

The most innocent purpose for which such a statement 
could have been made, was to detract from the weight of the 
chief justice s authority on the point of constitutional law; 
which Mr Smith, it seems, was willing to accomplish, by im 
puting to him a personal interest in the controversy. I say 
nothing about the motive or the candor of such an imputa 
tion, or of the evidence it affords of Mr Smith s scale of moral 
sentiment and honor. 

I find upon examination of the Dividend Books of the office 
of the Bank at this place, that Mr Marshall received the 
dividend of July 1817 on 12 shares; and the dividends on 
17 shares, of January 1818, July 1818, and January 1819; and 
that his receipt for this last dividend is dated Jan y 23, 1819, 
just before he left home to attend the supreme court, the 
term of which then commenced on the I st February. From 
thenceforth he never received any dividend (because, I infer, 
he never owned any stock) in his own right tho there was 
some stock standing in his name and mine as joint exors of 
G. K. Taylor of Petersburg, which I bought and always drew 
the dividends of and, at a later period, some stock standing 
in his name as trustee for the widow and children of his 
brother William Marshall. It follows, that he must have 
sold his own 17 shares of stock, after the dividend of January 
1819 was declared; but we cannot ascertain here the precise 
date when he parted with it. I have not the least doubt, that 
he sold this stock before he left home in January or Feb 
ruary 1819. 

Now I must beg the favor of you to ascertain the date of 
the transfer of that stock, on the the transfer book* at Phila 
delphia, the person to whom he transferred it, and (as he 
must have transferred by attorney) the date of the letter of 



To B. IT. Leigh 285 

attorney; and to give me the precise dates, and a copy of the 
letter of attorney and of the authentication subjoined to it. 
Have the goodness also, to have the facts stated in the form 
of a certificate signed by the proper officer of the Bank. 

You may perhaps think I am taking over unnecessary 
trouble about this affair but I do so at the request of a 
friend at Huntsville and besides, I am persuaded, that if 
a grave charge of forgery, or perjury, or sheep stealing, were 
made against the most honest and honorable man in the 
country, it would do him some harm; so general is the be 
lief of the universal corruption of the nation. I am, sir, with 
hearty respect &amp; esteem

My Dear Sir, 

I had last evening the pleasure of receiving your let 
ter of the 21 st inst. and immediately hasten to perform the 
sacred duty of defending the character of an honest man from 
the reptiles who avenge themselves for his superiority while 
living, by crawling over his dead body. I think we shall be 
perfectly successful in presenting the following results. 

The argument in the case of M c Cullock &amp; the State of 
Maryland began, according to your statement on the 22 d of 
Feb y 1819, &amp; the decision of the court was pronounced on the 
1 7 th of March 1819. 

Now of the 17 shares owned by the Judge Marshall on the

286 Correspondence of Nicholas Biddle 

I st of Jan y . 1819, 12 were transferred on the 8 th of Feb y . 
1819, under a power given by Judge Marshall on the 5 th of 
Feb y . 1819. 

For the remaining 5 he gave a power to transfer them on 
the 21 st of Jan y . 1819, though the transfer was not actually 
made on the Books until the 26 th of March 1819. 

So that in point of fact he was ostensibly the owner of five 
shares at the time of the decision. 

Finding this I sent for M r Cope, one of the Director s of 
the Bank of the U.S. and nephew of the M r Thomas V. Cope 
named in the power of Atty. &amp; requested him to examine 
the books of the House &amp; endeavored to find the evidences of 
what I have no doubt was the fact, that Judge Marshall sold 
the Stock at the time of giving the power of Attorney on the 
21 st of January, and that the purchaser neglected to send it 
on till March to be transferred. 

I have kept my letter open in order to give the result of M r 
Cope s enquiries, but as the period is so remote he has not 
been able to complete his examination, &amp; promises to let me 
know further tomorrow. He thinks however that he has as 
certained that this stock was sent to the House by some per 
son in Virg a with other parcels of stock to be transferred, &amp; 
that the probility is that the correspondent in Virg a had pur 
chased these five shares &amp; paid for them. 

I will postpone till tomorrow therefore the further exam 
ination, &amp; in the meantime send inclosed a certificate from 
the Transfer Office &amp; certified copies of the powers of Attor 
ney on file. It may be well to add, that in the power of Att y 
of the 21 st of Jany. 1819, there is a blank for the name of the 
Att y . and that the blank is filled up with the name of Thomas 
P Cope in the handwriting of Th 03 P Cope himself, whence I

it will appear that the Stock in the name of Judge Marshall

That gentleman is still living, &amp; could probably explain the

luckily attested by the James H. Lynch of this town ; and I im 
mediately resorted to him for information as to the date at 
which M r M. parted with his property in that stock. M r L. 
has furnished me conclusive proof, that that stock was 
sold to him at par, and paid for, on the 2ist January 1819, 
the date of the letter of attorney; and he says, moreover, 




288 Correspondence of Nicholas Bid die 

that he advised Mr. Marshall, at the time, not to sell his 
stock, but he assigned as his reason for selling it, that he did 
not choose to remain a stock holder, as questions might be 
brought before the supreme court in which the Bank might 
be concerned. M r . L. does not remember certainly to whom 
he sold these shares of stock; but the scrip and the letter of 
attorney probably passed thro several hands before they 
came to those of Mr Wilcox, who sent them to Mr Cope. 
But this is wholly immaterial, and I shall not take the trouble 
to write to Mr W. about it. 

You shall be informed what I do in this affair. Do not 
doubt that I will give the Hon William Smith such a rap over 
the knuckles as he deserves. But that is not all I have to do 
the gentleman who informed me of this mean and base slan 
der on Mr Marshall s memory, said, that Mr Smith "made 
the statement upon the authority of a U.States Senator now 
representing Virginia." I cannot believe that he had any 
such authority; and I suspect he has slandered our Senators 
as well as Mr Marshall. But if it shall turn out that he 
vouched any such authority, and that either of our present 
Senators made any such communication to him, that Senator 
shall hear of it, and that in such a manner that he shall not 
forget it for the remainder of his days.

Dear Sir 

You must pardon me forgiving you a little more trouble. 

I find from the dividend book of the office of the bank of 

U.States at Richmond, that Gen. J. B. Harvie of this town, 

the son-in-law of the late chief justice Marshall, received the 



To B. W. Leigh 289 

dividends on ten shares of stock, of July 1817, January and 
July 1818, and January 1819, and thenceforth afterwards he 
never received any dividend on any of the stock. From a con 
versation I have had with Gen. H. this morning, I appre 
hend that these shares were originally purchased by Mrs 
Marshall the wife of the chief justice, but the transfer of it 
was made to Gen. H. and the stock stood in his name, tho 
in fact as trustee for her she had a sort of separate prop 
erty,* which she managed for herself and disposed of the 
profits of it, or the principal, among her children, at her own 
pleasure. Gen. H. says this stock was given to him; Mr Mar 
shall telling him at the time, that he wished to divest him 
self of all manner of interest in the bank, because there was 
suits pending (or might be such suits) in the supreme court 
in which the bank was concerned. But Gen. H. does not re 
member the precise date of the gift to him. 

I beg you to get the transfer clerk to give me the precise 
date when, and the person to whom, Gen. H. transferred 
these ten shares of stock, and to send me a copy of his power

... I am very much pleased with the message, 2 and the 
evident breaking up, to a sufficient extent, of party usages. 

I think I see in the " conservative 22" of the hour, a body 
of men who must be united, ultimately, to the Whigs. How 
ever we may look with more confidence to the result of their 
deliberations. I think there is no hope of the "Sub treas

Preston and Hamilton are quietly in your favour. Quietly: 
for the day has not yet arrived to speak out plainly &amp; boldly. 
Three fourths of the business men in our State are with you,

out. If I augur rightly from the signs of the Times, a motion 
to reinstate your bank will be made in about 2 years; hardly 
sooner. But the expedients proposed &amp; to be proposed as sub

As you asked my opinion, I deem it right to Say that 
I think that neither your Bank nor any other Bank Should 
take the loan and that it would be very hazardous for an 
individual since he would have to prove to the purchaser in 
Europe that it had not been originally purchased by a Bank. 
I believe that the best thing to do for you therefore both 
officially &amp; individually is to abstain from it altogether, &amp; 
so apprize the parties at once. 

I had a long conversation to day with M r Hunt the Minis 
ter from Texas and suggested to him various changes 
which I thought useful in the Texas loan and which I have 
no doubt will be made unless some premature action takes 
place in regard to it. This you had better prevent.

The result of the elections 1 in this state is such as to 

1 The New York election was viewed with great interest during these months 
of distress, and it was evident that the outcome would be closely associated with 
the panic in the money market. The symptoms of a division in the Democratic 
Party in relation to banks and banking was early exhibited in New York. (Ham 
mond, J. D., The History of Political Parties in New York, Buffalo, 1850, vol. II, 
pp. 462, 463.) The spring elections in the city of New York resulted in the choice of 
a Whig Mayor, and coming as they did in the midst of hard times "prepared the 
way for the avalanche in the fall." A little later the Sub-Treasury issue began to*\ 
assume prominence in the politics of the state. Nathaniel P. Tallmadge, a Demo 
cratic United States Senator, openly opposed Van Buren s policy and endorsed 
Seward for governor of the state. Van Buren s message in September created a stir 
in Democratic ranks and was received with much displeasure by the Tammany 
men. The Whig papers rejoiced in the discomfiture of their enemies while the 
Democratic papers predicted a gloomy outlook for the Albany Regime. (New York 
Times quoted in the National Intelligencer, October 3, 1837; New York Spectator,

October 12, 1837.) The returns verified their forecasts. The Whigs carried the 
Assembly by 101 to 27 and 10 of the 22 Senators, showing a gain of 144 on the 
preceding year. (Niles, November 25, 1837.) Great was the rejoicing in the Whig 
strongholds over the victory. (Niles, November 18, 1837; Adams, J. Q., Memoirs, 
vol. ix, pp. 431, 432.) 

The Democratic papers set to work explaining the cause of their defeat. "To our 
mind," said the Worcester Republican, "there is no mystery to explain in order 
to solve the reasons of the change in the state as well as in the city of New York. 
The city and state are a highly commercial people. They have felt severely the 
pressure in the money market for the last two months and upwards. And this is the 
strongest argument that can be urged to men in their wants. ... It has been urged 
against the administration that its course of policy has been the cause of the diffi 
culties and pressure in the money market. This has been too successfully urged." 
(Worcester Republican, November 22, 1837.) "The late elections," reiterated the 
Globe, "have been carried under the influence of a panic excited by a false issue." 
(Globe, quoted in Wooster (Ohio) Republican A dvocate, November 23, 1837.) To 
Jackson the political tornado was caused by the apostasy of the Conservatives, but 
to all it was evident the cry of "hard times " raised so efficiently by the Whigs, had 
worked like magic. (Moore, J. B., Works of James Buchanan, Philadelphia, 1908,

Dear Sir, 

. . . The sub Treasury Bill is a subject of much con 
versation here, and its fate in the Senate is very doubtful; 
and it is believed by some of our friends, that the failure 
of the Common wealth Bank of Boston will operate in favour 
of its adoption. M r Grundy * will receive instructions to 
vote against it and will obey; M r Rives 2 is firmly opposed 
to the bill in its present shape, and M r . Talmadge will make 
a great effort to defeat it. Morris 3 of Ohio will obey in 
structions if they should be received in time, but Allen 4 it is 
said will not. M r Cambrelling is confident of the passage of 
the Bill in the Senate, but thinks it will meet with more diffi 
culty in the House; He says the present Congress will not 
consent to discuss any project for a National Bank of Dis 
count, and says that the administration is firmly determined 
to try the experiment of collecting and disbursing the reve 
nues of the Government without the use of Banks. I have

September, 1838, to December, 1839, when he resigned to sit in the Senate in the 
place of Ephraim H. Foster. In 1838 he was instructed to vote against the Sub- 
Treasury system, which he did even though favoring it. 

2 Appointed by Jackson Minister to France, but later filled the place of Taze- 
well in the Senate. In 1834 Mr. Rives resigned in "consequence of his unwilling 
ness to participate in the Senate s vote of censure on President Jackson s re 
moval of the United States Bank deposits, of which he approved, but which the 
Virginia Legislature reprobated." He was returned again to the Senate in 1835 
where he remained until 1845. In January, 1837, he voted for Thomas H. Benton s 
"expunging resolution."

My dear Sir, 

You may readily suppose that we are not idle whilfcy &gt;/ 
this insane Sub Treasury scheme is urged forward to break] 
down all the great interests of the country and prepara 
tions are made to obtain from our legislature at Harrisburgh 
instructions to our representatives in Congress to oppose it. 
I learn from a friend who has just left me on his arrival from 
Harrisburgh to night, that the resolutions for that purpose 
were to be introduced into the House of Rep 3 this day. If so, 
they will be taken up on Monday &amp; if then passed will be 
sent to the Senate &amp; passed finally on Tuesday. 

I lose no time therefore in suggesting that you would keep \ 
up the debate in the Senate for a few days until the resolu- J 
tionscan reach you. I attach great importance to this measure 
as separating our State from these desperadoes, and the coun 
try looks to you eminently to exert your great powers as 
they have been so often before displayed for its protection. 

1 On January 29, 1838, Webster wrote to Benjamin D. Lilliman as follows: 
"We begin the proceeding on the S.T. Bill tomorrow. It will probably pass this 
House, without amendment, by 2 or 3 votes. Its fate in the other House is greatly 
doubtful. The decision on the Mississippi election is expected to day or to morrow. 
The Sub Treasury Bill may, perhaps, be a good (deal) dependent on the decision."

I received your favor of the 4 th . &amp; met Mr. B. last 
night at a small party given at the house at which I board. 
I rallied him on the subject of instructions, &amp; he remarked to 
me, as he had done once or twice before, that if they came, he 
would obey or resign, intimating, I thought, a preference for 
the latter alternative. 

We are now in the midst of the debate on the Treasury 
Bank, the denomination which should be given to it upon 
every occasion. Rives began a very good speech, yesterday, 
which he will finish to-day. I do not know that an occasion 
will present itself, but if it does, I will embrace it, to draw 
from Mr. B. a more explicit declaration. We will run them 
to the girt in the Senate. If they carry their abominable 
measure, it will not be by a majority of more than two votes.

. . . The Sub Treasury bill remains in status quo. Cal- 
houn is moving heaven, earth, &amp; to obtain Southern votes 
for the measure. He labors to convince his Southern neigh 
bors that its success will relieve them from their commercial 
dependence on the North. His plausibility, &amp; endless perser- 
verance, have really effected a good deal. Even your relative 
Mr. C. Sheppard has been, &amp; indeed now is, in a state of 
doubt. Still, I think the Bill cannot pass; but the majority 
will be Small. The labors of Mr Calhoun, &amp; the power &amp; 
patronage of the Executive, have accomplished more than,? 
I have thought possible.

notwithstanding the two exceptionable paragraphs. The good 
in them more than counter balanced the bad, as the event has 
already proved. We now probably stand 26 against 26. One 
more vote would defeat the vile measure. We have a prospect 
of getting that by an instruction from Richmond to Mr. Roane 
but it is not certain. If it comes, he will obey it. Could it not 
be obtained from Trenton? Why could not a positive instruc 
tion (the Gen 1 Assembly instructs its Senators &amp; requests its

I believe, decide Mr. Wall. 1 I think he would obey. And as

out justly wounding the sensibility of Mr. Southard. . . . 

JOHN SERGEANT TO BIDDLE 

(Private) Washington, April 28 th . 1838. 

My dear Sir, 

Referring to what I wrote yesterday, I would now add, 
that there is a strong jealousy of New York rising in the 
South. You know the schemes of the Southrons 2 for get- 
moment that motives most unworthy have induced seven members of the House of 
Representatives to forego the solemn and imposing duties which they owed their 
constituents. . . . Here then we have before us a practical illustration of the im 
mense and alarming power of the banks, whose agents have been and now are as 
thick as bees prowling about the halls of both houses of our legislature." Van 
Buren MSS. in Library of Congress. 

1 Cf. Mr. Wall s speech on the Sub-Treasury setting forth his views on the 
measure in Cong. Globe, 25th Cong., 2d Sess., vol. vi, 1838, Appendix, pp. 230 et seq. 

2 The South fully appreciated the importance of their position and power dur 
ing this struggle, as is evidenced in the following letter of Pickens to Hammond, 
February 9, 1838: "There is much doubt as to the passage. The vote will be close 
&amp; much depends upon our delegation. . . . There never was such a time for the 
South to control as at present, if we would be united. The great struggle is whether 
cotton shall control exchange &amp; importations or whether the Banks &amp; the stock 
interest shall do it. The South will be more prosperous under cotton at IDC &amp; no 
banks converted connected with the government lending its credit &amp; power to the 
stock interest than we would be under cotton at i3c &amp; the reverse of these things.

ting their own trade into their own hands. What support they 
have given to the Sub-Treasury has been to promote this 
view. The mass of them have been sincere. M r . Calhoun 1 
has used it only to cloak his ambition. They are now alarmed 
at the prospect of a new union of the money power, with the 
political power by means of the free banking law of New 
York. The question is whether in this jealousy, (the present 
predominat feeling, whether well or ill founded) there is not 
a ground for an union of the Bank U.S. with the South. If you 
can make friends there, you will soon have Penns a ., for she 
always goes with the South. I throw this out for your con 
sideration. As you are to steer, of course you will observe 
where the wind is to come from. . . . 

We will have a great contest &amp; one which will fix our prosperity for 20 years, one 
way or the other." And as Pickens viewed the subject the South would be foolish to 
summit to cunning and fraud any longer. Hammond MSS. in Library of Congress. 

However, a good explanation for the position of the South on the Sub-Treasury 
and the motives which impelled it to stand by the Administration in these days is 
given in a letter of Alfred Hager (?) to Poinsett, September I, 1838: "As to the 
S.T. I really know very little about it ... but surely, a very little reflection must 
teach every Southern man who is willing to be taught what our policy is. The Bank 
&amp; the metallic basis &amp; the paper currency are all debatable questions but 
the Black Currency is not. How am I to be benefited by either Bank or Sub. 
Treasury without my land on Cooper River &amp; the Negroes that work there? What 
signifies to me all the jargon about Whigs &amp; Conservatives etc. etc. if the aboli 
tionists stand between me &amp; the White Gate at Longwood? these are the inquiries 
that make me an administration man with me the very foundation of liberty is 
slavery &amp; I go for Mr. Van Buren because Mr. Van Buren goes for me &amp; it would 
be worse than hypocrisy in me to be hunting about for better reasons than this with 
a strong current sitting against us, with the whole world looking angrily at our in 
stitution &amp; the prevailing feeling of mankind plainly developing a disposition to 
overthrow them, how can the South afford to talk about this man, or that man, with 
the message of the President &amp; the actions conforming to his message staring us 
in the face?" Poinsett MSS. in Pennsylvania Historical Society Library. 

1 By this period Calhoun realized that his alliance with the Whig Party would 
absorb his followers and that a coalition with the party in power would better serve 
his purposes. Accordingly he broke his alliance with the Whig Party. For a care 
ful and illuminating discussion of Calhoun s actions at this time, cf. Cole, Whig 
Party in the South, pp. 46-48.

(confidential} Phil a . April 30, 1838 

My dear Sir 

. . . The Bank of the U. States owes about six millions 
of dollars to the Gov fc . payable by instalments due in Sepf 
nxt Sep. i839~Sep. 1840. Now the Bank might anticipate 
these payments at once, and put the Gov fc . in funds for its 
pressing wants. In this Settlement, as it is the payment of a 
debt and does not come under the Same line as the ordinary 
revenue there need be no operation of specie payment or 
any other payment, for the public creditor would be too 
happy to receive a draft on the Bank with the option of asking 
specie for it if he choose to demand it, just as the Secretary 
of the Navy last year paid the pensioners. 

The first effect of such an arrangement would be to quiet the 
minds of the people as to what is regarded as the hostility of 
the Gov*. to the Banks the most serious obstacle at pres 
ent to a general restoration of the Currency and it would 
go further than any other measure I know to promote that ob 
ject. An easy consequence of this would be a return to some 
thing like the ancient habits of inter course between the Bank 
&amp; the Gov*. which would lead to this result. I think that the 
Gov*. may be satisfied that no System could work better than 
that of the late Bank of the U.S. Now the present Bank is only 
the late Bank with no change except in the origin of its char 
ter. Its whole machinery can be remounted in twenty four 
hours and thence forward it can, without difficulty, engage 
to receive &amp; disburse the public funds in every part of the 
U.S. without any charge whatever, in specie or its equivalent,

at the option of the public creditor. If therefore by a simple 
arrangement of that Kind with the Bank, you can restore 
the administration of the funds to its former footing, you 
accomplish several objects. The first of course is that the work 
of the Gov*. is well done. The second is that you are relieved 
from all connection in detail with a multitude of banks, the 
fruitful source of trouble &amp; political danger. Then you get rid 
of the debatable question of the National Bank You avoid 
the embarrassment of retracting any fixed opinions you 
restore in the most effectual way you can, at least you con 
tribute as far as you can to restore, the currency. 

Finally, you thus get peace not a bad thing at any time 
but a remarkably good thing at this time. For myself 
this business of Texas, and a much more important matter 
which I project, make me desire to close up these old sources 
of discontent. I am therefore singularly pacific &amp; amiable 
just now. 

It seems to me then, that you have an opportunity of 
making a political movement a coup d etat worth trying. 
I believe that at this moment a reconciliation between the 
/ Bank &amp; the Gov*. would do more both at home &amp; abroad to 
settle our troubles than any other measure that could be 
adopted. Its influence here in disarming the hostility of those 
who consider the Gov*. as indisposed to the credit system, you 
may estimate better than I can. This could be done simply 
by putting aside the Sub treasury bill, and all other projects, 
and leaving the whole matter on the footing of the resolution 
of 1816, which would make it the subject of treasury regu 
lation. 

Having thus unburdened my mind, I leave the rest to you, 
if you think the suggestion worth following out. If not, it of

course rests between ourselves, as no one will be aware of the &gt;. 
contents of this letter. The negociation for anticipating the ^ 
first instalment is going on under the auspices of the gentle 
man who has had charge of it but the occasion seems a 
good one to follow out the mere intended arrangement here 
suggested. 

HENRY CLAY TO BIDDLE 

Wash n . 30 th May 1838 
My Dear Sir 

I rec d . your favor of the 28 th ins 1 . You will have seen 
that the resolution, which had passed the Senate, rescinding 
the Specie Circular, 1 has also passed the House this morn 
ing in less than three hours after it was rec d by a majority of 
more than five to one! 

I sincerely hope that the condition of your Bank is such as\ 
to admit of your seizing this occurrence to make an early re- \ 
sumption. I am extremely anxious on your account as well \ 
as that of the public that your Bank shall continue to main- / 
tain its high character / 

You will have seen and you will comprehend the object and &gt; 
the benefits of the movement I made, in respect to a Bank of 
the U.S. It will turn public attention to the subject in the 
abstract. It will suspend or render harmless malignant at 
tacks on your Bank. And it may even reconcile the public 
ultimately to the grant of a National Charter to your Bank. 
I should be satisfied with either. 

1 The Specie Circular was rescinded by a joint resolution of May 21, 1838, 
which forbade the Secretary of the Treasury "to make or to continue in force, any 
general order, which shall create any difference between the different branches of 
revenue, as to the money or medium of payment, in which debts or dues, accruing 
to the United States, may be paid." Cf. U.S. Statutes at Large, vol. v, p. 310.

Tonight my advices from Wash 11 are that the virtual

This will satisfy us &amp; I will make an immediate move

I will tell you a short story. I left W. for Boston, in

order, &amp; should put it in- the same form, as my amendment, 
introduced for the same purpose, into the Sub-Tresury Bill.

to me, as you have mentioned your purpose, and it will be

over to Mr C s lodgings, the Evening before I left Washing

first day after my return, I should bring forward the measure 
if, in the mean time, the H. of R. should not take up the 
Sub-Treasury Bill. 

After I had been heard of, on my return, at New York,

My dear Sir, 

. . . The tide now has begun to turn, and the Bank 
has received to day a triumph such as it never enjoyed in any 
part of its career. You know that the stand taken by the Bank 
was, that it would not resume until the Gov*. changed its 
course, as there could be no security for specie payments 
while the Gov fc . itself made the distinction between specie &amp; 
notes. Accordingly the contest has literally been between 
the Bank &amp; the Executive. With what result you will see by 
the proceedings of yesterday when on the very same day the 
Specie Circular was repealed in the Senate by a vote of 34 to 
9, and in the House by 154 to 29. I have immediately en-* 
deavoured to justify the confidence of the country by issuing \ 
a note to M r Adams 1 in which suppressing all feelings of J

triumph, I merely announced the fact that we should now 
proceed to take measures for resumption. At the same time 
we resolved to yield to our New York friends who wished us 
to have a Branch there under the new Banking law. This 
application is itself one of the most extraordinary symptoms 
of the good feeling which pervades the commercial commu 
nity of New York. I send you an extract from the newspa 
per of to-day containing a notice of it, as well as my letter to 
M r . Adams &amp; I will inclose, if they can be prepared in 
time, copies of the correspondence with M r Adams on the 
subject. 

- I now mean to turn my immediate attention to mak- 
/ ing a simultaneous movement in the South &amp; West, so as 
/ to make the resumption really worth having &amp; I hope 
I to be able to rally up the whole country to an efficient 
\exertion. 

The efforts made here to injure the Bank and which are 
echoed on your side, have ceased to have any effect here, &amp; 
the Bank will probably be in a more desirable situation than 
it ever was. 

I shall even not be very much surprized if some coquetting 
passes between our administration friends and the Bank, as 
we are in a singularly amiable humour. 

You know that Woodbury is appointed Chief Justice of 
New Hampshire &amp; leaves the Treasury, being in fact turned 
out in the shape of a resignation; so that according to Euro 
pean ideas, the President s ordinance being repealed, by both 
Houses of Congress, &amp; the Minister who issued it being dis 
missed, it may be regarded as a civil revolution on the side of 
the Bank.

My dear Sir, 

We received yesterday your letter of the 5 th ulto. I 
am not surprized that the echo in London of all the trash cir 
culated here has annoyed you. But we have surmounted them 
on this side and I think the Bank stands even better now 
than it ever did in the general estimation. You will have seen 
that we hailed the first glimpse of sunshine offered by the 
repeal of the Specie Circular. But as soon as it passed, the 
party of the Administration rallied upon the Sub Treasury 
Bill. That bill, as you know, passed the Senate, but is now 
in such a position in the House that it cannot be reached with 
out a vote of two thirds. Accordingly M r Cambreling has 
brought in a fresh bill which a majority can control, &amp; which 
the Administration mean to push thro the House. If this be 
the case, it will undo all that has hitherto been done. M r Ser 
geant is here on a visit, and he thinks the matter so critical, 
&amp; is so anxious to obtain even a single vote that we are about 
sending down some people to Washington to explain to the 
representatives from our State how extremely injurious to its 
interests such a bill would prove, and urging them to defeat 
it. With what success a week will determine. ...

Phil a . June 23, 1838 
My dear Sir, 

... I think now we are approaching the end of our 
war. The repeal of the Specie Circular was an actual surren 
der by the Administration but since then, they have ral 
lied in great force on the Sub-Treasury bill which was sup 
posed to be dead &amp; buried. The real political secret of this 
bill is that the most of the Adm n . party do not like it 
that M r Calhoun is driving them into it in order to promote 
his own advancement. I think however it will be defeated. 
Then we shall come to some modification of the deposit sys 
tem. What I wish to establish is that the business of the 
/ country &amp; the public revenue shall pass through Banks 
1 &amp; not thro mere receivers and this I think we shall es- 
\tablish at last. . . . 

BIDDLE TO SAMUEL JAUDON 

Phil a . June 29, 1838 
My dear Sir, 

I have but a moment, as usual, to write, as the Bank 
is closing, &amp; the mail for the Sirius going. 
The repeal of the Specie Circular has been followed by 



To Thaddeus Stevens 315 

a fresh defeat in the rejection of the Sub-Treasury. 1 M r 
Buchanan has renewed the matter of the special deposit, but 
it will fail. 

In England we should have seen an instant change of min 
istry. Here ministers are engaged on wages for a year &amp; 
however they may misbehave, will serve out their term. On 
the 9 th of July, Congress will adjourn and then the Ad 
ministration, poor &amp; dispirited, will be brought to reason as 
wild beasts are tamed by hunger. 

Remember that whatever you may read to the contrary, 
the repeal of the Specie Circular &amp; the defeat of the Sub 
Treasury are the results, exclusively, of the course pursued 
by the Bank of the U.S. If we had done as the New York 
Banks had, succumbed to the Gov 4 . &amp; resumed when they 
did, it would have been a surrender at discretion. I was 
willing to risk the temporary overshadowing to have a per 
manent sunshine; and I think we shall soon have it. . .

(Private) Phil a . July 11,1838 

Dear Sir 

M r Kimble of the House of Representatives called 
upon me today and expressed to me a wish on your part to 
know whether the bonds of the Bank could be made available 
for the use of your Department. I hasten to say that from a 
desire to promote the public service, as well as from consid 
erations personal to yourself, it will afford me great pleasure 
to do anything which may contribute to the successful ad 
ministration of your Department. 

There are, as you are aware, three bonds payable on the 
I st of October of 1838-39 &amp; 40, respectively. The two which it 
is proposed to sell cannot be sold either in this country or in 
Europe, and the money can be furnished for them by the 
Bank only. But I should be disposed to advance the money 
on the first, second, and perhaps third of them, if it could 
be made the interest of both the Department and the Bank. 
If therefore you can in the first instance so arrange it as to 
have the bonds placed at your disposition to raise the money 
on them, and let me know how and where and when your 
disbursements are to be made, I will at once tell you what 
I can do.

opposition caused their defeat. Now having triumphed, the 
resumption of specie payment will be speedy and effectual. 

BIDDLE TO R. M. BLATCHFORD 

Phil 8 . July 31, 1838 
My dear Sir 

I will thank you to take charge of a little matter which 
may become important unless wisely managed. The Bank 
has just made a settlement, mutually advantageous to both 
parties, with the Gov 4 . To you, who know all the bearings 
of such a measure, I need not say, that I regard it as the ter- 
x mination of the war, &amp; therefore of great benefit alike to the 
LBank,and to the country. But if it be a matter of advantage to 
the Bank, or of triumph to its friends, like all triumphs it should 
be enjoyed with moderation. In noticing it therefore, by the 
press, I would specially avoid everything like exultation 
everything like rep roach to the administration as being forced, 
at last, to resort to the Bank. But on the contrary the admin 
istration should be treated as having done a good thing, and 
should have credit for a pacification which cannot fail to 
be useful to the country. It may be of some consequence to 
the Adm n . to see that they do not expose themselves, by this 
step, to sneers and sarcasms from their political opponents. 

Will you have the goodness to suggest this as the proper 
tone to be adopted by our friends in New York ?

My dear Sir 

Leaving to our friends Mess". Cowperthwait &amp; Dun- 
lap to give you all the details, I shall employ the only few 
moments of leisure I can command before the sailing of the 
Steamship, to say two or three things which may interest 
you. 

I . We have settled with Gov*. for our bonds, and settled 
in a way particularly agreeable. You know my opinion, which 
I have never concealed, in regard to the individuals who 
have for the last ten years governed the country. These 
opinions are confirmed rather than changed. But looking, as 
I do, to what I deem the great interests of the country, &amp; 
.Specially bound to protect the interests committed to my 
charge, my object has been to bring the existing Gov*. to 
such a course of measures as would remedy present evils, 
until some political revolution should restore wiser counsels 
at Washington. To bring this about, there was no safe course 



To Samuel Jaudon 3 1 9 

but one of open and decided defiance, to show that the Bank 
was not at all afraid of the administration, and would not 
depart from its own policy until the Gov*. had renounced 
the follies which it was laboring to propagate. Accordingly 
it became necessary to say that the Bank U.S. and the other 
banks would not resume specie payments until the Gov*. had 
announced its own policy. The parties stood in that attitude, 

the good cause weakened by the desertion &amp; the weakness 
of those New York 21/2 per cent patriots but still strong 
enough to face the enemy. Our efforts were of course directed 
to the repeal of the specie circular, &amp; when that was done, 
and the adm n . made a last rally on the sub treasury bill, by 
great exertion they were defeated on that point. This settled 
the matter. The real question, as you know perfectly well, 
was, whether the Gov*. should carry on its finances by the in 
strumentality of banks, or of special receivers of Gold &amp; Sil 
ver only; and the vote of the H. of Rep s . decided that the 
sense of the country was for the old mode. The adjournment 
of Congress hastened the process of repentance, by leaving 
the Adm n . without any means of carrying on the public busi 
ness, unless by the sale of the Bonds. I had taken my own 
position in that narrow defile, thro which I was sure they 
would have to pass, and where accordingly we met. What be- 
f el, you may imagine, since we have come out good friends ; 

and after a little coquetry and a little flirtation, I think it 
not improbable that M r (not M rs ) Woodbury &amp; I will be ten 
der &amp; true, after the Douglass fashion. 

The settlement is in this form : 

The first bond due in September next, will be divided 
into three instalments, payable on the 15 th . of August, 
September and October, respectively. 



320 Correspondence of Nicholas Bid die 

The second bond, due in September 1839, is immediately 

cashed on the I st ins*. 

The third; the Sec y is not yet sufficiently pressed to sell 

but when he does sell, we are to have the refusal. 
The money is placed at once to the credit of the Treasurer 
of the United States, &amp; remains on deposit with us with 
out interest and the See 7 gives a List, &amp; the Sec y of War 
gives another list, of the points where he wants the disburse 
ments made, which embrace the whole West &amp; South West, 
and the warrants of the Treasurer are drawn on the Bank of 
the United States, payable in Missouri, Arkansas &amp;c &amp;c. 

The benefit of time and exchange are thus apparent and 
the Bank is now actually a depository of the public money; 
/ so that the result is, that, after all the nonsense of the 
last few years, the Gov*. takes in payment of a bond, a credit 
in a bank which does not pay specie yet, and which had de 
clared that it did not mean to pay specie until that very 
Gov* had abandoned its course. Our Washington friends 
are scarcely aware of the concession which this involves, and 
I have taken pains, throughout the country, that the opposi 
tion should indulge in no exultation no sarcasm noth 
ing which should startle the treasury and blight our budding 
loves; for my present intention is to make the Bank a 
general depository of the funds of the Gov*. You know what 
a difficult and almost incredible work that will be, but 
there is no room for despair after what has occurred, for 
the partizans of the Gov 1 . are not yet recovered from the 
amazement caused by this recent inexplicable movement. 

You see that we resume on the 13 th of this month. We be 
gin without having sacrificed any great interest. We begin 
with a wide circle of resumers, whom our delay has enabled to 



From B 321 

prepare; and we begin after having fairly beaten down the\ 
Gov*., and secured the ascendency of reason for the future./ 
We arrive in port without having been under the necessity 
of throwing over any of our cargo. We arrive, for every useful 
purpose, just as soon as our neighbours, who lost over board 
a large part of the passengers; and we only stopped on the 
way to sink a pirate. So that, on the whole, I have no reason 
to be dissatisfied with our course. 

2. Just as we were preparing our machinery for the New 
York concern, we found, to our great surprize, that under the 
law it was doubtful whether the Bank, as a corporation, could 
become an associate, and we were obliged to give up our 
plan. I think it very probable, however, that the object will 
be accomplished, even in a better form, if we make an ar 
rangement with a small association to do our business in New 
York. We say nothing of this on our side of the water; but I 
think that the arrival after you receive this, will give you de 
tails. I mention it now, merely that you may know that we 
shall probably soon do the largest commercial business in 
New York. . . .

I have had quite an interesting interview with a Loco

the future prospects of the greate Democratic family. The

result of my friends mission is very satisfactory. As He was 
commissioned by me for the purpose of ascertaining the 
views entertained by the President toward the Bank of the 
United States he turned his attention to that subject entirely. 
He urged upon the President the absolute necessity there 
was of abandoning the present policy and hinted that in his 
opinion the only way of defeating M r Clay was by making 
Peace with the Bank of the U States. The President received 
his Hint in a very gracious manner and said he was in the 
Hands of the poeple and If thay resolved to have the Govern 
ment connected with the Bank He the President would not 
oppose the will of the majority when it had been clearly ex 
pressed. The President agreed with him that if M r Rives of 
Virg a could be reconciled it would be accomplishing much to 
wards a Reconciliation of the differences that had recently ex 
isted in the party. This would be a death blow to the Con 
servative party and then remarked my friend would not the 
withdrawing of the Bank of the United States from the whig 
party produce the same effect upon them (the Whigs) as the 
loss of M r Rives would be to the Conservative Interest. The 
president remarked, it is entitled to consideration, my im 
pression is it would. To sum up my friend is impressed with 
the Idea that the President is personally very anxious for a 
Reconciliation and If M r Rives will consent to run as Vice 
president theire would be no difficulty in making the arrange 
ments. All the best plans of getting back to the old Land 
marks of the party were discussed the disposition to be 
made of Blaire &amp; others conditioned an arraingement of this

adoption of one at Washington, under his eye &amp; control. 

I think Clay looks to the same Site, for the same reason. 

Whether Webster goes with you or not, I cannot tell : prob 
ably yes. 

If Clay can get the votes of New York or Pennsylvania, 
his chances for election are good. Van Beuren will get per 
haps a majority of the South: I greatly dislike the ultra 
federalism of Webster, but it is clear to me, your interest is 
allied to his; and that his success depends on overcoming the 
reasonable republican prejudices of New York &amp; Pennsyl 
vania against him. 

Hence, it is of great importance, if you wish a reinstatement,

BIDDLE TO SAMUEL JAUDON 

Philad 3 . August 15, 1838 
My dear Sir 

I have little to add to what I wrote by the Royal Wil 
liam, of which I enclose a copy. 

Our arrangements with the Gov*. are in very satisfactory 
progress. We have placed to their credit the proceeds of the 
two first bonds, and they indicate the points of disbursements, 
which, being very remote and numerous, afford the ad 
vantages of circulation &amp; exchange. But the greatest satis 
faction of all is, that this arrangement brings back the Gov 1 . 
to its old position of doing its business thro Banks, and by 
means of Bank credits. So, the triumph, is, I think, com 
plete. The two political parties, meanwhile, are confounded, 
and are not yet able to comprehend it. The Adm n people be 
lieve that I must have bought M r Van Buren, the opposi 
tion fearing that this will strengthen the ministry and work 
against the interests of M r Clay. You know that my owfk 
course has reference merely to the service of the Country/ 
and if these people are beaten into measures that are bene-\ 
ficial, I shall not permit myself to avoid co-operating with 



To Daniel Webster 325 

them, lest it should injure the prospects of our political party. 
The great power of the Bank lies in its total independence 
of all of them. 

Our resumption on the 13 th works very well, the demand 
for specie being very small. 

BIDDLE TO DANIEL WEBSTER *

My dear Sir 

I stated to you, last year, my views in regard to Texas; 
and you then thought that if the plan of annexation to the 
United States could be abandoned, every consideration of 
feeling &amp; interest would conspire to make us desire its pros 
perity. That question is now settled. M r Jones, the new 
Minister, arrived two days ago in Phil a ., and he is instructed 
to withdraw the proposal of union. This troublesome part 
of the question being thus disposed of, I am much inclined 
to think that if their loan of Five millions were taken in the 
United States, it would be far better than if they were 
obliged to seek it in England. I do not however wish to mix 
myself with the political contests of the day nor to interfere 
in matters which have been the subject of party warfare; and V 
I should like to have the benefit of the opinions of judicious 
friends before doing something final in respect to it. Will you 
then say, whatever you feel at liberty to say, in the question, 
whether it would not be greatly for the interest of our com 
mon country that Texas should continue independent of all 
foreign nations, that she should be protected by this coun 
try and not permitted, if possible, to owe her prosperity to 
any other aid than ours. Say, too, whether your opinion is 

1 Cf. letter on same topic reprinted in Van Tyne, Webster, p. 213.

that Texas can maintain its independence, or whether, in the 
last extremity, this country would permit her to be con 
quered, or reconquered; and, being free, whether you think 
a loan to her would be perfectly safe. You will readily under 
stand, by the strain of these remarks, that I am predisposed 
Go serve Texas, because I believe I should benefit our coun- 
ry by it; but, before taking any decisive step, I would wish 
to have your judgment, because I know that your opinion 
will be an impartial and a patriotic one. If any circumstance, 
public or private, indisposes you to answer, I request that you 
will not answer. But if you incline to speak, speak for 
I think the occasion worthy of you. and so speak that if, when 
I have decided, I should want the benefit of your judgment to 
sanction my course, I may have it and use it publicly or pri 
vately. I will only add that what you say I wish you to say 
quickly.

My dear Sir 

Your introduction of M r Burnley, Commissioner of 
Texas, makes it not unnatural to confer with you on the sub 
ject of the loan which he is endeavoring to negotiate. 

The subject of Texas is one familiar to me since my connec 
tion in Paris, thirty three years ago, with the treaty of Louisi 
ana, 1 the execution of a great portion of which fell under my 
own personal inspection. On that subject I hold very decided 
opinions. But the question which now occupies my attention 

1 For Biddle s connection with the treaty of Louisiana, cf. Conrad, Robert T., 
Sketch of Nicholas Biddle, in National Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Americans, 
vol. in, pp. 12 et seq. 



To Henry Clay 327 

is this : The Minister of Texas, just arrived &amp; in this city, 
means to withdraw, formally, the proposal to enter the Union. 
So far, the embarrassments and troubles which that measure 
threatened are, for the present at least, removed. The ques 
tion then becomes an open one, and it offers for considera 
tion this point: Whether, if we are to consider the revolution 
there as complete, if this country will not permit Texas 
to be conquered by a new master, or reconquered by its old 
one, then it is not of great importance that her prosperity 
should be of our own creation, and that she should not be 
obliged to incur obligations to any other country? She now 
wants money to consolidate her power &amp; fix her institutions. 
Is it not better far better that she should obtain it from 
us than from any other power? Now I am inclined to make 
the loan. At the same time I mean to do nothing rashly 
nothing which shall not, in my judgment, be highly benefi 
cial to our Country. But I do not wish to take any decided 
step without the opinion of some friends on whose judgment 
I rely. Allow me then to ask what you think of the question ? 
Do you think that Texas will maintain its independence, or 
that the United States would permit any power to deprive 
her of it. Do you think it would be wise to take the loan and 
not suffer her to owe her success to England ? 

If you feel any the slightest reluctance to say anything 
about the matter, you will of course say nothing. But if you 
feel disposed to give any opinion, let it be such as, hereafter, 
if I deem it useful to use your authority as confirming my 
own views, I may quote, and if necessary, make public. I 
mention this that you may limit, precisely, the nature &amp; ex 
tent of your communication. 



328 Correspondence of Nicholas Biddle 

DANIEL WEBSTER TO BIDDLE 

Boston Sept r io th 1838 
My Dear Sir 

I have rec d . your favor of the 8 th instant. The decision 
of the Gov* of Texas, to withdraw its application for a union 
with the U. States, is, in my judgment, an event, eminently 
favorable, to both countries. She now stands, as an independ- 
ant state, looking to her own power, &amp; her own resources, to 
maintain her place among the nations of the earth, an atti 
tude, vastly more respectable, than that which she held, while 
solicitous to her own political character, &amp; to become part 
of a neighbouring country. Seeking, thus, no longer a union 
with us, &amp; assuming the ground of entire independence 
I think it highly important to the interests of the U. States, 
that Texas should be found able to maintain her position. 
Any connexion with a European State, so close as to make 
her dependent on that State, or to identify her interests with 
the interests of such State, I should regard as greatly unfor 
tunate for us. I could not but regret, exceedingly, to see any 
union between those parts of our continent, which have 
broken the chain of European dependence &amp; the Govern 
ments of Europe; whether those, from which they have been 
disunited, or others. You Remember the strong opinion, ex 
pressed by M r . Monroe that the U.S. could not consent to 
the recolonization of those portions of this Continent, which 
had severed the ties, binding them to a European connexion, 
&amp; formed free &amp; independent Governments for themselves; or 
to the establishment of other European Colonies, in America 
The spirit, &amp; reason, of these sentiments, would lead us to 
regard with just fear, &amp; therefore with just jealousy, any con- 



From Daniel Webster 329 

nexions, between our near American neighbours, &amp; the power 
ful states of Europe, except those of friendly &amp; useful com 
mercial intercourse. It is easy to forsee the evils with which 
any other connexion, than that last mentioned, between 
Texas &amp; one of the great sovereignties of Europe, might 
threaten us. Not to avert to those of a high &amp; political char 
acter, one, likely to have a direct bearing on our commerce, a 
connexion on the great staple of our southern production. 
Texas is destined, doubtless, to be a great cotton producing 
country, &amp; which we should cheerfully concede to her all the 
advantages which her soil &amp; climate afford to her, in sus 
taining a competition with ourselves, we could not behold, 
with indifference, a surrender, by her, of her substantial in 
dependence, for the purchase of exclusive favors &amp; privileges, 
from the hands of a European Government. 

The competency of Texas to maintain her Independence 
depends, I think, altogether on the character of her Gov*. &amp; 
its administration. I have no belief, at all, in the power of 
Mexico to re-subjugate Texas, if the latter country shall be 
well governed. The same consideration decides, also, the ques 
tion, whether a loan to Texas would be safe. I have supposed, 
that her new formed Gov 1 was gradually strengthening, &amp; 
improving, in all the qualities requisite for the respectable 
exercise of National power. That in institutions so recent, 
there should be, for a time, some irregularity of action, is to 
be expected. But if those to whose hands her destinies are 
now committed, shall look steadily to two great objects, 
first, real &amp; absolute, as well as nominal, National Independ 
ence, &amp; second, the maintenance of a free &amp; efficient Gov*., 
of which good faith shall, from the beginning, be a marked 
characteristic, I see nothing to render it less safe to regulate 



330 Correspondence of Nicholas Bid die 

money transactions with her, than with the Gov ts . of other 
countries. On the other hand, if a spirit of speculation &amp; 
project should appear to actuate her councils, &amp; if she should 
trifle with her public domain, involve herself in contradic 
tory obligations, or seek to establish her prosperity on any 
other foundations, than those of justice &amp; good faith, there 
would, then, be little to be hoped, either in regard to punctu 
ality in pecuniary engagements or to the probability of her 
maintaining an independent National character. 

My opinion, on the whole, is, that the prospects of Texas 
are now far better &amp; brighter than they have ever been be 
fore; that the interests of our own country require, that she 
should keep herself free from all particular European con 
nexion; &amp; that whatever aid can be furnished to her, by in 
dividuals, or corporations, in theU. States, in the present state 
of her affairs, to enable her to maintain a truly independent 
&amp; national character, would tend to promote the welfare of 
the U States, as well as of Texas herself. 

HENRY CLAY TO BIDDLE 

Ashland 14 th Sept. 1838 
My Dear Sir 

I received this morning your favor of the 7 th instant 
communicating several inquiries, respecting Texas, on which 
you are desirous to obtain my opinion. This I have not the 
least objection to express; but without a strong necessity I 
should not wish it to be published. And my aversion to its 
publication arises solely out of the consideration that, at 
this time, I desire voluntarily to appear in the public prints 
as little as possible, lest I should be thought to be endeavor 
ing to conciliate public support. 



From Henry Clay 331 

I am glad to learn from you that the Minister from Texas 
intends to withdraw the application from Texas to be incor 
porated in our Union. It is a wise step; for it is perfectly mani 
fest that, whether it is expedient or not to annex it to the U. 
States, the public mind in this Country is not in a temper to 
sanction such a measure, at this period. The longer agitation 
of the question can do no possible good to our party, whilst it 
has a positively injurious tendency upon the domestic inter 
ests and relations of the other. If the question were to be pro 
longed, and a foreign attack, other than from Mexico, should 
be made on Texas, I think that a majority of the American 
Congress could not be got to succor Texas in warding off 
such an attack. Whereas, if the project of annexation be 
abandoned, and any European power were to attack the 
independence of the new Republic, I think it would be the 
inclination, as I am sure it would be the interest and the duty 
of the U.S. to prevent the success of the attack. 

Whether Texas will be able to maintain the Independence 
which she has declared, or not, I have no means of judging 
which you do not possess, perhaps not so many. I am inclined 
to believe that she will, if the Government is administered 
with reasonable ability. Time is everything to Texas, whilst 
delay is ruinous to the Mexican reconquest. The French 
Blocade 1 operates most advantageously to Texas, by ren 
dering her secure against attacks from the Gulph, which I 
have always thought her most vulnerable side. She ought to 
wish that this Blocade may be long continued. In the mean 
time emigrants are pouring into Texas, and daily adding 
strength to her. I do not see how Mexico, torn as she is by 

1 For the French blockade, cf. Yoakum, H., History of Texas (New York, 1836), 
vol. n, pp. 252-257. 



3 3 2 Correspondence of Nicholas Biddle 

factions, with her finances totally disordered, no efficient army 
nor commanders, and no good materials for an army to be 
sent on a distant conquest, can subjugate the revolted prov 
ince. If France were out of the way, and Mexico had and could 
keep the preponderance at Sea, Texas might be in danger. 

If Texas is to be an independent power, it is the obvious 
interest of the U.S. to cultivate her friendship, as their near 
est neighbour, in that quarter; and it is consequently their 
interest that Texas should/^/ that she has been well treated 
by them. Hitherto she has had no just cause to complain of 
the U.S. whatever they may have given to any other power. 
This feeling of friendship towards the U.S. on the part of 
Texas, for one, I should be happy to see strengthened, by all 
the good offices that can be rendered, consistently with our 
neutrality. The loan, which she wishes to negociate, and 
which you are inclined to make, may unquestionably be 
effected, without any violation of any Neutral duty by which 
the people of this Country stand bound. Of course, I give no 
opinion as to terms, or the security which may be offered 
for its reimbursement. Assuming them to be satisfactory to 
the parties, I think it, in every respect, highly desirable that 
Texas should contract an obligation for the loan in this 
Country, and not in any European State. 

I do not believe that the U.S. will or ought to interfere, so 
as to become a party to the contest, whilst it is confined to 
Mexico and Texas. But if any European power, and espe 
cially if G. Britain or France, were to attempt the conquest 
of Texas, or to aid Mexico in reconquering it, in my opinion 
the U.S. could not regard any such attempt with indifference. 

I have thus, my dear sir, frankly expressed my opinions. 
I shall be happy if you should be able to derive any assist-

Dear Sir. 

To the following letter make no reply. If I say any 
thing that has not occurred to you before, which is very un 
likely, use it in your own way. 

My original proposal met with the concurrence of every 
sensible man to whom I stated it, as a desirable event if it 
could be carried. But all doubted its present practicability, 
from the prevailing ignorance &amp; prejudice about Banks. 
That prejudice is evanescing. But I think, the matter may 
be managed some years hence, if you take advantage of a 
stepping stone, which I am persuaded is likely to be placed 
for your accomodation. I see clearly that H. Clay is likely 
to be the successful candidate. Harrison is out of the question. 
So is that very able man Webster. I think, Clay does not 
mean to advocate your bank as the national Bank. In fact, \ 
You are that Bank. When you quit it, you carry with you \ 
its Character. All the good it does, and great good it has \ 
done, is not given as credit to the Bank, but to Nicholas \ 
Biddle. It is all imputed righteousness to yourself, and when 
it is managed by other heads, it will be difficult to support J 
its present reputation. 

Why not take Woodbury s place under Clay? Then the 
national bank will be your Bank an appropriate field of

usefulness and reputation will be open to you you will 
have made a great step upwards and it will be your own 
fault, if you do not make the next step into the chair which 
you ought to occupy. 

Probably you and H. Clay may have come to an under 
standing about this; for I am not unaware that the oppor 
tunity has occured. Remember, I enter my 8o th year this 
month; &amp; I am talking of probabilities which cannot be 
realized till I am in the grave. In meantime, if any prelim 
inary movements before the public should be needed, com

may judge of the relation in which the Gov*. and the Bank 
stand when I tell you that a few minutes ago a gentleman 
left me having come directly from Washington charged with 
a communication from M r Poinsett. Among other things 
he said M r Poinsett took occasion to speak to Blair in the 
presence of M r Van Beuren, about the Bank; and that the 
President desired Blair not to attack the Bank or myself 
any more. M r . Poinsett himself moreover wrote an article 
for the Globe, explaining the late Circular issued by the 
Cover 1 ., directing the Officers to disburse the notes of the 
Bank. This article Blair was obliged to publish, adding some 
remarks of his own, just enough to save his own consistency. 
I will try to enclose the two articles. . . .

My dear Sir 

J have been wanting for some days past to go and talk 
with you; but I presume that I must pay the penalty of 
my notoriety by abstaining from being in Washington just 
now, and accordingly I write what I would much rather say. 
What I wanted to speak of was 

1. Texas. 

I mentioned when you were here, the intention of that 
Gov*. to withdraw its application for admission into the 
Union. That is now done, and it is very important that the 
President in his message should speak kindly and if possible 
cordially about that country, intimating that this with 
drawal does not abate any of our good feelings towards 
Texas, and that we wish her prosperity. One kind word might 
do her good ; and that word may now be hazzarded with 
out much risk, for I have reason to know that it will be re 
peated and approved by some of the most prominent leaders 
of the opposition. I wish therefore you would see that the 
message is kindly on that point. 

The other matter was 

2. That part of the message which relates to money. I do 
hope that he will not vamp this worn out foolery of M r Cal- 
houn, and say any more about the Sub Treasury. The coun 
try is disgusted with the subject, It cannot possibly do 
any good to the country, it will do great harm to M r Van 
Buren ; and if he will only say nothing about it we may 
get along very well; but if we are to have any more such

administration, if you do not permit these experiments to 
be continued.

The Message * has received its last touches before 
your letter of the 27 th reached my hands. I cannot therefore 
avail myself of your suggestions. But I must not suffer you 
to suppose I would have done so, had they been received 
in season. The times do not permit any specially favorable 
notice of Texas. You will find however nothing of unkind- 
ness in the simple statement of our relations with the Repub- 
lick. Admitting, what I do not believe, that you are entirely 
correct in the other topick the Sub-Treasury, as I know 
that M r V.B. s opinions have undergone no change I could 
not advise him to omit taking notice of the Subject in the 
message. Under present circumstances such pressure would 
betray a want of firmness &amp; consistency which no danger of 
consequences politically or personal should tempt any one 
to betray. . . .

I should incline to indulge it. But as you know travelling in 
Europe to a mere private gentleman is a dull business. If a 
man had a high public station &amp; a higher public fame, as you 
had, he gets along well, but a private gentleman delivering

called society has a task extremely repugnant to his pride. 
I am too old for that &amp; I am satisfied that the only way of 
being comfortable is to have some public character which 
at once settles your rank &amp; places you above the necessity 
of groping your way. Of these stations some are troublesome 
from the business to be done &amp; from the crowds of country 
men with whom one comes into contact : others give less rank 
but less labor. Now my object being to travel I would not be 
willing to remain in London or Paris or Petersburgh but I 
would prefer some position within striking distance of all the 
places on the continent, which would form the circle of 
travel and on the whole the place which seems best adapted 
for that purpose is Vienna. In regard to fitness, I have noth 
ing to say I began my career as Secretary in Paris &amp; after 
wards in London. I was to have been sent by Mr Madison as 
Minister to London at the close of the last war, &amp; was not 
sent because I was not a member of Congress the Far I

even of the design till some years afterwards, &amp; as I should 
be "able" &amp; able from my own private means to do all the 
external honors of a legation &amp; have already been at Vienna. 
I think I might be not a very bad successor * to the recent

no one need be removed and it is moreover ought of the

. . . The Sub Treasury bill cannot now be repealed 
too soon it is believed at Washington that the House will 
repeal it if the Senate will, and it is thought there that with 
the Penn: Senators a majority of the Senate will vote its 
repeal. Buchanan I understand has said that if he is in 
structed to repeal it he will resign. Your Legislature is Whig

is it not practicable to get them instructing your Senators. 
Such a movement would Come well &amp; with great power from 
your State. We could instruct M r Wright in our State but he 
does not give faith to the doctrine. It might not be amiss to 
get Mr Webster s views on the Subject. The Sub Treasury 
being out of the way The Bank must step in. 

BIDDLE TO DANIEL WEBSTER 

(confidential) Feby 2. 1841 

My dear Sir, 

I understand, tho at second hand, that a gentleman 
has arrived from Cin 1 who states that he heard the inaugural 
read and that it speaks of the necessity of a national 
Bank, &amp; almost recommends it. You may have heard this 
elsewhere but I mention it that you might be prepared to 
modify it if you think it should be modified. On the whole I 
should think the expediency of announcing that purpose so 
early was questionable. It does not seem to me necessary in 
the inaugural however it may do in the message to the 
new Congress and I should think it might rally at once the 
opposition on topics that might be turned to mischief against 
the new administration before it had time to strengthen itself. 

DANIEL WEBSTER TO BIDDLE 

Confidential Feb. 4. 41 

Dear Sir, 

Those of us who are here are quite united in opinion, 
that the Inaugural should be confined to principles, &amp; not 
go into measures; or [at] least, with one exception, &amp; that 
would be to suggest the necessity of early augmentation of 
naval means.

This steamer will take to you advices of an interest 
ing nature. The death * of our Venerable President though 
sincerely lamented will produce no material change in the 
policy of our new Administration. The Vice President his suc 
cessor is a Gentleman of great purity of mind and well calcu 
lated to assume the office and we shall probably see the meas 
ures originally proposed carried out with signal unanimity.

My dear sir, 

In my quiet seclusion I watch with great anxiety the 
progress of things at Washington and as lookers on at the 
game sometimes see a move which may escape the busy 
players, I venture to make a suggestion. It is prompted by 
an intense sensitiveness to the present state of the country 
by my desire to see your administration prosper and more 
especially by the instinctive wish to come to the aid of one 
[for] whom I have long entertained a sincere personal z regard 
at the moment when he is overcome by numbers. 

It is manifest that your opponents are striving to make 
you odious as an enemy to the interests protected by the 
Tariff 3 which you are ready to sacrifice in order to gratify

your personal dislike to M r Clay and M r Clay s favorite 
measure. 

Now if I understand your last veto You do not dislike 
the Tariff bill itself &amp; you would have signed it but for its 
connection with the Distribution clause. If this be so, you 
have a chance of striking one of those master strokes which 
decide instantly the fate of the campaigns. It is this : 

To send immediately a message to Congress, urging, in con 
sideration of the exhausted State of the Treasury a revenue bill 
exactly like that vetoed bill word for word, or as near as you 
can to it without saying anything about the Distribution 
clause. Look at the effect of it. If it succeeds, if your adver 
saries dare not vote against it it is your triumph your 
measure a popular measure for the country cares only 
for the Tariff &amp; comparatively little for the Distribution. 
But if it fails if your opponents vote against it, you will 
have done your duty. . . . 

JOHN TYLER TO BIDDLE 

Washington Aug 25 th 1842. 
Dear Sir, 

I thank you most sincerely for your letter of the 19 th . 
Before it reached me the House of Representatives as you 
have seen by the papers, had passed the Tariff Bill, which I 
had vetoed without the distribution clause. The Bill is now 
before the Senate, where it may undergo some amendments, 
in which event the probability is in favour of its passage. 
The suggestion you make had occurred to me, and I was 
strongly impelled to take the step, but upon informing myself 
with some degree of accuracy of the state of opinion which 
prevailed here, I abandoned it. A violent contest as I learned 



344 Correspondence of Nicholas Biddle 

had arisen between the tariffites and the distributionists, 
which fully manifested itself in the final voting in the House, 
so that the tariffites were driven to look to the democrats for 
aid, in order to enable them to carry through any measure. 
The democrats looked to some measure more moderate in 
its provisions than those of the bill, which I had returned to 
the House, and being really anxious to have a good, sound 
and permanent measure passed, I feared evil rather than 
good. ... I have therefore resolved to rest on my oft re 
peated recommendations to Congress, and leave it to assume 
all the responsibilities, growing out of and connected with 
that delicate but important question. . . .

My Dear Sir; 

I have not the least idea of going abroad, or of tak 
ing any appointment, whatever But I do not expect to 
remain where I am, more than a month This, inter nos. 

D.(ANIEL) W.(EBSTER) TO BIDDLE 

Strictly private &amp;f confidential Mar: 1 1. 43 

Dear Sir 

I may as well tell you, in the strictest confidence, the 
whole truth, respecting the state of things here. The Presi 
dent is still resolved to try the chances of an Election. This 
object enters into every thing, &amp; leads, &amp; will lead, to move 
ments in which I cannot concur. He is quite disposed to 
throw himself altogether into the arms of the loco foco party. 
This is just enough towards the Whigs but it is not just 
to himself, or his own fame &amp; character. He has altogether 
too high an opinion of the work which can be wrought by 
giving offices to hungry applicants. And he is surrounded by 
these, from morning to night. Every appointment, therefore, 
from the highest to the lowest, raises a question of political 
affects. This is terrible; especially in the Department where 
I am; &amp; I fear the interest of the Country, &amp; the dignity of 
the Gov*. may both suffer from it. Before the Whigs quar 
reled with the President, I had no reason to complain of any 
want of proper influence, in regard to appointments con 
nected with foreign affairs; altho the President had quite too 
many persons on hand to be provided for as charges . . . 
Since the formal abandonment of the President by the 



346 Correspondence of Nicholas Bid die 

Whigs, my position is entirely changed, as I can ask him for 
nothing. Between us, personally, there is entire good will; 
&amp; if his object now was only to get thro his present term with 
credits, we should agree, in every thing. But I am expecting, 
every day, measures, which I cannot stand by, &amp; face the 
Country. I must, therefore, leave my place. It seems inevi 
table. Who will take it; I know not; or what is to become of 
us all, I know not. I fear, a confused &amp; unsatisfactory scene 
is before us. When you have read this, burn it. 

BIDDLE TO JOHN TYLER 

Anda March 4, 1843 
My dear Sir, 

I wish to make a suggestion to you &amp; as in all cases 
the plainest course is the best, I proceed at once to my pur 
pose. How it may accord with your own views I do not know 
but your conduct in 1834 has given me a very strong feel 
ing towards yourself &amp; your administration, and it is as the 
friend of both that I speak. 

The subject most canvassed at present is the retirement 
of M r Webster a question of much importance to the 
country &amp; of great interest to yourself. Looking at it in 
both aspects, I have reached these conclusions 

I st as regard s the country 

I take it for granted that there is no fitter man for the 
place. 

This is settled by acclamation 

His successor must be his inferior 

Now his value lies in being precisely where he is. If he 
went to England he would be only a single minister now 
he is the instructor of all your ministers. Even in England 



70 John Tyler 347 

the strength of his name would be greater as Secretary of 
State giving your instructions to the resident minister in 
England, than if he were there in person while to all other 
foreign governments that strength would be lost. 

Then 

2. as regards himself, 

You could not find a successor who would be so valuable 
&amp; faithful an assistant to you. 

There is no man sufficiently] prominent to justify his selec 
tion who would not be liable to more personal and political 
objections, than he has. Yet he has now but shown them. He 
has run that gauntlet He is seasoned and is acknowl 
edged on all hands to do honor to your choice. Besides 
and this is the great matter for you personally he is the 
Secretary of State and nothing more. He has no political 
party, no body of political adherents. All these he has left for 
you. He has therefore no political aspirations. His strong 
hold on the country is that he can do the duties of the 
Department better than any one else and he will do it. 
He must work cordially with you without any cross pur 
poses or intrigues having no political objects of his own. I 
remember well how my old friend M r . Monroe was annoyed 
by having in his Cabinet three aspirants * for the Presi 
dency. 

I would therefore not let him go from the Department of 
State whether he wishes it or not. 

Yet after all, these may be the thoughts of a retired per 
son who is entirely wrong: for I do not sufficiently under 
stand the personal footing upon which you are &amp; which in

truth, must decide the question. But if there be no private 
reasons for your separation, all the public considerations are 
against it. 

Allow me to request that you will not answer this note. 
It is a subject easy for one to write about not easy for you 

and my purpose is merely to convey the very sincere senti 
ment of a friend without troubling you with an increase of 
correspondence. 1 

MEMORANDUM 2 OF BIDDLE TO DANIEL WEBSTER 

April 5, 1843 
You are going to resign that you think inevitable 

well 

But the matter of resignation is less important than the 
manner. 

In parting with the President the programme will of course 
be perfectly amiable. Nothing will be visible on either side 
but reciprocal good will and you are hereafter to be the 
object of a friendship much cemented by separation. That 
settled, the next question is what do you retire to? and by 
what route? 

You retire of course to absolute private life. Any thing 
else will be a fall obvious and incurable. 

Then by what route do you retire ? 

If you have any political engagement with any one of the 
candidates, I have no more to say you must of course 
abide his fortunes. 

But if you are entirely uncommitted the three roads of

retreat are open the route of Mr Tyler the route of the 
Loco Focos, the route of the Whigs. 

Now I take the route of Mr Tyler to be entirely impossible. 
The moment you leave him, you cease all political sympathy 
with his administration. 

The route of the Locofocos is equally impracticable. They 
will never leave their own leaders they will never move 
cordially under the banner of him against whom they have 
all their lives been fighting. 

There remains only the route of the Whigs. 

Now I have studied that part of the map with less judg 
ment of course but with more impartiality perhaps than you 
have done because your own sensitiveness has made you 
more alive to the conduct of that party. 

They have had jealousies and heart burnings with regard 
to you they have treated you unkindly &amp; unjustly. Cold 
ness there has been shyness, alienation, soreness at the 
injury done to them by your ceasing to act with them. But 
in my judgment there is no bitterness no wound not easily 
healed and the prevailing sentiment is rather regret &amp; sorrow 
than hostility. 

Believing therefore that you must fix yourself somewhere, 
that seems to be the best place. 

And I have imagined this course 

One of these days and soon before your motives are 
misinterpreted go to some public meeting not appar 
ently made for the purpose, and say 

Six months ago I told you in Fanueil Hall that I was a 
Whig unchangeably. I repeat it now you separated from 
me, not I from you because I staid in power. But I did not 
so, because I thought I could do good. I think I did do good 



350 Correspondence of Nicholas Bid die 

in making the English Treaty * and you agreed that I was 
right. 

Well, I thought by staying a little longer I could do more 
good. 

I told you so, and tried. 

But I find that I cannot do the good I proposed and 
therefore I would not remain in place a moment longer than 
I could serve the country. 

And so I have come back to you. 

I ask nothing I want nothing I take my stand in 
the ranks of the party willing to work with you, to support 
our measures, and our men. 

Such a step will be decisive it would be hailed with a 
shout throughout the country. 

It would make a brilliant retreat it would extricate you 
from your present awkward position and make your future 
path public &amp; private as smooth as you could desire. 

Think of this 

I offer it because I wish you to know my views before I 
know yours. 

If you have decided or shall decide otherwise I will bring 
myself to think it best, but now : 

this line of retreat both in a military &amp; civil aspect is the 
best in my judgment. 

You would think so too, if you studied the retreats of Lord 
Wellington in Spain. 

If possible, I would say nothing or what is equivalent to 
nothing at parting. 

The fear is that you may seem to approve too much of the 
past which is much to be avoided.

TO C. B. PENROSE l 

And 3 Apr. 24. 1843 
My dear Sir, 

Knowing how anxious you are [to] serve the country 
it strikes me that you might be useful now. 

I look with infinite regret at the prospect of a separation 
between M r Tyler &amp; M r Webster. I think M r Webster is not 
disinclined to stay if he were made to stay, &amp; he ought to be 
made to stay. I believe moreover that all the expectations 
ascribed I trust unjustly to M r Tyler of making the demo 
cratic party his party are wholly fallacious. No matter who 
thinks so such a belief will only mislead him. His patronage 
has not yet made him a single friend. No. He must take his 
own course make his own party of the best men of the 
country but not seek to win over any existing class of 
politicians. He has before him a noble career if he will make 
an administration of his own exclusively. But if M r W. goes 
away I think he will lose the chief strength &amp; the great orna 
ment of his administration. 

He spent 24 hours here last week &amp; r seeing unbroken 
vigor of his understanding I could not avoid feeling it a 
public misfortune that he should be withdrawn from the 
public counsels. 

Help to prevent it if you can. 2 

1 C. B. Penrose was appointed by President Harrison as Solicitor of the Treas 
ury, which office he held until the close of the Tyler Administration. He was

BIDDLE TO JOSEPH GALES 

Andalusia Jan y 9 1844 
My dear Sir 

When I had the pleasure of seeing you here we con 
versed about the benefit which might accrue to the Country 
from the union of M r Clay &amp; M r Webster &amp; their respective 
friends so as to ensure their triumphant election &amp; a strong 
&amp; cordial administration of public affairs I continue of 
the same mind I believe that the thing most desirable now 
would be the nomination of M r Clay for Pres t &amp; M r Webster 
for Vice Pres* &amp; this rather because it would shew both in 
this country &amp; in Europe the cordial union of these two 
American statesmen in whom the most confidence is placed 
in Europe than because of any adaptation of M r Webster 
for that Station which is one of mere pagent. 

Should however this union be impracticable, the next best 
thing in my judgment would be that M r Webster should be 
wholly unconnected with M r Clays administration, should 
not I mean be a member of his Cabinet there is not room 
enough for two such men in so small place. In that event his 
proper place is the Senate where he would I have no doubt 
go &amp; where he might occupy M r Choats place. 1 . . .

my present purpose as far as You are concerned is to avoid 
all seism between You &amp; M r Clay. I should for many reasons 
prefer in the first instance the union of the two names on the 
same ticket as an assurance both here &amp; in Europe of your 
cordiality. If any reason should dissuade from that, the next 
thing is for You to be unconnected with M r Clays adminis
