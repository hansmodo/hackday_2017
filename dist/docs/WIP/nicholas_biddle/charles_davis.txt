N. York 21 My <a href='/results.php?year=1830'>1830</a> 

My D'r Sir 

... I think it probable I may have mentioned to you 
that it was believ d here by many that Mr Van Buren had 
some agency in it, and the reasons assign d if not true are 
at least curious. This he look d upon the U.S. B. as a mass 
of power which might be employ d to bear on any point or ag t 
any point with no inconsiderable force and if a disposition 
sh d exist thus in directing its influence politically he as a 
political man (&amp; having had no agency either in its creation 
or thro its changes &amp; trials) naturally concluded it w d . be 
less likely to oppose old friends than to adopt new ones or 
strangers. Hence it was natural that he sh d not view it with 
a favorable political eye it might be perfectly harmless, or 
it might not and political men are not always satisfied 
with uncertainties. Like the old Gun it was safer out of reach 
&amp; harms way for tho it was said to have neither flint or pow 
der in it still it might go off. At this particular period the 
Safety fund system appear d and in theory had no doubt 
an honest, able aspect it was so far adopted by Mr Van 
Beuren then Gov r . of the State, 2 as to have been more easily

2 Van Buren s career as Governor of New York was very brief. He was in 
augurated January I, <a href='/results.php?year=1829'>1829</a>, but resigned March 12, to go into the Cabinet. "His 
inaugural message is said by Hammond to have been the best executive message 
ever communicated to the legislature." In this address he outlined the "safety 
fund" system which had been communicated to him by Joshua Forman. "Under 
this system all the Banks of the State, whatever their condition, were to contribute 
to a fund to be administered under state supervision, the fund to be a security for 
all dishonored bank notes. To this extent all the Banks were to insure or indorse 
the circulation of each bank, thus saving the scandal and loss arising from the oc-

made his almost exclusively if successful than it is now 
found to shake it .from him that it is suspected of being 
inapplicable in practice. Had it prov d successful and met 
with the general favor it was supposed to merit, "Van Buren 
Safety fund" w d . have been as clearly identified &amp; recogniz d 
as "Clinton &amp; Canal." And if approv d in one State w d . most 
likely have become general here then was a substitute at 
hand and "a safe channel for all Gov* purposes" sh d the 
U.S. Bank be dispens d with but it is likely to prove other 
wise and turns out among the moves of ill luck which 
sometimes are made by the most wise and prudent. These 
are among the leading reasons advanced by the knowing 
ones here touching Mr Van Buren and his agency in the 
Message, and if groundless, they are at least curious as 1 
before stated. 

I have a very high opinion * of Mr V. Buren. I believe him 
a safe and segacious man, or any way he has the reputation of 
being "mysterious" "dark" and "designing"; but un 
less I am entirely mistaken in my observations of him per 
sonally, I should say this impression is created for him more by 
a negative than a positive course of conduct politically, or 
rather by a peculiar and unusual system of Caution few 
men say less no man writes less on the passing political 

casional failure of Banks to redeem their notes, and making every Bank watchful 
of its associates. In compelling the Banks to submit to some general scheme the 
representatives of the people would, indeed, he said, enter into conflict with the 
claims of the great moneyed interests of the country; but what political exhibition 
so truly gratifying as the return to his constituents of the faithful public serv 
ant after having turned away every approach and put far from him every sinister 
consideration." Shephard, Edward M., Martin Van Buren (Boston, <a href='/results.php?year=1891'>1891</a>), pp. 
168-170. 

1 Biddle likewise held Van Buren in high regard and often reiterated his be 
lief that the latter was "neither the instigator nor the adviser of the President s 
remarks."

occurrences and whilst other great men are wasting their 
powers &amp; puzzling their wits to explain away or smoothen 
down the sharp corner of some printed or written opinions 
&amp; assertions which unfortunately may have outlived the oc 
casion and which may not harmonize with the changes of 
public sentiment He is fresh &amp; free from all charges ex 
cept the important one which friends as well as enemies are 
ready to lay at his door the charge of having effected 
all these changes in public sentiment no body can say 
how, when or where. He neither asserts or contradicts 
but if he has in reality no hand in thus acquiring political 
power few men know better how to keep what comes in 
possession. 

It is thro periods of political excitement that his system 
is more likely to succeed than in "calm successions," or in 
other words his capital accumulates faster at such periods, 
and if I were a politician or party man I d "back him" for a 
leader of my party "ag*. the field": but being neither I only 
indulge the liberty of sketching occasionally an outline 
roughly as in this instance of those who direct public affairs, 
aware at the same time that I can more correctly sketch the 
range of a market for Iron, Sugar or Coffee. I am in great 
truth &amp; with high esteem

My D r . Sir 

. . . The opinion rapidly obtains here that Pen a . will 
grant you a Charter if Congress declines acting in the mat 
ter and I dont believe one man in a thousand here identi 
fied with Trade but w d . rejoice in it and every time I am 
ask d about it my answer is that such will no doubt 

1 The movement for re-charter began in November of <a href='/results.php?year=1835'>1835</a>. In the early part 
of the month Nicholas Biddle began to receive letters from friends both within 
the state and in New York advising him to petition the next session of the Penn 
sylvania Legislature, composed, as it was, of "flexible material." Since New York 
seemed specially anxious for a charter, as the above letter indicates, the President 
used it to good advantage on the home Assembly.

occur provided the State could secure your services and name 
to preside over the Bank but I doubted if you w d . assent 
that from all I can gather, you intended to wind up the 
present institution and then devote yourself to higher 
pursuits than the Story of Banking. It does me good to worry 
the dogs on this point a few evenings since dining at the 
Mayors (where were present the delegation to the Legislature 
&amp; "other leaders of the party") I took occasion to reply thus 
to the Enquiry and as it was a "winder up" it seem d to 
me the "Chateau" tasted better to me afterwards.

My D r Sir 

... I have just return d from "up the Hudson" after 
a few days absence. I found all the folks up there sour &amp; sad the Banks contracting &amp; all suffering the doctrine of 
Message dont suit them at all &amp; as the crops are good &amp; 
prices declining I suspect the farmers by Nov. will begin to 
feel it too &amp; all the towns large &amp; small desire they sh d. 
Every thing is working for good or I am sadly mistaken. 
I Scarcely met a man of Mr .Van B. late party who does not 
blame him &amp; his " locd foco " 1 doctrines the horror the 
people have of the very name of loco foco is death to any 
mans hopes who hinges on them, they think in the Country 
" loco foco" means flour rioters &amp;c &amp;c they are not far out. 
The whole secrete of Mr . Van B. policy is to keep on the 
side of democracy &amp; when driven to extremities or compeld to 
Show his hand or take ground it is then he strikes so 
that none shall cut under him feeling that democracy is 
like a grass crop always springing up afresh &amp; in good time 
going to seed &amp; when it reaches this point it is calPd aristoc 
racy &amp; new crops follow but in boring his hold this time in 
the great "Barrel politic" he has evidently for the present 
bored too low &amp; will get dregs only but his system is simply 
this whilst others adopt measures that divide society per 
pendicularly he cuts horizontally &amp; always thus cuts that 
no one shall cut under him hence you may see him adopt 
any measure that is likely to win with great maxim &amp; rule. . . .

This steamer will take to you advices of an interest 
ing nature. The death * of our Venerable President though 
sincerely lamented will produce no material change in the 
policy of our new Administration. The Vice President his suc 
cessor is a Gentleman of great purity of mind and well calcu 
lated to assume the office and we shall probably see the meas 
ures originally proposed carried out with signal unanimity.
