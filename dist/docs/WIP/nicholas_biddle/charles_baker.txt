Harrisburgh Friday evening 

February 5 th <a href='/results.php?year=1836'>1836</a> 

Dear Sir 

Yesterday and to day has been spent in Skirmishing 
the troops being raw thay could not be brought to close 
action a counsel of war has been held and it has been 
resolved to force the matter to-morrow. Burden 3 is to lead 
on and I assure you he is in a happy state of mind to per 
form that service. Mr Penrose is now all confidence and in 
conjunction with D r Burden &amp; Mr Stevens is now engaged in 
arraigning every thing for to morrow. A test vote will be 
brought to beare upon the matter to-morrow and I think 
will evidence we are Strong, very strong, in the Senate 
success I consider certain. 

1 This letter refers to the chief difficulty encountered by the friends of the 
bill in the committee stage in the Senate. Senator Dickey stated his determination 
to have a branch in Beaver County. This the noble Senator declared was his 
sine qua non, as it was the only possible excuse he could offer his constituents for his 
vote. Mcllvaine acknowledged the justice of the Senator s contention, expecially as 
the latter threatened to vote against the bill and carry two votes with him. Biddle, 
in reply to a request for advice from his charge, stated that he was not opposed to a 
branch at Beaver, but to the naming of a branch anywhere which might lead to 
the naming of others. Still, if the Senator insisted upon it, Biddle was willing to 
agree and wrote the above letter to Mcllvaine. For a careful discussion of this sub 
ject, cf. Report of the Select Committee Relative to the United States Bank together with 
the Testimony taken in Relation thereto (Paterson, <a href='/results.php?year=1837'>1837</a>), p. 5. 

2 A Whig member later voted against the passage of the bill. A defense of his 
position is given in the Pennsylvanian, February 26, <a href='/results.php?year=1836'>1836</a>. 

* Representatives from the County of Philadelphia in the Senate.

Thursday evening Febry 8/38 

My Dear Sir 

This day has been one of no ordinary Character in 
Harrisburg. The Sub Treasury Resolutions were the orders of 
this day we forced it through Committee of the whole at 
the point of the Bayonet. The Van Buren men are in a State 
of excitement I never saw surpassed we have a vote of 49 
for 43 against, one of our Members Absent. It is impossible 
for them to bring all theire members into the House. If no 
screws gives way we shall have them through to morrow but 
it will be a hard contest. The Van Buren Men called the Yeas 
&amp; Nays on us 17 different times on the Vote to adjourne 
every man stood firm but we had to submit to an adjourn 
ment on acct of our friends it being nearly 1/2 past 3 
OClock. . . .

My dear Sir 

We are still in the field of Battle. This morning we expected to have carried our Resolutions but were disappointed 
by 3 of our men deserting to the enemy. I had examined every 
part and found all apparently safe. The danger Sprung upon 
us like a Tigers coming as it did from our own Ranks but 
it would not answer we contested the ground until I 
OClock when we moved to Adjourn the vote being 48 for 
48 against the Motion lost. We then Immediately renewed 
the Motion intending to continue until we succeeded our 
opponents then yielded us the field. All the Concentrated powers of Washington appear to be here and the operations 
of this day have perfectly dismayed them every thing was 
prepared by them to defeate us and they were certain of suc 
cess. I feel we are in danger but nothing like defeated it 
all turns upon the absent members and the disposition we 
shall be enabled to make of the 3 that deserted. I think we 
can get 2 at least back you may Rest assured I shall not 
give up the field as easily as Napoleon gave up Waterloo. 
The Banks are lost sight of but we consider on this (The 
Sub Treasury) depends greatly the Kind of bill we can get for 
our Banks. Our position is greatly strengthened by what we 
have all Ready done. We have broken assunder the majority 
in the House. We defeated without difficulty a proposition 
or amendment to Instruct our Senators to vote for the Sub 
Treasury. . . .

My Dear Sir 

The Resolutions are Slumbering in the Senate, the 
reason this one of our men thinking the Matter closed im 
mediately left for home we must now watch to avail our 
selves of the first Moment one of theire men is absent to get 
the last Resolution Stricken off. We have suffered much for 
want of a person in the house who fully understood all the 
trick of the trade the Slightest effort in the house would 
have defeated it had there been some one present to prompt 
to action three of our men again voted by mistake. It can 
pass any moment in the form it now is before the Senate. . . . 
please say if we can do no better must we pass the Resolu 
tions as thay are

Friday evening 

My dear Sir 

Your favor of the 15 th Ins 1 came duly to hand and I am 
truly happy that this days acts in the Senate will meet with 
your Kindest favour. This day I determined to pass the Reso 
lutions and made Known my wishes to D r Burden who accord 
ingly took the floor and called them up. The War Hoop was 
immediately raised but it would not do. D r Burden foiled 
them at every point and forced them through at the point of 
the Bayonet truly. The Resolutions are now on there way 
to Washington and to morrow we shall endeavour to pass an 
explanation of what we mean by the compliment to Martin 
Van Buren This is of course Humbug The explana 
tion will only pass as the views of the Senate. . . .

My dear Sir 

Your favor of yesterday came duly to hand. The 
Sub Treasury Resolutions will be disposed of to-morrow. 
Thay could have been carried today but Mr Johnson would 
not bring them up. The phil a Delegation having taken a stand 
against Stevens on the Improvement bill and the Improve 
ment bill being so intimately connected with Johnsons In 
terest he feels that he ought not to be treated by the Whigs 
as they have treated him because Stevens has been pleased 
to trifle with our Interests. . . .
