New York 7 t July 1829 

My Dear Sir 

Your favor of the 6th inst is before me. I have long 
been aware of the existance of the uneasiness which prevails in 
Portsmouth. I knew it would exist as long ago as when I was 
there last Summer and at the time the appointment was made 
and the Salary fixed any man that would do his duty under 
the Circumstances that exist, would be unpopular; but as the 
old saying is, "one man may Steal a Sheap while another 
dare not look over the fence." . . .
