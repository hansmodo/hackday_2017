Washington Deer 18. <a href='/results.php?year=1831'>1831</a> 

My Dear Sir 

The state of my health &amp; the severity of the weather 
have prevented me, since my arrival here, from being much 
abroad. Nevertheless, I have seen a great number of per 
sons, &amp; conversed with them, among other things, respecting 
the Bank. The result of all these conversations has been 
a strong confirmation of the opinion which I expressed at 
Philadelphia that it is expedient for the Bank to apply for 
the renewal of its Charter without delay. I do not meet a 
Gentleman, hardly, of another opinion; &amp; the little incidents 
&amp; anecdotes, that occur &amp; circulate among us, all tend to 
strengthen the impression. Indeed, I am now a good deal 
inclined to think, that after Gen 1 Jackson s re-election there would be a poor chance for the Bank. I am well informed, 
that within three days, he has in conversation with several Gentlemen, reiterated his old opinions, somewhat vociferously, &amp; declared them unchangeable. 

I have thought, My Dear Sir, the best advice I could give you, is, that you come down here, yourself, &amp; survey the 
ground. You will have access to men of all parties, &amp; can digest your information, compare opinions, &amp; judge discreetly 
upon the whole matter. In my judgment, this is your true course, &amp; ought to be immediately followed. 

I am, Dear Sir, always faithfully

My Dear Sir, 

Mr Biddle left on yesterday. I feel it to be a duty to express to those particularly interested in the Bank, my 
sense of the great benefit which has been derived from his presence and attention here. We should have done but badly 
without him. His address &amp; ability, in satisfying the doubftt 
of friends, softening the opposition of enemies, &amp; explaining whatever needed explanation, have been important cause in producing the result, which has, so far, attended the Bill. I can assure you, that this is not only my opinion, but that 
of others, also, the most competent observers &amp; judges. At dinner, yesterday, where gentlemen were speaking of the 
subject, a very distinguished person observed, "that it was 
only once in a century that a man was to be found so eminently fitted to be the head of such an Institution as Mr B." 
... I am, Dear Sir, with very true regard.

Dear Sir, 

I write this letter, as a private one, &amp; for the purpose 
of inquiring whether the course for the adoption of the Bank 
is yet settled. The removal of the Deposites is a question of great interest to the Government, &amp; as such will doubtless attract the attention of Congress. It is, also, a matter of moment to the Bank, as one part of their Charter. In this point of 
view, it becomes a question whether the Bank should not lay the transaction of removing the Deposites, before Congress. 
This, I have no doubt, you have already considered.

Sir 

Since I have arrived here, I have had an application to be concerned, professionally, against the Bank, which I have 
declined, of course, although I believe my retainer has not been renewed, or refreshed as usual. If it be wished that my 
relation to the Bank should be continued, it may be well to send me the usual retainers.

My Dear Sir 

It appears to me that our political affairs are taking a very decided turn, &amp; that if nothing be done to check the current, Mr V.B. will be elected President, by a vast majority. It is entirely obvious, I think, that the movement of the Southern Whigs * (as they call themselves) in Mr White s favor 
has disgusted, deeply, the whole body of our friends in the North. Such papers as the Richmond Whig &amp; Telegraph have 
endeavored to persuade the People that the question is narrowed down to a choice between Judge White &amp; Mr. V. Buren, &amp; if this be the only issue presented, there is already 
abundant indication that the whole north, east, &amp; middle too, as I believe, will go for V.B. I do not know whether any thing 
can be done to change the course of things; but I am fully persuaded, that if any thing can be done, it is be done in 
Penn a . Your people are awake to political subjects, in consequence of the pendency of an election for Gov r . If those who 
are likely to unite in support of Mr Ritner could unite also in making some demonstration, on National Subjects, &amp; do 
it immediately, it might possibly have some effect. Whether this be practicable is more than I know. 

I have thought it right, My Dear Sir, to express to you 
my opinion, thus freely, on the present State, &amp; apparent tendency, of things. Our friends here receive letters, every day, 
&amp; from P a . as well as from other quarters, calling on them to do more, &amp; say more. But they hardly see what more they 
can do, or say. The sentiment of Massachusetts is known; &amp; it would seem to be for the consideration of others, whether it should be seconded. 

You will of course, burn this, 1 &amp; let no eye but your own see it. You can judge whether any thing can be usefully done. 
For my part, I confess, it looks to me as if the whole Whig Strength in the Country was either to be frittered away, or 
melt into the support of Mr V. Buren.

D r Sir 

One word more on political subjects. It seems truly lamentable that the Nat. Intelligencer should be so unwilling 
to give, or take, tone, on questions most interesting to us, as a party. Cannot this reluctance be overcome? If Mess" 
G. &amp; S. are not disposed to support, at present, any named candidate, they might, at least, preach the necessity of sup 
porting a Whig Candidate some Whig Candidate. We are 
in danger of breaking up, &amp; dividing. Our natural field marshall he that should rally &amp; encourage us, is the leading 
paper on our side. But this natural leader seems at present to be without any "objects, and, aim." 

I mention this matter to you, because you can judge, as well as any one, whether the subject deems any attention; 
&amp; if it do, can, better than any one, give an availing hints, in the right quarter, burn.

Dear Sir 

. . . The Sub Treasury bill remains in status quo. Calhoun is moving heaven, earth, &amp; to obtain Southern votes 
for the measure. He labors to convince his Southern neighbors that its success will relieve them from their commercial 
dependence on the North. His plausibility, &amp; endless perserverance, have really effected a good deal. Even your relative 
Mr. C. Sheppard has been, &amp; indeed now is, in a state of doubt. Still, I think the Bill cannot pass; but the majority 
will be Small. The labors of Mr Calhoun, &amp; the power &amp; patronage of the Executive, have accomplished more than,? 
I have thought possible.

Boston Sept r io th <a href='/results.php?year=1838'>1838</a> 

My Dear Sir 

I have rec d . your favor of the 8 th instant. The decision of the Gov* of Texas, to withdraw its application for a union 
with the U. States, is, in my judgment, an event, eminently 
favorable, to both countries. She now stands, as an independant state, looking to her own power, &amp; her own resources, to 
maintain her place among the nations of the earth, an attitude, vastly more respectable, than that which she held, while 
solicitous to her own political character, &amp; to become part of a neighbouring country. Seeking, thus, no longer a union 
with us, &amp; assuming the ground of entire independence I think it highly important to the interests of the U. States, 
that Texas should be found able to maintain her position. Any connexion with a European State, so close as to make 
her dependent on that State, or to identify her interests with 
the interests of such State, I should regard as greatly unfortunate for us. I could not but regret, exceedingly, to see any 
union between those parts of our continent, which have broken the chain of European dependence &amp; the Governments of Europe; whether those, from which they have been disunited, or others. You Remember the strong opinion, ex 
pressed by Mr . Monroe that the U.S. could not consent to the recolonization of those portions of this Continent, which 
had severed the ties, binding them to a European connexion, &amp; formed free &amp; independent Governments for themselves; or 
to the establishment of other European Colonies, in America The spirit, &amp; reason, of these sentiments, would lead us to 
regard with just fear, &amp; therefore with just jealousy, any connexions, between our near American neighbours, &amp; the powerful states of Europe, except those of friendly &amp; useful commercial intercourse. It is easy to forsee the evils with which
any other connexion, than that last mentioned, between Texas &amp; one of the great sovereignties of Europe, might 
threaten us. Not to avert to those of a high &amp; political character, one, likely to have a direct bearing on our commerce, a 
connexion on the great staple of our southern production. Texas is destined, doubtless, to be a great cotton producing 
country, &amp; which we should cheerfully concede to her all the advantages which her soil &amp; climate afford to her, in sustaining a competition with ourselves, we could not behold, with indifference, a surrender, by her, of her substantial in 
dependence, for the purchase of exclusive favors &amp; privileges, from the hands of a European Government. 

The competency of Texas to maintain her Independence depends, I think, altogether on the character of her Gov*. &amp; 
its administration. I have no belief, at all, in the power of Mexico to re-subjugate Texas, if the latter country shall be 
well governed. The same consideration decides, also, the question, whether a loan to Texas would be safe. I have supposed, 
that her new formed Gov 1 was gradually strengthening, &amp; 
improving, in all the qualities requisite for the respectable 
exercise of National power. That in institutions so recent, 
there should be, for a time, some irregularity of action, is to 
be expected. But if those to whose hands her destinies are 
now committed, shall look steadily to two great objects, 
first, real &amp; absolute, as well as nominal, National Independence, &amp; second, the maintenance of a free &amp; efficient Gov*., 
of which good faith shall, from the beginning, be a marked characteristic, I see nothing to render it less safe to regulate 
money transactions with her, than with the Gov ts . of other 
countries. On the other hand, if a spirit of speculation &amp; 
project should appear to actuate her councils, &amp; if she should 
trifle with her public domain, involve herself in contradictory obligations, or seek to establish her prosperity on any 
other foundations, than those of justice &amp; good faith, there 
would, then, be little to be hoped, either in regard to punctuality in pecuniary engagements or to the probability of her 
maintaining an independent National character. 

My opinion, on the whole, is, that the prospects of Texas are now far better &amp; brighter than they have ever been be 
fore; that the interests of our own country require, that she 
should keep herself free from all particular European connexion; &amp; that whatever aid can be furnished to her, by individuals, or corporations, in theU. States, in the present state of her affairs, to enable her to maintain a truly independent 
&amp; national character, would tend to promote the welfare of the U States, as well as of Texas herself.

My Dear Sir 

I duly rec d your letter, on a certain subject, &amp; have that subject "in all my thoughts." Nob y could be better 
for the Country &amp; nothn would be more agreeable to me, than what you suggested. The difficulty will be with the 
Tobacco men. These Gentlemen got up the Austrian mission, some years ago, &amp; expected a Marylander or a Virginian to 
fill it. Mr V. Buren disappointed that expectation, &amp; appointed 
Mr. Muhlenberg, because he could talk German so well. Mr M. having returned, a new rally has been making, &amp; two or 
three Tobacco raising candidates are in the field already ____

Dear Sir, 

Those of us who are here are quite united in opinion, that the Inaugural should be confined to principles, &amp; not 
go into measures; or [at] least, with one exception, &amp; that would be to suggest the necessity of early augmentation of naval means.

My Dear Sir 

I cannot but think you have done exactly right. What ever may be the result, it seems to me the path of duty is 
plain. In my opinion, a failure, this session, if there should be one, will not at all diminish the chances of success, next session. 
I suppose the memorial will make its appearance, in the 
Senate, thro the V.P. My notion will be to let the administration Gentlemen take the Disposition of it, for the present, &amp; see what they will do with it.

Strictly private &amp;f confidential Mar: 1 1. 43 

Dear Sir 

I may as well tell you, in the strictest confidence, the 
whole truth, respecting the state of things here. The President is still resolved to try the chances of an Election. This 
object enters into every thing, &amp; leads, &amp; will lead, to movements in which I cannot concur. He is quite disposed to 
throw himself altogether into the arms of the loco foco party. 
This is just enough towards the Whigs but it is not just 
to himself, or his own fame &amp; character. He has altogether 
too high an opinion of the work which can be wrought by 
giving offices to hungry applicants. And he is surrounded by 
these, from morning to night. Every appointment, therefore, 
from the highest to the lowest, raises a question of political 
affects. This is terrible; especially in the Department where 
I am; &amp; I fear the interest of the Country, &amp; the dignity of 
the Gov*. may both suffer from it. Before the Whigs quarreled with the President, I had no reason to complain of any 
want of proper influence, in regard to appointments connected with foreign affairs; altho the President had quite too 
many persons on hand to be provided for as charges . . . 
Since the formal abandonment of the President by the Whigs, my position is entirely changed, as I can ask him for 
nothing. Between us, personally, there is entire good will; 
&amp; if his object now was only to get thro his present term with 
credits, we should agree, in every thing. But I am expecting, 
every day, measures, which I cannot stand by, &amp; face the 
Country. I must, therefore, leave my place. It seems inevitable. Who will take it; I know not; or what is to become of 
us all, I know not. I fear, a confused &amp; unsatisfactory scene is before us. When you have read this, burn it.
