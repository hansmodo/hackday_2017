(Private) Wash'n. 28th. May <a href='/results.php?year=1828'>1828</a> 
</p><p>
My dear Sir 
</p><p>
You may have observed in the Telegraph of the 20th inst. an article, taken from a K. paper, in which a formidable 
array of my mortgages and debts is made with a view of making me out a bankrupt. Among the mortgages are two, one to 
the Bank of the U.S. to secure payment of $22,000, and the other to J. Harper Cash r . &amp;c to secure payment of $1666.66. 
</p><p>
The latter is wholly discharged. Of the former debt all is paid but about $4000 to meet which there is deposited with 
the Lexington office paper payable to me, and which becomes due this fall. I have every reason to anticipate its punctual 
payment, and thus the entire extinction of the mortgage. The 
truth is that my private affairs, materially affected by a responsibility I incurred about ten years ago, as indorcer, have 
been in a state of progressive improvement since, and now stand better than they have done during any portion of that 
time. They are such that, if I were to die tomorrow, my resources are abundant to meet all my engagements, and to leave my family comfortable. 
</p><p>
I have thought it might be benefitial to me if you would cause a paragraph to be unveiled, in some paper in your 
City, making concisely the above statement in regard to the two mortgages, or simply saying that a small balance only 
is due on the large mortgage which paper is in deposit to meet this fall, and that the small one is discharged. It would 
be no more than an act of justice to add that, in all my relations with the bank, I have practised the greatest fidelity to 
my engagements; and that whilst most of your Western debtors have been allowed to pay off their debts in property, 
no such easement was ever extended or asked by me. I presume the returns from the office at Lexington are such 
as to admit of the insertion of such a paragraph which might be signed by yourself or Mr. M'llvaine, 1 or be published as upon the authority of the Bank, without any signature. 
</p><p>
I do not owe any bank in existence a cent, except the small balance due to the Lex'n. office. Instead of being indebted to 
the Bank of K. (which is one of my enumerated creditors) 
subsequent to the date and after the payment of my mortgage to that institution, it became indebted to me to the 
amount of $10000 for which I actually sued it. 
</p><p>
I hope you will excuse the trouble I give you, and believe me, with great respect,

Dear Sir 
</p><p>
. . . Unless I am deceived by information, received from one of the most intelligent Citizens of Virginia, the 
plan was laid at Richmond during a visit made to that place by the Secy, of State last autumn, to make the destruction 
of the Bank the basis of the next Presidential Election. The message of the President, and other indications, are the supposed consequences of that plan.

(confidential) Ashland nth. Sept. <a href='/results.php?year=1830'>1830</a> 
</p><p>
Dear Sir 
</p><p>
Major Tilford having mentioned to me that you 
were considering whether it was proper to apply, at the ensuing Session of Congress, for a renewal of the charter of the 
B.U.S. and that you entertained some doubts on the subject, I had a conversation with him and Mr. Harper, 1 which I in 
formed them that they were at liberty to communicate to you. I added that, perhaps, I might address a letter to you on 
the same matter. A leisure hour allows me to fulfill that intention. 
</p><p>
It may be assumed, as indisputable, that the renewal of the charter can never take place, as the Constitution now 
stands, against the opinion and wishes of the President of the U.S. for the time being. A bill, which should be rejected by 
him for that purpose, could never be subsequently passed by the constitutional majority. There would always be found 
a sufficient number to defeat such a bill, after its return with the President objection, among those who are opposed to 
the Bank on constitutional grounds, those who, without be 
ing influenced by constitutional considerations, might be opposed to it upon the score of expediency, and those who would 
be operated upon by the influence of the Executive. 
</p><p>
I think it may even be assumed that a bill to renew the Charter cannot be carried through Congress, at any time, 
with a neutral executive. To ensure its passage, the Presidents opinions and those of at least a majority of his Cabinet must 
be known to be in favor of the renewal. 
</p><p>
President Jackson, if I understand the paragraph of his 
message at the opening of the last Session of Congress, relating to the Bank, is opposed to it upon Constitutional objections. Other sources of information corroborate that fact. If he should act upon that opinion, and reject a bill, presented 
for his aprobation, it would be impossible to get it through Congress at the next Session against the Veto. 
</p><p>
That a strong party, headed by Mr. V. Buren, some Virginia politicians and the Richmond Enquirer, intend, if practicable to make the Bank question the basis of the next Presidential election, I have, I believe, heretofore informed you. 
I now entertain no doubt of that purpose. I have seen many evidences of it. The Editors of certain papers have received 
their orders to that effect, and embrace every occasion to act in conformity with them. This fact cannot have escaped your observation.
</p><p>
If you apply at the next Session of Congress, you will play into the hands of that party. They will most probably, in the 
event of such application, postpone the question, until an other Congress is elected. They will urge the long time that 
the Charter has yet to run; that therefore there is no necessity to act at the next Session on the measure; and that public 
sentiment ought to be allowed to develope itself &amp;c. These 
and other considerations will induce Congress, always disposed to procrastinate, to put off the question. In the mean 
time, the public press will be put in motion, every prejudice excited and appeals made to every passion. The question will incorporate Itself with all our elections, and especially with that as to which there is so great a desire that it should be incorporated. It will be difficult, when Congress comes finally to 
decide the question, to obtain a majority against the accumulation of topics of opposition. 
</p><p>
But suppose, at the next Session, on the contingency of your application for a renewal of the Charter, instead of postponing, Congress was to pass a bill for that object, and it 
should be presented to the President, what would he do with it? If, as I suppose, he would reject it, the question would 
be immediately, in consequence, referred to the people, and would inevitably mix itself with all our elections. It would 
probably become, after the next Session, and up to the time of the next Presidential election, the controlling question in 
American politics. The friends of the Bank would have to argue the question before the public against the official act of 
the President, and against the weight of his popularity. 
</p><p>
You would say what ought the Corporation to do? I stated to the above gentleman that, in my opinion, unless you had 
a satisfactory assurance that your application at the next Session would be successful, you had better not make it. If, 
contrary to my impressions, you could receive such an assurance from both departments of the Government, who would 
have to act on the case, that would present a different state of the question, and would justify the presentation of your petition. 
</p><p>
If not made at the next Session, when should it be made? 
I think the Session immediately after the next Presidential 
election would be the most proper time. Then every thing will 
be fresh; the succeeding P. election will be too remote to be 
shaping measure in reference to it; and there will be a disposition to afford the new administration the facilities in our fiscal 
affairs which the B. of the U.S. perhaps alone can render. 
But suppose Gen'l Jackson should be again elected? If that 
should be the case, he will have probably less disposition than 
he now has to avail himself of any prejudices against the 
Bank. He will then have also less influence; for it may be 
loosely asserted, at least as a general rule, that the President 
will have less popularity in his second than in his first term. 
And that I believe would emphatically be the fate of the present President. At all events, you will be in a better condition 
by abstaining from applying to renew the charter during his 
first term, than you would be in, if you were to make the application and it should be rejected. Upon the supposition of 
such a rejection, and that the question should be afterwards 
blended with the Presidential contest, and Gen'l Jackson 
should be elected, his re-election would amount to something 
like a popular ratification of the previous rejection of the 
renewal of the charter of the Bank. Indeed, if there be an 
union of the Presidents negative of the Bank bill with the 
next P. election, and he should be reelected, would it not be 
regarded as decisive against any Bank of the U.S. hereafter? 
</p><p>
My opinion, upon the whole, then is, that it would be unwise to go to Congress without something like a positive assurance of success at the next Session; and that the Corporation, 
without displaying any solicitude in regard to the continuation of its charter, had better preserve, in the able and faithful administration of its affairs, which it has of late years manifested, and go to Congress at the first moments of calm 
which shall succeed the approaching Presidential storm. 
</p><p>
I hope I need say nothing, by way of apology, to satisfy 
you of the friendly feelings which have prompted this letter; 
nor to impress you with the propriety of receiving it in the confidence with which it is written. I add assurances of the constant and cordial regard of

Washington 15th December <a href='/results.php?year=1831'>1831</a>. 
</p><p>
My dear Sir 
</p><p>
. . . Have you come to any decision about an application to Congress at this Session for the renewal of your 
Charter? The friends of the Bank here, with whom I have conversed, seem to expect the application to be made. The 
course of the President, in the event of the passage of a bill, seems to be a matter of doubt and speculation. My own be 
lief is that, if now called upon he would not negative the bill, 
but that if he should be re-elected the event might and probably would be different.

Ashland 10th April <a href='/results.php?year=1833'>1833</a> 
</p><p>
My Dear Sir 
</p><p>
I have received your favor of the 25th ult. and perused 
its interesting contents with much satisfaction. Your friendly 
solicitude to prevent any estrangement between Mr. W. and myself adds another to the many previous obligations 
under which you had placed me. I concur entirely with you 
in thinking that, on every account, such a change in the 
amicable relations between that gentleman and myself would 
be very unfortunate. 
</p><p>
After the introduction of the Compromise bill, it was manifest at Washington that a few of the Eastern friends of Mr. 
W., supposing that I had taken a step that would destroy me in the public estimation, indulged hopes that a new party 
would be formed, of which he might be the sole head. I thought that Mr. W. himself made an unprovoked and unnecessary 
allusion to me when, in describing the struggles of Mr. Calhoun in a Bog, he stated that no friend could come to his 
relief without sharing in his embarrassment. Even the female part of the audience understood to whom the allusion was 
directed. I need not say to you that I felt myself under no sort of obligation to Mr. Calhoun himself or to the State from 
which he came; that I had experienced nothing but unkindness from both ; and that I have come under no engagement 
whatever with him in regard to the future. If S Carolina had stood alone, or if she could have been kept separated 
from the riot of the South in the contest which I apprehended to be impending, I should not have presented the measure which I did. 
</p><p>
On a subsequent occasion Mr. W. imputed to me, in a manner I thought unfriendly, an abandonment of the Protective 
policy. To that suggestion an immediate reply was made. And deavored to change Webster's opinion on the subject; and that while Webster was 
visiting in Philadelphia he had prevented the Senator's friends from giving a 
public dinner for fear it might " furnish an occasion for his less discreet friends to 
do and say things inexcusable at a moment of excitement." Webster left the city 
"in a frame of mind entirely satisfactory." 
</p><p>

to his chief attack upon the bill itself a prompt answer was 
given, which you had seen in the public prints. Whatever 
momentary feelings were excited, during the progress of the 
measure, I assure you after it was carried that they entirely 
ceased ; and all my sentiments of attachment to Mr. W. returned in their undiminished strength. I took several occasions to evince to him this state of my heart; and I was happy 
to believe that it was fully reciprocated by him. I assure you 
that on my part these feelings shall be constantly cherished. 
</p><p>
You will have heard from him or others that the Compromise was not offered until after the fullest and freest conferences with him and others. Two distinct meetings at my 
quarters of'nor 12 Senators (at the first of which he at 
tended, and to the last he was summoned) took place, in 
which it was fully discussed and considered. At the last I 
interrogated each Senator individually, and I understood 
every one to agree substantially to the bill (for I had pre 
pared a bill) except one, who finally voted for it. Several of 
those who had, as I supposed, assented to it voted against it. 
</p><p>
I do not now think that the course of Mr. W. and other 
gentlemen from the East and North who voted with him, is to 
be regretted certainly not, if the difference of opinion should 
produce, and it ought to produce, no alienation between 
friends. Many of them I know so voted, from considerations 
of policy, rather than from any positive objections to the bill. 
And the course which they pursued will probably tend to reconcile the South more strongly to a measure, in which it has 
got a nominal triumph, whilst all the substantial advantages have been secured to the Tariff States. . . .

My dear Sir 
</p><p>
... If the state of public opinion at Phila'd. should be such as to favor the operation, it would be well to have a 
general meeting of the people to memorialize Congress in favor of a restoration of the deposites. Such an example might 
be followed elsewhere; and it would be more influential as it might be more general. 
</p><p>
If the local Banks could be induced to concur in such a movement so much the better. 
</p><p>
I think it would be expedient to obtain, at the general 
meeting of the Stockholders in Jan. an expression of their approbation of the conduct of the Board, and particularly of 
the expenditure which has been made in defending the Bank ag l . unfounded attacks.

My dear Sir

. . . My opinion is that no movement should yet be made towards a renewal of the Charter, or the establishment 
of a New Bank. The Bank ought to be kept in the rear; the usurpation in the front. If we take up the Bank, we play into 
the adversary's hands. We realize his assertions that the only question is a renewal of the Charter. It is the usurpation 
which has convulsed the Country. If we put it by and take up the Bank, we may &amp; probably would divide about the 
terms of the charter, and finally do nothing leaving things as they are. In the other course, the recharter will follow. The Country will take care of that.

I have this moment rec'd your letter, and rejoice at the movement which it states to be in contemplation. Buchanan told me that he would obey instructions. I hope they will come. They may [be] decisive of the fate of the atrocious measure.

I received your favor of the 4th . &amp; met Mr. B. last night at a small party given at the house at which I board. 
I rallied him on the subject of instructions, &amp; he remarked to me, as he had done once or twice before, that if they came, he 
would obey or resign, intimating, I thought, a preference for the latter alternative. 
</p><p>
We are now in the midst of the debate on the Treasury Bank, the denomination which should be given to it upon 
every occasion. Rives began a very good speech, yesterday, which he will finish to-day. I do not know that an occasion 
will present itself, but if it does, I will embrace it, to draw from Mr. B. a more explicit declaration. We will run them 
to the girt in the Senate. If they carry their abominable measure, it will not be by a majority of more than two votes.

I am worked almost to death, &amp; to relieve myself, I have to engage the good offices of a young friend as an amanuensis.

</p><p>
My Dear Sir 
</p><p>
I have rec'd your favor of the 18th . The Resolutions from Harrisburg have produced the effect of securing another vote in that of Mr. Buchanan ag't. the Gov't Bank. He 
presented them yesterday morning and gave in his adhesion before I reached the Senate, from which I was detained half 
an hour, in consequence of a Speech which I had to deliver, and did deliver, against that measure. It was wise in your 
Senate to pass the resolutions as they went from the House, notwithstanding the two exceptionable paragraphs. The good 
in them more than counter balanced the bad, as the event has already proved. We now probably stand 26 against 26. One 
more vote would defeat the vile measure. We have a prospect of getting that by an instruction from Richmond to Mr. Roane 
but it is not certain. If it comes, he will obey it. Could it not 
be obtained from Trenton? Why could not a positive instruction (the Gen'l Assembly instructs its Senators &amp; requests its 
Representatives &amp;c) emanate from that quarter? It would, I believe, decide Mr. Wall. I think he would obey. And as 
he acknowledged such an obligation, it might be given with out justly wounding the sensibility of Mr. Southard. . . .

My Dear Sir

I rec'd your favor of the 28th inst. You will have seen that the resolution, which had passed the Senate, rescinding 
the Specie Circular, 1 has also passed the House this morning in less than three hours after it was rec d by a majority of more than five to one! 
</p><p>
I sincerely hope that the condition of your Bank is such as to admit of your seizing this occurrence to make an early resumption. I am extremely anxious on your account as well as that of the public that your Bank shall continue to maintain its high character. 
</p><p>
You will have seen and you will comprehend the object and &gt; the benefits of the movement I made, in respect to a Bank of 
the U.S. It will turn public attention to the subject in the abstract. It will suspend or render harmless malignant at 
tacks on your Bank. And it may even reconcile the public ultimately to the grant of a National Charter to your Bank. 
I should be satisfied with either. 
</p><p>
Altho I did not think it right to allude to our conversation on the few remarks I addressed to the Senate, I have to several friends said that Mr. Biddle elevated patriotism made him look above the interests of the particular institution with which he is charged to the welfare of his Country.

Ashland 14th Sept. <a href='/results.php?year=1838'>1838</a> 
</p><p>
My Dear Sir 
</p><p>
I received this morning your favor of the 7th instant communicating several inquiries, respecting Texas, on which 
you are desirous to obtain my opinion. This I have not the least objection to express; but without a strong necessity I 
should not wish it to be published. And my aversion to its publication arises solely out of the consideration that, at 
this time, I desire voluntarily to appear in the public prints 
as little as possible, lest I should be thought to be endeavoring to conciliate public support. 
</p><p>
I am glad to learn from you that the Minister from Texas intends to withdraw the application from Texas to be incorporated in our Union. It is a wise step; for it is perfectly manifest that, whether it is expedient or not to annex it to the U. 
States, the public mind in this Country is not in a temper to sanction such a measure, at this period. The longer agitation 
of the question can do no possible good to our party, whilst it has a positively injurious tendency upon the domestic interests and relations of the other. If the question were to be prolonged, and a foreign attack, other than from Mexico, should 
be made on Texas, I think that a majority of the American Congress could not be got to succor Texas in warding off 
such an attack. Whereas, if the project of annexation be abandoned, and any European power were to attack the 
independence of the new Republic, I think it would be the inclination, as I am sure it would be the interest and the duty 
of the U.S. to prevent the success of the attack. 
</p><p>
Whether Texas will be able to maintain the Independence which she has declared, or not, I have no means of judging 
which you do not possess, perhaps not so many. I am inclined to believe that she will, if the Government is administered 
with reasonable ability. Time is everything to Texas, whilst delay is ruinous to the Mexican reconquest. The French 
Blocade operates most advantageously to Texas, by rendering her secure against attacks from the Gulph, which I 
have always thought her most vulnerable side. She ought to wish that this Blocade may be long continued. In the mean 
time emigrants are pouring into Texas, and daily adding strength to her. I do not see how Mexico, torn as she is by 
factions, with her finances totally disordered, no efficient army nor commanders, and no good materials for an army to be 
sent on a distant conquest, can subjugate the revolted province. If France were out of the way, and Mexico had and could 
keep the preponderance at Sea, Texas might be in danger. 
</p><p>
If Texas is to be an independent power, it is the obvious 
interest of the U.S. to cultivate her friendship, as their nearest neighbour, in that quarter; and it is consequently their 
interest that Texas should/^/ that she has been well treated by them. Hitherto she has had no just cause to complain of the U.S. whatever they may have given to any other power. 
This feeling of friendship towards the U.S. on the part of Texas, for one, I should be happy to see strengthened, by all 
the good offices that can be rendered, consistently with our neutrality. The loan, which she wishes to negociate, and 
which you are inclined to make, may unquestionably be effected, without any violation of any Neutral duty by which 
the people of this Country stand bound. Of course, I give no opinion as to terms, or the security which may be offered 
for its reimbursement. Assuming them to be satisfactory to the parties, I think it, in every respect, highly desirable that 
Texas should contract an obligation for the loan in this Country, and not in any European State. 
</p><p>
I do not believe that the U.S. will or ought to interfere, so as to become a party to the contest, whilst it is confined to 
Mexico and Texas. But if any European power, and especially if G. Britain or France, were to attempt the conquest 
of Texas, or to aid Mexico in reconquering it, in my opinion the U.S. could not regard any such attempt with indifference. 
</p><p>
I have thus, my dear sir, frankly expressed my opinions. 
I shall be happy if you should be able to derive any assistance from them; but for the reason already stated, to which 
I should add that I send the first draft of my reply, without correction, and without retaining any copy, I do not wish 
publicity given to them without an urgent reason.
