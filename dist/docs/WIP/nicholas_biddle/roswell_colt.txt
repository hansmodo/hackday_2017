Dear Biddle 

I send You a Letter I have rec d from Barney on the subject of Barbours resolution to day a Member called on 
me to whom I had written about it. he said that Cale Drayton, &amp; Mr McDuffie both assured him the moment Barbour 
returned they would have it called up &amp; finally disposed of. Mr Sargent who has gone to Harrisburg requested to have it 
suspended until his return, but that since the Public mind was so agitated they should not wait but act on it at once &amp; 
probably its fate would be decided to day.

Dear Biddle 

I saw a friend in New York who is intimate with Cambreleng &amp; speaking about the Presidents message, he 
told me that three months ago Cambreleng advised him to 
sell out his Bank Shares for that the Administration were hostile to the Bank that the Bank had not meet the public 
estimation, by producing an uniform currency &amp; that its 
charter would not be renewed &amp; that the Gov 1 would creat a new Bank a National one to be located at Washington 
with Branches only in such States as should pass a law authorising it &amp; made use of very Similar objections to the Bank as 
those introduced into the message from which he infers that Van Buren was consulted on that part of the message. . . .

Dear Biddle 

Soon after the Presidents first message in which the 
subject of the Bank was mentioned Mr Howard had a conversation with Mr Van Buren in which he told the Secretary 
that that part of the message refer y to the Bank had caused great surprise. Mr. V. B. answered he knew nothing of it, that 
he had not been consulted on the subject, and disapproaved of that part of the message &amp; that he was not hostile to the 
Bank. You recollect I wrote you at the time I was satisfied Mr V. B. was the author of those obnoxious paragraphs, &amp; 
Mr Poinsett says he is sure that V. B. is the man who has caused us all our trouble. . . .

Dear Biddle 

. . . Tis said that Van Buren &amp; Calhoun have kissed &amp; made up their dispute it is a fact that Calhoun has dined with Mr Van Buren and now the Secretarys party are crowing under the idea, that Calhoun is courting the 
favor &amp; forbearance of Mr V B at which it is Said that Mr C. is not a little vexed. If Jackson determines to run again 
for the Presidency, &amp; Calhoun does the Same, as he says he will, then Van B. &amp; his party will denounce Calhoun &amp; throw 
him off as they have Duff Green. The Clay party are trying to get Calhoun to separate himself from Jackson they say 
that heretofore he was sound on the leading questions, U.S. Judiciary, Bank U States, Tariff &amp; internal improvements, 
and that all he has to do is find some fit &amp; proper occasion to come out &amp; declare that his views on these important subjects 
are the same he had formerly entertained this the Clay party tell him. Clay is our first Choice You are Second, 
but that we cannot carry our party for You if You are against the Judiciary, the Currency, the finding employment at 
home for our surplus Labour, or new avenues through which to distribute the product of that Labour and it is hoped 
he will listen. I fear not.

My dear Sir 

... If the Secretary of the Treasury comes out against 
the Bank, &amp; which I am now disposed to doubt, since I find who are interested in depressing Stock, I think You ought at 
once, to call a Meeting of the Whole Board and consult with them, whether a meeting of the Stockholders should not be 
called that the affairs of the Bank may be examined into, with a view of putting down the calumnies heaped upon its 
present administration the reason given to the Public for the call might be, to ask directions or instructions from the 
Stockholders on the subject of curtailing the discounts &amp; withdrawing the Southern &amp; western Branches this would 
frighten the men at Washington not a little it is astonishing what a change the Message l has produced no one 
doubts for a moment had this message come out 6 weeks ago that Jackson would have lost his Election &amp; Yet in 6 weeks 
more, it will be the flinging up of Caps &amp; hurrah for Jackson he is all right the Bank must be put down the Tariff 
must be put down so must the Supreme Court &amp; the Lands given to the Western States &amp; internal improvements is 
worse than bad. I really think You ought to curtail Your 
Discount in Tenessee, Mobile, Charleston, Savanna, &amp; Virginia. I would let these people feel a pressure but not of 
course so as to cause failures give orders at Same time that in all instances at the Southern &amp; Southwestern Offices 
Where more is offered than they can do, to discount first 
the Drafts on the Northern &amp; Eastern Cities &amp; refuse the domestic Notes unless the discounts are made of better 
paper to enable the offerer to take up a Note held by the Bank. Your true plan is now to encrease even Your Loans 
to a man, if You can thereby make a doubtful debt secure, so the great object is now to see how much You can repay the 
Stockholders, upon the Supposition the Bank is to be wound up in 5 Years. . . .

My dear Sir 

. . . The more I have thought about the Bank, the better I like your idea of applying to your State for a Charter 
for 35 Millions for a Bank to be called the Bank of the U S. Penn a to subscribe 7 Millions pay* in a Stock bearing 4 1/2 
percts Interest or even 4 having the Same time to run, 
they grant the Charter, pledging the faith of the State for 
Said Debt, &amp; the accruing Dividends toward part of Interest, this would give your State at least 200,000 a Year as 
a Bonus, the present private Stockholders of the B U S to 
have the right to subscribe for the Same number of Shares 
in the New Bank they now hold in the Old the unsubscribed Stock to belong to the Corporation with right to Sell 
as they think proper the Bank to have the right to establish Branches in all States permitting, &amp; agencies every 
where on such terms as may be agreed upon. I feel persuaded all the States but N York would grant such privilege &amp; if 
the[y] refused, place an Agency there we would grant You the Charter here at once.
