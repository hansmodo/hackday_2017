My dear Sir 

The Message has received its last touches before your letter of the 27th reached my hands. I cannot therefore 
avail myself of your suggestions. But I must not suffer you to suppose I would have done so, had they been received 
in season. The times do not permit any specially favorable notice of Texas. You will find however nothing of unkindness in the simple statement of our relations with the Republick. Admitting, what I do not believe, that you are entirely 
correct in the other topick the Sub-Treasury, as I know that Mr V.B. s opinions have undergone no change I could 
not advise him to omit taking notice of the Subject in the message. Under present circumstances such pressure would 
betray a want of firmness &amp; consistency which no danger of consequences politically or personal should tempt any one to betray. . . .
