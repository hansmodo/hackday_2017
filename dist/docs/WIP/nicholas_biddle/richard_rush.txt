private and confidential. Washington Nov: 19, <a href='/results.php?year=1828'>1828</a> 

My dear sir. 

... I am about setting down to the preparation of my 
annual report, always a work of importance, but the materials 
for which, as you well know, cannot be got in, until just be 
fore congress assembles. I must prepare it, too, amidst the inevitable interruptions of daily business, drawing me aside. 
The receipts for the current year are likely, I think, to exceed by a million and a half (perhaps more) my estimate of 
them this time last year. 

It is my present intention to take some notice of your Bank. 
This has never yet been done, as far as I recollect, as a voluntary duty by the secretary of the treasury in his annual 
reports. But if these reports are to consist of nothing but an account current of the receipts of the year, set off in ruled 
lines and columns, any copying clerk in the department might annually save the secretary the trouble of drawing them up. 

Please to consider this communication as confidential, and believe me dear Sir,

Dear sir, 

I beg leave to enclose you a copy of my annual report. 
In framing it on this occasion, I have had reference to its making a good impression abroad, satisfied that [if] it should have 
this effect, in any degree, it will render it but the more valuable at home. Hence in the part about the debt, as well indeed 
as in other parts, I have been somewhat more elementary, 
or rather, I should say, explanatory, than would be necessary for home readers alone. I had written out the first sketch 
of the whole, including the part about the bank, before I was favored with your letter of the 25 th of November, and had anticipated some of its suggestions. Others that it contained, and that I also found in your late letter to Mr Dickins, I adopted, 
and now make you my acknowledgments for them. At the time the Bank was attacked last winter, for so it was in effect, 
I took my determination not to leave the Department with out placing on record my testimony to its vast value to the 
nation. It will be called an extra-official, volunteer, thing on my part, and other comments made; all of which I shall set at 
naught. The finances of the state are the state. So said Burke. 
Every thing that can be brought to bear upon the wealth and 
prosperity of the nation, commerce, manufactures, agriculture, the shipping interest, the currency, banks, the coin, 
tariffs, Internal works legislation as it may affect all or any of these topics, are open, so I hold it, to the scrutiny 
or recommendations of a secretary of the treasury, in his annual reports to the national Legislature. He may review in 
them, if he pleases, the financial systems of any part of the world, past or present, and ought to, if by it he can help our 
own. True he must be responsible to his own character for the manner in which he may do all this, and more, for every 
thing is open to him. His scope is boundless. I have at least desired to give to the law under which the annual report is 
made, an enlarged interpretation. I would lift up its dignity, as well as its importance, leaving it for others, more able, 
who are to come after me, to improve to great national benefits my mere conception of the duties which it imposes. . . . 

You have probably as much or more to fear for the Bank, 
from New York, as from Virginia, and with even less excuse. 
In Virginia, there are still constitutional scruples. In New 
York, none. But the frog of Wall Street, puffs himself into 
the Ox of Lombard street, and will not have you abuse him. 
Hinc ille lacrymse. . . . 

It is my intention to send copies of my report abroad. I 
shall take care that it reaches the hands not only of such 
persons as Mr Huskisson, Mr Peel and Lord Aberdeen, but also some of those capitalists and bankers who can make 
the pecuniary world heave, in both hemispheres, by holding 
up a finger, at the Royal or stock exchange.
