Washington Feb y 2. <a href='/results.php?year=1832'>1832</a> 

Dear Sir, 

I saw the President for the first time yesterday introduced by Mr Livingston who kindly volunteered his 
carriage and personal attendance for the purpose. Thus auspicated my reception was extremely gracious and flattering. 
There was a great deal of free and general conversation of which the topics were the French treaty, the Mexican treaty, 
the tariff, Mr Van Buren s rejection and his pending negociation, Mr Clay, and Governor Hamilton of South Carolina. 
I feel satisfied that from the beginning by gradual and proper advances I may eventually and a propos bring about a tete-a-tete communication on the bank, to which end my future intercourse in that quarter shall be directed. I understand 
from Dickins with whom I had some confidential chat and shall repeat it frequently that General Jackson s antipathy 
is not to the Bank of the United States in particular, but to all Banks whatever. He considers all the State Banks unconstitutional and impolitic and thinks that there should be no Currency but coin, that the Constitution [was not] designed 
to compel paper altogether as any part of our monetary system. This view of his doctrine conforms to a report which you 
shewed me not long ago made by him to the Legislature of Tennessee; 1 it coincides with some similar notions that I have 
long indulged myself, and at any rate to be apprised of the theory of his sentiments will be useful to me as it supplies 
a platform on which to approach him. If his prejudices are honest they may fairly be dealt with. Louis Williams 2 of 
North Carolina says that all his opposition to the Bank of the United States was fomented if not created by Van Buren 
who calculated that he could render his ascendancy in New York subservient to the prejudices of Virginia, and that 
Pennsylvania would acquiesce, which three States thus united would give him a broad basis for the future Presidency. . . .

Washington. Thursday evening 

9 February <a href='/results.php?year=1832'>1832</a> 

Dear Sir, 

An article signed Tulpe Hocken destined to appear in the Sentinel, and another signed incognito sent to the Enquirer of Philadelphia, each adapted to the various tastes of 
the readers of those different papers, the first designed to corroborate the spirit of Pennsylvania, the second to inculcate a 
beleif that the President has no constitutional objections to 
the Bank, but that the Vice President and his adherents are 
opposed to it, will serve to shew you that I have been paving 
the way for just such a coup d etat as your letter of the 6 th 
received to day suggests and after [having] well digested 
my project I went to the Department of State yesterday to 
break ground : But Mr Livingston was with the President and 
I was obliged to defer the overture till to day, which I am not 
sorry for, as your letter come to hand in the mean time has 
confirmed my views and shaped them with precision. I now 
proceed with much satisfaction to report to you substantially 
what took place. When I saw Mr Livingston, as I did this 
morning soon after the receipt of your letter, I told him that 
I wished to speak freely with him respecting an important 
measure which he had often mentioned with great apparent 
freedom to me, assuring him that he might rely implicitly on 
my confidence and my disposition to render a service to General Jackson s administration consistent with what I deemed 
the welfare of the country: I then explained to him the state 
of parties in Pennsylvania, that the confidence of the people 
in General Jackson is undiminished as is well known to the 
adherents of Governor Wolf, but that they have the whole 
party organization of the State in their hands, and while they 
dare not openly oppose General Jackson s re-election, yet 
that many if not most of them are inclined to be in op 
position to him. I repeated all the circumstances of the 
publication by the Philadelphia members of the Legislature 
last spring in answer to the charge of bribery * which was intended to strike at the President, and would have done so 
much more forcibly than it did, but for the mitigation of some 
of whom I was one, and I added that the resent attempt to 
get up a Van Buren party in Pennsylvania had been a complete failure. I then mentioned the recent almost unanimous 
resolutions of the present Legislature sustaining those of the 
last in favor of the bank of the U S and said that he might de 
pend upon it, therefore, that collision between the State and 
the President would be a dangerous &amp; unfortunate occurrence 
for the latter for which surely said I there is not the least 
occasion, for why should he risk any portion of his popularity 
against an object entirely disconnected with politics, and so 
purely fiscal that if the Secretary of the Treasury were to tell 
the President that he found a frying pan the most convenient 
means of managing the finances, I should suppose the President would agree to it, especially as I understood he has no 
constitutional scruples. After more of these preliminaries than 
I can altogether repeat, I asked Mr Livingston if under these 
circumstances it would not be the simplest resolution of all 
the supposed difficulties to take the Bank out of the hands of 
M r M c Duffie and the opposition, modifying its charter so as 
to suit it to the President s opinion and passing it as a measure of the Administration, Mr M c Lane taking the place which 
M r Dallas occupied and General Jackson the example of Mr Madison in [ ] 15-16 when the Bank was created. I further 
more offered to see Mr Dallas, expressing my confidence that he would cordially cooperate in such a movement. Finally, I 
charged and the Washington Globe reprinted the charge of bribery. To this Inger- 
soll and other members of the legislature from Philadelphia and its vicinity has 
tened to publish an indignant denial. This was dated May 18, <a href='/results.php?year=1831'>1831</a>, and first ap 
peared in the American Sentinel of Philadelphia and was widely copied. Meigs, 
Ingersoll, pp. 167-185. 



From Charles Jared Ingersoll 177 

told Mr Livingston all that General Smith had told me as 
to the wish of the President s immediate advisors, that the 
Bank question should be put by this Session. Mr Livingston 
rec d . my communication with the utmost apparent cordiality, 
acknowledged the force of the argument and said the pro 
posed mode of proceeding was exactly that one which he 
thought ought to be pursued. I then inquired if the Presi 
dent would oppose the Bank on the ground of its unconsti 
tutionally; he answered that he would not, but that he had 
certain notions of his own as to the frame of the charter which 
ought to be complied with. Let his friends frame it as they 
will, said I, provided their alterations are not destructive of 
the Institution. What are they? First that it should hold 
no real estate but what is indespensably necessary. Granted, 
there is no harm in that. Secondly, that the State should not 
be prevented taxing it. Thirdly, some addition to the Capi 
tal so as to let in new subscribers, and Lastly there is another 
provision, which he could not call to mind; very well, said 
I, I have no authority to remould the charter. I interpose only 
as the friend of Mr Biddle of the Bank, and the Administra 
tion, but I have no doubt that any reasonable modifications 
will be acquiesced in, only take the subject out of the hands of 
the President s opponents and let it be brought before Con 
gress in such a shape that his friends may support it, and I 
offered to call upon Mr Dallas forthwith. Mr Livingston de 
sired me to defer doing so for a few days promising in the 
mean while to have a full understanding with the President 
he said he knew there were some who wanted him to veto 
it, and that he does not know what are the present sentiments 
of the Secretary of the Treasury whose official situation puts 
it out of his power to be passive or neutral as General Smith had said he designed to be. For himself Mr Livingston ac 
knowledged that the President s various messages invited 
the immediate action of Congress upon the subject. I told 
him that as I had no object in view but the public good which 
I considered identified with the re-charter, I had no objec 
tion whatever to wait on the Secretary of the Treasury, or the 
President and speak to them in the same tone of candour and 
earnestness that I had used in communicating with him. 
M r Livingston replied that the President would hear me with 
perfect attention &amp; thankfulness and we agreed that at a 
proper time I should call upon him. In the mean while Mr 
Livingston will take the earliest opportunity of a full explana 
tion with him, which he probably could not accomplish today 
because there is a large diplomatic dinner at the President s 
but he will try tomorrow. . . .

Washington 21 Feb 32 

Dear Sir 

Thus stands the cabinet The Secretary of State 
with us with all his heart &amp; all his head, anxious to be the 
author of the President s conversion, who, he says, ought to 
be fixed if any thing can fix him by Tibbit s Scheme. Mr . L. 
is confident of succeeding, but has done nothing since my 
last, not having had an opportunity of bringing the subject 
before all the members of the cabinet together, not, in the 
first instance, in form, nor till after he has secured a major 
ity of them he says he is constantly and hard at work for 
us; but the bad weather and other interruptions have put 
him back, but he promises every thing The Secretary of the 
Treasury 1 with us, but so variable in his moods, so much 
cooler at times than at others that Mr . L. says he is at a loss 
what to think of him, after said Mr . L. all the pains I have 
taken with him. 

The Secretary of War 2 with us entirely 

The Secretary of the Navy 3 with us 

The Atty Gen 1 4 against us but Mr . L. hopes to con 
vert him I found him just now closetted with Kendall, of 
whom and Lewis I do not despair. My good understanding 
with the Editor of the Globe is well settled. The Bank has 
not a warmer or more active friend than Judge Wilkins.

1 84 Correspondence of Nicholas Biddle 

M r . Livingston agrees with me as to the mollesse of his col 
league. I expect to see you this week. In haste 

The scheme of some of them, said Mr . L. is a bank of the 
US in each State, but that I consider impossible. 

The more schemes and places the better.

Dear Sir 

... It is my fortune to have other subjects of confidential liaison with Mr . L. which operate favorably as inducement to similar understanding respecting the bank. After arranging those subjects yesterday at his house where I saw 
him, when I was about leaving his study without mentioning the bank for he had told me the day before that it would 
require some days, and I am very cautious not to torment him with it he himself introduced it by saying, I suppose 
you 11 see Biddle at Philadelphia and let him know how matters are as to the bank. No doubt, said I. Well then, continued he, I wish you would ascertain from him whether the bank will agree to the President s views of the terms for a 
new charter, and he proceeded to recapitulate them. As my memory might fail me in some particulars, said I, suppose I 
make a written note of them. Very well, he rejoined and accordingly I sat down at his desk, made the enclosed min 
ute, with his assistance, read it to him when done and we parted on the footing of his unreserved declaration of his 
desire that I would submit them for your approbation or otherwise, as may be. Tho I send the original protocol as 
it may be called, which I have dated and signed that you may keep it in Rei Vei testimonium yet I proceed to rewrite 
the items, as the memorandum made yesterday is not perfectly plain from the hurry of writing it. 

1. Government to have no interest in the bank. 

2. President of the U S empowered to appoint a Director at each branch so that government may be represented at each. 

3. States authorized to tax the property both real &amp; personal of the bank within the said States in like manner as the States may tax other property within them. 

4. The bank to hold no real Estate but such as it may be constrained to take in payment or security of its debts, and to be compelled by law to sell that within stated time. 

The foregoing I understand from Mr . L. are the President s terms. 

5. A certain proportion of the stock or capital to be thrown 
open to new subscriptions, which may be done by prorata reduction of the present capital, or by addition to it. 

This 5 is not the President s requirement: but Mr. L. seems to be very tenacious of it, always urging that it will facilitate very much the recharter. 

6. The Directors to nominate annually two or three per 
sons of whom the President to appoint any one as President 
of the bank. 

This 6 neither the President nor Mr . L. like. It is 
the suggestion of others he said. . . .

Washington I Mch 32 

Dear Sir 

... In handling your letter to Mr Livingston yesterday I made good use of the crisis which the annoying resolution occasions. He assures me, and you may rely, that the 
President has nothing to do with it, nor with Root s resolutions. 1 Not at all, said Mr . L. He wishes to end the business 
this Session. If such a bill goes to him as he can sign he will sign it without hesitation. If not, he will be equally prompt 
to reject it. Thus we have the mind of the President without doubt, if Mr . L s word is to be taken, of which I have not a 
particle of misgiving and I feel confident that his is the predominating influence. When I told him so, he said certainly 
the President knows that he seeks nothing, not even to be where he is, and can have no motive but the honor of the admin . . .

Washington 6 Mch 32 

Dear Sir 

... I think I have gathered a motive for Mr. Mc Duffie's almost unaccountable capitulation: if so there was 
more method than madness in it. The Speaker informs me 
that M C D told him that he did not mean nor wish to let the 
bank be discussed before the Tariff. Hence his yielding to an 
inquiry which will just occupy in his reckoning the few weeks 
to elapse before the Tariff becomes the topic. This being so, 
or at any rate, I have another plan to counteract him: that 
is, soon after the bank has invited investigation, as I expect 
it to do tomorrow, and a committee is appointed accordingly, 
to get the subject taken up in Senate and a bill sent to the 
h of R if possible before the Tariff is before them. I had an 
interesting conversation yesterday with Mr . Livingston on 
this subject. What do you think of a plan, said I, by which 
Pennsylvania shall yield something of the tariff to the well 
disposed and moderate of Virginia and the Carolinas in equivalent for their uniting with her in support of such a modified bank as the President approves and thus firmly securing 
tariff bank and union altogether? I like it very much said he. But can you accomplish it since McDuffie has given way to 
the enquiry ? I do not consider that, said I, indespensible. There is a very strong spirit in Pennsylvania for the bank, I mean 
in the delegation, and they do not intend to let Mr. McDuffie surrender their desire for his views. I am sensible, said he, 
that your delegation is very much bent on the bank. . . . 
What do you think, said I, of my prevailing on Mr . Madison to appear before the public recommending such a compromise ? 
I believe I c d get him to do it. Very well, said he: or, I continued, shall it begin at some primary assembly in Pennsylvania ? The difficulty now, after all I have understood from 
you, is not with the Executive, but with Congress. Yes, said he, this unlucky resolution of inquiry; but for that I think 
there would be no difficulty. The President would sign such a bill as you and I have arranged. I have never heard him 
say so. But I have good reason to rely on it. (I think those were his very words.) 

Thus, you perceive, that McDuffie and Clayton agreeing in opposition to the Tariff, and that the Tariff is the first 
consideration, have, no doubt without concert, contrived between the resolution of the one and the concession of the 
other to postpone the bank lest it should by its combinations 
of votes interfere with their primary object and this suspends all the inclining of the President to give way to what 
he is I am persuaded more alarmingly satisfied is the settled determination of that State without whose hearty good 
will his stan dets. Such is the state of things we have to deal with. If a Pennsylvanian capable of taking the lead 
would now do so on the footing of accommodating the President and the South by some modification (which can be well 
afforded) of the Tariff in return for most of them (for I do not expect all) yielding their objections to a modified bank, it 
would be that Pennsylvanians certain road to honor, influence and office. I mean to sound Wilkins about it this very 
day. I shall probably meet him at the Atty Genl dinner or 
at Serverius ball, and I will make it a point to set the inducement before him. If, as I presume, Dallas was yesterday 
nominated at Harrisburg, it leaves W. no better if other chance of promotion. He has already intimated in the Senate 
his desire to compromise the Tariff and I know from Mr. Livingstons frequent urgency to me that such a movement 
would win Jackson s heart. . . .

Dear Sir 

During the few days of my stay here I have made it a point to ascertain from good authority what the probability 
is as to the bank of the U S; the result is an assurance that some time during one of the Sessions of the next Congress, 
the Executive will invite their attention to the subject, 1 and 
submit a plan, which, with modifications, such as the Legislative and Executive may eventually agree upon, will become 
the institution. What the plan is I did not inquire. Not with standing all that has passed it is impossible to travel ever so 
short a distance as from Philadelphia to Washington without perceiving universal preference and undiminished confidence 
in the papers of the bank of the US....
