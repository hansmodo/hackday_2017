D. Sir, 

Your letter of the I4th Inst. inclosing one from Mr 
Dun of Lexington, was received by the mail of yesterday 
morning. I have not the pleasure of being personally ac 
quainted with Mr Dun, but am told by those who know him, 
that he is a highly reputable gentleman. His letter, as re 
quested, has been shown to the President who, with compli 
ments, desires me to express to you his thanks for the in 
formation it contains. He certainly has been led to believe, 
from the complaints of his friends, during the pendency 
of the presidential election, that the Lexington Branch in disbursing its golden favours, in the way of discounts, had 
manifested great partiality. It is gratifying to him however, 
he says, to learn that probably there was no just cause for 
those complaints, or at least, that they probably had been 
much exaggerated. He requests me to say, that he has too 
much confidence in you to believe, for a moment, that you 
should knowingly tolerate such conduct in the Branches of 
your Bank; but from the complaints which are still made with 
regard to some of them, particularly the one at New Orleans, 
he thinks it not improbable that party feeling may yet have 
some influence upon their operations. He hopes this may 
not be the case, but an inquiry into the cause of those com 
plaints, and a removal of the ground if there be any for them, 
is an object, he thinks, worthy the attention of the Parent 
Bank. The President thinks, as you do, that the Bank of the 
U. States should recognise no party; and that, in all its opera 
tions, it should have an eye single to the interest of the Stock 
holders and the good of the country. . . .

D. Sir, 

I wrote last evening to Mr H. Toland 3 informing 
him that some of his friends here were anxious that he should 
be run for the appointment of Clerk to the House of Repre 
sentatives in Congress. I think, if he will consent to serve, 
he can be elected, and he should not, it seems to me object to 
it. I wish you would see and advise with him on this subject. 
There is a very large majority of the members of the next 
Congress in favour of the present Administration, and I am 
sure there can be no wish on their part to reelect Mr Clark(e) 4 
nor do 1 believe the opposition members have any partiality 
for him. If Toland will consent to let his friends place his 
name before the House, you can serve him very efficiently, 
I have no doubt, by speaking to Webster and enlisting him 
and other New England members in his behalf. I am sure

they can have no predelections in favour of Clark, and with 
a little pains could be got to vote for Toland. Mr Ingham 
for particular reasons will support Mr Clark, and such of the 
Penn a . delegation as are under his influence (D r Sutherland 1 
and two or three others) will vote for him; but I have no 
doubt, a decided majority would support our friend. It will 
be well to see Mr Hemphill, 2 and converse with him upon 
the subject, and if he should be favourably disposed, get 
him to write to his friends particularly Judge Wilkins 3 of 
Pittsburgh, and old Mr Ross. You will have a fine opportu 
nity of seeing your Eastern friends (I mean such as you can 
venture to speak to) as they pass thro Phil a . on their way to 
Congress, and enlisting them in the support of Toland. 

I have taken the liberty, my dear sir, of writing to you upon 
this subject, because I know you feel, as I do, a deep interest 
in the welfare of Mr Toland, and will most cheerfully aid in 
whatever may tend to his benefit. Should he be appointed 
Clerk to the House it may lead to results still more impor 
tant to him it may ultimately be the means of relieving 
him from his pecuniary embarrassments. 

I intimated in my letter to him, of last night, that should 
he consent to be a candidate, it might be well to let it be an 
nounced in one of your papers &amp;c. On reflection I am inclined 
to think it would be best to say nothing about it in the papers 
- instead of that course it would be better for Toland to write 
to some of the leading members elect. 

I have no hesitation in saying that he will be supported by 
all the leading and personal friends of the President here

My D. Sir, 

I rec d . yours of the 27 ultimo the day previous to 
Judge Overtons departure, and consulted him with regard 
to the appointment of suitable persons to fill the places 
of those directors of your Nashville Board as will have shortly 
to retire. We found considerable difficulty in making proper 
selections, but have agreed to recommend the following 
named gentlemen. 

Thomas Crutcher 

Alexander Porter 

Francis B Fogg, or E. H. Foster 

Bernard Vanlier 

Joseph Vaulx. 

The first named gentleman is one of the earliest settlers 
in the Country a man of great moral worth, and is at this 
time and has been for nearly thirty years, one of the Treas 
urers of Tennessee. You cannot, I should think, do better 
than to appoint him. Mr . Porter was a member of the Nash 
ville Board when it was first organized an Irishman by 
birth, but has been a resident of the State upwords of thirty 
years and has lived, I should think, 25 years in Nashville 
a man of good moral character, of wealth, and needs none 
of your money. I have served with him and know he makes 
a good and safe director. Fogg and Foster are partners in 
law, both men of business and of high standing Foster 
was a member of your first Board. Mr Vanlier is concerned 
in some of the iron works of this State he is a native of 
Penn a . a man of good moral character, well off, safe 
and judicious at least this was his character when I left 
Nashville, and I have no reason to believ it has undergone 
any change. Mr. Vaulx must be known to you as he has 
served two years as a director. He is a safe judicious man 
has married into an influential connection, and is doing a good 
business as a merchant. When he was first appointed some ob 
jection was made to him on account of his age; but as he has 
once been a member of the Board, and is several years older 
than he was, I presume no objection could now be made to 
him on that account. 

I am of opinion that Judge Overton himself would serve 
if appointed, tho I am not authorised to say so, never having 
heard him speak upon the subject. If it would not be incon 
venient for him to attend, living 5 or 6 miles from town, it 
would be good policy to appoint him; he is a brother-in-law 
of Judge White of the Senate, and a particular friend of the 
President. If his living in the Country should be an ob 
jection, I would advise you to put him in the place of 
Harding next Year, who also lives in the Country. Two of 
the Directors who go out this year should be returned to 
the Board as early as the rule, which governs such cases, 
will admit of. I mean Campbell and Farqueharsen, both of 
whom make good directors particularly the latter. With 
out wishing to disparage others I verily believe that Mr . 
Farqueharsen is the very best director you have in your 
Board. 

The President is well, and desires me to present his respects 
to you.

D. Sir, 

. . . Before closing this letter permit me to say one 
word in reference to a subject mentioned in your last letter 
to me I mean the information you rec d . of the President s 
having declared that if Congress should pass a law renewing 
the Charter of the U.S. Bank he would put his veto on it. 
I told you in PhiK when you first mentioned the thing to 
me, that there must be some mistake, because the report was 
at variance with what / had heard him say upon the subject. 
In conversing with him a few days ago upon the subject he 
still entertained the opinion that a National Bank might be 
established that would be preferable to the present U.S. Bank ; 
but that, if Congress thought differently, and it was deemed 
necessary to have such a Bank as the present, with certain 
modifications he should not object to it. If the President finds 
that his scheme is not likely to take, I do not believe he will 
be opposed, altogether, to the present Bank. In haste I am 
</p>
