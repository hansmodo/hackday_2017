Dear Sir, 

Feeling as I do deep solicitude in the prosperity of the Bank, I have been very much gratified with your nomination to the Presidency of that institution and most sincerely hope, that you may be elected. 

... If at any time, I can render aid to the institution, it will afford me much pleasure, and should you be elected, 
of which there can be no reasonable doubt, the pleasure would be still farther advanced by cooperating, as with the 
present President, with one for whom I have so great an esteem. 
</p>
