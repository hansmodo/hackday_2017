My dear Sir 

I had last night a long conversation with M c Lane 
and I am authorized by him to say that it is his deliberate 
opinion and advice that a renewal of the Charter ought not 
to be pressed during the present session in which I concurr 
most sincerely. The message is as much as you could expect. 
It shows that the Chief is wavering. If pressed into a Corner 
immediately neither M c Lane nor myself will answer for the 
consequences. But we both feel confident of ultimate success 
if time be given for the P fc to convince himself of the Error 
into which opinion long formed (prejudice if you pleased) had committed him. Every day new Converts are making. 
Every day the utility of the Bank is becoming better known, 
and its popularity increasing. The mind of the President is 
getting better informed. And the increase of its friends can 
not fail to have a favourable Effect on him therefore do not 
push him out of time. Give full play to the members of the 
Administration. Every one of whom (except Taney) are fa 
vourable; his opposition, I think, arises out of the mistaken 
Idea that the Bank has operated politically. Can you give me 
the means of Conquering that Idea. 

M N. Mangum of N.C. a new Senator is a warm advocate 
of the Bank; he lodges with your friend

Washington, Dec r . 17. <a href='/results.php?year=1831'>1831</a> 

Dear Sir 

This morning Mr . Clay, on returning a visit I had paid 
him, took occasion to broach the subject of the renewal of 
the Charter of the Bank of the U. States, by enquiring 
whether I had any precise information as to its purpose to 
memorialise Congress on the subject. I replied that I had not; 
that I had myself been inclined to think that, as the subject 
was national, and had so repeatedly and recently received 
the notice of the Executive, it might be the best policy to 
let the Gov* act upon it without the special interposition of 
the Bank, as it would in this event be acted upon on large pub 
lic considerations, free from the prejudices which might arise 
on viewing its bearings on private interests. He expressed his 
dissent from this opinion; said the present was the most favor 
able time to get the charter; that a majority of the two Houses 
was for it; that he himself should vote for it; that Mr . Buck- 
ner, the new Senator from Missouri, had told him he would 
do so; that the President had unquestionably the last sum 
mer declared (stating the name of the individual to whom he 
made the declaration) that either the Bank or Andrew Jack 
son must go down; that it was probable that, if two Houses 
passed a Bill, the President would approve it previous to the 
next Presidential election, but that if not passed previously 
he did not doubt his rejecting it; in fact, that now or never, 
was the time to act with any chance of success. 

I stated to him that in conversation with several members 
of Congress, personal friends of the President, and others of 
like character, they had expressed great solicitude that the 



144 Correspondence of Nicholas Eiddle 

subject should not at this session be pressed by the Bank, 
declaring at the same time their friendship to the Bank, 
with the fear, if so pressed, the measure would be considered 
by the President as an electioneering one, and would scarcely 
fail to be felt by him as personal, and being so viewed impel 
him, in the assertion of his independence, to put his veto on 
the Bill, that it might not be alleged that he was influenced 
by a regard to a re-election; that the Secretary of the Treas 
ury was adverse to the subject being taken up at this time; 
and that if the discussion were deferred, as public opinion, 
particularly in the West, was becoming more favorable, the 
President, yielding to its influence, would be apt to become 
himself less adverse to a continuance of the Charter. 

He said that his information corraborated mine; but that 
he did not believe the effect on the President would be such 
as was represented; that if the Bank memorialised Congress 
it would be but following in the wake of the President; that if 
they did not, he doubted whether the subject would be effec 
tively brought forward ; that many of the members would avail 
themselves of the circumstance to wave the discussion of the 
subject; that, further, it should be considered that if the press 
ing it by the Bank should be viewed by the friends of the Pres 
ident as an electioneering measure aimed against him, there 
was another aspect of the subject under which those opposed 
to the President, and in general friends to the Bank, might 
consider the delay to memorialise, especially after the actions 
of the stockholders on the subject, as an electioneering step 
against them; that already rumors of a coalition to this effect 
was circulated; and that in regard to the feeling in the West, 
it was quite doubtful; he believed they (the representa 
tives) might without injury vote for a renewal, but there would be little sensation there let the decision be what it might. . . . 

Altho these views are probably familiar to you, and you 
may, thro other channels, be possessed of the facts I have 
stated, I have supposed there might be a use in communi 
cating them, with the opinion . . . that the views and reason 
ing of Mr Clay are in the main correct. I may add, that you 
know him sufficiently well to admit, that, however glittering 
the prize of ambition may be, he is remarkable for the habit 
ual exercise of dispassionate judgement and clear perception. I 
would add, however, my aprehension, that, altho the discussion 
will shew a majority in favor of the Bank, there will be a suffi 
cient number of members voting with its enemies for an indefi 
nite postponement to defeat the passage of a Bill this session. 

... I am, with unfeigned respect
