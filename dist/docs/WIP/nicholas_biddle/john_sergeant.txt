Washington Dec 1 . 13, 1827 

Dear Sir, 

Tomorrow s paper will give you a resolution introduced to day by Mr . Barbour, and the remarks with which 
he accompanied it, instructing the ComnV*. of Ways and 
Means to enquire into the expediency of selling the Gov 13 . 
stock in the Bank. It ought to have been decided at once, 
and I think might have been, but before I could get the floor, 
a motion was made to lay it on the table which supersedes 
debate. I believe it will be rejected. In the mean time, however, 
it will do some mischief, and, if considered as the beginning of 
an attack, lead to permanent distrust in the stability of the 
institution which will somewhat enfeeble it. The motion will 
have the effect, too, of putting the Bank among the topics 
to be handled by those who are seeking popularity. I am 
sorry for it. 

I have never heard a word about our cause, from which I am afraid there was nothing pleasant to say.

Washington Mar: 2. 1833. 

My dear Sir, 

. . . Looking forward, tho the present excitement will cease, and the composition of Congress be different and less 
favorable, there are still to be discerned the elements of hope. 
The new state of parties will be founded upon a combination 
of the South, and the leaders of it (the Southern party) are 
friends of the Bank upon principle, and will be more so from 
opposition to Jackson. If they succeed in their first object, 
of uniting the South, they will carry the whole of it in favor 
of the Bank, either actively or passively, those who cannot 
act in that direction, becoming neutralised and Quiescent. 
In the middle and Northern States, and in the West too, 
their view as to the Bank question will be an argument to 
gain friends for their party. Against a combination which 
threatens to be so powerful, Van Buren will have to look for 
alliances in the North, I think, and in so doing will be obliged 
to give up his hostility to the Bank. It is quite possible, in 
deed, that he may come into conjunction with some of its 
most decided friends. In the mean time, Jackson s influence 
will be diminishing, and his personal feelings will by no 
means have the same weight as heretofore. And, besides, 
I think he will be pressed by so powerful an opposition, 
that even he will be obliged to behave himself with some 
decency. 

What I have thus hinted at, is no doubt the subject of 
calculation with those who are looking to the future, and I 
shall be surprized if even at the next session there be not 
an altered tone towards the Bank in Congress, less ferocity 
among its opponents, and more confidence on the part of its 
friends, who, by the way, can never be too much commended 
for the zeal and courage they have manifested under the most 
unpromising circumstances. . . .

(Private) Washington, Feb. 27. 1834 

My dear Sir, 

The first thing of real importance I have heard since I came here was communicated this morning by Mr . Calhoun. He asked me whether I had heard any thing from 
M r . Southard. I told him no. Well, he said, there is a letter from Mr . S. in which he states as follows Tliat on his way 
to Baltimore (on Tuesday) a New York Jackson man said to him, "As you are going from Washington, I will tell you 
what I would not have told you there. We (meaning himself and some of his friends from New York) have been talking 
with the President about the great and increasing distress, and endeavouring to convince him that this state of things 
cannot continue that some thing must be done. He (President) admitted he had heard some thing, but by no means 
to the extent we stated, of which he seemed to have no idea. The result was that the President drew up some questions 
for his cabinet, who were to deliberate upon what was to be done." As Mr . Southard has been in Philad 3 . you will probably have heard all this, and heard it more accurately. The further fact, stated by M. Calhoun, is material, that there 
are daily meetings of the cabinet. He told me this yesterday, and then thought they were about changes in the administration. To day, he thinks they are upon the subject of the 
New Yorker s conversation, and considering the question "What is to be done." If they have come to that point, we 
shall soon see some movement. Strange as it may seem, I should not be at all surprized if Mr . Taney were to give 
up the Treasury, and some one else (perhaps Forsyth) take his place. In such an event we shall see a very queer game 
played. Gen 1 . Jackson will look at the matter, as he does at every thing, singly with reference to himself, and will make 
any sacrifice that may be necessary to save his own reputation. It is in such emergencies that his greatest skill is 
exhibited, and it is quite unrestrained by any feeling for others. 

M r . Calhoun thinks they are upon a question of a new Bank. If any project should be brought forward, it will open 
the way for Mr . C. to bring forward his plan as a substitute. He is fully aware of the advantage would give him He 
is at this time the most confident man in either house. He always speaks of the Administration as broken down and gone. . . .

(Private) Washington, April 28 th . 1838. 

My dear Sir, 

Referring to what I wrote yesterday, I would now add, that there is a strong jealousy of New York rising in the 
South. You know the schemes of the Southrons 2 for get moment that motives most unworthy have induced seven members of the House of 
Representatives to forego the solemn and imposing duties which they owed their 
constituents. . . . Here then we have before us a practical illustration of the immense and alarming power of the banks, whose agents have been and now are as thick as bees prowling about the halls of both houses of our legislature." Van Buren MSS. in Library of Congress. 


ting their own trade into their own hands. What support they 
have given to the Sub-Treasury has been to promote this 
view. The mass of them have been sincere. Mr . Calhoun 1 
has used it only to cloak his ambition. They are now alarmed 
at the prospect of a new union of the money power, with the 
political power by means of the free banking law of New 
York. The question is whether in this jealousy, (the present 
predominat feeling, whether well or ill founded) there is not 
a ground for an union of the Bank U.S. with the South. If you 
can make friends there, you will soon have Penns a ., for she 
always goes with the South. I throw this out for your con 
sideration. As you are to steer, of course you will observe 
where the wind is to come from. . . . 

We will have a great contest &amp; one which will fix our prosperity for 20 years, one 
way or the other." And as Pickens viewed the subject the South would be foolish to 
summit to cunning and fraud any longer. Hammond MSS. in Library of Congress. 

However, a good explanation for the position of the South on the Sub-Treasury 
and the motives which impelled it to stand by the Administration in these days is 
given in a letter of Alfred Hager (?) to Poinsett, September I, 1838: "As to the 
S.T. I really know very little about it ... but surely, a very little reflection must 
teach every Southern man who is willing to be taught what our policy is. The Bank 
&amp; the metallic basis &amp; the paper currency are all debatable questions but 
the Black Currency is not. How am I to be benefited by either Bank or Sub. 
Treasury without my land on Cooper River &amp; the Negroes that work there? What 
signifies to me all the jargon about Whigs &amp; Conservatives etc. etc. if the abolitionists stand between me &amp; the White Gate at Longwood? these are the inquiries 
that make me an administration man with me the very foundation of liberty is 
slavery &amp; I go for Mr. Van Buren because Mr. Van Buren goes for me &amp; it would 
be worse than hypocrisy in me to be hunting about for better reasons than this with 
a strong current sitting against us, with the whole world looking angrily at our in 
stitution &amp; the prevailing feeling of mankind plainly developing a disposition to 
overthrow them, how can the South afford to talk about this man, or that man, with 
the message of the President &amp; the actions conforming to his message staring us 
in the face?" Poinsett MSS. in Pennsylvania Historical Society Library.
