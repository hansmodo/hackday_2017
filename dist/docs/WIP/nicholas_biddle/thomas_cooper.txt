Dear Sir 

I am in principle opposed to all Banks, and of course 
to that over which you preside. I wrote the review of that 
question in the Southern review. I have just written the ar 
ticle on Banks in the Southern Times of this place, which I 
send by this post. I have not varied in my good opinion of 
your personal Character, to which I have not omitted to bear 
, willing testimony. 

If I could oppose the banking system with success, I would 
do so; but I cannot. Under these circumstances, I very 
greatly prefer the renewal of your institution, to the Schemes 
of Gen 1 . Jackson and Van Beuren; &amp; I have determined to 
open upon them the battery of the Press here. Have you any 
facts or suggestions that you would be willing to communi 
cate to me confidentially in aid of my design? If so, I will use 
them as I here propose. If not, all is well; I shall go on, with

was born in London, October 22, <a href='/results.php?year=1759'>1759</a>. After studying at Oxford, Cooper visited 
France where he became involved in the political struggles of that nation. In <a href='/results.php?year=1795'>1795</a> 
he came to America with Dr. Joseph Priestley; but, once more taking up the cudgel 
against government, he was tried under the Alien and Sedition laws for attacking 
the administration of John Adams. From <a href='/results.php?year=1811'>1811</a> to <a href='/results.php?year=1814'>1814</a> he held the chair of chem

of nullification. The character of the man can easily be discerned from this and the

years contributed articles on banking to various periodicals. He was connected for 
some time with the Treasury Department in Washington. His best-known works 
are: The History of the American Banking System (<a href='/results.php?year=1835'>1835</a>); The Expediency of Dis 
pensing with Bank Paper (<a href='/results.php?year=1837'>1837</a>); and Fiscal History of Texas (<a href='/results.php?year=1852'>1852</a>). Gouge was

istration of every form of government. He has written to the 
editor of the Times, to send him the series of Essays signed

in my own name: I have not kept any but one copy of 
the former numbers. I observe Ritchie 1 of Richmond is very 
angry : of course: many people here think I abandon my prin 
ciples ; but I do not write for popularity, but for what I con

Jackson, his proclamation &amp; his force bill, 2 &amp; to those who 
support these measures, I have nothing to say but bellum 
inter necinum. Degraded as we are, to a government whose 
polar star is the omnipotence of parliament, I care but little 
about modern politics here, except to oppose them.

Dear Sir 

The talking will go on in Congress till nothing is done 
and the members and the public become weary. In that case, 
Jackson will hold firm grasp of the public monies, and set the 
opposition at defiance. I have written to suggest a resolution, 
that no Appropriation bill be passed till Congress shall have 
provided by law for some safe deposit of the public monies, 
out of the controul of the President. 

I now venture to suggest, whether in New York and Phila 
delphia, a resolution might not be gotten up, to stop the cus 
tom house collections, in case Congress breaks up, and leaves 
them in Jackson s power. Is there any other possible plan 
that will be efficient? I think the mercantile Interests maybe 
brought to do it. If Jackson obtains controul of the revenue 
we are defeated, and nothing but extensive bloodshed will 
preserve us from a permanent disposition. Assuredly, our 
present war of resolutions and proclamations will do us but 
little good. . . . 

I observe, all our delegation, Pinckney, Clowney, speak 
of your Bank in terms of highest respect, and w d . willingly 
vote for an alteration of the Constitution in its favour: 



To John S. Smith 231 

but unless the north under Webster coalesce with Calhoun, 1 
nothing will be done this session, if at all. If Jackson seizes 
the revenue in spite of the Senate, and in defiance of a re 
jection of the appropriation bill, the game is up, for he has 
the means and the inclination of buying up not merely politi 
cal but military adherents ; and half measures will only plunge 
us deeper into the whirlpool destined to absorb what little 
of freedom remains. Adieu.

Dear Sir 

I wrote a letter to you some time ago on behalf of our 
Iron company: subsequent events have furnished a sufficient 
reply. 

I enter upon my 79 th Year, next October. By the time Mr 
Van Beuren s first period has expired, I shall be superannu 
ated. I can have therefore no selfish motive in my present 
proposal. The tide is turning strongly agst the measures of 
the last and present Administration. The poor now groan 
under the financial follies of Gen. Jackson as well as the 
rich. To be sure, over trading and gambling speculation will 
account for three fourths of the present distress, but no one 
can be blind to the effects produced by the desperate igno 
rance of the last President. 

At this moment your judicious conduct has placed you 
prominent as a wise and temperate man, and a public bene 
factor. You can go on pursuing cautiously the same course of 
conduct, and earning on all hands golden opinions. 

Why not look to the Presidency? 

Can your name be brought forward at a time more ad 
vantageous than the present? You are rising, your oppo 
nents are falling: strike the ball on the rebound, and I think 
this is the moment. 

Is there any chance of success for such imbecilles as Ben ton, 
Harrison, or even White? Men without preliminary study,

of popular clamour. Think of this : and if needful command 
my services, such as they may be. I am, and so may you be, 
in the odour of political sanctity in this State : and this State is 
the South; for we have earned the character of honesty &amp; 
energy. We have here two men of plausible &amp; fair pretensions : 
of those pretensions I say nothing at present; the subject may 
be discussed, if needful, by and by. 

The present suggestion is my own : received from and com 
municated to no one but yourself: &amp; so it shall remain till you 
decide. . . .

Dear Sir 

My friend the Governor of this State, a man of no 
brilliant talents, of no acquirement, but a great worldly 
tact and resource, and extremely popular, will not be here for some days. He is at Charleston where our State Bank have 
acceded to our request to the loan I wrote to you about. I 
shall sound him when he returns, cautiously but I think successfully: till then I make no move. Hitherto, he and I have 
acted with no variance of opinion. 

I could write to Noah : but Altho I have no doubt about his inclinations, I know not enough how his interest points. 
The Iron is quite hot enough in that furnace, to strike; but you have it under your own controul. In that field of battle 
you must trace the line of March. Movements of great danger &amp; irritation seem to me probable in that quarter, that 
may furnish a favourable occasion for your prudent interference. 

We have two aspirants here: both able, &amp; both honest men: 
both regarded throughout the State, rather as looking stead 
ily at the central Government, than as guided by a purely 
South Carolinian spirit. They are therefore not popular. 
Calhoun is rather borne with, than supported. He has talent, 
but without tact or Judgement. Remember, I am giving you, 
what leading and thinking men say. 

Preston has more talent, more tact, more judgement, &amp; is 
as honest as Calhoun. They are on the field of political com 
petition. Preston is more approved. But he is too much of a 
diplomat: too much non committal; too Van Beurenish, but 
much superior to V. Beuren. People distrust him from his 
manner, more than they ought. But he is not popular. He 
has not the leading mark of a great man, he cannot attach 
to himself a corps of personal thorough-going friends. Gen 1 
Hamilton of our State could do that. So does our present 
Governor Butler. Preston moreover is a Virginian. He would 
make a good minister at a foreign Court.

Both these Gentlemen are like me, Nullifiers. They could 
not be sustained out of the State, even if they could command 
South Carolina. It is an unfashionable Garb. It sticks like the 
shirt of Nesus. I am content however to wear it as my wind 
ing sheet. 

You will have no opponents of equal talent, energy, &amp; hon 
esty with these two Gentlemen, whom I regard as hors de 
combat. 

Strange times are approaching. Arrangements ought to be 
made to introduce the Subject; when, where, and how? For 
by the time Congress meets, the pressure will be at its acme, 
and the lower classes will feel it severely. 

I trouble you with these preliminary hints, for the plan of 
the Campain must be thought about. 

Webster will be set up as your Opponent: the South will 
not go for him; &amp; they will go for you in preference. Webster 
has a character for talent, but he is not qualified for a leader. 
He has no personal friends. He is a good partizan parliamen 
tary debater, but he cannot trace out the plan of a political 
Campain, nor is he fit to be at the head of it. I see no fearful 
competitor at present, or in prospect. . . . Adieu.

Dear Sir 

... All to whom I have guardedly spoken, agree with 
me in opinion, decidedly. My friend the Governor has set 
tled with to set up a new paper here; for we cannot make use 
of the Telescope, or the other paper of our town; and the 
strange infatuation of Mr Calhoun as to the presidency must 
be counteracted. I believe M Duffie would go with us strenuously, if it were not for personal regard to Mr Calhoun. You 
have gained over Calcock of Charleston. 

Among our people in Congress, White of Tennessee has 
friends ; but White &amp; Clay have been started on the course, 
and are broken down. Neither can succeed if entered again. 

M r Van Beuren, whom I like personally (for he is a Gentle 
man) will I think carry the next Congress with him. I have 
taken full and effectual care both to him &amp; Mr Poinsett, to 
render mistake impossible as to my opinions. I have stated 
expressly and decidedly that I am a friend to State inter 
position agst an unconstitutional Law, by Nullification. That 
I disapprove of Gen 1 . Jackson s exprints[?] on the finances of 
the Country, and that I consider the treasury circular as tend 
ing in its results to degrade the national credit and character. 
I have found this distinct explanation on my part, necessary. 

// the Congress called in September should resolve on a na 
tional Bank, (which I doubt, for a majority as yet are Van 
Beurenists) it will be, either the readoption of yours, or a new 
establishment at New York, over which you will probably be 
invited to preside. But the measure of misfortune is not yet 
full enough, to drive the friends of General Jackson from their 
insane attempts. I think Mr Van Beuren has committed him 
self to the old man too far; and the call of Congress may be in 
tended to introduce a little welcome force before he yields. . . .

Dear Sir 

. . . The time has not yet arrived for the direct nomi 
nation of any man as future president. But all secondary 
means and appliances may be usefully brought forward, and 

should be so: cast thy bread on the waters, it will be found 
again after many days. 

Webster is a dexterous debater, but he has no judgement, 
no energy, or boldness of character. The man has no per 
sonal courage &amp; cannot succeed : he is made to be governed. 
Here, we should decidedly prefer Van Beuren to Webster. 
But the battle is coming on (may be, literally) between 
the ultra radicalists and the Constitutionalists: if Mr Van 
Beuren has desperate courage enough, we shall have a mo 
narchical government of no liberal character. If not, I see no 
serious obstacle to the success of my proposal. . . . Adieu.

opinions of influential men here are divided about your bank. 
Preston and Hamilton are quietly in your favour. Quietly: 
for the day has not yet arrived to speak out plainly &amp; boldly. 
Three fourths of the business men in our State are with you, 
but I think the time has not come in which we can call them 
out. If I augur rightly from the signs of the Times, a motion 
to reinstate your bank will be made in about 2 years; hardly 
sooner. But the expedients proposed &amp; to be proposed as sub 
stitutes will all fail. I think even the 10 million bill will fail 
to relieve the New York merchants ; and in that case, I dare 
not risk prognosticating the result.

go on gently. It will work its own way, &amp; has probability on 
its side. . . .

October 12, <a href='/results.php?year=1837'>1837</a>.) The returns verified their forecasts. The Whigs carried the 
Assembly by 101 to 27 and 10 of the 22 Senators, showing a gain of 144 on the 
preceding year. (Niles, November 25, <a href='/results.php?year=1837'>1837</a>.) Great was the rejoicing in the Whig 
strongholds over the victory. (Niles, November 18, <a href='/results.php?year=1837'>1837</a>; Adams, J. Q., Memoirs, 
vol. ix, pp. 431, 432.) 

The Democratic papers set to work explaining the cause of their defeat. "To our 
mind," said the Worcester Republican, "there is no mystery to explain in order 
to solve the reasons of the change in the state as well as in the city of New York. 
The city and state are a highly commercial people. They have felt severely the 
pressure in the money market for the last two months and upwards. And this is the 
strongest argument that can be urged to men in their wants. ... It has been urged 
against the administration that its course of policy has been the cause of the diffi 
culties and pressure in the money market. This has been too successfully urged." 
(Worcester Republican, November 22, <a href='/results.php?year=1837'>1837</a>.) "The late elections," reiterated the 
Globe, "have been carried under the influence of a panic excited by a false issue." 
(Globe, quoted in Wooster (Ohio) Republican A dvocate, November 23, <a href='/results.php?year=1837'>1837</a>.) To 
Jackson the political tornado was caused by the apostasy of the Conservatives, but 
to all it was evident the cry of "hard times " raised so efficiently by the Whigs, had 
worked like magic. (Moore, J. B., Works of James Buchanan, Philadelphia, <a href='/results.php?year=1908'>1908</a>,

currency will not take place among us unless by returning 
into the beaten road we have unwisely quitted. But the neces 
sity must be felt, ere it is adopted. Of course your friends 
&amp; the friends of your institution must permit the course of 
events to guide their course. Van Beuren cannot make head 
agst Clay, unless he goes in good earnest for the South, which 
I think he will do. Strange to say, I hear no objection to your\ 
talents or your integrity, among those whom I have cau- J 
tiously sounded, but they all object to you as being in want or 
the necessary knowledge and experience as a party politician. 
To be sure, like the modest girl in Magdalen, who was ad 
vised to go out and qualify herself for admittance, you might 
go for a session into that house of ill fame the H. of Rep. in 
Congress, with political morals sufficiently debauched to 
become a president; but I sh d . not recommend this course of 
education as indispensible. My own opinion is, that the regu 
lar course of events will ere long point out the course you 
might be able to adopt. . . .

Dear Sir 

I wish to state why I penned the communication I 
have lately sent. You need not write to me in reply, but re 
flect on my suggestions. I. Webster, Clay, Van Beuren, are the 
next presidential Candidates. Clay goes for a national bank, 
but not for yours. Van Beuren wishes to be driven into the 
adoption of one at Washington, under his eye &amp; control. 

I think Clay looks to the same Site, for the same reason. 

Whether Webster goes with you or not, I cannot tell : prob 
ably yes. 

If Clay can get the votes of New York or Pennsylvania, 
his chances for election are good. Van Beuren will get per 
haps a majority of the South: I greatly dislike the ultra 
federalism of Webster, but it is clear to me, your interest is 
allied to his; and that his success depends on overcoming the 
reasonable republican prejudices of New York &amp; Pennsyl 
vania against him. 

Hence, it is of great importance, if you wish a reinstatement, 

to stand fair before the populace in a political point of view. 
Without this, you cannot counteract Clay: I should say, keep 
up the ball I have thrown up into the air by frequent discus 
sions in the papers. You have honest, honourable, popular 
| ground to place your foot on, firmly. . . . These are my no- 
l tions; I have no desire to know yours: therefore you need not 
write to me on the subject. I send directions, to make up, the 
part of my communication which was omitted for want of 
documents. I remain with kind respects . . .

Dear Sir. 

To the following letter make no reply. If I say any thing that has not occurred to you before, which is very unlikely, use it in your own way. 

My original proposal met with the concurrence of every sensible man to whom I stated it, as a desirable event if it 
could be carried. But all doubted its present practicability, from the prevailing ignorance &amp; prejudice about Banks. 
That prejudice is evanescing. But I think, the matter may be managed some years hence, if you take advantage of a 
stepping stone, which I am persuaded is likely to be placed for your accomodation. I see clearly that H. Clay is likely 
to be the successful candidate. Harrison is out of the question. So is that very able man Webster. I think, Clay does not 
mean to advocate your bank as the national Bank. In fact, You are that Bank. When you quit it, you carry with you 
its Character. All the good it does, and great good it has done, is not given as credit to the Bank, but to Nicholas Biddle. It is all imputed righteousness to yourself, and when it is managed by other heads, it will be difficult to support J its present reputation. 

Why not take Woodbury's place under Clay? Then the national bank will be your Bank an appropriate field of 
usefulness and reputation will be open to you you will have made a great step upwards and it will be your own 
fault, if you do not make the next step into the chair which you ought to occupy. 

Probably you and H. Clay may have come to an understanding about this; for I am not unaware that the opportunity has occured. Remember, I enter my 8oth year this 
month; &amp; I am talking of probabilities which cannot be realized till I am in the grave. In meantime, if any preliminary movements before the public should be needed, command me if I am living at the time. But I shall not last long. 
I have had my three warnings. Adieu.
