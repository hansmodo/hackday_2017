Washington 20. Dec: 1831. 

Tuesday Eve: 

My dear Sir, 

This is merely to report my arrival &amp; that I am quartered at Barnard s Hotel. 

I had some talk with my companion, the Senator, 1 who 
seems disposed to give all the aid he can, tho he hangs in 
doubt as to the policy of starting the application now, unless 
it can be ascertained that we have 2/3 ds , in asmuch as he 
has lately had intimations, from a quarter w h he considers 
entitled to full credit, leading him to apprehend a Veto, on 
a smaller vote: at the same time he acknowledges that the 
chances of such negative may be greater after the Election. 
Of his Colleague &amp; Brother in Law (W.) he speaks doubtingly. He will give me however all he can gather about him, 
as well as about the members below from Penns a &amp; says he 
will help along. I have sent a note to Mr M c Lane, asking to 
fix a time tomorrow morning to talk with me, &amp; you shall 
hear from me after seeing him. 2

Barnard s 3 Washington 

(Private) 21. Dec. 1831. 

My dear Sir, 

I yesterday reported my arrival. I have had this morning a long &amp; frank conversation with Mr M c Lane. He says 
positively that the President will reject the Bill, if the matter is 
agitated this Session. He (the Pres*.) &amp; those about him w d 
regard the movement, before the election, as an act of hostility, or as founded on the idea that his opinions w* 1 bend to 
personal views, &amp; that his fears w d induce him to truckle. Mr ML. is sure that under such circumstances he w d apply his 
veto, even if certain that he w d thereby lose the Election. The 
question he says cannot now be started without being regarded as a party one, &amp; the influence of the government w d 
be thrown upon it so that we should lose a large number of 
votes which under other circumstances we should gain 
the rejection not being considered as a final one as the 
question may be renewed at the next session, or a subsequent 
one, the Veto once given the President w d never swerve, &amp; 
that 2/3 ds w d be required on any subsequent trial. Accordingly to the Sec y s view of it, therefore, we are now to see 
whether we can rely on 2/3 ds under the circumstances averted to, namely the operation of party feeling, &amp; Gov 4 
influence and to that inquiry I devote myself. Mr . M C L. seems to have canvassed the Senate thoroughly, &amp; we have 
gone over the names together. He gives us Maine, Mass" 3 Rhode Is d Connecticut &amp; Vermont two each &amp; New Hampshire making 1 1

If M c L. s views are right (&amp; he tells me they are chiefly 
founded on personal communications) this is discouraging 
as to the present session. As to the H.of R. heconsiders Maine

Miss 1 doubtful, Missouri pro I. 

These are Mr M c Lane s impressions. All will be cautiously 

sifted by information from other quarters. 

I have seen M c Duffie, &amp; am to have my talk with him 
tomorrow morning: Had a note also from Gen 1 Smith with 
whom I am to confer. 9 P.M. I have just left Mr M c Lane 
with whom I have passed the Eve. We have gone over 
the ground again he re-iterating &amp; enforcing his views &amp; 
opinions as before expressed, amounting to this if you 
apply now, you assurdedly will fail if you wait, you will as 
certainly succeed. He thinks Gen 1 . J. will hereafter sign the 
Bill, if it appears that a large portion of the People are for the 
Bank. He tells me Cass Livingston &amp; Barry are decidedly for 
the Bank, &amp; Woodbury also favorable to it the 2 later 
w d work against it if the question is agitated before the Elec 
tion. Taney fixed against us he is latterly radical on all 
points par example , he thinks the Judges ought to hold 
their appointments only for 4 or 5 years. I write, as my letter 
shews, hastily no time to read over People calling 
all the P.M. &amp; it is now being late. I will get together before I 
leave this place materials on which the Board may make cal 
culations giving as I shall do, the authorities on w h I de 
pend. My object is to correct the votes on w h we may rely 
in case of an application at this Session. With that informa 
tion before us, the decision may readily be made. 

I have a great deal of private matter opened to me w h will better to talk than to write on.

Barnard s 22. Dec: 1831 

My dear Sir, 

I yesterday gave you the ideas of Mr McLane &amp; have to day had a conference with Mr McDuffie. He leans strongly 
to an immediate application but is much staggered by what I learned from M C L. He now thinks we must ascertain our 
strength carefully &amp; not start the business unless sure of a majority under the circumstances adverted to in my last. 
He was entirely candid &amp; confidential has no good will to the Administration &amp; is disposed to view their movements 
with doubt &amp; suspicion. He will not give up the idea that the 
P. will be more likely to sign the bill now than after the Election, &amp; under any circumstance he thinks we ought to go on, 
if we can poll a certain majority. Let the P. then veto, if he 
finds freedom to do so in the face of his Message &amp; M c L s 
Report &amp; we may bring on the measure with a fair chance 
of the 2/3 ds next year. We are now getting exact information as to the vote in w h he will help. Tomorrow after ten, 
I meet Gen 1 Smith &amp; dine with him &amp; M c Duffie at Mr McLanes. That triumvirate &amp; my unworthy self are to discuss the subject in conclave at the Sec y s office on Saturday 
Eve. 

All our Penns 3 members of the H. of R. (except Horn, Dewart, * &amp; Mann) are said to be for us, even in the teeth of 
the P that part I shall better sift, before I rely on all - Ford &amp;King, I do not feel sure of. I shall look closely at those 
of them who voted for Stevenson, fearing their steadiness in acting counter to Executive influence. M C D. doubts 
whether that feeling will operate as powerfully as has been supposed he calculates on the odium it w d produce, affect 
ing equally the acting &amp; the acted upon. 

Observe that I give you, as I go along, what I hear from others. When I get all the materials to be gathered, &amp; hear 
all opinions, I shall make up my own. The conference of Saturday Eve: may perhaps open new lights tho there 
will be in it more of diplomatic reserve than in my previous tete-a-tetes with the Individuals. I keep my eyes &amp; ears 
sharply open &amp; hear a great deal more than seems to be worth recollecting 

I am interrupted &amp; must close

Barnards 

My dear Sir, 

Gen. Smith entirely goes with the administration in his 
objections to the agitation of the question at this Session 
it will be made a Jackson &amp; anti-Jackson vote, as he says, 
it being entirely impossible to persuade the Pres t that we 
are acting under any other than a hostile feeling to him. 
Under that view of the subject, in a vote of this Session, Smith 
says, we lose in the Senate 10 votes which we might count 
in our favor next year viz; 

Jersey i. Dickerson 

Penns a 2 (Dallas told S. so. Wilkins is certain for the party) 

Maryland I (Smith* ! ! ! as he himself tells me.) 

N.Car: I. (Mangum) 

Georgia I. (Forsyth) 



From Thomas Cadwalader 153 

Mississippi I . (Pointdexter not certain as he is sound 

with the Pres 1 :) 
Illinois 2 (Kane &amp; Robinson (both supposed friendly 

but strong party men) 

Indiana I (Hendricks doubtful if he w d vote for us at 
10 all another man to be in Hanna s place 
dead contra. 

* Smith failing us, you will think the question settled for 
this session &amp; so it is, unless we can turn the administra 
tion men from their objections to a present movement of it. 
This I shall perhaps know in a few days. The conference with 
M c Lane, Smith &amp; M c Duffie is put off to Sunday. Gen 1 . S. 
&amp; also M C L. &amp; M C D. advert often to the general impression 
that the Bank operates powerfully ag* the Jackson party 
they themselves having no such notion: I have said to each 
of them that your Letter Book J contains the best evidence 
to the contrary &amp; would shew, if it c d be looked into, that we 
not only endeavour to keep the Bank &amp; city offices out of the 
political vortex, but dissuade the officers of the Institution 
from being prominent as party men. I recollect letters to that 
point extracts from which c d be used in a quiet way by Smith, 
as he thinks, with a powerful effect I advise you sending 
them if no objection strikes you to your so doing. . . . 

I therefore now close with one remark that as far as 
my consultations with our friends have gone, the Jackson 
portion of them argue against starting the question at this 
Session and the Clay portion are equally anxious for its 
present agitation. . . .

25 Dec: 1831 

My dear Sir 

My last letter to you was of Friday I have yet rec d no communications from you. Yours of the 23 d is just 
brought in &amp; contents noted. This morning was appointed for the conference between the Sec y : G 1 Smith Mr M c Duffie &amp; 
myself, the Secy: is however ill, in bed &amp; we must await his convalescence. 

I have had much talk with Mr Webster (who is now at Annapolis) Mr . Silbee present. He (W.) seems decidedly for starting the memorial if we are sure of a bare majority in the 

2 Houses &amp; even indeed if we are sure of a majority in H. 
of R. where we of course must begin. He says the Senate 
will not throw out the Bill., if passed below &amp; he thinks the 



156 Correspondence of Nicholas Bid die 

Pres*. will not reject it threaten as he may at present, 
entre nous, it is evident that W s opinions are guided, in some 
degree, by party feelings as seems to be the Case with 
most of the Clay men. I must therefore measure opinions with 
fair allowances, Mr Adams, with whom I have consulted, &amp; 
with whom I shall again confer takes cooler views &amp; is 
more disposed to look at the question under all its aspects; 
leans towards postponing unless a strong vote can be ascer 
tained. Having rec d the N. York reports this morning, I be 
lieve I may now sum up our supporters in that delegation at 
14 three others are marked doubtful. In Maine, from the 
best information I can get we shall have I. vote (Evans) 
we certainly have all the Mass" 3 R. I d Conn 4 : &amp; Vermont

as Dallas tells me) &amp; Mann (perhaps) Delaware I. Mary

With us another time Dickerson Smith Forsyth 
&amp; Grundy perhaps Brown say 5 = making 29 or 30 on 
another occasion. Under these circumstances M c Duffie 
leans in favor of going it now &amp; so do I but we think it 
best not to decide till after the Conference with McLane &amp; 
Smith. We have full confidence in M c L s candour as to his 
belief that J. will put on his veto but the old Gent m may 
shake in his intentions and, if he return the Bill, he may 
state objections that perhaps may be yielded to by us. 
We sh d in fact have hopes of him on a future occasion, if he 
takes any other than the broad ground of the constitution. 
We might be blamed for losing this Session (the long one 
moreover) &amp; tho we go counter to the administration men 
who are interested in postponing, we keep the other party 

with us some of whom w d be lukewarm, Webster w d be 
cold, 1 or perhaps hostile, if we bend to the Gov* influence. 
I do not yet decide but incline to suppose that after the 
council at the Treasury, I shall advise the Com 66 to start 
the memorial. I shall not do so however unless M c Dume s 
opinion is decidedly that way, for he is our main stay &amp; 
if we make a blunder I have told him that I shall throw it on 
him. 

All agree that when started, the H. of R. must lead &amp; 
all say it will not be committed to the Com 66 of W. &amp; M. but 
to a special one 7. will be the number &amp; of course the 
Speaker will appoint 4 for &amp; 3 against so say M c Duffie 
&amp; all no danger of his breaking a custom so fixed. Every 
thing then depends on having the proper man as chair 
man. M c Duffie promised to move the Commitment of the 
Memorial w h puts him in that position &amp; thus gives us a 
fair chance.

Washington 26 Dec: 1831 

My dear Sir: 

I have your letter of Saturday night (24 th ins 1 .) and am glad to find the leaning of your mind, as to the question of present action or postponement, to be in the direction of my own notions . . . 

In my estimates of votes I counted Findlay of Ohio as for 
us he is decidedly adverse. We have however Gen 1 Dun 
can of Illinois our firm friend who was considered against 

1 Professor Catterall, in his book on the Second Bank of the United States 
makes the statement, on page 218, that this remark was made in a footnote by 
Cadwalader. However, the above extract shows that it was in the regular context 
of the letter. 



From Thomas Cadwalader 159 

us &amp; I have reason to hope that several of those marked 
doubtful on my list will be on our side . . . 

I shall not consult Dallas &amp; Wilkins as to the policy of act 
ing now knowing they w d incline to postpone &amp; not 
wishing to ask advice, under strong probabilities of going 
against it. They are now well inclined to help us to votes 
&amp; Wilkins, tho always protesting for non-commitment on the 
B k question, is, as I verily think, more warm in our cause 
than D being more linked in the great points of State In 
terest to w h , as he admits the extinction of the B k w d 
carry a death blow. On tariff &amp; internal improvements he is 
Quixotic Dallas has a cooler head, if not heart. . . . 

My yesterdays Letter gave my ideas as to the modus ope- 
randi in the H. of R. if now to go on. I am more in doubt 
as to the course in the Senate when the Bill goes up. As to 
Smith, after his confession to me of adhesion to Palace in 
fluence we must understand with him, in a candid &amp; friendly 
way, that he must hold back, &amp; that some other Champion 
must head our Column who it ought to be is the question 
as to power of talent, we w d at once designate Webster 
but the name carries a deadly bearing of party feeling, 
w h it seems to me w d counterbalance the good we might de 
rive from him in other respects. M c . Duffie may perhaps 
enlighten me in the darkness in w h I confess myself now to 
be enveloped &amp; I mention the difficulty, now in time, to 
you, for the benefit of your views . . . 

Expect, very shortly after that Conference at the Treasury, 
to receive my opinion as to the policy of now presenting the 
memorials or waiting for a less stormy occasion. You may 
as well have the papers ready.

Washington 26. Dec 1831 

My dear Sir 

Your last letter is of Saturday night (23 d ins 1 ) ans d 
by me yesterday Nothing to day from you. 

M r Peter R. Livingston x (Brother of the Sec y : of State, 
in whose House he is living) came to see me last Eve. He is 
strongly of opinion that we ought to start an application now. 
He says his Brother M c Lane &amp; Cass 2 w d prevent the veto 
tho they are all desirous of saving the Pres fc . from the neces- 

1 Peter Livingston was largely instrumental for the election of William H. 
Seward as Governor of New York in 1834. "Livingston had been a wheel horse 
in the party of Jefferson. He had served in the Senate with Van Buren; he had taken 
a leading part in the convention of 1821, and he had held with distinction the 
speakership of the Assembly and the presidency of the Senate. His creed was love 
of republicanism and hatred of Clinton. At one time he was the faithful follower, 
the enthusiastic admirer, almost the devotee of Van Buren; and, so long as the 
Kinderhook statesman opposed Clinton he needed Livingston. But when the time 
came that Van Buren must conciliate Clinton., Livingston was dropped from the 
Senate. The consequences were far more serious than Van Buren intended. Liv 
ingston was as able as he was eloquent and Van Buren s coalition with Clinton 
quickly turned Livingston s ability and eloquence to the support of Clay. Then 
he openly joined the Whigs." Alexander, De Alva S., A Political History of New 
York (New York, 1909), vol. i, pp. 402, 403. 

2 Lewis Cass did not agree with President Jackson in his attack on the Bank. On 
September 23, 1833, Cass made an appointment with Lewis to discuss the matter 
of the removal of the deposits. "Cass commenced the conversation," wrote Lewis, 
"by remarking that his object in desiring to see me before I left was to inform 
me that he had determined to resign his seat in the cabinet, and wished to con 
verse with me upon the subject before he handed his letter of resignation to the 
President. He said he differed with the President with regard to the measures 
which were about to be adopted for the removal of the public deposits from the 
United States Bank, and as his remaining in the cabinet might embarrass his 
operations, he owed it, he thought, both to himself and the President to with 
draw." Lewis urged him to acquaint Jackson. Cass was finally induced to remain 
in the Cabinet, but in a later Cabinet meeting, when asked his opinon on the meas 
ure, Cass simply and frankly said: "You know, sir, I have always thought that 
the matter rests entirely with the secretary of the treasury." McLaughlin, A. C., 
Lewis Cass (Boston, 1898), pp. 154, 155. 



To Samuel Smith 1 6 1 

sity of acting one way or the other, before the Election they 
look to Penns a with great anxiety. M c . Lane calculated in his 
talks with me on half that delegation voting postponement, 
in conformity with the wishes of the administration phalanx. 
Now I do not think they can shake more than four of them, if 
so many &amp; the more I see of the Senators D. &amp; W. the 
more satisfied am I that the opinions lately expressed as to 
their votes are well founded. They are strongly inclined to 
aid the wishes of the Palace men in dissuading from moving 
the question this Session but whenever moved they must 
support it. 

M r . Livingston has been, as you know, an active &amp; power 
ful worker in the politics of N York. He enters zealously into 
this B k question (probably from Party feeling a Mem 
ber of the Clay Convention) besides the 14 favorable votes of 
his State on w h I have before counted, he says he can, &amp; will, 
bring over some of those marked on my list as doubtful 
viz: Angel, Babcock, Cooke, Hogan, Lansing, Lent, Pierson, 
Reed &amp; Soule. He is now engaged in that good work &amp; is to 
report the result. When the subject comes up much warmth, 
say indeed violence, is to be expected &amp; we may find some 
shaking, on whose firmness we now count. I am fully in the 
belief, however, that we shall gain more from those marked 
"uncertain" &amp; now by me counted as adverse, than will 
make up any losses from my present list of yeas. . . .
