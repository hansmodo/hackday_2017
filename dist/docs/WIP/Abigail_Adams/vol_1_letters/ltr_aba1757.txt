MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
IF I was certain I should welcome you to your native land in the course of the summer, I should not regret Mr. Smith s going abroad without me. Should 
it be otherwise, should you still be detained abroad, I must submit, satisfied that you judge best, and that 
you would not subject me to so heavy a disappointment, or yourself to so severe a mortification as I 
flatter myself it would be, but for the general good. A European life, would, you say, be the ruin of our 
children. If so, I should be as loth as you to hazard their imbibing sentiments and opinions, which might 
make them unhappy in a sphere of life, which t'is probable they must fill, not by indulging in luxuries 
for which it is more than possible they might con tract a taste and inclination, but in studious and laborious pursuits. 
</p><p>
You have before this day received a joint commission for forming a commercial treaty with Britain. 
I am at a loss to determine whether you will consider yourself so bound by it, as to tarry longer abroad. 
Perhaps there has been no juncture in the public affairs of our country, not even in the hour of our 
deepest distress, when able statesmen and wise counsellors were more wanted than at the present day. 
Peace abroad leaves us at leisure to look into our own domestic affairs. Although, upon an estimate of our 
national debt, it appears but as the -small dust of the balance when compared to the object we have obtained, and the benefits we have secured, yet the 
restless spirit of man will not be restrained ; and we have reason to fear, that domestic jars and confusion will take place of foreign contentions and devastation. Congress have commuted with the army, by engaging to them five years pay in lieu of half-pay 
for life. With security for this, they will disband contented ; but our wise legislators are about disputing the power of Congress to do either, without considering their hands in the mouth of the lion, and that, if the just and necessary food is not supplied, the outrageous animal may become so ferocious as to spread 
horror and devastation. Another Theseus may arise, who, by his reputation and exploits of valor, his personal character and universal popularity, may destroy our Amphictyonic system, and subjugate our infant republic to monarchical domination.

Our House of Representatives is this year com posed of more than a hundred new members, some 
of whom, no doubt, are good men. Nearly all the able and skilful members, who composed the last 
House, have lost their seats by voting for the return of Mr. Brattle, notwithstanding the strongest evidence 
in his favor, and the many proofs which were produced of his friendly conduct towards America. For 
this crime, our worthy friend Mr. Cranch was drop ped by this town. The Senate is a loser this year, 
by the resignation of some excellent members. We have in this State an impost of five per cent., and 
an excise act, whilst the neighbouring States have neither. Foreigners, finding this the case, carry 
their cargoes to other States. At this the merchant grumbles, he farmer groans with his taxes, and the 
mechanic for want of employ. Heaven avert, that, like the Greek republics, we should, by civil dissension, weaken our power and crush our rising greatness, that the blood of our citizens should be shed in vain, and the labor and toil of our statesmen be finally baffled through niggardly parsimony, lavish 
prodigality, or ignorance of our real interests. We want a Solomon in wisdom, to guide and conduct this great people at this critical era, when the counsels which are taken and the measures which are pursued will mark our future character, either with honor and fame, or disgrace and infamy. In adversity, we have conducted with prudence and magnanimity. Heaven forbid that we should grow giddy with prosperity ; or the height, to which we have soared, render a fall conspicuously fatal. 
</p><p>
Thus far I had written when your welcome favor of March 28th reached me. I was not disappointed 
in finding you uncertain with regard to the time of your return. Should the appointment, which I fear and you have hinted at, take place, it would indeed 
be a dull day to me. I have not a wish to join in a scene of life so different from that, in which I have 
been educated, and in which my early, and, I must suppose, happier days, have been spent. Curiosity satisfied, and I shall sigh for tranquil scenes, 
</p><p>
" And wish that Heaven had left me still 
The whispering zephyr and the purling rill." 
</p><p>
Well-ordered home is my chief delight, and the affectionate, domestic wife, with the relative duties 
which accompany that character, my highest ambition. It was the disinterested wish of sacrificing 
my personal feelings to the public utility, which first led me to think of unprotectedly hazarding a voyage. 
I say unprotectedly, for so I consider every lady, who is not accompanied by her husband. This 
objection could only be surmounted by the earnest wish I had to soften those toils which were not to be 
dispensed with ; and, if the public welfare required your labors and exertions abroad, I flattered myself 
that, if I could be with you, it might be in my power to contribute to your happiness and pleasure. But 
the day is now arrived, when, with honor and well-earned fame, you may return to your native land ; 
when I cannot any longer consider it as my duty to submit to a further separation ; and when it appears 
necessary, that those abilities, which have crowned you with laurels abroad, shall be exerted at home for the public safety. 
</p><p>
I do not wish you to accept an embassy to England, should you be appointed. This little cottage 
has more heart-felt satisfaction for you than the most brilliant court can afford. 
</p><p>
I will bid you good night. Yours, 
</p><p>
