I SUPPOSE you have had a formidable account of the 
alarm we had last Sunday morning. When I rose, 
about six o'clock, I was told, that the drums had been 
some time beating, and that three alarm guns were 
fired ; that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=weymouth" rel="city">Weymouth</a> bell had been ringing, and 
Mr. Weld's was then ringing. I immediately sent 
off an express to know the occasion, and found the whole town in confusion. Three sloops and one 
cutter had come out and dropped anchor just below 
Great Hill. It was difficult to tell their designs ; 
some supposed they were coming to Germantown, 
others, to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=weymouth" rel="city">Weymouth</a> ; people, women, children, 
from the iron-works, came flocking down this way ; 
every woman and child driven off from below my 
father's ; my father's family flying. The Doctor l is 
in great distress, as you may well imagine, for my 
aunt had her bed thrown into a cart into which she 
got herself, and ordered the boy to drive her to 
Bridgewater, which he did. The report was to them, 
that three hundred had landed, and were upon their 
march up into town. The alarm flew like lightning, 
and men from all parts came flocking down, till two 
thousand were collected. But, it seems, their expedition was to Grape Island for Levett's hay. There 
it was impossible to reach them, for want of boats ; 
but the sight of so many persons, and the firing at 
them, prevented their getting more than three tons of 
hay, though they had carted much more down to the 
water. At last a lighter was mustered, and a sloop 
from Hingham, which had six port holes. Our men 
eagerly jumped on board, and put off for the island. 
As soon as they perceived it, they decamped. Our 
people landed upon the island, and in an instant set 
fire to the hay, which, with the barn, was soon consumed ; about eighty tons, it is said. We expect 
soon to be in continual alarms, till something decisive takes place. We wait, with longing expectation, 
in hopes to hear the best accounts from you, with 
regard to union and harmony, &c. We rejoice 
greatly on the arrival of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ben" rel="friend">Dr. Franklin</a>, as he must 
certainly be able to inform you very particularly of 
the situation of affairs in England. I wish you 
would, if you can get time, be as particular as you 
may, when you write, Every one hereabouts comes 
to me, to hear what accounts I have. I was so un 
lucky, as not to get the letter you wrote at New 
York. Captain Beale forgot it, and left it behind. 
We have a flying report here, with regard to New 
York, but cannot give any credit to it, as yet, that 
they had been engaged, with the ships, which Gage 
sent there, and had taken them, with great loss upon both sides. 
</p><p>
Yesterday we had an account of three ships com 
ing into <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. I believe it is true, as there was a 
salute from the other ships, though I have not been 
able to learn from whence they come. I suppose you 
have had an account of the fire, which did much 
damage to the warehouses, and added greatly to the 
distresses of the inhabitants, whilst it continued. The 
bad conduct of General Gage was the means of its 
doing so much damage. 
</p><p>
Our house has been, upon this alarm, in the same scene of confusion, that it was upon the former. 
soldiers coming in for a lodging, for breakfast, for supper, for drink, &c. Sometimes refugees from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, tired and fatigued, seek an asylum for a day, 
a night, a week. You can hardly imagine how we live ; yet, 
</p><p>
"To the houseless child of want 
Our doors are open still ; 
And, though our portions are but scant, 
We give them with good will." 
</p><p>
My best wishes attend you, both for your health 
and happiness, and that you may be directed into the 
wisest and best measures for our safety, and the 
security of our posterity. I wish you were nearer to 
us ; we know not what a day will bring forth, nor 
what distress one hour may throw us into. Hitherto 
I have been able to maintain a calmness and presence of mind, and hope I shall, let the exigency of 
the time be what it will. Adieu, breakfast calls. 
Your affectionate 
</p><p>
