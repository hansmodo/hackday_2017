I DO not feel easy more than two days together 
without writing to you. If you abound, you must 
lay some of the fault upon yourself, who have made 
such sad complaints for letters ; but I really believe 
I have written more than all -my sister delegates. 
There is nothing new transpired since I wrote you 
last, but the sailing of some transports, and five deserters having come into our camp. One of them 
is gone, I hear, to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. I think I should be 
cautious of him. No one can tell the secret designs 
of such fellows, whom no oath binds. He may be sent with assassinating designs. I can credit any 
villany, that a Caesar Borgia would have been guilty 
of, or Satan himself would rejoice in. Those who 
do not scruple to bring poverty, misery, slavery, and 
death upon thousands, will not hesitate at the most 
diabolical crimes ; and this is Britain. Blush, O 
Americans, that ever you derived your origin from such a race.

We learn from one of these deserters, that our 
ever valued friend, Warren, dear to us even in death, 
was not treated with any more respect than a common soldier ; but the savage wretches, called officers, 
consulted together, and agreed to sever his head 
from his body and carry it in triumph to Gage, who 
no doubt would have " grinned horribly a ghastly 
smile," instead of imitating Caesar, who far from being gratified with so horrid a spectacle as the head 
even of his enemy, turned away from Pompey's with 
disgust, and gave vent to his pity in a flood of tears. 
How much does Pagan tenderness put Christian 
benevolence to shame ! What humanity could not 
obtain, the rites and ceremonies of a mason demand 
ed. An officer, who, it seems, was one of the brother 
hood, requested, that as a mason, he might have the 
body unmangled, and find a decent interment for it. 
He obtained his request, but, upon returning to secure 
it, he found it already thrown into the earth, only with 
the ceremony of being first placed there with many 
bodies over him ;

" Nor writ his name, whose tomb should pierce the skies."

" Glows my resentment into guilt? What guilt 
Can equal violations of the dead? 
The dead how sacred ! Sacred is the dust 
Of this heaven-labored form, erect, divine ! 
This heaven-assumed, majestic robe of earth."

Thus far I wrote and broke off; hearing there was 
a probability of your return, I thought not to send it ; 
but the reception of yours this morning, of July 23d, 
makes me think the day further off than I hoped. I 
therefore will add a few lines, though very unfit. I 
went out yesterday to attend the funeral of the poor 
fellow who, the night before, fell in battle, as they 
were returning from the lighthouse ; I caught some 
cold. Sabbath evening there was a warm fire from 
Prospect Hill and Bunker's Hill, begun first by the 
riflemen taking off their guard. Two men upon our 
side were killed ; five of their guards were killed, 
two taken. I believe my account will be very con 
fused, but I will relate it as well as I am able. Sabbath evening a number of men, in whaleboats, went 
off from Squantum and Dorchester, to the lighthouse, 
where the general, Gage, had again fixed up a lamp, 
and sent twelve carpenters to repair it. Our people 
went on amidst a hot fire from thirty marines, who 
were placed there as a guard to the Tory carpenters, 
burnt the dwell inghouse, took the Tories and twenty- 
eight marines, killed the lieutenant and one man, 
brought off all the oil and stores which were sent, 
without the loss of a man, until they were upon their 
return ; when they were so closely pursued, that they 
were obliged to run one whaleboat ashore, and leave 
her to them ; the rest arrived safe, except the unhappy youth, whose funeral I yesterday attended, who 
received a ball through the temple, as he was rowing 
the boat. He belonged to Rhode Island. His name 
was Griffin. He, with four wounded marines, was 
brought by Captain Turner to Germantown, and 
buried from there with the honors of war. Mr. Wi- 
bird, upon the occasion, made the best oration (he 
never prays, you know,) I ever heard from him. The 
poor wounded fellows (who were all wounded in 
their arms) desired they might attend. They did, 
and he very pathetically addressed them, with which 
they appeared affected. I spoke with them, I told 
them, it was very unhappy that they should be obliged 
to fight their best friends. They said they were sorry ; 
they hoped in God an end would be speedily put to 
the unhappy contest ; when they came, they came in 
the way of their duty, to relieve Admiral Montague, 
with no thought of fighting, but their situation was 
such as obliged them to obey orders ; but they wished 
with all their souls, that they that sent them here 
had been in the heat of the battle ; expressed gratitude at the kindness they received ; and said in that 
they had been deceived, for they were told, if they 
were taken alive, they would be sacrificed by us. 
Dr. Tufts dressed their wounds.

I had a design to write something about a talked 
of appointment of a friend of mine to a judicial department, but hope soon to see that friend, before 
his acceptance may be necessary. I enclose a compliment, copied by a gentleman from a piece in the 
Worcester paper, signed " Lycurgus." 
</p><p>
I can add no more, as the good Colonel Palmer 
waits. Only my compliments to Mrs. Mifflin, and 
tell her I do not know whether her husband is safe 
here. Bellona and Cupid have a contest about him. 
You hear nothing from the ladies but about Major 
Mifflin's easy address, politeness, complaisance, &c. 
T is well he has so agreeable a lady at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>. They know nothing about forts, intrenchments, &c., when they return ; or, if they do, they 
are all forgotten and swallowed up in his accomplishments. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dearest friend, and always believe me 
</p><p>
Unalterably yours,
