MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HAVE lived to see the close of the third year of our separation. This is a melancholy anniversary to 
me, and many tender scenes arise in my mind upon the recollection. I feel unable to sustain even the 
idea, that it will be half that period ere we meet again. Life is too short to have the dearest of its 
enjoyments curtailed ; the social feelings grow callous by disuse, and lose that pliancy of affection 
which sweetens the cup of life as we drink it. The rational pleasures of friendship and society, and 
the still more refined sensations of which delicate minds only are susceptible, like the tender blossom, 
when the rude northern blasts assail them, shrink within and collect themselves together, deprived of 
the all-cheering and beamy influence of the sun. The blossom falls and the fruit withers and decays ; 
but here the similitude fails, for, though lost for the present, the season returns, the tree vegetates anew, 
and the blossom again puts forth. 
</p><p>
But, alas ! with me, those days which are past are gone for ever, and time is hastening on that 
period when I must fall to rise no more, until mortality shall put on immortality, and we shall meet 
again, pure and disembodied spirits. Could we live to the age of the antediluvians, we might better sup 
port this separation ; but, when threescore years and ten circumscribe the life of man, how painful is the 
idea, that, of that short space, only a few years of social happiness are our allotted portion. 
</p><p>
Perhaps I make you unhappy. No. You will enter with a soothing tenderness into my feelings. 
I see in your eyes the emotions of your heart, and hear the sigh that is wafted across the Atlantic to 
the bosom of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aba" rel="me">PORTIA</a>. But the philosopher and the statesman stifles these emotions, and regains a firmness which arrests my pen in my hand.

I received from France by the Alexander yours, bearing no date, but, by the contents, written about 
the same time with those I received by Mr. Guild. Shall I return the compliment, and tell you in a poetical style, 
</p><p>
" Should at my feet the world s great master fall, 
Himself, his world, his throne, I d scorn them all." 
</p><p>
No. Give me the man I love ; you are neither of an age or temper to be allured by the splendor of 
a court, or the smiles of princesses. I never suffered an uneasy sensation on that account. I know 
I have a right to your whole heart, because my own never knew another lord ; and such is my confidence in you, that, if you were not withheld by the 
strongest of all obligations, those of a moral nature, your honor would not suffer you to abuse my confidence. 
</p><p>
But whither am I rambling? We have not any thing in the political way worth noticing. The fleet of our allies still remains with us. 
</p><p>
Who is there left that will sacrifice as others have done? <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aba" rel="me">PORTIA</a>, I think, stands alone, alas, in more 
senses than one. This vessel will convey to you the packets designed for the Firebrand. I hope, unimportant as they are, they will not be lost. 
</p><p>
Shall I close here, without a word of my voyage? I believe it is best to wait a reply, before I say any 
thing further. Our friends desire me to remember them to you. Your daughter, your image, your superscription, desires to be affectionately remembered 
to you. O, how many of the sweet domestic joys do you lose by this separation from your family. I 
have the satisfaction of seeing my children thus far in life behaving with credit and honor. God grant 
the pleasing prospect may never meet with an alloy, and return to me the dear partner of my early years, 
rewarded for his past sacrifices by the consciousness of having been extensively useful, not having lived to himself alone ; and may the approving voice of his 
country crown his later days in peaceful retirement, in the affectionate bosom of 
</p><p>
