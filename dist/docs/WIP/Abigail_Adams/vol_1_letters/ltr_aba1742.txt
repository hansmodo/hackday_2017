Sunday Evening, 27 December, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1778">1778</a>. How lonely are my days? how solitary are, my nights? secluded from all society but my two little 
boys and my domestics. By the mountains of snow which surround me, I could almost fancy myself in Greenland. We have had four of the coldest days 
I ever knew, and they were followed by the severest snow-storm I ever remember. The wind, blowing like a hurricane for fifteen or twenty hours, rendered 
it impossible for man or beast to live abroad, and has blocked up the roads so that they are impassable. A week ago I parted with my daughter, at the request 
of our <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=plymouth" rel="city">Plymouth</a> friends, to spend a month with them ; so that I am solitary indeed. 
</p><p>
Can the best of friends recollect, that for fourteen years past I have not spent a whole winter alone. Some part of the dismal season has heretofore been

It is proper to remark here, that the inattention which called forth these complaints was only apparent, and caused by 
the capture of nearly all the vessels which brought letters. mitigated and softened by the social converse and 
participation of the friend of my youth. 
</p><p>
How insupportable the idea, that three thousand miles and the vast ocean now divide us ! but divide 
only our persons, for the heart of my friend is in the bosom of his partner. More than half a score of 
years has so riveted it there, that the fabric which contains it must crumble into dust ere the particles can be separated ; for

" in one fate, our hearts, our fortunes, 
And our beings blend."

I cannot describe to you how much I was affected the other day with a Scotch song, which was sung to me by a young lady in order to divert a melancholy hour ; but it had quite a different effect, and the native simplicity of it had all the power of a well wrought tragedy. When I could conquer my sensibility I begged the song, and Master Charles has learned it, and consoles his mamma by singing it to her. I will enclose it to you. It has beauties in it to me, which an indifferent person would not feel 
perhaps. 
</p><p>
" His very foot has music in t, 
As he comes up the stairs." 
</p><p>
How oft has my heart danced to the sound of that music? 
</p><p>
" And shall I see his face again? 
And shall I hear him speak? " 
</p><p>
Gracious Heaven ! hear and answer my daily petition, by banishing all my grief. 
</p><p>
I am sometimes quite discouraged from writing. So many vessels are taken, that there is little chance 
of a letter's reaching your hands. That I meet with so few returns, is a circumstance that lies heavy at 
my heart. If this finds its way to you, it will go by the Alliance. By her I have written before. She 
has not yet sailed, and I love to amuse myself with my pen, and pour out some of the tender sentiments 
of a heart overflowing with affection, not for the eye of a cruel enemy, who, no doubt, would ridicule 
every humane and social sentiment, long ago grown callous to the finer sensibilities, but for the sympathetic heart that beats in unison with
