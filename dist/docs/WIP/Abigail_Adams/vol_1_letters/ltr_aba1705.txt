THE great distance between us makes the time appear very long to me. It seems already a month 
since you left me. The great anxiety I feel for my 
country, for you, and for our family, renders the day 
tedious, and the night unpleasant. The rocks and 
quicksands appear upon every side. What course 
you can or will take is all wrapped in the bosom of 
futurity. Uncertainty and expectation leave the 
mind great scope. Did ever any kingdom or state/ 
regain its liberty, when once it was invaded, with 
out bloodshed? I cannot think of it without horror. 
Yet we are told, that all the misfortunes of Sparta 
were occasioned by their too great solicitude for 
present tranquillity, and, from an excessive love of 
peace, they neglected the means of making it sure 
and lasting. They ought to have reflected, says Polybius, that, " as there is nothing more desirable or 
advantageous than peace, when founded in justice 
and honor, so there is nothing more shameful, and 
at the same time more pernicious, when attained by 
bad measures, and purchased at the price of liberty." I have received a most charming letter from 
our friend Mrs. Warren. She desires me to tell you that her best wishes attend you through your journey, both as a friend and a patriot, hopes you will have no uncommon difficulties to surmount, or hostile 
movements to impede you, but, if the Locrians 
should interrupt you, she hopes that you will beware, 
that no future annals may say you chose an ambitious Philip for your leader, who subverted the noble 
order of the American Amphictyons, and built up a monarchy on the ruins of the happy institution.

I have taken a very great fondness for reading 
Rollin's Ancient History since you left me. I am 
determined to go through with it, if possible, in these 
my days of solitude. I find great pleasure and entertainment from it, and I have persuaded Johnny to 
read me a page or two every day, and hope he will, 
from his desire to oblige me, entertain a fondness for 
it. We have had a charming rain, which lasted 
twelve hours, and has greatly revived the dying fruits of the earth.

I want much to hear from you. I long impatiently 
to have you upon the stage of action. The first of 
September, or the month of September, perhaps, may 
be of as much importance to Great Britain, as the Ides 
of March were to Caesar. I wish you every public, 
as well as private blessing, and that wisdom which is 
profitable both for instruction and edification, to conduct you in this difficult day. The little flock remember papa, and kindly wish to see him ; so does your most affectionate
