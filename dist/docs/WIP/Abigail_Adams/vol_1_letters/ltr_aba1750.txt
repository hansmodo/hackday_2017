MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
LAST evening General Lincoln called here, introducing to me a gentleman, by the name of Colonel Laurens, the son, as I suppose, of your much esteemed 
friend, the late President of Congress ; who informed me, that he expected to sail for France in a few 
days, and would take despatches from me. Although I closed letters to you, by way of Holland, a few 
days ago, I would not omit so good an opportunity as the present. T'is a long time since the date of 
your last letters, the 25th of September. I wait with much anxiety, listening to the sound of every gun, 
but none announce the arrival of the Fame, from Holland, which we greatly fear is taken or lost, or 
the Mars, from France. Colonel Laurens is enabled, I suppose, to give you every kind of intelligence respecting the army, which you may wish to learn. 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure to inform you, that a repeal of the obnoxious tender act has passed the House and 
Senate. The Governor, as has been heretofore predicted, when any thing not quite popular is in agitation, has the gout, and is confined to his bed. A 
false weight and a false balance are an abomination, and in that light this tender act must be viewed by every impartial person. Who, but an idiot, would 
believe that forty were equal to seventy-five? But the repeal gives us reason to hope, that justice and 
righteousness will again exalt our nation ; that public faith will be restored ; that individuals will lend to the public ; and that the heavy taxes, which now distress all orders, will be lessened. 
</p><p>
A late committee, who have been sitting upon ways and means for raising money, tell us, that a tax for two years more, equal to what we have paid 
in the last, would clear this State of debt. You may judge of the weight of them ; yet our State taxes are 
but as a grain of mustard seed, when compared with our town taxes. Clinton, I hear, has sent out a proclamation upon Germain's plan, inviting the people to 
make a separate peace, which will only be a new proof of the ignorance and folly of our enemies, 
without making a single proselyte. Even the revolted Pennsylvania troops gave up to justice the spies, 
whom Clinton sent to them, offering them clothing and pay ; letting him know, that it was justice from 
their State, not favors from their enemies, which they wanted. 
</p><p>
It is reported, that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=bea" rel="">Arnold</a>, with a body of troops, is gone to Virginia, where it is hoped he and his 
Myrmidons will meet their fate. Had Clinton been a generous enemy, or known human nature, he 
would, like Aurelian, upon a like occasion, have given up the traitor to the hands of justice ; knowing 
that it was in vain to expect fidelity in a man who had betrayed his own country, which, from his defection, may learn to place a higher value upon integrity and virtue than upon a savage ferocity, so often mistaken for courage. He who, as an individual, is cruel, unjust, and immoral, will not be likely 
to possess the virtues necessary in a general or statesman. Yet, in our infant country, infidelity and 
debauchery are so fashionably prevalent, that less attention is paid to the characters of those who fill 
important offices, than a love of virtue and zeal for public liberty can warrant ; which, we are told by 
wise legislators of old, are the surest preservatives of public happiness. 
</p><p>
You observe in a late letter, that your absence from your native State will deprive you of an opportunity of being a man of importance in it. I hope 
you are doing your country more extensive service abroad, than you could have done, had you been 
confined to one State only ; and, whilst you continue in the same estimation among your fellow-citizens 
in which you are now held, you will not fail of being of importance to them at home or abroad. 
</p><p>
Heaven preserve the life and health of my dear absent friend, and, in its own time, return him to his country and to the arms of his ever affectionate 
</p><p>
