MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HAD just returned to my chamber, and taken up my pen to congratulate you upon the arrival of the fleet 
of our allies at Newport, when I was called down to receive the most agreeable of presents, letters from my dearest friend. One bearing date March 
28th, by Mr. Izard, and one of May 3d, taken out of the post-office ; but to what port they arrived first I 
know not. They could not be those by the fleet, as in these you make mention of letters, which I have 
not yet received, nor by the Alliance, since Mr. Williams sailed twenty-five days after the fleet, and 
she was then in France. A pity, I think, that she should stay there when here we are almost destitute. 
Our navy has been unfortunate indeed. I am sorry to find, that only a few lines have reached you from 
me. I have written by way of Spain, Holland, and Sweden, but not one single direct conveyance have 
I had to France since you left me. I determine to open a communication by way of Gardoqui, and wish 
you would make use of the same conveyance. 
</p><p>
What shall I say of our political affairs? Shall I exclaim at measures now impossible to remedy? 
No. I will hope all from the generous aid of our allies, in concert with our own exertions. I am not 
suddenly elated or depressed. I know America capable of any thing she undertakes with spirit and 
vigor. " Brave in distress, serene in conquest, drowsy when at rest," is her true characteristic. Yet I 
deprecate a failure in our present effort. The efforts are great, and we give, this campaign, more than half 
our property to defend the other. He who tarries from the field cannot possibly earn sufficient at home 
to reward him who takes it. Yet, should Heaven bless our endeavours, and crown this year with the 
blessings of peace, no exertion will be thought too great, no price of property too dear. My whole soul 
is absorbed in the idea- The honor of my dearest friend, the welfare and happiness of this wide- 
extended country, ages yet unborn, depend for their happiness and security upon the able and skilful, the 
honest and upright, discharge of the important trust committed to him. It would not become me to write 
the full flow of my heart upon this occasion. My constant petition for him is, that he may so discharge 
the trust reposed in him as to merit the approving eye of Heaven, and peace, liberty, and safety crown 
his latest years in his own native land.

The Marchioness, at the Abbe Raynal s, is not the only lady who joins an approving voice to that of 
her country, though at the expense of her present domestic happiness. It is easier to admire virtue 
than to practise it ; especially the great virtue of self-denial. I find but few sympathizing souls. Why 
should I look for them? since few have any souls, but of the sensitive kind. That nearest allied to my 
own they have taken from me, and tell me honor and fame are a compensation. 
</p><p>
" Fame, wealth, or honor, what are ye to love? " 
</p><p>
But hushed be my pen. Let me cast my eye upon the letters before me. What is the example? I follow it in silence. 
</p><p>
Present my compliments to Mr. Dana. Tell him I have called upon his lady, and we enjoyed an after 
noon of sweet communion. I find she would not he averse to taking a voyage, should he be continued 
abroad. She groans most bitterly, and is irreconcilable to his absence. I am a mere philosopher to her. 
I am inured, but not hardened, to the painful portion. Shall I live to see it otherwise? 
</p><p>
Your letters are always valuable to me, but more particularly so when they close with an affectionate 
assurance of regard, which, though I do not doubt, is never repeated without exciting the tenderest sentiments ; and never omitted without pain to the affectionate bosom of your
