THE joyful news of the surrender of General Burgoyne and all his army, to our victorious troops, 
prompted me to take a ride this afternoon with my daughter to town, to join, to-morrow, with my friends in thanksgiving and praise to the Supreme Being, 
who hath so remarkably delivered our enemies into our hands. And, hearing that an express is to go off 
to-morrow morning, I have retired to write you a few lines. I hove received no letters from you since you 
left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a> by the post, and but one by any private hand. 
</p><p>
Burgoyne is expected in by the middle of the week. I have read many articles of capitulation, 
but none which ever before contained so generous terms. Many people find fault with them, but per 
haps do not consider sufficiently the circumstances of General Gates, who, by delaying and exacting 
more, might have lost all. This must be said of him, that he has followed the golden rule, and done 
as he would wish himself, in like circumstances, to be dealt with. Must not the vaporing Burgoyne, 
who, it is said, possesses great sensibility, be humbled to the dust? He may now write the Blockade of 
Saratoga. I have heard it proposed, that he should take up his quarters in the Old South, but believe 
he will not be permitted to come to this town. Heavc-n grant us success at the southward. That 
saying of Poor Richard often occurs to my mind, God helps them who help themselves ;" but, if men 
turn their backs and run from an enemy, they cannot surely expect to conquer him.

This day, dearest of friends, completes thirteen years since we were solemnly united in wedlock. 
Three years of this time we have been cruelly separated. I have, patiently as I could, endured it, with the belief that you were serving your country, and 
rendering your fellow creatures essential benefits. May future generations rise up and call you blessed, 
and the present behave worthy of the blessings you are laboring to secure to them, and I shall have less 
reason to regret the deprivation of my own particular felicity.

Adieu, dearest of friends, adieu.
