DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
FIVE weeks have passed and not one line have I received. I would rather give a dollar for a letter by 
the post, though the consequence should be, that I 
ate but one meal a day these three weeks to come. 
Every one I see is inquiring after you. When did 
I hear? All my intelligence is collected from the 
newspaper, and I can only reply that I saw by that, 
you arrived such a day. I know your fondness for 
writing, and your inclination to let me hear from you 
by the first safe conveyance, which makes me suspect that some letter or other has miscarried, but 
I hope, now you have arrived at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, you 
will find means to convey me some intelligence. 
We are all well here. I think I enjoy better health 
than I have done these two years. I have not been 
to town since I parted with you there. The Governor is making all kinds of warlike preparations, 
such as mounting cannon upon Beacon Hill, digging 
intrenchments upon the Neck, placing cannon there, 
encamping a regiment there, throwing up breast* 
works, &c. The people are much alarmed, and the selectmen have waited upon him in consequence of 
it. The County Congress have also sent a commit 
tee ; all which proceedings you will have a more 
particular account of, than I am able to give you, 
from the public papers. But, as to the movements 
of this town, perhaps you may not hear them from 
any other person.

In consequence of the powder being taken from 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charlestown</a>, a general alarm spread through many 
towns and was caught pretty soon here. The report 
took here on Friday, and on Sunday a soldier was seen 
lurking about the Common, supposed to be a spy, 
but most likely a deserter. However, intelligence 
of it was communicated to the other Parishes, and 
about eight o'clock, Sunday evening, there passed 
by here about two hundred men, preceded by a 
horsecart, and marched down to the powder house, 
from whence they took the powder, and carried it 
into the other Parish and there secreted it. I opened 
the window upon their return. They passed with 
out any noise, not a word among them till they came 
against this house, when some of them perceiving 
me, asked me if I wanted any powder. I replied, 
No, since it was in so good hands. The reason 
they gave for taking it was, that we had so many 
Tories here, they dared not trust us with it ; they had 
taken Vinton in their train, and upon their return 
they stopped between Cleverly's and Etter's and 
called upon him to deliver two warrants. Upon his 
producing them, they put it to vote whether they 
should burn them, and it passed in the affirmative. 
They then made a circle and burnt them. They 
then called a vote whether they should huzza, but, it 
being Sunday evening, it passed in the negative. 
They called upon Vinton to swear, that he would 
never be instrumental in carrying into execution any 
of these new acts. They were not satisfied with his 
answers ; however, they let him rest. A few days 
afterwards, upon his making some foolish speeches, 
they assembled to the amount of two or three hundred, 
and swore vengeance upon him unless he took a solemn 
oath. Accordingly, they chose a committee and sent 
it with him to Major Miller's to see that he complied ; 
and they waited his return, which proving satisfactory, they dispersed. This town appears as high as 
you can well imagine, and, if necessary, would soon 
be in arms. Not a Tory but hides his head. The 
Church parson thought they were coming after him, 
and ran up garret ; they say another jumped out of 
his window and hid among the corn, whilst a third 
crept under his board fence and told his beads.
