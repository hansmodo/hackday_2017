DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE day, perhaps, the decisive day, is come, on 
which the fate of America depends. My bursting 
heart must find vent at my pen. I have just heard, 
that our dear friend, Dr. Warren, is no more, but 
fell gloriously fighting for his country ; saying, better to die honorably in the field, than ignominiously 
hang upon the gallows. Great is our loss. He has 
distinguished himself in every engagement, by his 
courage and fortitude, by animating the soldiers, and 
leading them on by his own example. A particular 
account of these dreadful, but I hope glorious days 
will be transmitted you, no doubt, in the exactest manner.

" The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to 
the strong ; but the God of Israel is he, that giveth 
strength and power unto his people. Trust in him 
at all times, ye people, pour out your hearts before 
him ; God is a refuge for us." <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charlestown</a> is laid 
in ashes. The battle began upon our intrenchments 
upon Bunker's Hill, Saturday morning about three 
o'clock, and has not ceased yet, and it is now three 
o'clock Sabbath afternoon. 
</p><p>
It is expected they will come put over the Neck 
to-night, and a dreadful battle must ensue. Almighty 
God, cover the heads of our countrymen, and be a 
shield to our dear friends ! How many have fallen, 
we know not. The constant roar of the cannon is 
so distressing, that we cannot eat, drink, or sleep. 
May we be supported and sustained in the dreadful 
conflict. I shall tarry here till it is thought unsafe 
by my friends, and then I have secured myself a 
retreat at your brother s, who has kindly offered me 
part of his house. I cannot compose myself to write 
any further at present. I will add more as I hear further. 
</p><p>
Tuesday Afternoon. 
</p><p>
I have been so much agitated, that I have not 
been able to write since Sabbath day. When I say, 
that ten thousand reports are passing, vague and uncertain as the wind, I believe I speak the truth. I 
am not able to give you any authentic account of 
last Saturday, but you will not be destitute of intelligence. Colonel Palmer has just sent me word, that 
he has an opportunity of conveyance. Incorrect as 
this scrawl will be, it shall go. I ardently pray, that 
you may be supported through the arduous task you 
have before you. I wish I could contradict the report of the Doctor's death ; but it is a lamentable 
truth, and the tears of multitudes pay tribute to his 
memory ; those favorite lines of Collins continually 
sound in my ears ; 
</p><p>
" How sleep the brave," 
</p><p>
I must close, as the Deacon waits. I have not 
pretended to be particular with regard to what I 
have heard, because I know you will collect better 
intelligence. The spirits of the people are very 
good ; the loss of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charlestown</a> affects them no more 
than a drop of the bucket. I am, most sincerely, 
</p><p>
Yours,
