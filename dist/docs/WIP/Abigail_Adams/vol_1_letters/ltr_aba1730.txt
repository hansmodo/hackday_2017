I HAVE received all the papers you sent, the oration and the magazines. In the small papers I sometimes 
find pieces begun and continued, (for instance, Johnston's speech,) but am so unlucky as not to get the papers in order, and miss of seeing the whole.

The removal of the army seems to have stopped the current of news. I want to know to what part 
of America they are now wandering. It is reported and credited, that Manly has taken a schooner be 
longing to the fleet, richly laden with money, plate, and English goods, with a number of Tories. The 
particulars I have not yet learned. Yesterday the remains of our worthy General Warren were dug 
up upon Bunker s hill, and carried into town, and on Monday are to be interred, with all the honors of war.

The Doctor was buried on Monday ; the masons walking in procession from the Statehouse, with the military in uniforms, and a large concourse of people attending. He was carried into the Chapel, and there a funeral dirge was played, an excellent 
prayer by Dr. Cooper, and an oration by Mr. Morton, which I hope will be printed. I think the subject 
must have inspired him. A young fellow could not have wished a finer opportunity to display his 
talents. The amiable and heroic virtues of the deceased, recent in the minds of the audience ; the 
noble cause to which he fell a martyr ; their own sufferings and unparalleled injuries, all fresh in their 
minds, must have given weight and energy to what ever could be delivered upon the occasion. The 
dead body, like that of Caesar, before their eyes, whilst each wound, 
</p><p>
" like dumb mouths, did ope their ruby lips, 
To beg the voice and utterance of a tongue. 
Woe to the hands that shed this costly blood, 
A curse shall light" upon their line.

I take my pen and write just as I can get time ; my letters will be a strange mixture. I really am 
" cumbered about many things," and scarcely know which way to turn myself. I miss my partner, and 
find myself unequal to the cares which fall upon me. I find it necessary to be the directress of our husbandry. I hope in time to have the reputation of 
being as good a farmeress, as my partner has of being a good statesman. To ask you any thing about 
your return, would, I suppose, be asking a question which you cannot answer.

Retirement, rural quiet, domestic pleasures, all, all, must give place to the weighty cares of state. It would bo 
</p><p>
" meanly poor in solitude to hide 
An honest zeal, unwarped by party rage." 
</p><p>
" Though certain pains attend the cares of state, 
A good man owes his country to be great, 
Should act abroad the high distinguished part, 
And show, at least, the purpose of his heart."

I hope your Prussian general will answer the high character which is given of him. But we, who have 
been bred in a land of liberty, scarcely know how to give credit to so unjust and arbitrary a mandate of a 
despot. To cast oft* a faithful servant only for being the unhappy bearer of ill news, degrades the man, 
and dishonors the prince. The Congress, by employing him, have shown a liberality of sentiment, 
not confined to colonies or continents, but, to use the words of " Common Sense," have " carried their 
friendship on a larger scale, by claiming brotherhood with every European Christian, and may justly 
triumph in the generosity of the sentiment."

Yesterday, was taken and carried into Cohasset, by three whaleboats, who went from the shore on purpose, a snow from the Grenadas, laden with 
three hundred and fifty-four puncheons of West India rum, forty-three barrels of sugar, twelve thousand and five hundred weight of coffee ; a valuable 
prize. A number of Eastern sloops have brought wood into town since the fleet sailed. We have a 
rumor of Admiral Hopkins being engaged with a number of ships and tenders off Rhode Island ; and 
are anxious to know the event. Be so good as to send me a list of the vessels which sail with Hopkins, their names, weight of metal, and number of men ; all the news you know, &c.

I hear our jurors refuse to serve, because the writs are issued in the King s name. Surely, they are for independence.

Write me how you do this winter. I want to say many things I must omit. It is not fit " to wake the 
soul by tender strokes of art," or to ruminate upon happiness we might enjoy, lest absence become in 
tolerable. Adieu. Yours. 
</p><p>
I wish you would burn all my letters.
