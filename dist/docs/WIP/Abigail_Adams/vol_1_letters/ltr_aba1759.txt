</p><p>
THIS evening, as I was sitting with only your sister by my side, who was scribbling to some of her cor 
respondents, my neighbour, Field, entered with, " I have a letter for you, Madam." My imagination was 
wandering to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>, ruminating upon the long, long absence of my dear son and his parent, so that I was 
rather inattentive to what he said, until he repeated, " I have letters for you from abroad." The word 
" abroad," roused my attention, and I eagerly seized the letters, the handwriting and seal of which gave 
me hopes, that I was once more about to hear from my young wanderer ; nor was I disappointed. 
</p><p>
After two years silence, and a journey of which I can scarcely form an idea, to find you safely returned to your parent, to hear of your health and to 
see your improvements ! You cannot know, should I describe to you, the feelings of a parent. Through 
your father, I sometimes heard from you, but one letter only ever reached me after you arrived in 
Russia. Your excuses, however, have weight and are accepted ; but you must give them further energy by a ready attention to your pen in future. Four 
years have already passed away since you left your native land and this rural cottage ; humble indeed 
when compared to the palaces you have visited, and the pomp you have been witness to ; but I dare say, 
you have not been so inattentive an observer as to suppose, that sweet peace and contentment cannot inhabit the lowly roof and bless the tranquil inhabitants, equally guarded and protected in person and property in this happy country as those who reside in the most elegant and costly dwellings. If you 
live to return, I can form to myself an idea of the pleasure you will take in treading over the ground 
and visiting every place your early years were accustomed wantonly to gambol in ; even the rocky 
common and lowly whortleberry bush will not be without their beauties. 
</p><p>
My anxieties have been and still are great, lest the numerous temptations and snares of vice should 
vitiate your early habits of virtue, and destroy those principles, which you are now capable of reasoning 
upon, and discerning the beauty and utility of, as the only rational surce of happiness here, or foundation of felicity hereafter. Placed as we are in a transitory scene of probation, drawing nigher and still nigher day after day to that important crisis which 
must introduce us into a new system of things, it ought certainly to be our principal concern to become 
qualified for our expected dignity. 
</p><p>
What is it, that affectionate parents require of their children, for all their care, anxiety, and toil on their 
account? Only that they would be wise and virtuous, benevolent and kind. 
</p><p>
Ever keep in mind, my son, that your parents are your disinterested friends, and that if, at any time, 
their advice militates with your own opinion or the advice of others, you ought always to be diffident of 
your own judgment ; because you may rest assured, that their opinion is founded on experience and long 
observation, and that they would not direct you but to promote your happiness. Be thankful to a kind 
Providence, who has hitherto preserved the lives of your parents, the natural guardians of your youthful 
years. With gratitude I look up to Heaven, blessing the hand which continued to me my dear and honored parents until I was settled in life ; and, though 
now I regret the loss of them, and daily feel the want of their advice and assistance, I cannot suffer as I should have done, if I had been early deprived of them. 
</p><p>
You will doubtless have heard of the death of your worthy grandpapa before this reaches you. He 
left you a legacy more valuable than gold or silver ; he left you his blessing and his prayers that you 
might return to your country and friends, improved in knowledge and matured in virtue ; that you might 
become a useful citizen, a guardian of the laws, liberty, and religion of your country, as your father 
(he was pleased to say) had already been. Lay this bequest up in your memory, and practise upon it ; 
believe me, you will find it a treasure that neither moth nor rust can devour. 
</p><p>
I received letters from your father last evening, dated in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> the 10th of September, informing me 
of the necessity of his continuance abroad this winter. The season is so far advanced that I readily 
sacrifice the desire of seeing him to his safety ; a voyage upon this coast at this season is fraught with 
dangers. He has made me a request, that I dare not comply with at present. No husband, no son, to 
accompany me upon the boisterous ocean, to animate my courage and dispel my fears, I dare not 
engage with so formidable a combatant. If I should find your father fixed in the spring, and determined 
to continue abroad a year or two longer, the earnest desire I have to meet him and my dear son might 
overcome the reluctance I feel at the idea of engaging in a new scene, and the love I have for domestic 
attachments and the still calm of life. But it would be more agreeable to me to enjoy all my friends together in my own native land ; from those who have visited foreign climes I could listen with pleasure to the narrative of their adventures, and derive satisfaction from the learned detail, content, myself, that 
</p><p>
" The little learning I have gained, 
Is all from simple nature drained." 
</p><p>
I have a desire that you might finish your education at our University, and I see no chance for it 
unless you return in the course of the year. Your cousin, W. Cranch, expects to enter next July. He 
would be happy to have you his associate. I hope your father will indulge you with a visit to England 
this winter. It is a country J should be fond of your seeing. Christianity, which teaches us to forgive our 
enemies, prevents me from enjoining upon you a similar vow to that which Hamilcar obtained from 
his son Hannibal, but I know not how to think of loving those haughty islanders. 
</p><p>
Your friends send you their affectionate regards ; and I enjoin it upon you to write often to your ever affectionate mother,
