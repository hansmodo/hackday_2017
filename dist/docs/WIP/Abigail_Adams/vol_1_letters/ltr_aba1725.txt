I HOPE you have received several letters from me in this fortnight past. I wrote by Mr. Lynch and by 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=ben" rel="friend">Dr. Franklin</a>, the latter of whom I had the pleasure of dining with, and of admiring him, whose character from my infancy I had been taught to venerate. 
I found him social but not talkative, and, when he spoke, something useful dropped from his tongue. 
He was grave, yet pleasant and affable. You know I make some pretensions to physiognomy, and I 
thought I could read in his countenance the virtues of his heart, among which, patriotism shone in its 
full lustre ; and with that is blended every virtue of a Christian. For a true patriot must be a religious 
man. I have been led to think from a late defection, that he who neglects his duty to his Maker, may 
well be expected to be deficient and insincere in his duty towards the public. Even suppose him to possess a large share of what is called honor and public spirit, yet, do not these men, by their bad example, by a loose, immoral conduct, corrupt the minds 
of youth, and vitiate the morals of the age, and thus injure the public more than they can compensate by 
intrepidity, generosity, and honor? Let revenge or ambition, pride, lust, or profit, tempt these men to a 
base and vile action ; you may as well hope to bind up a hungry tiger with a cobweb, as to hold such 
debauched patriots in the visionary chains of decency, or to charm them with the intellectual beauty of truth and reason.

But where am I running? I mean to thank you for all your obliging favors lately received ; and though some of them are very laconic, yet, were 
they to contain only two lines to tell me that you were well, they would be acceptable to me. I think 
however, you are more apprehensive than you need be ; the gentleman, to whose care they have always 
been directed, has been very kind in his conveyance, and very careful. I hope, however, that it will not 
now be long before we shall have nearer interviews. You must tell me, that you will return next month ; 
a late appointment ! will make it inconvenient (provided you accept) for you to go again to Congress.

It seems human nature is the same in all ages and countries. Ambition and avarice reign everywhere, 
and, where they predominate, there will be bickerings after places of honor and profit. There is an 
old adage, " Kissing goes by favor," that is daily verified. I inclose to you the paper you sent for. Your 
business in collecting facts will be very difficult, and the sufferings of this people cannot be described 
with pen, ink, and paper. Besides, these ministers of Satan are rendering it every day more and more 
difficult, by their ravages and devastation, to tell a tale which will freeze the young blood of succeeding generations, as well as harrow up the souls of the present. 
</p><p>
Nothing new has transpired since I wrote you last. I have not heard of one person s escape out of town, nor of any maneuver of any kind. 
</p><p>
I will only ask you to measure by your own the affectionate regard of your nearest friend.
