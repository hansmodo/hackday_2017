I RECEIVED yours of June 10th, for which I thank 
you. I want you to be more particular. Does every member feel for us? Can they realize what we 
suffer? And can they believe, with what patience 
and fortitude we endure the conflict? Nor do we even tremble at the frowns of power.

You inquire of me who were at the engagement 
at Grape Island. I may say, with truth, all of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=weymouth" rel="city">Weymouth</a>, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=braintree" rel="city">Braintree</a>, Hingham, who were able to bear 
arms, and hundreds from other towns within twenty, 
thirty, and forty miles of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=weymouth" rel="city">Weymouth</a>. Our good 
friend, the Doctor, is in a miserable state of health, 
and hardly able to go from his own house to my 
father s. Danger, you know, sometimes makes timid 
men bold. He stood that day very well, and generously attended, with drink, biscuit, flints, &c., five 
hundred men, without taking any pay. He has since 
been chosen one of the Committee of Correspondence 
for that town, and has done much service, by establishing a regular method of alarm from town to town. 
Both your brothers were there ; your younger brother, 
with his company, who gained honor by their good 
order that -day. He was one of the first to venture 
on board a schooner, to land upon the island. As to 
Chelsea, I cannot be so particular, as I know only in 
general, that Colonel Putnam commanded there, and 
had many gentlemen volunteers. We have two companies stationed in this town ; at Germantown, Captain Turner ; at Squantum, Captain Vinton; 
in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=weymouth" rel="city">Weymouth</a>, one ; in Hingham, two, &c. I believe I shall 
remove your books this week to your brother s. We think it advisable. Colonel Quincy has procured his 
family a retreat at Deacon Holbrook s. Mr. Cranch 
has one at Major Bass s, in case of necessity, to which 
we hope not to be driven. We hear, that the troops 
destined for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> are all expected here ; but 
we have got to that pass, that a whole legion of them would not intimidate us. I think I am very brave, 
upon the whole. If danger comes near my dwelling, I suppose I shall shudder. We want powder, but, 
with the blessing of Heaven, we fear them not. Write every opportunity you can.

I am yours,
