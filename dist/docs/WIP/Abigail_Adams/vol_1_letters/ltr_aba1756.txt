MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
AT length an opportunity offers, after a space of near five months, of again writing to you. Not a vessel 
from any port in this State has sailed since January, ,by which I could directly convey you a line. I have 
written twice by way of Virginia, but fear the letters will never reach you. From you, I have lately 
received several letters, containing the most pleasing intelligence.

Hail, " Goddess, heavenly bright, Profuse of joy and pregnant with delight."

The garb of this favorite of America is woven of an admirable texture, and proves the great skill, wisdom, and abilities of the master workmen. It was 
not fabricated in the loom of France, nor are the materials English, but they are the product of our 
own American soil, raised and nurtured, not by the gentle showers of Heaven, but by the hard labor and 
indefatigable industry and firmness of her sons, and watered by the blood of many of them. May its 
duration be in proportion to its value, and, like the mantle of the prophet, descend with blessings to 
generations yet to come. And may you, my dearest friend, return to your much loved solitude, with the 
pleasing reflection of having contributed to the happiness of millions. 
</p><p>
We have not received any account of the signing the definitive treaty, so that no public rejoicings have 
taken place as yet. The fifth article in the treaty has raised the old spirit against the Tories to such a 
height that it would be at the risk of their lives, should they venture here. It may subside after a 
while, but I question whether any State in the Union will admit them, even for twelve months. What then would have been the consequence, if compensation had been granted them? 
</p><p>
Your Journal has afforded me and your friends much pleasure and amusement. You will learn, 
perhaps from Congress, that the Journal you meant for Mr. Jackson, was, by some mistake, enclosed to 
the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and consequently came before Congress, with other public papers. 
The Massachusetts delegates applied for it, but were refused it. Mr. Jackson was kind enough to wait 
upon me, and show me your letter to him, and the other papers enclosed ; and I communicated the 
Journal to him. Mr. Higginson writes, that it was moved in Congress by Hamilton, of N Virginia, and 
Wilson of Pennsylvania, to censure their ministers for departing from their duty, in not adhering to 
their instructions, and for giving offence to the Court of France by distrusting their friendship. They, 
however, could not carry their point. It was said, the instruction alluded to was founded upon reciprocity, and that Count de Vergennes had not acted upon 
that principle. When these gentry found, that it would not be considered in the light in which they 
wished, they gave out, that, if no more was said upon that subject, the other would drop. This is all I have been able to collect. My intelligence is very imperfect l since Mr. Lovell left Congress. Mr. Gerry, I believe, is determined to go again. I shall then have a friend and correspondent who will keep me informed. 
</p><p>
Upon receiving a letter from you, in which you desire me to come to you, should you be long detained abroad, I took the liberty of writing to Dr. 
Lee, requesting him to give me the earliest intelligence respecting the acceptance of your resignation. 
I do not think it will be accepted, by what I have already learnt. If it is not, I shall still feel undetermined what to do. From many of your letters, 
I was led to suppose you would not return without permission. Yet I do not imagine the bare renewal 
</p><p>
This will account for the errors, which are many and striking in this paragraph. No motion of the kind alluded to 
appears in the Journal of Congress. But by the papers of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mad" rel="acquaintance">Mr. Madison</a>, lately published, we find that it was made, and 
particularly directed against <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met spouse">Mr. Adams</a>. It was offered, however, by Mr. Mercer of Virginia, and seconded by Mr. Madison himself, for reasons which are stated by the latter ; but it was found not to be acceptable to a large proportion of 
the members, particularly to the Eastern delegates, and was, therefore, never pressed to a decision. Neither Mr. Hamilton of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, nor Mr. Wilson of Pennsylvania, appears to have been anxious to adopt it. 
</p><p>
Upon this, the most controverted and debatable ground of the history of our Revolution, which has been elaborately 
occupied of late by Mr. Sparks, in his various contributions to it, the present is not the fitting occasion to add a word of 
commentary. of a former commission would induce you to tarry. I shall not run the risk, unless you are appointed Minister at the Court of Great Britain. 
</p><p>
Our friends are all well, and desire to be affectionately remembered to you. Where is our son? 
I hear no more of him than if he was out of the world. You wrote me in yours of December 4th, 
that he was upon his journey to you, but I have never heard of his arrival. Need I add how earnestly I long for the day when Heaven will again bless us in the society of each other? Whether upon European or American ground, is yet in the book of uncertainty ; but, to feel entirely happy and easy, 
I believe it must be in our own republican cottage, with the simplicity which has ever distinguished it and your ever affectionate

I last evening received yours of February 18th, 
in which you are explicit with regard to your return. 
I shall, therefore, (let Congress renew or create what 
commission they please,) at least wait your further 
direction, though you should be induced to tarry 
abroad. I have taken no step as yet with regard to 
coming out, except writing to Dr. Lee, as mentioned 
before. Heaven send you safe to your ever affectionate
