MY FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I thinK I write to you every day. Shall not I make 
my letters very cheap? Don't you light your pipe 
with them? I care not if you do. T'is a pleasure 
to me to write. Yet I wonder I write to you with 
so little restraint, for as a critic I fear you more than 
any other person on earth, and t'is the only character in which I ever did or ever will fear you. What 
say you? Do you approve of that speech? Don't 
you think me a courageous being? Courage is a 
laudable, a glorious virtue in your sex, why not in 
mine? For my part, I think you ought to applaud 
me for mine. 
</p><p>
Exit Rattle. 
</p><p>
Solus your Diana. 
</p><p>
And now, pray tell me, how you do? Do you 
feel any venom working in your veins? Did you 
ever before experience such a feeling? (This letter 
will be made up with questions, I fancy, not set in 
order before you, neither.) How do you employ 
yourself? Do you go abroad yet? Is it not cruel 
to bestow those favors upon others, which I should 
rejoice to receive, yet must be deprived of? 
</p><p>
I have lately been thinking whether my mamma 
when I write again I will tell you something. 
Did not you receive a letter to-day by Hannes? 
</p><p>
This is a right girl's letter, but I will turn to 
the other side and be sober, if I can. 
</p><p>
But what is bred in the bone will never be out of 
the flesh, (as Lord M. would have said.) 
</p><p>
As I have a good opportunity to send some milk, 
I have not waited for your orders, lest, if I should 
miss this, I should not catch such another. If you 
want more balm, I can supply you. 
</p><p>
Adieu; evermore remember me with the tenderest affection, which is also borne unto you by 
your 
</p><p>
