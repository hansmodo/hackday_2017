I HAVE just returned from a visit to my brother with 
my father, who carried me there the day before yesterday, and called here on my return, to see this 
much injured town. I view it with much the same 
sensations that I should the body of a departed 
friend ; as having only put off its present glory, to 
rise finally to a more happy state. I will not despair, 
but will believe, that, our cause being good, we shall 
finally prevail. The maxim, " In time of peace prepare for war," (if this may be called a time of peace,) 
resounds throughout the country. Next Tuesday they 
are warned at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=braintree" rel="city">Braintree</a>, all above fifteen and under 
sixty, to attend with their arms ; and to train once a 
fortnight from that time is a scheme which lies much 
at heart with many.

Scott has arrived, and brings news that he expected to find all peace and quietness here, as he left 
them at home. You will have more particulars than 
I am able to send you, from much better hands. 
There has been in town a conspiracy of the negroes. 
At present it is kept pretty private, and was discovered by one who endeavoured to dissuade them from 
it. He being threatened with his life, applied to Justice Quincy for protection. They conducted in this 
way, got an Irishman to draw up a petition to the 
Governor, telling him they would fight for him provided he would arm them, and engage to liberate 
them if he conquered. And it is said that he attended so much to it, as to consult Percy upon it, and 
one Lieutenant Small has been very busy and active. There is but little said, and what steps they 
will take in consequence of it I know not. I wish 
most sincerely there was not a slave in the province ; 
it always appeared a most iniquitous scheme to me 
to fight ourselves for what we are daily robbing and 
plundering from those who have as good a right to 
freedom as we have. You know my mind upon 
this subject.

I left all our little ones well, and shall return to 
them to-night. I hope to hear from you by the return of the bearer of this, and by Revere. I long 
for the day of your return, yet look upon you as 
much safer where you are, but know it will not do 
for you ; not one action has been brought to this 
court, no business of any sort in your way, all 
law ceases, and the gospel will soon follow ; for they 
are supporters of each other. Adieu, my father hurries me. 
</p><p>
Yours most sincerely,
