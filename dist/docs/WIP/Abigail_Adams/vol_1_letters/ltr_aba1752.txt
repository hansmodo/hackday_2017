MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HEAR the Alliance is again going to France, with the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=laf" rel="">Marquis de la Fayette</a> and the Count de Noailles. 
I will not envy the Marquis the pleasure of annually visiting his family, considering the risk he runs in 
doing it ; besides, he deserves the good wishes of every American, and a large portion of the honors 
and applause of his own country. He returns with the additional merit of laurels won at Yorktown by the 
capture of a whole British army. America may boast, that she has accomplished what no power be 
fore her ever did, contending with Britain, captured two of their celebrated generals, and each with 
an army of thousands of veteran troops to support them. This event, whilst it must fill Britain with 
despondency, will draw the Union already framed still closer and give us additional allies ; and, if properly improved, will render a negotiation easier and 
more advantageous to America. 
</p><p>
But I cannot reflect much upon public affairs, until I have unburdened the load of my own heart. 
Where shall I begin my list of grievances? Not by accusations, but lamentations. My first is, that I do not hear from you ; a few lines only, dated in April 
and May, have come to hand for fifteen months. 
</p><p>
You do not mention receiving any from me except by Captain Casneau, though I wrote by Colonel 
Laurens, by Captain Brown, by Mr. Storer, Dexter, and many others ; to Bilboa by Trask, and several times by way of France. You will refer me to Gilon, I suppose. Gillon has acted a base part, of which, no doubt, you are long ere now apprized. You had great reason to suppose, that he would 
reach America as soon or sooner than the merchant vessels, and placed much confidence in him by the 
treasure you permitted to go on board of him. Ah ! how great has my anxiety been. What have I not 
suffered since I heard my dear Charles was on board, and no intelligence to be procured of the vessel for 
four months after he sailed. Most people concluded, that she was foundered at sea, as she sailed before a 
violent storm. Only three weeks ago did I hear the contrary. My uncle despatched a messenger, the 
moment a vessel from Bilboa arrived with the happy tidings, that she was safe at Corunna ; that the passengers had all left the ship in consequence of GilIon's conduct, and were arrived at Bilboa. The vessel sailed the day that the passengers arrived at Bilboa, so that no letters came by Captain Lovett ; 
but a Dr. Sands reports, that he saw a child, who they told him was yours, and that he was well. This was a cordial to my dejected spirits. I know not 
what to wish for. Should he attempt to come at this season upon the coast, it has more horrors than 
I have fortitude. I am still distressed ; I must resign him to the kind, protecting hand of that Being, who hath hitherto preserved him, and submit to whatever dispensation is allotted me. 
</p><p>
What is the matter with Mr. Thaxter? Has he forgotten all his American friends, that, out of four 
vessels which have arrived, not a line is to be found on board of one of them from him? I could quarrel with the climate, but surely, if it is subject to the 
ague, there is a fever fit as well as a cold one. Mr. Guild tells me, he was charged with letters, but left 
them, with his other things, on board the frigate. She gave him the slip and he stepped on board of 
Captain Brown's ship, and happily arrived safe. From him I have learned many things respecting my 
dear connexions ; but still I long for that free communication, which I see but little prospect of obtain 
ing. Let me again entreat you to write by way of Guardoqui. Bilboa is as safe a conveyance as I 
know of. Ah, my dear John ! where are you? In so remote a part of the globe, that I fear I shall not 
hear a syllable from you. Pray write me all the intelligence you get from him ; send me his letters to 
you. Do you know I have not had a line from him for a year and a half? Alas ! my dear, I am much 
afflicted with a disorder called the heartache, nor can any remedy be found in America. It must be 
collected from Holland, Petersburg, and Bilboa. 
</p><p>
And now, having recited my griefs and complaints, the next in place are those of my neighbours. I have been applied to by the parents of 
several <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=braintree" rel="city">Braintree</a> youth to write to you in their be half, requesting your aid and assistance, if it is in your power to afford it. Captain Cathcart, in the 
privateer Essex, from Salem, went out on a cruise last April in the Channel of England, and was, on 
the 10th of June, so unfortunate as to be taken and carried into Ireland. The officers were confined 
there, but the sailors were sent prisoners to Plymouth jail, twelve of whom are from this town, a list 
of whom I enclose. The friends of these people have received intelligence by way of an officer, who 
belonged to the Protector, and who escaped from the jail, that in August last they were all alive, several 
of them very destitute of clothing, having taken but a few with them and those for the summer, particularly Ned Savil and Job Field. Their request is, 
that, if you can, you would render them some assistance ; if not by procuring an exchange, that you 
would get them supplied with necessary clothing. I have told them, that you would do all in your power 
for them, but what that would be, I could not say. Their friends here are all well, many of them greatly 
distressed for their children, and in a particular manner the mother of Josiah Bass. I wish you to be 
very particular in letting me know, by various opportunities and ways after the receipt of this, whether 
you have been able to do any thing for them, that I may relieve the minds of these distressed parents. 
The Captain got home about three months ago by escaping to France, but could give no account of his men after they were taken.

Two years, my dearest friend, have passed away since you left your native land. Will you not return ere the close of another year? I will purchase 
you a retreat in the woods of Vermont, and retire with you from the vexations, toils, and hazards of public life. Do you not sometimes sigh for such a 
seclusion? Public peace and domestic happiness ; 
</p><p>
" an elegant sufficiency, content, 
Retirement, rural quiet; friendship, books, 
Ease and alternate labor; useful life, 
Progressive virtue, and approving Heaven." 
</p><p>
May the time, the happy time soon arrive, when we may realize these blessings, so elegantly described 
by Thomson ; for, though many of your countrymen talk in a different style with regard to their intentions, 
and express their wishes to see you in a conspicuous point of view in your own State, I feel no ambition 
for a share of it. I know the voice of fame to be a mere weather-cock, unstable as water and fleeting as 
a shadow. Yet I have pride ; I know I have a large portion of it. 
</p><p>
I very fortunately received, by the Apollo, by the Juno, and by the Minerva, the things you sent me, 
all in good order. They will enable me to do, I hope, without drawing upon you, provided I can part 
with them ; but money is so scarce, and taxes so high, that few purchasers are found. Goods will not 
double, yet they are better than drawing bills, as these cannot be sold but with a large discount. I 
could not get more than ninety for a hundred dollars, should I attempt it. 
</p><p>
I shall enclose an invoice to the house of Ingraham and Bromfield, and one to De Neufville. There 
is nothing from Bilboa that can be imported to advantage. Handkerchiefs are sold here at seven dollars 
and a half per dozen. There are some articles which would be advantageous from Holland, but 
goods there run high, and the retailing vendues, which are tolerated here, ruin the shopkeepers. 
The articles put up by the American house were better in quality for the price than those by the 
house of De Neufville. Small articles have the best profit ; gauze, ribbons, feathers, and flowers, to make 
the ladies gay, have the best advance. There are some articles, which come from India, I should suppose would be lower-priced than many others, Ben 
gals, nankeens, Persian silk, and bandanna handkerchiefs ; but the house of Bromfield know best what 
articles will suit here. 
</p><p>
Believe me, with more affection than words can express, ever, ever, yours.
