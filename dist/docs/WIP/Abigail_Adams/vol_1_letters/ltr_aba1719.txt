DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HAVE seen your letters to Colonels Palmer and 
Warren. I pity your embarrassments. How difficult the task to quench the fire and the pride of private ambition, and to sacrifice ourselves and all our 
hopes and expectations to the public weal I How 
few have souls capable of so noble an undertaking ! 
How often are the laurels worn by those who have 
had no share in earning them ! But there is a future 
recompense of reward, to which the upright man 
looks, and which he will most assuredly obtain, provided he perseveres unto the end. 
</p><p>
The appointment of the generals <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met friend">Washington</a> and 
Lee gives universal satisfaction. The people have 
the highest opinion of Lee's abilities, but you know 
the continuation of the popular breath depends much 
upon favorable events. I had the pleasure of seeing both the generals and their aids-de-camp soon 
after their arrival, and of being personally made 
known to them. They very politely express their 
regard for you. Major Mifflin said he had orders 
from you to visit me at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=braintree" rel="city">Braintree</a>. I told him I 
should be very happy to see him there, and accordingly sent Mr. Thaxter to Cambridge with a card, to 
him and Mr. Read, to dine with me. Mrs. Warren 
and her son were to be with me. They very politely received the message, and lamented that they 
were not able to come, upon account of expresses 
which they were on that day to get in readiness to send off, 
</p><p>
I was struck with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met friend">General Washington</a>. You had 
prepared me to entertain a favorable opinion of him, 
but I thought the half was not told me. Dignity 
with ease and complacency, the gentleman and soldier, look agreeably blended in him. Modesty marks 
every line and feature of his face. Those lines of Dryden instantly occurred to me ; 
</p><p>
"Mark his majestic fabric ! he's a temple 
Sacred by birth, and built by hands divine; 
His soul's the deity that lodges there ; 
Nor is the pile unworthy of the god." 
</p><p>
General Lee looks like a careless, hardy veteran, 
and, by his appearance, brought to my mind his 
namesake, Charles the Twelfth, of Sweden. The 
elegance of his pen far exceeds that of his person. 
</p><p>
You have made frequent complaints that your 
friends do not write to you. I have stirred up some 
of them. May not I in my turn make complaints? 
All the letters I receive from you seem to be written 
in so much haste, that they scarcely leave room for 
a social feeling. They let me know that you exist, 
but some of them contain scarcely six lines. I want 
some sentimental effusions of the heart. I am sure 
you are not destitute of them ; or are they all absorbed in the great public? Much is due to that, I 
know ; but, being part of the public, I lay claim to a 
larger share than I have had. You used to be more 
communicative on Sundays. I always loved a Sabbath day's letter, for then you had a greater command of your time ; but hush to all complaints. 
</p><p>
I am much surprised that you have not been more 
accurately informed of what passes in the camps. 
As to intelligence from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, it is but very seldom 
we are able to collect any thing that may be relied 
on ; and to report the vague, flying rumors, would be 
endless. I heard yesterday, by one Mr. Roulstone, 
a goldsmith, who got out in a fishing schooner, that 
their distress increased upon them fast. Their beef 
is all spent ; their malt and cider all gone. All the 
fresh provisions they can procure, they are obliged 
to give to the sick and wounded. Thirteen of our men who were in jail, and were wounded at the battle of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charlestown</a>, were dead. No man dared now 
to be seen talking to his friend in the street. They 
were obliged to be within, every evening, at ten 
o'clock, according to martial law ; nor could any 
inhabitant walk any street in town after that time, 
without a pass from Gage. He has ordered all the 
molasses to be distilled up into rum for the soldiers ; 
taken away all licenses, and given out others, obliging to a forfeiture of ten pounds, if any rum is sold 
without written orders from the general. He gives 
much the same account of the killed and wounded 
we have from others. The spirit, he says, which 
prevails among the soldiers, is a spirit of malice and 
revenge ; there is no true courage and bravery to be 
observed among them. Their duty is hard, always 
mounting guard with their packs at their backs, 
ready for an alarm, which they live in continual hazard of. Dr. Eliot is not on board a man-of-war, as 
has been reported, but perhaps was left in town, as 
the comfort and support of those who cannot escape. 
He was constantly with our prisoners. Messrs. Lovell and Leach, with others, are certainly in jail. A 
poor milch cow was last week killed in town, and 
sold for a shilling sterling per pound. The transports arrived last week from York, but every additional man adds to their distress. There has been a 
little expedition this week to Long Island. There 
have been, before, several attempts to go on, but 
three men-of-war lay near, and cutters all round the 
island, so that they could not succeed. A number 
of whaleboats lay at Germantown. Three hundred 
volunteers, commanded by one Captain Tupper, 
came on Monday evening and took the boats, went 
on, and brought off seventy odd sheep, fifteen head 
of cattle, and sixteen prisoners, thirteen of whom 
were sent by (Simple Sapling) to mow the hay, 
which they had very badly executed. They were 
all asleep in the house and barn. When they were 
taken, there were three women with them. Our 
heroes came off in triumph, not being observed by 
their enemies. This spirited up others, who could 
not endure the thought that the house and barn 
should afford them any shelter ; they did not destroy them the night before for fear of being discovered. Captain Wild, of this town, with about 
twenty-five of his company ; Captain Gold, of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=weymouth" rel="city">Weymouth</a>, with as many of his, and some other volunteers, to the amount of a hundred, obtained leave to 
go on and destroy the hay, together with the house 
and barn ; and in open day, in full view of the men- 
of-war, they set off from the Moon? so called, covered by a number of men who were placed there, 
went on and set fire to the buildings and hay. 
A number of armed cutters immediately surrounded 
the island and fired upon our men. They came off 
with a hot and continued fire upon them, the bullets 
flying in every direction, and the men-of-war's boats 
plying them with small arms. Many in this town, 
who were spectators, expected every moment our 
men would all be sacrificed, for sometimes they 
were so near as to be called and damned by their 
enemies, and ordered to surrender ; yet they all re 
turned in safety, not one man even wounded. Upon 
the Moon we lost one man, from the cannon on 
board the man-of-war. On the evening of the same 
day, a man-of-war came and anchored near Great 
Hill, and two cutters came to Pig Rocks. It occasioned an alarm in this town, and we were up all 
night. They remain there yet, but have not ventured to land any men. 
</p><p>
This town have chosen their representative. Colonel Palmer is the man. There was a considerable 
muster upon Thayer's side, and Vinton's company 
marched up in order to assist, but got sadly disappointed. Newcomb insisted upon it that no man 
should vote who was in the army. He had no notion of being under the military power ; said we 
might be so situated as to have the greater part of 
the people engaged in the military, and then all power would be wrested out of the hands of the civil 
magistrate. He insisted upon its being put to vote, and carried his point immediately. It brought 
Thayer to his speech, who said all he could against it. 
</p><p>
As to the situation of the camps, our men are in general healthy, much more so at Roxbury than at 
Cambridge, and the camp is in vastly better order. General Thomas has the character of an excellent 
officer. His merit has certainly been overlooked, as modest merit generally is. I hear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=gwa" rel="met friend">General Washington</a> is much pleased with his conduct. 
</p><p>
Every article here in the West India way is very 
scarce and dear. In six weeks we shall not be able 
to purchase any article of the kind. I wish you would 
let Bass get me one pound of pepper, and two yards 
of black calamanco for shoes. I cannot wear leather, if I go barefoot. Bass may make a fine profit 
if he lays in a stock for himself. You can hardly 
imagine how much we want many common small 
articles, which are not manufactured amongst our 
selves ; but we will have them in time ; not one pin 
to be purchased for love or money. I wish you 
could convey me a thousand by any friend travelling 
this way. It is very provoking to have such a plenty 
so near us, but, Tantalus-like, not be able to touch. 
I should have been glad to have laid in a small stock 
of the West India articles, but I cannot get one cop 
per ; no person thinks of paying any thing, and I do 
not choose to run in debt. 
</p><p>
We have not yet been much distressed for grain. 
Every thing at present looks blooming. O that peace would once more extend her olive branch ; 
 
</p><p>
"This day be bread and peace my lot; 
All else beneath the sun, 
Thou knowest if best bestowed or not, 
And let thy will be done." 
</p><p>
"But is the Almighty ever bound to please, 
Build by my wish, or studious of my ease? 
Shall I determine where his frowns shall fall, 
And fence my grotto from the lot of all? 
Prostrate, his sovereign wisdom I adore, 
Intreat his mercy, but I dare no more." 
</p><p>
I have now written you all I can collect from every 
quarter. T'is fit for no eyes but yours, because you 
can make all necessary allowances. I cannot copy. 
</p><p>
There are yet in town three of the selectmen and 
some thousands of inhabitants, t'is said. I hope to 
hear from you soon. Do let me know if there is 
any prospect of seeing you? Next Wednesday is 
thirteen weeks since you went away. I must bid 
you adieu. 
</p><p>
You have many friends, though they have not noticed you by writing. I am sorry they have been so 
negligent. I hope no share of that blame lies upon 
</p><p>
Your most affectionate 
</p><p>
