MY DEAR SON, 
</p><p>
YOUR letters by Mr. Thaxter, I received, and was not a little pleased with them. If you do not write with the precision of a Robertson, nor the elegance 
of a Voltaire, it is evident you have profited by the perusal of them. The account of your northern 
journey, and your observation upon the Russian government, would do credit to an older pen. 
</p><p>
The early age at which you went abroad gave you not an opportunity of becoming acquainted with 
your own country. Yet the revolution, in which we 
were engaged, held it up in so striking and important a light, that you could not avoid being in some 
measure irradiated with the view. The characters 
with which you were connected, and the conversation you continually heard, must have impressed 
your mind with a sense of the laws, the liberties, and the glorious privileges, which distinguish the free, sovereign, independent States of America. 
</p><p>
Compare them with the vassalage of the Russian government you have described, and say, were 
this highly favored land barren as the mountains of Switzerland, and covered ten months in the year 
with snow, would she not have the advantage even of Italy, with her orange groves, her breathing statues, and her melting strains of music? or of 
Spain, with her treasures from Mexico and Peru? not one of which can boast that first of blessings, the 
glory of human nature, the inestimable privilege of sitting down under their vines and fig-trees, enjoying 
in peace and security whatever Heaven has lent them, having none to make them afraid. 
</p><p>
Let your observations and comparisons produce in your mind an abhorrence of domination and power, 
the parent of slavery, ignorance, and barbarism, which places man upon a level with his fellow tenants of the woods ; 
</p><p>
" A day, an hour, of virtuous liberty Is worth a whole eternity of bondage." 
</p><p>
You have seen power in its various forms, a benign deity, when exercised in the suppression of 
fraud, injustice, and tyranny, but a demon, when united with unbounded ambition, a wide-wasting 
fury, who has destroyed her thousands. Not an age of the world but has produced characters, to 
which whole human hecatombs have been sacrificed. 
</p><p>
What is the history of mighty kingdoms and nations, but a detail of the ravages and cruelties of the 
powerful over the weak? Yet it is instructive to trace the various causes, which produced the strength 
of one nation, and the decline and weakness of another ; to learn by what arts one man has been 
able to subjugate millions of his fellow creatures, the motives which have put him upon action, and 
the causes of his success ; sometimes driven by 
ambition and a lust of power ; at other times, swallowed up by religious enthusiasm, blind bigotry, and 
ignorant zeal ; sometimes enervated with luxury and 
debauched by pleasure, until the most powerful nations have become a prey and been subdued by 
these Sirens, when neither the number of their enemies, nor the prowess of their arms, could conquer 
them. History informs us that the Assyrian empire sunk under the arms of Cyrus, with his poor but hardy Persians. The extensive and opulent empire 
of Persia fell an easy prey to Alexander and a handful of Macedonians ; and the Macedonian empire, 
when enervated by the luxury of Asia, was compelled to receive the yoke of the victorious Romans. 
Yet even this mistress of the world, as she is proudly styled, in her turn defaced her glory, tarnished her victories, and became a prey to luxury, ambition, 
faction, pride, revenge, and avarice, so that Jugurtha, after having purchased an acquittance for the blackest of crimes, breaks out into an exclamation, 
" O city, ready for sale, if a buyer rich enough can be found ! " 
</p><p>
The history of your own country and the late revolution are striking and recent instances of the mighty things achieved by a brave, enlightened, and 
hardy people, determined to be free ; the very yeomanry of which, in many instances, have shown 
themselves superior to corruption, as Britain well knows, on more occasions than the loss of her 
Andre. Glory, my son, in a country which has 
given birth to characters, both in the civil and military departments, which may vie with the wisdom 
and valor of antiquity. As an immediate descendant of one of those characters, may you be led to an 
imitation of that disinterested patriotism and that noble love of your country, which will teach you to 
despise wealth, titles, pomp, and equipage, as mere 
external advantages, which cannot add to the internal excellence of your mind, or compensate for the want of integrity and virtue. 
</p><p>
May your mind be thoroughly impressed with the absolute necessity of universal virtue and goodness, 
as the only sure road to happiness, and may you walk therein with undeviating steps, is the sincere and most affectionate wish of 
</p><p>
Your mother, 
</p><p>
