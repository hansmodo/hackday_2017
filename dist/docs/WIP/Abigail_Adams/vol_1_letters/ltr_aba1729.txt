Saturday Evening-, 2 March, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1776">1776</a>. 
</p><p>
I WAS greatly rejoiced, at the return of your servant, to find you had safely arrived, and that you were 
well I had never heard a word from you after you had left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, and a most ridiculous story 
had been industriously propagated in this and the neighbouring towns to injure the cause and blast your 
reputation; namely, that you and your President had gone on board of a man-of-war from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a>, 
and sailed for England. I should not mention so idle a report, but that it had given uneasiness to 
some of your friends ; not that they, in the least, credited the report, but because the gaping vulgar 
swallowed the story. One man had deserted them and proved a traitor, another might, &c. I assure 
you, such high disputes took place in the public house of this Parish, that some men were collared and dragged out of the shop with great threats, for 
reporting such scandalous lies, and an uncle of ours offered his life as a forfeit for you, if the report 
proved true. However, it has been a nine days marvel, and will now cease. I heartily wish every 
Tory was extirpated from America ; they are continually, by secret means, undermining and injuring our cause. 
</p><p>
I am charmed with the sentiments of " Common Sense," and wonder how an honest heart, one who 
wishes the welfare of his country and the happiness of posterity, can hesitate one moment at adopting 
them. I want to know how these sentiments are received in Congress. I dare say there would be no 
difficulty in procuring a vote and instructions from all the Assemblies in New England for Independency. I most sincerely wish, that now, in the lucky moment, it might be done. 
</p><p>
I have been kept in a continual state of anxiety and expectation, ever since you left me. It has been 
said " to-morrow " and " to-morrow " for this month, but when the dreadful to-morrow will be, I know not. 
But hark ! The house this instant shakes with the roar of cannon. I have been to the door and find it 
is a cannonade from our army. Orders, I find, are come for all the remaining militia to repair to the 
lines Monday night by twelve o'clock. No sleep for me to-night. And if I cannot, who have no guilt upon my soul with regard to this cause, how shall 
the miserable wretches, who have been the procurers of this dreadful scene, and those who are to be the actors, lie down with the load of guilt upon their souls? 
</p><p>
Sunday Evening, 3 March. 
</p><p>
I went to bed after twelve, but got no rest ; the cannon continued firing, and my heart beat pace 
with them all night. We have had a pretty quiet day, but what to-morrow will bring forth, God only knows. 
</p><p>
Monday Evening. 
</p><p>
Tolerably quiet. To-day the militia have all mustered, with three days provision, and are all 
marched by three o'clock this afternoon, though their notice was no longer ago than eight o'clock, 
Saturday. And now we have scarcely a man, but our regular guards, either in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=weymouth" rel="city">Weymouth</a>, Hingham, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=braintree" rel="city">Braintree</a>, or Milton, and the militia from the 
more remote towns are called in as seacoast guards. Can you form to yourself an idea of our sensations? 
</p><p>
I have just returned from Perm s Hill, where I have been sitting to hear the amazing roar of can 
non, and from whence I could see every shell which was thrown. The sound, I think, is one of the 
grandest in nature, and is of the true species of the Sublime. T'is now an incessant roar ; but O ! the fatal ideas, which are connected with the sound ! 
How many of our dear countrymen must fall ! 
</p><p>
Tuesday Morning. 
</p><p>
I went to bed about twelve, and rose again a little after one. I could no more sleep, than if I had been 
in the engagement ; the rattling of the windows, the jar of the house, the continual roar of twenty-four 
pounders, and the bursting of shells, give us such ideas, and realize a scene to us of which we could 
form scarcely any conception. About six, this morning, there was quiet. I rejoiced in a few hours 
calm. I hear we got possession of Dorchester hill last night ; four thousand men upon it to-day ; lost 
but one man. The ships are all drawn rourid the town. To-night we shall realize a more terrible 
scene still. I sometimes think I cannot stand it. I wish myself with you, out of hearing, as I cannot 
assist them. I hope to give you joy of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, even if it is in ruins, before I send this away. I am too 
much agitated to write as I ought, and languid for want of rest. 
</p><p>
Thursday. Fast-day. 
</p><p>
All my anxiety and distress is at present at an end. I feel disappointed. This day our militia are 
all returning without effecting any thing more than taking possession of Dorchester hill. I hope it is 
wise and just, but, from all the muster and stir, I hoped and expected more important and decisive 
scenes. I would not have suffered all I have for two such hills. Ever since the taking of that, we 
have had a perfect calm : nor can I learn yet, what effect it has had in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. I do not hear of one person s escaping since. 
</p><p>
I was very much pleased with your choice of a committee for Canada. All those to whom I have 
ventured to show that part of your letter, approve the scheme of the priest, as a master-stroke of policy.
I feel sorry, that General Lee has left us, but his presence at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> was no doubt of great importance, as we have reason to think it prevented Clinton 
from landing and gathering together such a nest of vermin, as would at least have distressed us greatly. 
But how can you spare him from here? Can you make his place good? Can you supply it with a man 
equally qualified to save us? How do the Virginians relish the troops said to be destined for them? Are 
they putting themselves into a state of defence? I cannot bear to think of your continuing in a state of supineness this winter.

" There is a tide in the affairs of men, 
Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune; 
Omitted, all the voyage of their life 
Is bound in shallows and in miseries. 
On such a full sea are we now afloat ; 
And we must take the current when it serves, 
Or lose our ventures." 
</p><p>
Sunday Evening. 
</p><p>
I had scarcely finished these lines when my ears were again assaulted by the roar of cannon. I could not write any further. My hand and heart will 
tremble at this " domestic fury and fierce civil strife," which " cumber all " our " parts " ; though " blood and destruction " are " so much in use," " and dreadful objects so familiar," yet is not " pity choked," nor my heart grown callous. I feel for the unhappy 
wretches, who know not where to fly for safety. I feel still more for my bleeding countrymen, who are 
hazarding their lives and their limbs. A most terrible and incessant cannonade from half after eight 
till six this morning. I hear we lost four men killed, and. some wounded, in attempting to take the hill 
nearest the town, called Nook s Hill. We did some work, but the fire from the ships beat off our men, 
so that they did not secure it, but retired to the fort upon the other hill. 
</p><p>
I have not got all the particulars ; I wish I had ; but, as I have an opportunity of sending this, I shall endeavour to be more particular in my next. 
</p><p>
If there are reinforcements here, I believe we shall be driven from the seacoast ; but, in whatever state I am, I will endeavour to be therewith content. 
</p><p>
" Man wants but little here below, 
, Nor wants that little long." 
</p><p>
You will excuse this very incorrect letter. You see in what perturbation it has been written, and 
how many times I have left off. Adieu. Yours.
