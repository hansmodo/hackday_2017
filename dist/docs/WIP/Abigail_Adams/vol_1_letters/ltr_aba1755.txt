MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I HAVE omitted writing by the last opportunity to Holland, because I had but small faith in the designs 
of the owners or passengers ; and I had just written you so largely, by a vessel bound to France, that I 
had nothing new to say. There are few occurrences in this northern climate, at this season of the year, 
to divert or entertain you ; and, in the domestic way, should I draw you the picture of my heart, it would 
be what I hope you still would love, though it contained nothing new. The early possession you obtained there, and the absolute power you have ever 
maintained over it, leave not the smallest space unoccupied. I look back to the early days of our acquaintance and friendship, as to the days of love and 
innocence, and, with an indescribable pleasure, I have seen near a score of years roll over our heads, 
with an affection heightened and improved by time ; nor have the dreary years of absence in the smallest 
degree effaced from my mind the image of the dear, untitled man to whom I gave my heart. I cannot 
sometimes refrain considering the honors with which he is invested, as badges of my unhappiness. The 
unbounded confidence I have in your attachment to me and the dear pledges of our affection, has soothed 
the solitary hour, and rendered your absence more supportable ; for, had I loved you with the same affection, it must have been misery to have doubted. 
Yet a cruel world too often injures my feelings, by wondering how a person, possessed of domestic attachments, can sacrifice them by absenting himself for years.

" If you had known," said a person to me the 
other day, " that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met spouse">Mr. Adams</a> would have remained 
so long abroad, would you have consented that he 
should have gone? " I recollected myself a moment, 
and then spoke the real dictates of my heart. " If I 
had known, Sir, that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met spouse">Mr. Adams</a> could have effected 
what he has done, I would not only have submitted 
to the absence I have endured, painful as it has been, 
but I would not have opposed it, even though three 
years more should be added to the number, (which 
Heaven avert !) I feel a pleasure in being able to 
sacrifice my selfish passions to the general good, 
and in imitating the example, which has taught me 
to consider myself and family but as the small dust 
of the balance, when compared with the great community." 
</p><p>
It is now, my dear friend, a long, long time, since I had a line from you. The fate of Gibraltar leads 
me to fear, that a peace is far distant, and that I shall not see you, God only knows when. I shall say 
little about my former request ; not that my desire is less, but, before this can reach you, tis probable I 
may receive your opinion ; if in favor of my coming to you, I shall have no occasion to urge it further ; 
if against it, I would not embarrass you by again requesting it. I will endeavour to sit down and consider 
it as the portion allotted me. My dear sons are well. Our friends all desire to be remembered. The fleet 
of our allies expects to sail daily, but where destined we know not. A great harmony has subsisted be tween them and the Americans ever since their residence here. 
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear friend. Why is it, that I hear so seldom from my dear John? But one letter have I 
ever received from him since he arrived in Petersburgh. I wrote him by the last opportunity. Ever remember me, as I do you, with all the tenderness, 
which it is possible for one object to feel for another, which no time can obliterate, no distance alter, but which is always the same in the bosom of
