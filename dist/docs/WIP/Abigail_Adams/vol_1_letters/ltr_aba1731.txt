</p><p>
How many are the solitary hours I spend, ruminating upon the past, and anticipating the future, whilst 
you, overwhelmed with the cares of state, have but a few moments you can devote to any individual. 
</p><p>
All domestic pleasures and enjoyments are absorbed in the great and important duty you owe your country, " for our country is, as it were, a secondary 
god, and the first and greatest parent. It is to be preferred to parents, wives, children, friends, and all 
things, the gods only excepted ; for, if our country perishes, it is as impossible to save an individual, as 
to preserve one of the fingers of a mortified hand." Thus do I suppress every wish, and silence every 
murmur, acquiescing in a painful separation from the companion of my youth, and the friend of my heart. 
</p><p>
I believe t'is near ten days since I wrote you a line. I have not felt in a humor to entertain you if 
I had taken up my pen. Perhaps some unbecoming invective might have fallen from it. The eyes of 
our rulers have been closed, and a lethargy has seized almost every member. I fear a fatal security 
has taken possession of them. Whilst the building is in flames, they tremble at the expense of water to 
quench it. In short, two months have elapsed since the evacuation of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, and very little has been 
done in that time to secure it, or the harbour, from future invasion. The people are all in a flame, and 
no one among us, that I have heard of, even mentions expense. They think, universally, that there 
has been an amazing neglect somewhere. Many have turned out as volunteers to work upon Noddle's 
Island, and many more would go upon Nantasket, if the business was once set on foot. " T'is a maxim of state, that power and liberty are like heat and 
moisture. Where they are well mixed, everything prospers ; where they are single, they are destructive." 
</p><p>
A government of more stability is much wanted in this colony, and they are ready to receive it from 
the hands of the Congress. And since I have begun with maxims of state, I will add another, namely, 
that a people may let a king fall, yet still remain a people ; but, if a king let his people slip from him, 
he is no longer a king. And as this is most certainly our case, why not proclaim to the world, in decisive terms, your own importance? 
</p><p>
Shall we not be despised by foreign powers, for hesitating so long at a word? 
</p><p>
I cannot say, that think you are very generous to the ladies ; for, whilst you are proclaiming peace and 
good -will to men, emancipating all nations, you insist upon retaining an absolute power over wives. 
But you must remember, that arbitrary power is like most other things which are very hard, very liable 
to be broken ; and, notwithstanding all your wise laws and maxims, we have it in our power, not only to 
free ourselves, but to subdue our masters, and, with out violence, throw both your natural and legal authority at our feet ; 
</p><p>
" Charm by accepting, by submitting sway, 
Yet have our humor most when we obey." 
</p><p>
I thank you for several letters which I have received since I wrote last ; they alleviate a tedious 
absence, and I long earnestly for a Saturday evening, and experience a similar pleasure to that which 
I used to find in the return of my friend upon that day after a week's absence. The idea of a year dissolves all my philosophy. 
</p><p>
Our little ones, whom you so often recommend to my care and instruction, shall not be deficient in 
virtue or probity, if the precepts of a mother have their desired effect ; but they would be doubly en 
forced, could they be indulged with the example of a father alternately before them. I often point them to their sire, 
</p><p>
" engaged in a corrupted state, Wrestling with vice and faction."

I designed to have finished the sheet, but, an opportunity offering, I close, only just informing you that, May the 7th, our privateers took two prizes in 
the bay, in fair sight of the man-of-war ; one, a brig from Ireland ; the other from Fayal, loaded with 
wine, brandy, &c. ; the other with beef, &c. The wind was east, and a flood tide, so that the tenders 
could not get out, though t they tried several times ; the lighthouse fired signal guns, but all would not do. They took them in triumph, and carried them into Lynn. 
</p><p>
Pray be kind enough to remember me at all times, and write, as often as you possibly can, to your
