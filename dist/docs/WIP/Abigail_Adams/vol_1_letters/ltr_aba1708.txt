16 September, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1774">1774</a>. 
</p><p>
I dined to-day at Colonel Quincy's. They were 
so kind as to send me and Abby and Betsey an invitation to spend the day with them ; and, as I had not 
been to see them since I removed to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=braintree" rel="city">Braintree</a>, I accepted the invitation. After I got there came Mr. 
Samuel Quincy's wife and Mr. Sumner, Mr. Josiah and wife. A little clashing of parties, you may be 
sure. Mr. Sam's wife said, she thought it high time 
for her husband to turn about ; he had not done half 
so cleverly since he left her advice ; said they both 
greatly admired the most excellent speech of the 
Bishop of St. Asaph, which I suppose you have seen. 
It meets, and most certainly merits, the greatest encomiums.

Upon my return at night, Mr. Thaxter met me 
at the door with your letter, dated at Princeton, 
New Jersey. It really gave me such a flow of spirits, that I was not composed enough to sleep until 
one o'clock. You make no mention of one I wrote 
you previous to that you received by Mr. Breck, and 
sent by Mr. Cunningham. I am rejoiced to hear you 
are well. I want to know many more particulars 
than you write me, and hope soon to hear from you 
again. I dare not trust myself with the thought how 
long you may perhaps be absent. I only count the 
weeks already past and they amount to five. I am 
not so lonely as I should have been without my two 
neighbours ; we make a table-full at meal times. All 
the rest of their time they spend in the office. Never were two persons who gave a family less trouble 
than they do. It is at last determined, that Mr. 
Rice keep the school here. Indeed, he has kept 
ever since he has been here, but not with any expectation that he should be continued ; but the people, finding no small difference between him and his predecessor, chose he should be continued. I have 
not sent Johnny. He goes very steadily to Mr. 
Thaxter, who I believe takes very good care of him ; 
and, as they seem to have a liking to each other, 
I believe it will be best to continue him with him. 
However, when you return, we can consult what 
will be best. I am certain that, if he does not get so 
much good, he gets less harm ; and I have always 
thought it of very great importance, that children 
should, in the early part of life, be unaccustomed to 
such examples as would tend to corrupt the purity of 
their words and actions, that they may chill with 
horror at the sound of an oath, and blush with indignation at an obscene expression. These first principles, which grow with their growth, and strengthen with their strength, neither time nor custom can to 
tally eradicate. You will perhaps be tired. No. 
Let it serve by way of relaxation from the more important concerns of the day, and be such an amusement, as your little hermitage used to afford you 
here. You have before you, to express myself in 
the words of the Bishop, the greatest national concerns that ever came before any people ; and, if the 
prayers and petitions ascend unto Heaven, which 
are daily offered for you, wisdom will flow down as 
a stream, and righteousness as the mighty waters, 
and your deliberations will make glad the cities of 
our God.

I was very sorry I did not know of Mr. Gary's 
going ; it would have been so good an opportunity to 
have sent this, as I lament the loss of. You have 
heard, no doubt, of the people's preventing the court 
from sitting in various counties ; and last week, in 
Taunton, Angier urged the court's opening, and call 
ing out the actions, but could not effect it. I saw a 
letter from Miss Eunice, wherein she gives an ac 
count of it, and says there were two thousand men 
assembled round the court-house, and, by a commit 
tee of nine, presented a petition requesting that they 
would not sit, and with the utmost order waited two 
hours for their answer, when they dispersed.

You will burn all these letters, lest they should 
fall from your pocket, and thus expose your most 
affectionate friend,
