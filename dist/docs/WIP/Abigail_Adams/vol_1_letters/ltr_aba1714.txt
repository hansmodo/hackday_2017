I SAT down to write to you on Monday, but really 
could not compose myself sufficiently ; the anxiety I 
suffered from not hearing one syllable from you for 
more than five weeks, and the new distress arising 
from the arrival of recruits, agitated me more than 
I have been since the never-to-be-forgotten 14th of 
April. I have been much revived by receiving two 
letters from you last night ; one by the servant of 
your friend, and the other by the gentleman you 
mention, though they both went to Cambridge, and 
I have not seen them. I hope to send this, as a re 
turn to you. 
</p><p>
I feared much for your health, when you went 
away. I must entreat you to be as careful as you 
can consistently with the duty you owe your country. 
That consideration, alone, prevailed with me to con 
sent to your departure, in a time so perilous and 
so hazardous to your family, and with a body so 
infirm as to require the tenderest care and nursing. 
I wish you may be supported and divinely assisted 
in this most important crisis, when the fate of empires depends upon your wisdom and conduct. I 
greatly rejoice to hear of your union and determination to stand by us. 
</p><p>
We cannot but consider the great distance you are 
from us as a very great misfortune, when our critical situation renders it necessary to hear from you 
every week, and will be more and more so, as difficulties arise. We now expect our seacoast ravaged ; perhaps the very next letter I write will tage. Necessity will oblige Gage to take some desperate steps. We are told for truth, that he is now 
eight thousand strong. We live in continual expectation of alarms. Courage, I know we have in 
abundance, conduct, I hope we shall not want ; 
but powder, where shall we get a sufficient sup 
ply? I wish we may not fail there. Every town is 
filled with the distressed inhabitants of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>. Our 
house among others is deserted, and by this time, 
like enough, made use of as a barrack. Mr. Bowdoin and his lady are at present in the house of Mrs. Borland, and are going to Middleborough, to the 
house of Judge Oliver. He, poor gentleman, is so 
low, that I apprehend he is hastening to a house not 
made with hands ; he looks like a mere skeleton, 
speaks faint and low, is racked with a violent cough, 
and, I think, far advanced in a consumption. I went 
to- see him last Saturday. He is very inquisitive of 
every person with regard to the times ; begged I 
would let him know of the first intelligence I had 
from you ; is very unable to converse by reason of 
his cough. He rides every pleasant day, and has 
been kind enough to call at the door (though unable 
to get out) several times. He says the very name 
of Hutchinson distresses him. Speaking of him, the 
other day, he broke out, " Religious rascal ! how 
I abhor his name." 
</p><p>
Pray be as particular as possible when you write. 
Everybody wants to hear and to know what is do 
ing, and what may be communicated do not fail to 
inform me of. All our friends desire to be kindly 
remembered to you. Gage's proclamation you 
will receive by this conveyance. All the records of 
time cannot produce a blacker page. Satan, when 
driven from the regions of bliss, exhibited not more 
malice. Surely the father of lies is superseded. 
Yet we think it the best proclamation he could have issued. 
</p><p>
I shall, whenever I can, receive and entertain, in 
the best manner I am capable, the gentlemen who 
have so generously proffered their services in our 
army. Government is wanted in the army and else 
where. We see the want of it more from so large 
a body being together, than when each individual 
was employed in his own domestic circle. My best 
regards attend every man you esteem. You will 
make my compliments to Mr. Mifflin and lady. I do 
not now wonder at the regard the ladies express for 
a soldier. Every man who wears a cockade appears 
of double the importance he used to do, and I feel 
a respect for the lowest subaltern in the army. You 
tell me you know not when you shall see me. I 
never trust myself long with the terrors which some 
times intrude themselves upon me. 
</p><p>
I hope we shall see each other again, and rejoice 
together in happier days ; the little ones are well, and send duty to papa. Don't fail of letting me 
hear from you by every opportunity. Every line is like a precious relic of the saints. 
</p><p>
I have a request to make of you ; something like the barrel of sand, I suppose you will think it, but 
really of much more importance to me. It is, that you would send out Mr. Bass, and purchase me a 
bundle of pins, and put them in your trunk for me. The cry for pins is so great, that what I used to buy 
for seven shillings and sixpence, are now twenty 
shillings, and not to be had for that. A bundle contains six thousand, for which I used to give a dollar ; 
but if you can procure them for fifty shillings, or three pounds, pray let me have them. 
</p><p>
I am, with the tenderest regard, 
</p><p>
Your
