MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
THE family are all retired to rest ; the busy scenes 
of the day are over ; a day which I wished to have 
devoted in a particular manner to my dearest friend ; but company falling in prevented it, nor could I claim 
a moment until this silent watch of the night. 
</p><p>
Look, (is there a dearer name than friend? Think of it for me,) look to the date of this letter, and tell 
me, what are the thoughts which arise in your mind? Do you not recollect, that eighteen years have run 
their circuit since we pledged our mutual faith to each other, and the hymeneal torch was lighted at 
the altar of Love? Yet, yet it burns with unabating fervor. Old Ocean has not quenched it, nor old Time 
smothered it in this bosom. It cheers me in the lonely hour ; it comforts me even in the gloom which 
sometimes possesses my mind. 
</p><p>
It is, my friend, from the remembrance of the joys I have lost, that the arrow of affliction is pointed. I 
recollect the untitled man, to whom I gave my heart, and, in the agony of recollection, when time and 
distance present themselves together, wish he had never been any other. Who shall give me back time? 
Who shall compensate to me those years I cannot recall? How dearly have I paid for a titled hus 
band? Should I wish you less wise, that I might enjoy more happiness? I cannot find that in my 
heart. Yet Providence has wisely placed the real blessings of life within the reach of moderate abilities ; 
and he who is wiser than his neighbour sees so much more to pity and lament, that I doubt whether the 
balance of happiness is in his scale. 
</p><p>
I feel a disposition to quarrel with a race of beings who have cut me off, in the midst of my days, from 
the only society I delighted in. " Yet no man liveth for himself," says an authority I will not dispute. 
Let me draw satisfaction from this source, and, in stead of murmuring and repining at my lot, consider 
it in a more pleasing view. Let me suppose, that the same gracious Being, who first smiled upon our 
union and blessed us in each other, endowed my friend with powers and talents for the benefit of man 
kind, and gave him a willing mind to improve them for the service of his country. You have obtained 
honor and reputation at home and abroad. O ! may not an inglorious peace wither the laurels you have won. 
</p><p>
I wrote you by Captain Grinnell. The Firebrand is in great haste to return, and I fear will not give me 
time to say half I wish. I want you to say many more things to me than you do ; but you write so 
wise, so like a minister of state. I know your embarrassments. Thus again I pay for titles. Life 
takes its complexion from inferior things. It is little attentions and assiduities that sweeten the bitter draught 
and smooth the rugged road. 
</p><p>
I have repeatedly expressed my desire to make a part of your family. But " Will you come and see 
me? " cannot be taken in that serious light should choose to consider an invitation from those I love. 
I do not doubt but that you would be glad to see me, but I know you are apprehensive of dangers and 
fatigues. I know your situation may be unsettled, and it may be more permanent than I wish it. Only 
think how the words, " three, four, and five years absence," sound? They sink into my heart with a 
weight I cannot express. Do you look like the miniature you sent? I cannot think so. But you have 
a better likeness, I am told. Is that designed for me? Gracious Heaven ! restore to me the original, and I 
care not who has the shadow. 
</p><p>
We are hoping for the fall of Gibraltar, because we imagine that will facilitate a peace ; and who is 
not weary of the war? The French fleet still remain with us, and the British cruisers insult them. 
More American vessels have been captured since they have lain here than for a year before ; the 
General Greene is taken and carried into Halifax, by which, I suppose, I have lost some small bundles or 
packages. Beals told me, that you gave him seven small packages, which he delivered Captain Bacon 
for me. The prisoners have all arrived, except Savil, who is yet in France. I mentioned to you 
before, that some of them had been with me, and offered to repay the money with which you supplied 
them. I could only tell them, that I had never received a line from you concerning the matter, and that 
I chose first to hear from you. I would not receive a farthing, unless I had your express direction, and 
your handwriting to prove, that what you had done was from your private purse, which I was confident 
was the case, or you would have been as ready to have relieved others, if you had any public funds for 
that purpose, as those which belonged to this town. I found a story prevailing, that what you had done 
was at the public expense. This took its rise either from ignorance or ingratitude ; but it fully determined me to receive your direction. The persons who 
have been with me are the two Clarks, the two Beales, and Job Field.

Adieu, my dear friend. Ever, ever, yours,
