MY DEAREST FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I CLOSED a long letter to you only two days ago, but as no opportunity is omitted by me, I embrace this, 
as Colonel Fleury was kind enough to write me on purpose, from Newport, to inform me of it, and to 
promise a careful attention to it. Yet I feel doubtful of its safety. The enemy seems to be collecting a prodigious force into these seas, and is bent 
upon the destruction of oar allies. We are not a little anxious for them, and cannot but wonder, that 
they are not yet reinforced. Graves's fleet, Arbuthnot s, and Rodney s, all here ; with such a superiority, 
can it be matter of surprise, if M. de Ternay should fall a sacrifice? My own mind, I own, is full of 
apprehension ; yet I trust we shall not be delivered over to the vengeance of a nation more wicked and 
perverse than our own. We daily experience the correcting and the defending arm. The enclosed 
papers will give you the particulars of an infernal plot, and the providential discovery of it. For, how 
ever the belief of a particular Providence may be exploded by the modern wits, and the infidelity of too 
many of the rising generation deride the idea, yet the virtuous mind will look up and acknowledge the great 
First Cause, without whose notice not even a sparrow falls to the ground. 
</p><p>
I am anxious to hear from you. Your last letter, which I have received, was dated June the 17th. I 
have written you repeatedly, that my trunk was not put on board the Alliance ; that poor vessel was the 
sport of more than winds and waves. The conduct with regard to her is considered as very extraordinaiy. 
She came to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, as you have no doubt heard. Landais is suspended. The man must be new made 
before he can be entitled to command. I hope Captain Sampson arrived safe. He carried the resolve of 
Congress, which you wanted. 
</p><p>
You tell me to send you prices current. I will aim at it. Corn, is now thirty pounds, rye twentyseven, per bushel. Flour from a hundred and forty 
to a hundred and thirty per hundred. Beef, eight dollars per pound ; mutton, nine ; lamb, six, seven, 
and eight. Butter twelve dollars per pound ; cheese, ten. Sheep's wool thirty dollars per pound ; flax, 
twenty. West India articles ; sugar, from a hundred and seventy to two hundred pounds per hundred ; 
molasses, forty-eight dollars per gallon ; tea, ninety ; coffee, twelve ; cotton wool, thirty per pound. 
Exchange from seventy to seventy-five for hard money. Bills at fifty. Money scarce ; plenty of goods ; 
enormous taxes. Our State affairs are thus. Hancock will be Governor, by a very great majority ; the 
Senate will have to choose the Lieutenant-Governor. X3ur constitution is read with great admiration in New 
/ York, and pronounced by the Royal Governor the "best republican form he ever saw, but with sincere 
hopes that it might not be accepted. How will it be administered? is now the important question. 
</p><p>
The report of the day is, that three thousand troops are arrived at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New York</a> from England. 
</p><p>
Adieu ! Most affectionately yours.
