PREFACE. 



THIS DIARY was written with the knowledge of 
the President and the Secretary of War. I informed 
them of it by note. They did not deprecate criticism 
on their official conduct; for they allowed me still to 
execute the functions of a very important position in 
the Government until the end of its career. 

My discriminating friends will understand why I 
accepted the poor title of a clerkship, after having 
declined the Chargeship to Naples, tendered by Mr. 
Calhoun during the administration of President Polk.

A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY. 



CHAPTER I. 

My flight from the North and escape into Virginia. Revolutionary scene 
at Richmond. The Union Convention passes the Ordinance of Seces- 
sion. Great excitement prevails in the South. 

APRIL STH, 1861. BURLINGTON, NEW JERSEY. The expedition 
sails to-day from New York. Its purpose is to reduce Fort Moul- 
trie, Charleston harbor, and relieve Fort Sumter, invested by the 
Confederate forces. Southern born, and editor of the Southern 
Monitor, there seems to be no alternative but to depart imme- 
diately. For years the Southern Monitor, Philadelphia, whose 
motto was " The Union as it was, the Constitution as it is," has 
foreseen and foretold the resistance of the Southern States, in the 
event of the success of a sectional party inimical to the institution 
of African slavery, upon which the welfare and existence of the 
Southern people seem to depend. And I must depart imme- 
diately; for I well know that the first gun fired at Fort Sumter 
will be the signal for an outburst of ungovernable fury, and I 
should be seized and thrown into prison. 

I must leave my family my property everything. My family 
cannot go with me but they may follow. The storm will not 
break in its fury for a month or so. Only the most obnoxious 
persons, deemed dangerous, will be molested immediately. 

8 O'CLOCK P.M. My wife and children have been busy packing 
my trunk, and making other preparations for my departure. They 
are cheerful. They deem the rupture of the States a, fait accom- 
pli, but reck not of the horrors of war. They have contrived to 
pack up, with other things, my fine old portrait of Calhoun, by 
Jarvis. But I must leave my papers, the accumulation of twenty- 

2 (13) 



14 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

five years, comprising thousands of letters from predestined rebels. 
My wife opposes my suggestion that they be burned. Among 
them are some of the veto messages of President Tyler, and many 
letters from him, Governor Wise, etc. , With the latter I had a 
correspondence in 1856, showing that this blow would probably 
have been struck then, if Fremont had been elected. 

APRIL 9TH. My adieus over, I set out in the broad light of 
day. When the cars arrived at Camden, I proceeded, with the 
rest of the through passengers, in the boat to the navy yard, with- 
out going ashore in the city. The passengers were strangers to 
me. Many could be easily recognized as Southern men ; but 
quite as many were going only as far as Washington, for their 
reward. They were bold denouncers of the rebellion ; the others 
were silent, thoughtful, but in earnest. 

The first thing which attracted my attention, as the cars left the 
Delaware depot, was a sign-board on my left, inscribed in large 
letters, ""UNION CEMETERY." My gaze attracted the notice of 
others. A mocking bon-mot was uttered by a Yankee wit, which 
was followed by laughter. 

For many hours I was plunged in the deepest abstraction, and 
spoke not a word until we were entering the depot at Washington, 
just as the veil of night was falling over the scene. 

Then I was aroused by the announcement of a conductor that, 
failing to have my trunk rechecked at Baltimore, it had been left 
in that city ! Determined uot to lose it, I took the return train 
to Baltimore, and put up at Barnum's Hotel. Here I met with 
Mr. Abell, publisher of the Baltimore Sun, an old acquaintance. 
Somewhat contrary to my expectations, knowing him to be a na- 
tive of the North, I found him an ardent secessionist. So enthu- 
siastic was he in the cause, that he denounced both Maryland and 
Yirginia for their hesitancy in following the example of the Cotton 
States; and he invited me to furnish his paper with correspondence 
from Montgomery, or any places in the South where I might be a 
sojourner. 

APRIL 10TH. Making an early start this morning, I once more 
arrived at Washington City. I saw no evidences of a military 
force in the city, and supposed the little army to be encamped at 
the west end of the Avenue, guarding the Executive Mansion. 

We took an omnibus without delay and proceeded to the 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 15 

steamer. As soon as we left the shore, I fancied I saw many 
of the passengers breathing easier and more deeply. Certainly 
there was more vivacity, since we were relieved of the presence of 
Republicans. And at the breakfast table there was a freer flow 
of speech, and a very decided manifestation of secession proclivi- 
ties. 

Among the passengers was Major Holmes, who had just resigned 
his commission in the U. S. army. He had been ordered to pro- 
ceed with the expedition against Charleston; but declined the 
honor of fighting against his native land. The major is a little 
deaf, but has an intellectual face, the predominant expression in- 
dicating the discretion and prudence so necessary for success 
in a large field of operations. In reply to a question concerning 
the military qualities of Beauregard and Bragg, he said they 
were the flower of the young officers of 4he U. S. army. The 
first had great genius, and was perhaps the most dashing and 
brilliant officer in the country; the other, more sedate, neverthe- 
less possessed military capacities of a very high order. President 
Davis, in his opinion, had made most excellent selections in the 
appointment of his first generals. The major, however, was very 
sad at the prospect before us ; and regarded the tenders of pecu- 
niary aid to the U. S. by the Wall Street capitalists as ominous of 
a desperate, if not a prolonged struggle. At this time the major's 
own State, North Carolina, like Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, 
Arkansas, and Missouri, yet remains in the Union. 

We were delayed several hours at Aquia Creek, awaiting the 
arrival of the cars, which were detained in consequence of a great 
storm and flood that had occurred the night before. 

APRIL IOTH AND HTH. These two days were mainly lost by 
delays, the floods having swept away many bridges, which had not 
yet been repaired. As we approached Richmond, it was observed 
that the people were more and more excited, and seemed to be 
pretty nearly unanimous for the immediate secession of the State. 
Everywhere the Convention then in session was denounced with 
bitterness, for its adherence to the Union ; and Gov. Letcher was 
almost universally execrated for the chocks he had thrown under 
the car of secession and Southern independence. I heard very 
many who had voted for him, regret that they had ever supported 
the clique of politicians who managed to secure his nomination. 



1C A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

And now I learned that a People's Spontaneous Convention would 
assemble in Richmond on the 16th of the month, when, if the 
other body persisted in its opposition to the popular will, the 
most startling revolutionary measures would be adopted, involv- 
ing, perhaps, arrests and executions. Several of the members of 
this body with whom I conversed bore arms upon their persons. 

APRIL 12TH. To-day I beheld the first secession flag that 
had met my vision. It was at Polecat Station, Caroline County, 
and it was greeted with enthusiasm by all but the two or three 
Yankees in the train. One of these, named Tupps, had been ques- 
tioned so closely, and his presence and nativity had become so 
well known, that he became alarmed for his safety, although no 
one menaced him. He could not sit still a moment, nor keep 
silence. He had been speculating in North Carolina the year be- 
fore, and left some property there, which, of course, he must save, 
if needs be, at the risk of his life. But lie cared nothing for 
slavery, and would never bear arms against the South, if she saw 
fit to "set up Government business for herself." He rather 
guessed war was a speculation that wouldn't pay. His volubility 
increased with his perturbation, and then he drank excessively 
and sang Dixie. When we reached Richmond, he was beastly 
drunk. 

Arrived at the Exchange Hotel, Richmond. A storm rages 
above, and below in the minds of men ; but the commotion of the 
elements above attracts less attention than the tempest of excite- 
ment, agitating the human breast. The news-boys are rushing in 
all directions with extras announcing the bombardment of Fort 
Sumter! This is the irrevocable blow! Every reflecting mind 
here should know that the only alternatives now are successful 
revolution or abject subjugation. But they do not lack for the 
want of information of the state of public sentiment in the North. 
It is in vain that the laggards are assured by persons just from 
the North, that the Republican leaders now composing the cabi- 
net at Washington were prepared to hail the event at Charleston 
as the most auspicious that could have happened for the accom- 
plishment of their designs; and that their purpose is the extinction 
of slavery, at least in the border States; the confiscation of the 
estates of rebels to reimburse the Federal Government for the ex- 
penses of the war which had been deliberately resolved on ; and to 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 17 

gratify the cupidity of the "Wide- Awakes," and to give employ- 
ment to foreign mercenaries. 

But it is not doubtful which course the current of feeling is 
rapidly taking. Even in this hitherto Union city, secession de- 
monstrations are prevalent ; and the very men who two days ago 
upheld Gov. Letcher in his conservatism, are now stricken dumb 
amid the popular clamor for immediate action. I am now 
resolved to remain in Richmond for a season. 

After tea I called upon Gov. Wise, who occupied lodgings at 
the same hotel. He was worn out, and prostrated by a distressing 
cough which threatened pneumonia. But ever and anon his 
eagle eye assumed its wonted brilliancy. He was surrounded by 
a number of his devoted friends, who listened with rapt attention 
to his surpassing eloquence. A test question, indicative of the pur- 
pose of the Convention to adjourn without action, had that day 
been carried by a decided majority. The governor once rose from 
his recumbent position on the sofa and said, whatever the major- 
ity of Union men in the Convention might do, or leave undone, 
Virginia must array herself on one side or the other. She must 
fight either Lincoln or Davis. If the latter, he would renounce 
her, and tender his sword and his life to the Southern Confed- 
eracy. And although it was apparent that his physique was re- 
duced, as he said, to a mere " bag of bones," yet it was evident 
that his spirit yet struggled with all its native fire and animation. 

Soon after President Tyler came in. I had not seen him for 
several years, and was surprised to find him, under the weight of 
so many years, unchanged in activity and energy of body and 
mind. He was quite as ardent in his advocacy of prompt State 
action as Wise. Having, recently abandoned the presidency of the 
Peace Congress at Washington, in despair of obtaining concessions 
or guarantees of safety from the rampant powers then in the ascend- 
ency, he nevertheless believed, as did a majority of the statesmen 
of the South, that, even then, in the event of the secession of all 
the Southern States, presenting thus a united front, no war of great 
magnitude would ensue. I know better, from my residence in the 
North, and from the confessions of the Republicans with whom I 
have been thrown in contact ; but I will not dissent voluntarily 
from the' opinions of such statesmen. I can only, when my opin- 
ion is desired, intimate my conviction that a great war of the sec- 

2* 



18 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

tions might have been averted, if the South had made an adequate 
coup d'etat before the inauguration of Lincoln, and while the Dem- 
ocratic party everywhere was yet writhing under the sting and 
mortification of defeat. Then the arm of the Republican party 
would have been paralyzed, for the attitude of the Democratic 
party would at least have been a menacing one; but now, the 
Government has been suffered to fall into the possession of the 
enemy, the sword* and the purse have been seized, and it is too late 
to dream of peace in or out of the Union. Submission will be 
dishonor. Secession can only be death, which is preferable. 

Gov. Wise, smiling, rose again and walked to a corner of the 
room where I had noticed a bright musket with a sword-bayonet 
attached. He took it up and criticised the sword as inferior to 
the knife. Our men would require long drilling to become expert 
with the former, like the French Zouaves ; but they instinctively 
knew how to wield the bowie-knife. The conversation turning 
upon the probable deficiency of a supply of improved arms in the 
South, if a great war should ensue, the governor said, with one of 
his inevitable expressions of feeling, that it was not the improved 
arm, but the improved man, which would win the day. Let brave 
men advance with flint locks and old-fashioned bayonets, on the 
popinjays of the Northern cities advance on, and on, under the 
fire, reckless of the slain, and he would answer for it with his life, 
that the Yankees would break and run. But, in the event of the 
Convention adjourning without decisive action, he apprehended 
the first conflict would be with Virginians the Union men of 
Virginia. He evidently despaired, under repeated defeats, of see- 
ing an ordinance of secession passed immediately, and would have 
preferred "resistance" to "secession." 

APRIL 13iH. After breakfast I accompanied Gov. Wise to his 
room. He advised me to remain a few days before proceeding 
elsewhere. He still doubted, however, whether Virginia would 
move before autumn. He said there was a majority of 500 Union 
men then in the city. But the other Convention, to meet on the 
16th, might do something. He recommended me to a friend of his 
who distributed the tickets, who gave me a card of admission. 

APRIL 14TH. Wrote all day for several journals. 

APRIL 15iH. Great demonstrations made throughout 'the day, 
and hundreds of secession flags are flying in all parts of the city. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 19 

At night, while sitting with Captain O. Jennings Wise in the 
editorial room of the Enquirer, I learned from the Northern ex- 
change papers, which still came to hand, that my office in Phila- 
delphia, " The Southern Monitor," had been sacked by the mob. 
It was said ten thousand had visited my office, displaying a rope 
with which to hang me. Finding their victim had escaped, they 
vented their fury in sacking the place. I have not ascertained the 
extent of the injury done; but if they injured the building, it be- 
longed to H. B., a rich Republican. They tore down the signs 
(it was a corner house east of the Exchange), and split them up, 
putting the splinters in their bats, and wearing them as trophies. 
They next visited the mansion of Gen. P., who had made his for- 
tune dealing in cotton, and had been a bold Northern champion 
of Southern rights. But the general flinched on this trying occa- 
sion. He displayed the stars and stripes, and pledged "the boys" 
to lead them in battle against the secessionists. 

During the evening^ a procession with banners and torch-lights 
came up the street and paused before the Enquirer office. They 
called for Captain Wise, and I accompanied him to the iron bal- 
cony, where he made them a soul-stirring speech. At its conclu- 
sion, he seized me by the arm and introduced me to the crowd. He 
informed them of the recent proceedings in Philadelphia, etc., and 
then ceased speaking, leaving me to tell my own story to the list- 
ening multitude. That was not my fault ; I had never attempted 
to make a public speech in my life ; and I felt that I was in a pre- 
dicament. Wise knew it, and enjoyed my embarrassment. I con- 
trived, however, to say to the people that the time for speaking 
had gone by, and there was no time left for listening. They pro- 
ceeded up the street, growing like a snow-ball as they rolled on- 
ward. At every corner there were cheers uttered for Davis, and 
groans for Lincoln. 

Upon returning to my boarding-house (the hotel being found 
too expensive), kept by Mrs. Samuels, and her sister, Miss Long, 
I found the ladies making secession flags. Indeed, the ladies 
everywhere seem imbued with the spirit of patriotism, and never 
fail to exert their influence in behalf of Southern independence. 

APRIL 15iH. To-day the secession fires assumed a whiter heat. 
In the Conventiou the Union men no longer utter denunciations 
against the disuniouists. They merely resort to pretexts and 



20 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

quibbles to stave off the inevitable ordinance. They had sent a 
deputation to Washington to make a final appeal to Seward and 
Lincoln to vouchsafe them such guarantees as would enable them 
to keep Virginia to her moorings. But in vain. They could not 
obtain even a promise of concession. And now the Union mem- 
bers as they walk the streets, and even Gov. Letcher himself, hear 
the indignant mutterings of the impassioned storm which threatens 
every hour to sweep them from existence. Business is generally 
suspended, and men run together in great crowds to listen to the 
news from the North, where it is said many outrages are com- 
mitted on Southern men and those who sympathize with them. 
Many arrests are made, and the victims thrown into Fort Lafay- 
ette. These crowds are addressed by the most inflamed members 
of the Convention, and never did I hear more hearty responses 
from the people. 

APRIL 16TH. This day the Spontaneous People's Convention 
met and organized in Metropolitan Hall. The door-keeper stood 
with a drawn sword in his hand. But the scene was orderly. The 
assembly was full, nearly every county being represented, and the 
members were the representatives of the most ancient and respect- 
able families in the State. David Chalmers, of Halifax County, I 
believe, was the President, and Willoughby Newton, a life-long 
Whig, among the Yice-Presidents. P. H. Aylett, a grandson of 
Patrick Henry, was the first speaker. And his eloquence indicated 
that the spirit of his ancestor survived in him. But he was for 
moderation and delay, still hoping that the other Convention 
would yield to the pressure of public sentiment, and place the 
State in the attitude now manifestly desired by an overwhelming 
majority of the people. He was answered by the gallant Capt. 
Wise, who thrilled every breast with his intrepid bearing and 
electric bursts of oratory. He advocated action, without reference 
to the other Convention, as the best means of bringing the Union- 
ists to their senses. And the so-called Demosthenean Seddon, and 
G. W. Randolph (grandson of Thomas Jefferson), Lieut. -Gov. 
Montague, James Lyons, Judge Robertson, etc., were there. 
Never, never did I hear more exalted and effective bursts of 
oratory. And it was apparent that messages were constantly re- 
ceived from the other Convention. What they were, I did not 
learn at the moment ; but it was evident that the Unionists were 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 21 

shaking in their shoes, and they certainly begged one just one 
day's delay, which was accorded them. The People's Convention 
agreed to adjourn till 10 o'clock A.M. the next day. But before 
we separated a commotion was observed on the stage, and the 
next moment a Mr. P., from Gov. Wise's old district, rushed for- 
ward and announced that he had just arrived from Norfolk, where, 
under instructions, and with the acquiescence of Gov. Letcher, he 
had succeeded in blocking the channel of the river; and this 
would either secure to us, or render useless to the United States, 
certain ships of the navy, stores, armament, etc., of the value of 
millions of dollars. This announcement was received with the 
wildest shouts of joy. Young men threw up their hats, and old 
men buttoned their coats and clapped their hands most vigorously. 
It was next hinted by some one who seemed to know something 
of the matter, that before another day elapsed, Harper's Ferry 
would fall into the hands of the secessionists. 

At night the enthusiasm increases in intensity, and no further 
opposition is to be apprehended from the influence of Tim Rives, 
Baldwin, Clemens, etc. etc. It was quite apparent, indeed, that 
if an ordinance of secession were passed by the new Convention, 
its validity would be recognized and acted upon by the majority 
of the people. But this would be a complication of the civil war, 
now the decree of fate. 

Perhaps the occurrence which has attracted most attention is 
the raising of the Southern flag on the capitol. It was hailed with 
the most deafening shouts of applause. But at a quiet hour of 
the night, the governor had it taken down, for the Convention had 
not yet passed the ordinance of secession. Yet the stars and 
stripes did not float in its stead ; it was replaced by the flag of 
Virginia. 

APRIL I^TH. This was a memorable day. When we assembled 
at Metropolitan Hall, it could be easily perceived that we were on 
the threshold of momentous events. All other subjects, except that 
of a new political organization of the State, seemed to be moment- 
arily delayed, as if awaiting action elsewhere. And this plan of 
political organization filled me with alarm, for I apprehended it 
would result in a new conflict between the old parties Whig and 
Democrat. The ingenious discussion of this subject was probably 
a device of the Unionists, two or three of them having obtained 



22 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

seats in the Revolutionary Convention. I knew the ineradicable 
instincts of Virginia politicians, and their inveterate habit of public 
speaking, and knew there were well-grounded fears that we should 
be launched and lost in an illimitable sea of argument, when the 
business was Revolution, and death to the coming invader. Be- 
sides, I saw no hope of unanimity if the old party distinctions and 
designations were not submerged forever. 

These fears, however, were groundless. The Union had received 
its blessure mortelle, and no power this side of the Potomac could 
save it. During a pause in the proceedings, one of the leading 
members arose and announced that he had information that the 
vote was about being taken in the other Convention on the ordi- 
nance of secession. " Very well !" cried another member, " we will 
give them another chance to save themselves. But it is the last !" 
This was concurred in by a vast majority. Not long after, Lieut. - 
Gov. Montague came in and announced the passage of the ordi- 
nance by the other Convention ! This was succeeded by a moment 
too thrilling for utterance, but was followed by tears of gladness 
and rapturous applause. Soon after, President Tyler and Gov. 
Wise were conducted arm-in-arm, and bare-headed, down the 
center aisle amid a din of cheers, while every member rose to 
his feet. They were led to the platform, and called upon to 
address the Convention. The venerable ex-President of the 
United States first rose responsive to the call, but remarked that 
the exhaustion incident to his recent incessant labors, and the 
nature of his emotions at such a momentous crisis, superadded to 
the feebleness of age, rendered him physically unable to utter 
what he felt and thought on such an occasion. Nevertheless, he 
seemed to acquire supernatural strength as he proceeded, and he 
spoke most effectively for the space of fifteen minutes. He gave 
a brief history of all the struggles of our race for freedom, from 
Magna Charta to the present day; and he concluded with a 
solemn declaration that at no period of our history were we 
engaged in a more just and holy effort for the maintenance of 
liberty and independence than at the present moment. The career 
of the dominant party at the North was but a series of aggres- 
sions, which fully warranted the steps we were taking for resist- 
ance and eternal separation ; and if we performed our whole duty 
as Christians and patriots, the same benign Providence which 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 23 

favored the cause of our forefathers in the Revolution of 1776, 
would again crown our efforts with similar success. He said he 
might not survive to witness the consummation of the work begun 
that day ; but generations yet unborn would bless those who had 
the high privilege of being participators in it. 

He was succeeded by Gov. Wise, who, for a quarter of an hour, 
electrified the assembly by a burst of eloquence, perhaps never 
surpassed by mortal orator. During his pauses a silence reigned, 
pending which the slightest breathing could be distinctly heard, 
while every eye was bathed in tears. At times the vast assembly 
rose involuntarily ^o their feet, and every emotion and expression 
of feature seemed responsive to his own. During his speech he 
alluded to the reports of the press that the oppressors of the North 
had probably seized one of his children sojourning in their midst. 
"But," said he, "if they suppose hostages of my own heart's blood 
will stay my hand in a contest for the maintenance of sacred 
rights, they are mistaken. Affection for kindred, property, and 
life itself sink into insignificance in comparison with the over- 
whelming importance of public duty in such a crisis as this." He 
lamented the blindness which had prevented Virginia from seizing 
Washington before the Republican hordes got possession of it 
but, said he, we must do our best under the circumstances. It was 
now Independence or Death although he had preferred fighting 
in the Union and when the mind was made up to die rather than 
fail, success was certain. For himself, he was eager to meet the 
ordeal, and he doubted not every Southern heart pulsated in 
unison with his own. 

Hon. J. M. Mason, and many other of Virginia's distinguished 
sons were called upon, and delivered patriotic speeches. And 
finally, Gov. Letcher appeared upon the stage. He was loudly 
.cheered by the very men who, two days before, would gladly have 
witnessed his execution. The governor spoke very briefly, merely 
declaring his concurrence in the important step that had been 
taken, and his honest purpose, under the circumstances, to dis- 
charge his whole duty as Executive of the State, in conformity to 
the will of the people and the provisions of the Constitution. 

Before the sine die adjournment, it was suggested that inasmuch 
as the ordinance had been passed in secret session, and it was de- 
sirable that the enemy should not know it before certain prepara- 



24 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

tions could be made to avert sudden injury on the border, etc., that 
the fact should not be divulged at present. 

APRIL 18TH. In spite of every precaution, it is currently 
whispered in the streets to-day that Virginia has seceded from the 
Union ; and that the act is to be submitted to the people for rati- 
fication a month hence. This is perhaps a blunder. If the South- 
ern States are to adhere to the old distinct sovereignty doctrine, 
God help them one and all to achieve their independence of the 
United States. Many are inclined to think the safest plan would 
be to obliterate State lines, and merge them all into an indivisible 
nation or empire, else there may be incessant conflicts between the 
different sovereignties themselves, and between them and the Gen- 
eral Government. I doubt our ability to maintain the old cumbrous, 
complicated, and expensive form of government. A national ex- 
ecutive and Congress will be sufficiently burdensome to the people 
without the additional expense of governors, lieutenant-governors, 
a dozen secretaries of State, as many legislatures, etc. etc. It is 
true, State rights gave the States the right to secede. But what 
is in a name ? Secession by any other name would smell as sweet. 
For my part, I like the name of Revolution, or even Rebellion, 
better, for they are sanctified by the example of Washington and 
his compeers. And separations of communities are like the sepa- 
rations of bees when they cannot live in peace in the same hive. 
The time had come apparently for us to set up for ourselves, and 
we should have done it if there had been no such thing as State 
sovereignty. It is true, the Constitution adopted at Montgomery 
virtually acknowledges the right of any State to secede from the 
Confederacy ; but that was necessary in vindication of the action 
of its fathers. That Constitution, and the permanent one to 
succeed it, will, perhaps, never do. They too much resemble the 
governmental organization of the Yankees, to whom we have bid> 
adieu forever in disgust. * 

APRIL 19TH. Dispatches from Montgomery indicate that 
President Davis is as firm a States right man as any other, per- 
fectly content to bear the burdens of government six years, and 
hence I apprehend he will not budge in the business of guarding 
Virginia until after the ratification of the secession ordinance. 
Thus a month's precious time will be lost ; and the scene of con- 
flict, instead of being in Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia, will be 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 25 

in Virginia. From the ardor of the volunteers already beginning 
to pour into the city, I believe 25,000 men could be collected and 
armed in a week, and in another they might sweep the whole 
Abolition concern beyond the Susquehanna, and afterward easily 
keep them there. But this will not be attempted, nor permitted, 
by the Convention, so recently composed mostly of Union men. 

To-night we have rumors of a collision in Baltimore. A regi- 
ment of Northern troops has been assailed by the mob. No good 
can come of mob assaults in a great revolution. 

Wrote my wife to make preparations with all expedition to 
escape into Virginia. Women and children will not be molested 
for some weeks yet; bnt I see they have begun to ransack their 
baggage. Mrs. Seraple, daughter of President Tyler, I am in- 
formed, had her plate taken from her in an attempt to get it away 
from New York. 

APRIL 20TH. The news has been confirmed. It was a brick- 
bat " Plug Ugly" fight the result of animal, and not intellectual 
or patriotic instincts. Baltimore has better men for the strife 
than bar-room champions. The absence of dignity in this assault 
will be productive of evil rather than good. Maryland is probably 
lost for her fetters will be riveted before the secession of Virginia 
will be communicated by the senseless form of ratification a month 
hencei Woe, woe to the politicians of Virginia who have wrought 
this delay ! It is now understood that the very day before the 
ordinance was passed, the members were gravely splitting hairs 
over proposed amendments to the Federal Constitution ! 

Guns are being fired on Capitol Hill in commemoration of se- 
cession, and the Confederate flag now floats unmolested from the 
summit of the capitol. I think they had better save the powder, 
etc. 

At night. We have a gay illumination. This too is wrong. 
We had better save the candles. 

APRIL 21 ST. Received several letters to-day which had been 
delayed in their transmission, and were doubtless opened on the 
way. One was from my wife, informing me of the illness of Cns- 
tis, my eldest son, and of the equivocal conduct of some of the 

neighbors. The Rev. Mr. D., son of the late B p, raised the 

flag of the Union on his church. 

The telegraphic wires are still in operation.

26 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

APRIL 22D. Earty a few mornings since, I called on Gov. Wise, 
and informed him that Lincoln had called out 70,000 men. He 
opened his eyes very widely and said, emphatically, " I don't be- 
lieve it." The greatest statesmen of the South have no concep- 
tion of the real purposes of the men now in power in the United 
States. They cannot be made to believe that the Government at 
Washington are going to wage war immediately. But when I 
placed the President's proclamation in his hand, he read it with 
deep emotion, and uttered a fierce " Hah I" Nevertheless, when I 
told him that these 70,000 were designed to be merely the videttes 
and outposts of an army of 700,000, he was quite incredulous. 
He had not witnessed the Wide-Awake gatherings the preceding 
fall, as I had done, and listened to the pledges they made to sub- 
jugate the South, free the negroes, and hang Gov. Wise. I next 
told him they would blockade our ports, and endeavor to cut off 
our supplies. To this he uttered a most positive negative. He 
said it would be contrary to the laws of nations, as had been de- 
cided often in the Courts of Admiralty, and would be moreover a 
violation of the Constitution. Of course I admitted all this ; but 
maintained that such was the intention of the Washington Cabinet. 
Laws and Courts and Constitutions would not be impediments in 
the way of Yankees resolved upon our subjugation. Presuming 
upon their superior numbers, and under the pretext of saving the 
Union and annihilating slavery, they would invade us like the 
army-worm, which enters the green fields in countless numbers. 
The real object was to enjoy our soil and climate by means of con- 
fiscation. He poohed me into silence with an indignant frown. 
He had no idea that the Yankees would dare to enter upon such 
enterprises in the face of an enlightened world. But I know them 
better. And it will be found that they will learn how to fight, and 
will not be afraid to fight. 

APRIL 23o. Several prominent citizens telegraphed President 
Davis to-day to hasten to Virginia with as many troops as he can 
catch up, assuring him that his army will grow like a snow-ball as 
it progresses. I have no doubt it would. I think it would swell 
to 50,000 before reaching Washington, and that the people on the 
route would supply the quartermaster's stores, and improvise an 
adequate commissariat. I believe he could drive the Abolitionists 
out of Washington even yet, if he would make a bold dash, and 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 2T 

that there would be a universal uprising in all the border States 
this side of the Susquehanua. But he does uot respond. Vir- 
ginia was too late moving, and North Carolina, Tennessee, Ar- 
kansas, Kentucky, and Missouri have not seceded yet though 
all of them will soon follow Virginia. Besides, the vote on the 
ratification in this State is to take place a month hence. It would 
be an infringement of State rights, and would be construed as an 
invasion of Virginia! Could the Union men in the Convention, 
after being forced to pass the ordinance, have dealt a more fatal 
blow to their country ? But that is not all. The governor is ap- 
pointing his Union partisans to military positions. Nevertheless, 
as time rolls on, and eternal separation is pronounced by the 
events that must be developed, they may prove true to the best in- 
terests of their native land. 

Every hour there are fresh arrivals of organized companies from 
the country, tendering their services to the governor ; and nearly 
all the young men in the city are drilling. The cadets of the Mil- 
itary Institute are rendering good service now, and Professor 
Jackson is truly a benefactor. I hope he will take the field him- 
self; and if he does, I predict for him a successful career. 

APRIL 24xH. Martial music is heard everywhere, day and 
night, and all the trappings and paraphernalia of war's decorations 
are in great demand. The ladies are sewing everywhere, even in 
the churches. But the gay uniforms we see to-day will change 
their hue before the advent of another year. All history shows 
that fighting is not only the most perilous pursuit in the world, 
but the hardest and the roughest work one can engage in. And 
many a young man bred in luxury, will be killed by exposure in 
the night air, lying on the damp ground, before meeting the 
enemy. But the same thing may be said of the Northmen. - And 
the arbitrament of war, and war's desolation, is a foregone conclu- 
sion. How much better it would have been if the North had per- 
mitted the South to depart in peace! With political separation, 
there might still have remained commercial union. But they would 
not. 

APRIL 25TH. Ex-President Tyler and Vice-President Stephens 
are negotiating a treaty which is to ally Virginia to the Confed- 
erate States. 

APRIL 26TH. To-day I recognize Northern merchants and 



28 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

Jews in the streets, busy in collecting the debts doe them. The 
Convention has thrown some impediments in the way ; but I hear 
on every hand that Southern merchants, in the absence of legal 
obligations, recognize the demands of honor, and are sending 
money North, even if it be used against us. This will not last long. 

APRIL 2tTH. We have had a terrible alarm. The tocsin was 
sounded in the public square, and thousands have been running 
hither and thither to know its meaning. Dispatches have been 
posted about the city, purporting to have been received by the 
governor, with the startling information that the U. S. war steamer 
Pawnee is coming up the James River for the purpose of shelling 
the city ! 

All the soldiery, numbering some thousands, are marching down 
to Rocketts, and forming in line of battle on the heights command- 
ing the approaches. The howitzers are there, frowning defiance ; 
and two long French bronze guns are slowly passing through Main 
Street in the same direction. One of them has just broken down, 
and lies abandoned in front of the Post-Office. Even civilians, by 
hundreds, are hurrying with shot-guns and pistols to the scene of 
action, and field officers are galloping through the streets. Al- 
though much apprehension is apparent on many faces, it is but 
just to say that the population generally are resolved to make a 
determined defense. There is no fear of personal danger; it is 
only the destruction of property that is dreaded. But; in my 
opinion, the Pawnee is about as likely to attempt the navigation 
of the River Styx, as to run up this river within shelling distance 
of the city. 

I walked down to the lower bridge, without even taking a 
pocket-pistol, and saw the troops drawn up in line of battle await- 
ing the enemy. Toward evening the howitzers engaged in some 
unprofitable practice, shelling the trees on the opposite side. 

It was a false alarm, if not something worse. I fear it is an in- 
vention of the enemy to divert us from the generally conceived 
policy of attacking Washington, and rousing up Maryland in the 
rear of Lincoln. 

Met with, and was introduced to, Gov. Letcher, in the evening, 
at the Enquirer office. He was revising one of his many procla- 
mations ; and is now undoubtedly as zealous an advocate of seces- 
sion as any man. He said he would be ready 4o fight in three or 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 29 

four days ; and that he would soon have arrangements completed 
to blockade the Potomac by means of formidable batteries. 

APRIL 28Tii. Saw Judge Scarburg, who has resigned his seat 
in the Court of Claims at Washington. I believe he brought his 
family, and abandoned his furniture, etc. Also Dr. Garnett, who 
left most of his effects in the hands of the enemy. He was a 
marked man, being the son-in-law of Gov. Wise. 

Many clerks are passing through the city on their way to Mont- 
gomery, where they are sure to find employment. Lucky men, 
some of them ! They have eaten Lincoln bread for more than a 
month, and most of them would have been turned out of office if 
there had been no secession. And I observe among them some 
who have left their wives behind to take care of their homes. 

APRIL 29TH. I wrote to my agent on the Eastern Shore to 
send me the last year's rent due on the farm. But I learn that the 
cruisers in the bay are intercepting the communications, and I fear 
remittances will be impracticable. I hope my family are ready by 
this to leave Burlington. Women and children have not yet been 
interfered with. What if they should be compelled to abandon 
our property there ? Mrs. Semple had her plate seized at New 
York. 

At fifty-one, I can hardly follow the pursuit of arms ; but I will 
write and preserve a DIARY of the revolution. I never held or 
sought office in my life ; but now President Tyler and Gov. Wise 
say I will find employment at Montgomery. The latter will pre- 
pare a letter to President Davis, and the former says he will draw 
up a paper in my behalf, and take it through the Convention him- 
self for signatures. I shall be sufficiently credentialed, at all 
events provided old partisan considerations are banished from 
the new confederacy. To make my DIARY full and complete as 
possible, is now my business. And, 

"When the hurly-burly's done, 
When the battle's lost and won," 

if the South wins it, I shall be content to retire to my farm, pro- 
vided it falls on the Southern side of the line, and enjoy sweet 
repose "under my own vine and fig-tree." 

APRIL 30TH. Gen. Kearney has been brought here, having 
been taken on his way to Washington from Missouri. He mani-

fested surprise at his captivity, and says that he is no enemy; be- 
ing, I believe, Southern born. I learn it is the purpose of the 
governor to release him. And this may be a blunder. I fear 
about as much from ill-timed Southern magnanimity as from 
Northern malignity. 

The Pawnee "scare" turned out just as I thought it would. 
She merely turned her nose up the river, and then put about and 
steamed away again. It may do good, however, if it stimu- 
lates the authorities to due preparation against future assaults 
from that quarter. 



CHAPTER II. 

Depart for Montgomery. Interview with President Davis. My position 
in the Government. Government removed to Richmond. My family. 

MAY IST. Troops are coming in from all directions, cavalry and 
infantry ; but I learn that none scarcely are accepted by the State. 
This is great political economy, with a vengeance ! How is Gov. 
Letcher to be ready to fight in a few days ? Oh, perhaps he thinks 
the army will spontaneously spring into existence, march without 
transportation, and fight without rations or pay ! But the Con- 
vention has passed an act authorizing the enlistment of a regular 
army of 12,000 men. If I am not mistaken, Virginia will have to 
put in the field ten times that number, and the confederacy will 
have to maintain 500,000 in Virginia, or lose the border States. 
And if the border States be subjugated, Mr. Seward probably 
would grant a respite to the rest for a season. 

But by the terms of the (Tyler and Stephens) treaty, the Con- 
federate States will reimburse Virginia for all her expenses ; and 
therefore I see no good reason why this State, of all others, being 
the most exposed, should not muster into service every well-armed 
company that presents itself. There are arms enough for 25,000 
men now, and that number, if it be too late to take Washington, 
might at all events hold this side of the Potomac, and keep the 
Yankees off the soil of Virginia. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 31 

MAT 2D. There are vague rumors of lawless outrages commit- 
ted on Southern men in Philadelphia and New York ; but they 
are not well authenticated, and I do not believe them. The Yan- 
kees are not yet ready for retaliation. They know that game 
wouldn't pay. No they desire time to get their money out of 
the South ; and they would be perfectly willing that trade should 
go on, even during the war, for they would be the greatest gainers 
by the information derived from spies and emissaries. I see, too, 
their papers have extravagant accounts of imprisonments and 
summary executions here. Not a man has yet been molested. It 
is true, we have taken Norfolk, without a battle ; but the enemy 
did all the burning and sinking. 

MAY 3D. No letters from my wife. Probably she has taken 
the children to the Eastern Shore. Her farm is there, and she has 
many friends in the county. On that narrow peninsula it is hardly 
to be supposed the Yankees will send any troops. With the 
broad Atlantic on one side and the Chesapeake Bay on the other, 
it is to be presumed there will be no military demonstration by the 
inhabitants, for they could neither escape nor receive reinforce- 
ments from the mainland. In the war of the first Revolution, 
and the subsequent one with Great Britain, this peninsula escaped 
the ravages of the enemy, although the people were as loyal to the 
government of the United States as any; but the Yankees are 
more enterprising than the British, and may have an eye to "truck 
farms" in that fruitful region. 

MAY 4TH. Met Wm. H. B. Custis, Esq., to-day in the square, 
and had a long conversation with him. He has made up his mind 
to sign the ordinance. He thinks secession might have been 
averted with honor, if our politicians at Washington had not been 
ambitious to figure as leaders in a new revolution. Custis was 
always a Democrat, and supported Douglas on the ground that 
he was the regular nominee. He said his negro property a month 
before was worth, perhaps, fifty thousand dollars; now his slaves 
would not bring probably more than five thousand; and that 
would be the fate of many slaveowners in Virginia. 

MAYSTH. President Tyler has placed in my hands a memorial 
to President Davis, signed by himself and many of the members 
of the Convention, asking appropriate civil employment for me in 
the new government. I shall be content to obtain the necessary 



32 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

position to make a full and authentic Diary of the transactions of 
the government. I could not hope for any commission as a civil 
officer, since the leaders who have secured possession of the gov- 
ernment know very well that, as editor, I never advocated the pre- 
tensions of any of them for the Presidency of the United States. 
Some of them I fear are unfit for the positions they occupy. But 
the cause in which we are embarked will require, to be successful, 
the efforts of every man. Those capable of performing military 
duty, must perform it; and those physically incapable of wielding 
the bayonet and the sword, must wield the pen. It is no time to 
stand on ceremony or antecedents. The post of duty is the post 
of honor. In the mighty winnowing we must go through, the 
wheat will be separated from the 'chaff. And many a true man 
who this day stands forth as a private, will end as a general. And 
the efficient subordinate in the departments may be likewise ex- 
alted if he deserves it, provided the people have rule in the new 
confederacy. If we are to have a monarchy for the sake of econ- 
omy and stability, I shall submit to it in preference to the 
domination of the Northern radicals. 

MAY GTH. To-day a Yankee was caught in the street ques- 
tioning some negroes as to which side they would fight on, slavery 
or freedom. He was merely rebuked and ordered out of the 
country. Another instance of Southern magnanimity ! It will 
only embolden the insidious enemy. 

MAY 7TH. Col. R. E. Lee, lately of the United States army, 
has been appointed major-general, and commander-in-chief of the 
army in Virginia. He is the son of " Light Horse Harry" of the 
Revolution. The North can boast no such historic names as we, 
in its army. Gov. Wise is sick at home, in Princess Ann County, 
but has sent me a strong letter to President Davis. I fear the 
governor will not survive many months. 

MAY STH. The Convention has appointed five members of 
Congress to go to Montgomery : Messrs. Hunter, Rives, Brocken- 

borough, Staples, and . I have not yet seen Mr. Hunter ; 

he has made no speeches, but no doubt he has done all in his 
power to secure the passage of the ordinance, in his quiet but 
effective way. To-day President Tyler remarked that the politi- 
cians in the Convention had appointed a majority of the members 
from the old opposition party. The President would certainly 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 33 

have been appointed, if it had not been understood he did not 
desire it. Debilitated from a protracted participation in the ex- 
citing scenes of the Convention, he could not bear the fatigue of 
so long a journey at this season of the year. 

MAY 9Tii. The Examiner still fires shot and shell at Gov. 
Letcher and the dominant majority in the Convention, on account 
of recent appointments. It is furious over the selection of Mr. 
Baldwin, recently a leading Union man, for inspector-general ; and 
seems to apprehend bad results from thrusting Union men forward 
in the coming struggle. The Enquirer is moderate, and kind, to 
Gov. Letcher, whose nomination and subsequent course were so 
long the theme of bitter denunciation. It is politic. The Whig 
now goes into the secession movement with all its might. Mr. 
Mosely has resumed the helm ; and he was, I believe, a secessionist 
many years ago. The Dispatch, not long since neutral and con- 
servative, throws all its powers, with its large circulation, into the 
cause. So we have perfect unanimity in the press. Per contra, 
the New York Herald has turned about and leap-frogged over 
the head of the Tribune into the front ranks of the Republicans. 
No doubt, when we win the day, the Herald will leap back again. 

MAY 10TH. The ladies are postponing all engagements until 
their lovers have fought the Yankees. Their influence is great. 
Day after day they go in crowds to the Fair ground where the 
1st S. C. Yols. are encamped, showering upon them their smiles, 
and all the delicacies the city affords. They wine them and cake 
them and they deserve it. They are just from taking Fort 
Sumter, and have won historic distinction. I was introduced to 
several of the privates by their captain, who told me they were 
worth from $100,000 to half a million dollars each. The Tribune 
thought all these men would want to be captains ! But that is 
not the only hallucination the North labors under, judging from 
present appearances ; by closing our ports it is thought we can be 
subdued by the want of accustomed luxuries. These rich young 
men were dressed in coarse gray homespun ! We have the best 
horsemen and the best marksmen in the world, and these are the 
qualities that will tell before the end of the war. We fight for 
existence the enemy for Union and the freedom of the slave. 
Well, let the Yankees see if this "new thing"will pay. 

MAY HTH. Robert Tyler has arrived, after wonderful risks 



34 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

and difficulties. When I left Mr. Tyler in the North, the people 
were talking about electing him their representative in Congress. 
They tempted him every way, by threats and by promises, to make 
them a speech under the folds of the "star spangled banner" 
erected near his house. But in vain. No doubt they would have 
elected him to Congress, and perhaps have made him a general, if 
he had fallen down and worshiped their Republican idol, and 
fought against his father. 

MAY 12TH. To-day I set out for Montgomery. The weather 
was bright and pleasant. It is Sunday. In the cars are many 
passengers going to tender their services, and all imbued with the 
same inflexible purpose. ' The corn in the fields of Virginia is 
just becoming visible ; and the trees are beginning to disclose 
their foliage. 

MAY 13TH. We traveled all night, and reached Wilmington, 
N. C., early in the morning. There I saw a Northern steamer 
which had been seized in retaliation for some of the seizures of the 
New Yorkers. And there was a considerable amount of ord- 
nance and shot and shell on the bank of the river. The people 
everywhere on the road are for irremediable, eternal separation. 
Never were men more unanimous. And North Carolina has passed 
the ordinance, I understand, without a dissenting voice. Better 
still, it is not to be left to a useless vote of the people. The work 
is finished, and the State is out of the Union without contingency 
or qualification. I saw one man, though, at Goldsborough, who 
looked very much like a Yankee, and his enthusiasm seemed more 
simulated than real ; and some of his words were equivocal. His 
name was Dibble. 

To-day I saw rice and cotton growing, the latter only an inch 
or so high. The pine woods in some places have a desolate 
appearance ; and whole forests are dead. I thought it was caused 
by the scarifications for turpentine ; but was told by an intelligent 
traveler that the devastation was produced by an insect or worm 
that cut the inner bark. 

The first part of South Carolina we touched was not inviting. 
Swamps, with cane, and cypress knees, and occasionally a plung- 
ing aligator met the vision. Here, I thought the Yankees, if they 
should carry the war into the far south, would fare worse than 
Napoleon's army of invasion in Russia. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 35 

But railroads seldom run through the fairest and richest por- 
tions of the country. They must take the route where there is the 
least grading. We soon emerged, however, from the marshy dis- 
trict, and then beheld the vast cotton-fields, now mostly planted in 
corn. A good idea. And the grain crops look well. The corn, 
in one day, seems to have grown ten inches. 

In the afternoon we were whisked into Georgia, and the face of 
the country, as well as the color of the soil, reminded me of some 
parts of France between Dieppe and Rouen. No doubt the grape 
could be profitably cultivated here. The corn seems to have 
grown a foot since morning. 

MAY 14TH. The weather is very warm. Day before yesterday 
the wheat was only six or eight inches high. To-day it is two or 
three feet in height, headed, and almost ripe for the scythe. 

At every station [where I can write a little] we see crowds of 
men, and women, and boys; and during our pauses some of the 
passengers, often clergymen, and not uofrequently Northern born, 
address them in soul-stirring strains of patriotic eloquence. If 
Uncle Abe don't find subjugation of this country, and of such a peo- 
ple as this, is truly a "big job" on his hands, I am much mistaken. 

Passed the Stone Mountain at 11 o'clock A.M. It appears at a 
distance like a vast artificial formation, resembling the pictures of 
the pyramids. 

Arrived at Montgomery 10 o'clock P.M., and put up at the 
Montgomery House. The mosquitoes bled me all night. Mos- 
quitoes in the middle of May 1 And as they never cease to bite 
till killed by the frost, the pest here is perennial. 

MAY 15TH. From my window at the top of the house, I see 
corn in silk and tassel. Three days ago the corn I saw was not 
three inches high. And blackberries are in season. Strawberries 
and peas are gone. 

This city is mostly situated in a bottom on the Alabama River. 

Being fatigued I did not visit the departments to-day, but em- 
ployed myself in securing lodgings at a boarding-house. Here I 
met, the first time, with my friend Dr. W. T. Sawyer, of Hollow 
Square, Alabama. A skillful surgeon and Christian gentleman, 
his mission on earth seems to be one of pure beneficence. He had 
known me before we met, it appears ; and I must say he did me 
many kind offices. 



36 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

In the afternoon I walked to the capitol, a fine structure with 
massive columns, on a beautiful elevation, where I delivered seve- 
ral letters to the Virginia delegation in Congress. They were 
exceedingly kind to me, and proffered their services very freely. 

MAY 16iH Met John Tyler, Jr., to-day, who, with his native 
cordiality, proffered his services with zeal and earnestness. He 
introduced me at once to Hon. L. P. Walker, Secretary of War, 
and insisted upon presenting me to the President the next day. 
Major Tyler had recently been commissioned in the army, but is 
now detailed to assist the Secretary of War in his correspondence. 
The major is favorably known in the South as the author of seve- 
ral Southern essays of much power that have been published in a 
Review, signed "Python." 

The principal hotel is the Exchange, as in Richmond ; the 
entrance to the bar, reading-room, etc. is by a flight of stairs 
from the street to the second story, with stores underneath. Here 
there is an incessant influx of strangers coming from all directions 
on business with the new government. But the prevalent belief 
is that the government itself will soon travel to Richmond. The 
buildings here will be insufficient in magnitude for the' transaction 
of the rapidly increasing business. 

MAY I^TH. Was introduced to the President to-day. He was 
overwhelmed with papers, and retained a number in his left hand, 
probably of more importance than the rest. He received me with 
urbanity, and while he read the papers I had given him, as I had 
never seen him before, I endeavored to scrutinize his features, as 
one would naturally do, for the purpose of forming a vague esti- 
mate of the character and capabilities of the man destined to per- 
form the leading part in a revolution which must occupy a large 
space in the world's history. His stature is tall, nearly six feet ; 
his frame is very slight and seemingly frail ; but when he throws 
back his shoulders he is as straight as an Indian chief. The feat- 
ures of his face are distinctly marked with character ; and no one 
gazing at his profile would doubt for a moment that he beheld 
more than an ordinary man. His face is handsome, and his thin 
lip often basks a pleasant smile. There is nothing sinister or re- 
pulsive in his manners or appearance ; and if there are no spcial 
indications of great grasp of intellectual power on his forehead and 
on his sharply defined nose and chin, neither is there any evidence 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 37 

of weakness, or that he could be easily moved from any settled 
purpose. I think he has a clear perception of matters demanding 
his cognizance, and a nice discrimination of details. As a poli- 
tician he attaches the utmost importance to consistency and here 
I differ with him. I think that to be consistent as a politician, is 
to change with the circumstances of the case. When Calhoun and 
Webster first met in Congress, the first advocated a protective 
tariff and the last opposed it. This was told me by Mr. Webster 
himself, in 1842, when he was Secretary of State; and it was con- 
firmed by Mr. Calhonn in 1844, then Secretary of State himself. 
Statesmen are the physicians of the public weal ; and what doctor 
hesitates to vary his remedies with the new phases of disease ? 

When the President had completed the reading of my papers, 
and during the perusal I observed him make several emphatic 
nods, he asked me what I wanted. I told him I wanted employ- 
ment with my pen, perhaps only temporary employment. I 
thought the correspondence of the Secretary of War would in- 
crease in volume, and another assistant besides Major Tyler would 
be required in his office. He smiled and shook his head, saying 
that such work would be only temporary indeed; which I con- 
strued to mean that even he did not then suppose the war was to 
assume colossal proportions. 

MAY 18TH. To-day I had another interview with the Presi- 
dent. He advised me to see the Secretary of the Treasury without 
delay ; but the Treasury would not answer so well for my Diary. 

MAY 19TH. The Secretary of War sent for me this morning, 
and said he required more assistance in his correspondence, then 
increasing daily; but the act of Congress limiting salaries would 
prevent him from offering me an adequate compensation. He 
could only name some ten or twelve hundred dollars. I told him 
my great desire was employment, and facilities to preserve inter- 
esting facts for future publication. I was installed at once, with 
Major Tyler, in the Secretary's own office. It was my duty to 
open and read the letters, noting briefly their contents on the 
back. The Secretary would then indicate in pencil marks the an- 
swers to be written, which the major and I prepared. These were 
signed by the Secretary, copied in another room, and mailed. I 
was happy in the discharge of these duties, and worked assidu- 
ously day and night. 

4 



38 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

MAY 20TH. Mr. Walker, the Secretary of War, is some forty- 
seven or eight years of age, tall, thin, and a little bent ; not by age, 
but by study and bad health. He was a successful lawyer, and 
having never been in governmental employment, is fast working 
himself down. He has not yet learned how to avoid unnecessary 
labor; being a man of the finest sensibilities, and exacting with 
the utmost nicety all due deference to the dignity of his official 
position. He stands somewhat on ceremony with his brother offi- 
cials, and accords and exacts the etiquette natural to a sensitive 
gentleman who has never been broken on the wheel of office. I 
predict for him a short career. The only hope for his continuance 
in office is unconditional submission to the President, who, being 
once Secretary of War of the United States, is familiar with all 
the wheels of the department. But soon, if I err not, the Presi- 
dent will be too much absorbed in the fluctuations of momentous 
campaigns, to give much of his attention to any one of the depart- 
ments. Nevertheless Mr. Walker, if he be an apt scholar, may 
learn much before that day; and Congress may simplify his duties 
by enacting a uniform mode of filling the offices in the field. The 
applications now give the greatest trouble ; and the disappointed 
class give rise to many vexations. 

MAY 21sT. Being in the same room with the Secretary, and 
seen by all his visitors, I am necessarily making many new ac- 
quaintances ; and quite a number recognize me by my books which 
they have read. Among this class is Mr. Benjamin, the Minister 
of Justice, who, to-day, informed me that he and Senator Bayard 
had been interested, at Washington, in my "Story of Disunion." 
Mr. Benjamin is of course a,Jew, of French lineage, born I believe 
in Louisiana, a lawyer and politician. His age may be sixty, and 
yet one might suppose him to be less than forty. His hair and 
eyes are black, his forehead capacious, his face round and as intel- 
lectual as one of that shape can be ; and Mr. B. is certainly a man 
of intellect, education, and extensive reading, combined with natu- 
ral abilities of a tolerably high order. Upon his lip there seems 
to bask an eternal smile ; but if it be studied, it is not a smile 
yet it bears no unpleasing aspect. 

M.AY 22D. To-day I had, in our office, a specimen of Mr. 
Memminger's oratory. He was pleading for an installment of the 
claims of South Carolina on the Confederacy ; and Mr. Walker, 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. .;'! 

always hesitating, argued the other side, merely for delay. Both 
are fine speakers, with most distinct enunciation and musical voices. 
The demand was audited and paid, amounting, I believe, to several 
hundred thousand dollars. 

And I heard and saw Mr. Toombs to-day, the Secretary of State. 
He is a portly gentleman, but with the pale face of the student and 
the marks of a deep thinker. To gaze at him in repose, the cas- 
ual spectator would suppose, from his neglect of dress, that he was 
a planter in moderate circumstances, and of course not gifted with 
extraordinary powers of intellect; but let him open his mouth, and 
the delusion vanishes. At the time alluded to he was surrounded 
by the rest of the cabinet, in our office, and the topic was the pol- 
icy of the war. He was for taking the initiative, and carrying the 
war into the enemy's country. And as he warmed with the sub- 
ject, the man seemed to vanish, and the genius alone was visible. 
He was most emphatic in the advocacy of his policy, and bold 
almost to rashness in his denunciations of the merely defensive 
idea. He was opposed to all delays, as fraught with danger; the 
enemy were in the field, and their purposes were pronounced. 
Why wait to see what they meant to do ? If we did that, they 
would not only invade us, but get a permanent foothold on our 
soil. We must invade or be invaded ; and he was for making the 
war as terrible as possible from the beginning. It was to be no 
child's play; and nothing could be gained by reliance upon the 
blunders and forbearance of the Yankees. News had been re- 
ceived of the occupation of Alexandria and Arlington Heights, in 
Virginia ; and if we permitted them to build fortifications there, 
we should not be able to expel them. He denounced with bit- 
terness the neglect of the authorities in Virginia. The enemy 
should not have been permitted to cross the Potomac. During 
the month which had elapsed since the passage of the ordinance in 
Virginia, nothing had been done, nothing attempted. It was true, 
the vote on ratification had not been taken ; and although that 
fact might shield the provisional government from responsibility, 
yet the delay to act was fraught with danger and perhaps irrepa- 
rable injury. Virginia alone could have raised and thrown across 
the Potomac 25,000 men, and driven the Yankees beyond the Sus- 
quehanna. But she, to avoid responsibility, had been telegraphing 
Davis to come to the rescue; and if he (Toombs) had been in 
Davis's place, he would have taken the responsibility. 



40 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

The Secretary of War well knew how" to parry these thrnsts ; 
he was not responsible. He was as ultra a man as any; and all 
he could do was to organize and arm the troops authorized by 
Congress. Some thirty odd thousand were mustered in already ; 
and at least five thousand volunteers were offering daily. Mr. 
Toombs said five hundred thousand volunteers ought to be ac- 
cepted and for the war. We wanted no six or twelve months' 
men. To this the Secretary replied that the Executive could not 
transcend the limits prescribed by Congress. 

These little discussions were of frequent occurrence ; and it soon 
became apparent that the Secretary of War was destined to be the 
most important man among the cabinet ministers. His position 
afforded the best prospect of future distinction always provided 
he should be equal to the position, and his administration attended 
with success. I felt convinced that Toombs would not be long 
chafing in the cabinet, but that he would seize the first opportu- 
nity to repair to the field. 

MAY 23D. To-day the President took the cars for Pensacola, 
where it had been said everything was in readiness for an assault 
on Fort Pickens. Military men said it could be taken, and 
Toombs, I think, said it ought to be tak.en. It would cost, per- 
haps, a thousand lives; but is it not the business of war to con- 
sume human life ? Napoleon counted men as so much powder to 
be consumed ; and he consumed millions in his career of conquest. 
But still he conquered, which he could not have done without the 
consumption of life. And is it not better to consume life rapidly, 
and attain results quickly, than to await events, when all history 
shows that a protracted war, of immobile armies, always engulfs 
more men in the grave, from camp fevers than usually fall in battle 
during the most active operations in the field ? 

To-day I saw Col. Bartow, who has the bearing and eye of a 
gallant officer. He was attended by a young man named Lamar, 
of fine open countenance, whom he desired to have as his aid ; 
but the regulations forbid any one acting in that capacity who was 
not a lieutenant; and Lamar not being old enough to have a com- 
mission, he said he would attend the colonel as a volunteer aid till 
he attained the prescribed age. I saw Ben McCulloch, also an 
unassuming but elastic and brave man. He will make his mark. 
Also Capt. Mclntosh, who goes to the West. I think I saw him 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 41 

in 1846, in Paris, at the table of Mr. King, our Minister; but I 
had no opportunity to ask him. He is all enthusiasm, and will 
rise with honor or full with glory. And here I beheld for the first 
time Wade Hampton, resolved to abandon all the comforts of his 
great wealth, and encounter the privations of the tented field in 
behalf of his menaced country. 

Arkansas and Tennessee, as I predicted, have followed the ex- 
ample of Virginia and North Carolina; and I see evidence daily 
in the mass of correspondence, that Missouri and Kentucky will 
follow in good time. 

MAY 24TH. Congress passed, in secret session, a resolution to 
remove the seat of government to Richmond ; but I learn it has 
been vetoed by the President. There is a strong feeling against 
going thither among some of the secessionists in the Cotton States. 
Those who do not think there will be a great deal of fighting, 
have apprehensions that the border States, so tardy in the seces- 
sion movement, will strive to monopolize the best positions and 
patronage of the new government. Indeed, if it were quite cer- 
tain that there is to be no war for existence as if a nation could 
be free without itself striking the blow for freedom I think there 
would be a party among the politicians, not the people opposed 
to confederating with the border slave States. 

Some of his fellow-members tell many jokes on Mr. Hunter. 
They say every time he passes the marble-yards going up to the 
capitol, and surveys the tomb-stones, he groans in agony, and 
predicts that he will get sick and die here. If this be true, I pre- 
dict that he will get the seat of government moved to Richmond, 
a more congenial climate. He has a way of moving large bodies, 
which has rarely failed him ; and some of his friends at the hotels, 
already begin to hint that he is the proper man to be the first 
President of the permanent government. I think he will be 
President some day. He would be a safe one. But this whjsper 
at the hotel has produced no little commotion. Some propose 
making him Secretary of War, as a sure means of killing him off. 
I know a better way than that, but I wouldn't suggest it for the 
world. I like him very much. 

To-day the Secretary placed in my hands for examination and 
report, a very long document, written by a deposed or resigned 
Roman priest. He urged a plan to avert the horrors of war. He

had been to see Lincoln, Gov. Letcher, etc., and finally obtained 
an interview on "important business" with President Davis. The 
President, not having leisure even to listen to his exordium, re- 
quested him to make his communication briefly in writing. And 
this was it about twenty pages of foolscap. It consisted chiefly 
of evidences of the exceeding wickedness of war, and suggestions 
that if both belligerents would only forbear to take up arms, the 
peace might be preserved, and God would mediate between them. 
Of course I could only indorse on the back "demented." But 
the old man hung round the department for a week afterward, and 
then departed, I know not whither. I forget his name, but his 
paper is in the archives of the government. I have always dif- 
fered with the preachers in politics and war, except the Southern 
preachers who are now in arms against the invader. I think 
war is one of the providences, of God, and certainly no book 
chronicles so much fighting as the Bible. It may be to the human 
race what pruning is to vegetation, a necessary process for the 
general benefit. 

MAY 25TH. There is to be no fight no assault on Pickens. 
But we are beginning to send troops forward in the right direc- 
tion to Virginia. Virginia herself ought to have kept the in- 
vader from her soil. Was she reluctant to break the peace ? And 
is it nothing to have her soil polluted by the martial tramp of the 
Yankees at Alexandria and Arlington Heights ? But the wrath ' 
of the Southern chivalry will some day burst forth on the ensan- 
guined plain, and then let the presumptuous foemen of the North 
beware of the fiery ordeal they have invoked. The men I see 
daily keeping time to the music of revolution are fighting men, 
men who will conquer or die, and who prefer death to subjugation. 
But the Yankee has no such motive to fight for, no thought of 
serious wounds and death. He can go back to his own country ; 
our men have no other country to go to. 

MAY 26TH. Was called on by the Episcopal minister to-day, 
Dr. Sawyer having informed him that I was a member of the 
church the doctor being one also. He is an enthusiastic young 
man, and though a native of the North, seems to sympathize with 
us very heartily. He prays for the President of the Confederate 
States. The President himself attends very regularly, and some 
intimate that he intends to become a candidate for membership. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 43 

I have not learned whether he has been baptized. Gen. Cooper, 
the first on our list of generals in the regular army, is a member 
of the church. The general was, I think, adjutant-general at 
Washington. He is Northern born. Major Gorgas is likewise a 
native of the North. He is Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance. 
The Quartermaster-General, Major Myers, is said to be a Jew ; 
while the Commissary-General is almost a Jesuit, so zealous is he 
in the advocacy of the Pope. 

Mr. Mallory, the Secretary of the Navy, I have seen but once ; 
but I have heard him soundly abused for not accepting some 
propositions and plans from Mobile and elsewhere, to build iron- 
clad steam rams to sink the enemy's navy. Some say Mr. M. is 

an Irishman born. He was in the United States Senate, and em- 

l 

braced secession with the rest of the " conspirators" at Wash- 
ington. 

I saw the Yice-President to-day. I first saw Mr. Stephens at 
Washington in 1843. I was behind him as he sat in the House of 
Representatives, and thought him a boy, for he was sitting beside 
large members. But when I got in front of him, it was apparent 
he was a man every inch a man. 

There is some excitement in official circles here against Mr. 
Browne, the Assistant Secretary of State, on the ground that he 
interfered in behalf of a Mr. Hurlbut, a Northern man (prob- 
ably arrested), a writer in the English Reviews against slavery in 
the South, and a correspondent for the New York Tribune. Mr. 
B. is an Englishman, who came from Washington on the invita- 
tion of Mr. Toombs, and through his influence was appointed 
Assistant Secretary of State, and the Southern gorge rises at it. 
I doubt whether he will be molested. 

I saw Major Tochman to-day, also a foreigner. He is author- 
ized to enlist a regiment or two of Polanders in New Orleans, 
where I am told there are none. 

And there are several Northern men here wanting to be gen- 
erals. This does not look much like Southern homogeneity. God 
save us, if we are not to save ourselves I 

How hot it is 1 But I like hot weather better than cold, and 
would soon become accustomed to this climate. This morning 
Mr. Hunter really seemed distressed ; but he has four inches on 
his ribs, and I not the eighth of an inch. 



44 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

Since writing the foregoing, I have seen Mr. Hunter again, and 
although there is no diminution of heat, he is quite cheerful. 
Congress has again passed the resolution to remove the seat of 
government to Richmond, and it is said the President will not 
veto it this time. The President himself came into our office to- 
day and sat some time conversing with Secretary Walker. He 
did not appear vexed at the determination of Congress, which he 
must have been apprised of. 

MAY 26TH. The President is sick to-day having a chill, I 
believe. Adjutant- General Cooper was in, comparing notes with 
the Secretary as to the number of regiments in the field. The 
Secretary has a most astonishing memory, and could easily number 
the forces without referring to his notes. The amount is not large, 
it is true ; but, from the eagerness to volunteer, I believe if we 
had the arms there might soon be organized an army of three or 
four hundred thousand men. And yet it would seem that no one 
dreams of armies of such magnitude. Wait till we sleep a little 
longer ! A great many separate companies are accepted ; all 
indeed that offer for three years or the war, provided they have 
arms even double-barreled shot-guns and hunting rifles. What 
a deal of annoyance and labor it will be to organize these into 
battalions, regiments, brigades, and divisions ! And then comes 
the appointment of staff and field officers. This will be labor for 
the President. Bat he works incessantly, sick or well. 

We have an agent in Europe purchasing arms. This was well 
thought on. And Capt. Huse is thought to be a good selection. 
It will be impossible for Lincoln to keep all our ports hermeti- 
cally sealed. Hitherto improvident, it is to be hoped the South 
will now go to work upon her own resources. We have plunged 
into the sea of revolution, and must, unaided, sink or swim. The 
Yankees say they are going to subdue us in six months. What 
fools ! 

I tasted green corn to-day, and, although very fond of it, I 
touched it lightly, because it seemed so much out of season. The 
country around is beautiful, and the birds are singing as merrily as 
if we were about to enter upon a perennial Sabbath-day, instead 
of a desolating war. But the gunpowder will be used to destroy 
the destroyer, man, and why should not the birds sing ? The 
china-trees are beautiful, and abundant about the dwellings. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 45 

MAY 27TH. We leave Montgomery day after to-morrow. The 
President goes to-day but quietly no one, not connected with 
the Government, to have information of the fact until his arrival 
in Richmond. It is understood that the Minister of Justice (At- 
torney-General) accompanies him. There are a great number of 
spies and emissaries in the country sufficient, if it were known 
when the train would pass, to throw it off the track. This pre- 
caution is taken by the friends of the President. 

The day is pretty much occupied in the packing of boxes. It is 
astonishing how vast a volume of papers accumulates in a short 
space of time but when we consider the number of applications 
for office, the wonder ceases. 

MAY 28TH. Little or no business was done this day. The 
Secretary announced that no more communications would be con- 
sidered by him in Montgomery. He placed in my charge a great 
many unopened letters, and a special list of candidates for office, 
with annotations. These I packed in my trunk. 

As I was to precede the Secretary, and having some knowledge 
of the capacity of the public buildings in Richmond, I was charged 
with the duty of securing, if possible, suitable offices for the De- 
partment of War. I made hasty preparations for departure. 

Before starting, something prompted me to call once more at 
the post-office, where, to my surprise and delight, I found a letter 
from my wife. She was in Richmond, with all the children, Tabby 
and the parrot. She had left Burlington about the same time I had 
left Richmond. At Havre-de-Grace, on the Susquehanna, which ' 
they crossed in the night, my youngest daughter was compelled 
with difficulty to stride over the sleeping bodies of Yankee soldiers. 
She writes that she deposited, very carefully, our plate in the 
bank 1 The idea that all might have been brought off if she had 
only known it, is the source of her wretchedness. She writes that 
she had been materially assisted by Mr. Grubb and his lady, 
prompted by personal friendship, by humanity, and by those gener- 
ous instincts of the true nobility of heart imparted by the Creator. 
Mr. G. is true to the Constitution and the Government under 
which he lives and would doubtless never consent to a rupture of 
the Union under any circumstances. He has a son in the army 
against us. And Col. Wall, another personal friend, boldly 
shook hands with my family at parting, while the Wide-Awake 



46 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

file leaders stood scowling by. I hope he may not suffer for his 
temerity. 

These things occupied my thoughts during a sleepless night in 
the cars. My abode in New Jersey had been a pleasant one. I 
had a fine yard and garden, and many agreeable neighbors. I 
loved my garden, and cultivated my own grapes, pears, peaches, 
apples, raspberries, currants, and strawberries. I had fruits and 
vegetables in the greatest profusion. And the thrushes and other 
migratory birds had come to know me well, and sang me to sleep 
at night, and awakened me with their strains in the morning. They 
built their nests near the windows, for the house was embowered 
in trees, and half covered with ivy. Even my cats, for every living 
thing was a pet to some one of the family, when I think of them 
now, wandering about unprotected, give rise to painful emotions. 
But even my youngest child was willing to make any sacrifice for 
the sake of her country. The South is our only home we have 
been only temporary sojourners elsewhere. 

MAY 29TH AND 30TH. The remainder of the journey was with- 
out interest, until we arrived at Wythville, Ya., where it was dis- 
covered Gen. Floyd was in the cars. He was called out and 
made a speech in vindication of his conduct at Washington, as 
Secretary of War, wherein he had caused the transfer of arras, etc. 
from the North to the South. He was then organizing a brigade 
for the field, having been commissioned a brigadier-general by the 
President. 

MAY 31sT. I arrived in Richmond about 1 o'clock P.M. The 
meeting with my family was a joyful scene. All were well. 

I lost no time in securing rooms for the department in the new 
custom-house. Mr. Giles had been employed in this business by 
the Congressional Committee, and I found him every way accom- 
modating. I succeeded without difficulty in convincing him that 
the War Department was the most important one, and hence en- 
titled to the first choice of rooms. I therefore selected the entire 
suites on both sides of the hall on the lower floor. The Treasury, 
the Executive office, Cabinet chamber, and Departments of Jus- 
tice and the Navy were located on the floor above. This arrange- 
ment, however, was understood to be but a temporary one ; Me- 
chanics Hall was leased for future purposes ; and I was consulted 
on the plan of converting it into suites of offices. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 47 



CHAPTER III. 

Troops pour into Richmond. Beginning of hostilities. Gen. Lee made a 
full general. Major-Gen. Polk. A battle expected at Manassas. 

JUNE IST. In the absence of the Secretary, I arranged the 
furniture as well as I could, and took possession of the five offices 
I had selected. But no business, of course, could be done before 
his arrival. Yet an immense mass of business was accumulating 
letters by the hundreds were demanding attention. 

And I soon found, as the other Secretaries came in, that some 
dissatisfaction was likely to grow out of the appropriation by the 
Secretary of War of the best offices. Mr. Tootnbs said the " war 
office" might do in any ordinary building; but that the Treasury 
should appropriately occupy the custom-house, which was fire- 
proof. For his own department, he said he should be satisfied 
with a room or two anywhere. But my arrangement was not 
countermanded by the President, to whom I referred all objectors. 
His decision was to be final and he did not decide against it. I 
had given him excellent quarters ; and I knew he was in the habit 
of having frequent interviews both with the Secretary of War and 
the Adjutant-General, and this would be inconvenient if they were 
in different buildings. 

JUNE 2o. My wife had a little gold among her straightened 
finances; and having occasion to purchase some article of dress, 
she obtained seven and a half per cent, premium. The goods began 
to go up in price, as paper money fell in value. At Montgomery 
I bought a pair of fine French boots for $10 in gold but packed 
my old ones in the top of my trunk. I was under the necessity, 
likewise, of buying a linen coat, which cost only $3.50. What 
will be the price of such commodities a year hence if the blockade 
continues ? It is fearful to contemplate ! And yet it ought to be 
considered. Boarding is rising rapidly, and so are the blood- 
thirsty insects at the Carleton House. 



48 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

JUNE 3D. The Secretary arrived to-day, sick ; and was accom- 
panied by Major Tyler, himself unwell. And troops are beginning 
to arrive in considerable numbers. The precincts of the city will 
soon be a series of encampments. The regiments are drilled here, 
and these mostly forwarded to Manassas, where a battle must soon 
occur, if the enemy, now in overwhelming numbers, should ad- 
vance. The Northern papers say the Yankee army will .celebrate 
the 4th of July in Richmond. Nous verrons. But no doubt hos- 
tilities have commenced. We have accounts of frightful massacres 
in Missouri, by German mercenaries. Hampton has been occupied 
by the enemy, a detachment having been sent from Fortress Mon- 
roe for that purpose. They also hold Newport News on the Pen- 
insula. There are rumors of a fight at Philippi. One Col. 
Potterfield was surprised. If this be so, there is no excuse for 
him. I think the President will make short work of incompetent 
commanders. Now a blunder is worse than a crime. 

JUNE 4iH. The Secretary is still sick. Having nothing better 
to do, and seeing that eight-tenths of the letters received are 
merely applications for commissions in the regular army an or- 
ganization without men and none being granted from civil life, I 
employed myself writing certain articles for the press, hoping by 
this means to relieve the Secretary of the useless and painful 
labor of dictating negative replies to numberless communications. 
This had the sanction of both the President and the Secretary, 
and produced, in some measure, the desired relief. 

JUNE 5iH. There are rumors of a fight down at Pig's Point 
to-day ; and it is said our battery has torn the farthingale of the 
Harriet Lane pretty extensively. The cannon was heard by 
persons not many miles east of the city. These are the mutter- 
ings of the storm. It will burst some of these days. 

JUNE GTH. We have hard work at the War Department, and 
some confusion owing to the loss of a box of papers in transitu 
from Montgomery. I am not a betting man, but I would wager 
a trifle that the contents of the box are in the hands of some cor- 
respondent of the New York Herald or Tribune. Our careless 
people think that valor alone will win the day. The Yankees 
desire, above all things, information of our condition and move- 
ments, of which they will take advantage. We must learn by 
dear-bought experience. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 49 

JUNE 7Tii. We have a Chief of the Bureau of War, a special 
favorite, it is said, of Mr. Davis. I went into the Secretary's 
room (I now occupy one adjoining), and found a portly gentleman 
in a white vest sitting alone. The Secretary was out, and had 
not instructed the new officer what to do. He introduced himself 
to me, and admitted that the Secretary had not assigned him to 
duty. I saw at a glance how the land lay. It was Col. A. T. 
Bledsoe, lately of the University of Virginia ; and he had been 
appointed by the President, not upon the recommendation of the 
Secretary. Here was a muss not larger than a mustard-seed ; but 
it might grow, for I knew well how sensitive was the nature of 
the Secretary ; and he had not been consulted. And so I took 
it upon myself to be cicerone to the stranger. He was very 
grateful, for a long'time. Col. B. had graduated at West Point 
in the same class with the President and Bishop Polk, and subse- 
quently, after following various pursuits, being once, I believe, a 
preacher, became settled as a teacher of mathematics at the Uni- 
versity of Virginia. The colonel stayed near me, aiding in the 
work of answering letters; but after sitting an hour, and groaning 
repeatedly when gazing at the mass of papers constantly accumu- 
lating before us, he said he believed he would take a number of 
them to his lodging and answer them there. I saw nothing more of 
him during the day. And once or twice, when the Secretary came 
in, he looked around for him, but said nothing. Finally I in- 
formed him what I had done ; and, without signifying an assent, 
he merely remarked that there was no room in his office for him. 

JUNE 8TH. This morning Col. Bledsoe came in with his letters, 
some fifty in number, looking haggard and worn. It was, indeed, 
a vast number. But with one of his humorous smiles, he said they 
were short. He asked me to look over them, and I found them 
mainly appropriate responses to the letters marked for answer, and 
pretty closely in accordance with the Secretary's dictation. In 
one or two instances, however, he had been unable to decipher the 
Secretary's most difficult chirography for he had no idea of 
punctuation. In these instances he had wholly misconcieved the 
meaning, and the replies were exactly the reverse of what they 
were intended to be. These he tore up, and wrote others before 
submitting any to the Secretary. 

5 



50 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

I had only written some thirty letters ; but mine were longer 
longer than there was any necessity for. I told the colonel that 
the Secretary had a partiality for " full " letters, especially when ad- 
dressing any of his friends; and that Major Tyler, who had re- 
turned, and was then sitting with the Secretary, rarely dismissed 
one from his pen under less than three pages. The colonel smiled, 
and said when there was nothing further to say, it was economy to 
say nothing. He then carried his letters into the Secretary's of- 
fice, clearing his throat according to custom on passing a door. 
I trembled for him; for I knew Mr. Walker had an aversion to 
signing his name to letters of merely two or three lines. He re- 
turned again immediately, saying the Secretary was busy. He left 
the letters, however. 

Presently Major Tyler came out of the Secretary's room with 
several voluminous letters in his own handwriting, duly signed. 
The major greeted the colonel most cordially; and in truth his 
manners of a gentleman are so innate that I believe it would be 
utterly impossible for him to be clownish or rude in his address, if 
he were to make a serious effort to be so. 

The major soon left us and re-entered the Secretary's office; 
but returned immediately bearing the colonel's fifty letters, which 
he placed before him and then retired. The very first one the 
colonel's eye .rested upon, brought the color to his face.. Every 
line in it had been effaced, and quite a different answer substituted 
in pencil marks between the lines ! "I wrote that," said the col- 
onel, "according to his own dictation." And as every letter car- 
ried in its fold the one to which it was a reply, he exhibited the 
Secretary's words in pencil toarks. The colonel was right. The 
Secretary had omitted the little word "not"; and hence the col- 
onel had written to the Georgian : "Your company of cavalry is 
accepted." The Secretary refused almost uniformly to accept cav- 
alry, and particularly Georgia cavalry. I took blame to myself 
for not discovering this blunder previously. But the colonel, with 
his rapid pen, soon wrote another answer. About one-half the 
letters had to be written over again ; and the colonel, smiling, and 
groaning, and perspiring so extravagantly that he threw off his 
coat, and occupied himself several hours in preparing the answers in 
accordance with the Secretary's corrections. And when they were 
done, Mr. S. S. Scott, who was to copy them in the letter-book, 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 51 

complimented the colonel on their brevity. In response to this, 
the colonel said, unfortunately, he wished he, Scott, were the sec- 
retary. Scott abused every one who wrote a long letter. 
- JUNE 9TH. To-day the Secretary refused to sign the colonel's 
letters, telling him to sign them himself "by order of the Secre- 
tary of War." 

JUNE 10TH. Yesterday the colonel did not take so many let- 
ters to answer; and to-day he looked about him for other duties 
more congenial to his nature. 

JUNE HTH. It is coming in earnest I The supposed thunder, 
heard down the river yesterday, turns out to have been artillery. 
A fight has occurred at Bethel, and blood Yankee blood has 
flowed pretty freely. Magruder was assailed by some five thousand 
Yankees at Bethel, on the Peninsula. His force was about nine 
hundred ; but he was behind intrenchments. We lost but one man 
killed and five wounded. The enemy's loss is several hundred. 
That road to Richmond is a hard one to travel ! But I learn 
there is a panic about Williamsburg. Several young men from 
that vicinity have shouldered their j)cns and are applying for clerk- 
ships in the departments. But most of tfre men of proper age in 
the literary institutions are volunteering in defense of their native 
land. 

JUNE.12TH. Gen. Lee has been or is to be created a full gen- 
eral in the Confederate army, and will be assigned to duty here. 
He is third on the list, Sydney Johnston being second. From all 
I can see and infer, we shall make no attempt this year to invade 
the enemy's country. Our policy .is to be defensive, and it will be 
severely criticised, for a vast majority of our people are for " car- 
rying the war into Africa" without a moment's delay. The sequel 
will show which is right, the government or the people. At all 
events, the government will rule. 

JUNE 13TH. Only oue of the Williarasburg volunteers carae 
into the department proper; and he will make his way, for he is a 
flatterer. He told me he had read my " Wild Western Scenes " 
twice, and never was so much entertained by any other book. He 
went to work with hearty good-will. 

JUNE 14TH. Col. Bledsoe has given up writing almost entirely, 
but he groans as much as ever. He is like a fish out of water, 
and unfit for office. 



52 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

JUNE 15TH. Another clerk has been appointed; a sedate one, 
by the name of Shepherd, and a former pupil of the colonel's. 

I received several hints that the Chief of the Bureau was not at 
all a favorite with the Secretary, who considered him utterly unfit 
for the position ; and that it could hardly be good policy for me to 
be on terms of such intimacy with him. Policy ! A word I never 
appreciated, a thing I never knew. All I know is that Col. Bled- 
soe has been appointed by the President to fill an important posi- 
tion ; and the same power appoints the secretaries, and can un- 
make them. Under these circumstances I find him permitted to 
sit for hours and days in the department with no one to inform 
him of the condition of the business or to facilitate him in the per- 
formance of his official duties. Not for any partiality in his be- 
half, or prejudice against the Secretary, I step forward and en- 
deavor to discharge my own duty. I strive to serve the cause, 
whatsoever may be the consequences to my personal interests. 

JUNE 16iH. To-day, receiving dispatches from General Floyd, 
in Western Virginia, that ten thousand Yankees were advancing 
through Fayette County, and might intercept railroad communica- 
tion between Richmond and Chattanooga the Secretary got me 
to send a telegraphic dispatch to his family to repair hither with- 
out delay, for military reasons. About this time the Secretary's 
health gave way again, and Major Tyler had another fit of indis- 
position totally disqualifying him for business. Hence I have 
nearly all the correspondence of the department on my hands, 
since Col. Bledsoe has ceased to write. 

JUNE 17TH.. To-day there was a rumor in the streets that Har- 
per's Ferry had been evacuated by Gen. Joseph E. Johnston, and, 
for the first time, I heard murmurs against the government. So 
far, perhaps, no Executive had ever such cordial and unanimous 
support of the people as President Davis. I knew the motive of 
the evacuation, and prepared a short editorial for one of the pa- 
pers, suggesting good reasons for the retrograde movement ; and 
instancing the fact that when Napoleon's capital was surrounded 
and taken, he had nearly 200,000 men in garrison in the countries 
he had conquered, which would have been ample for the defense of 
France. This I carried to the Secretary at his lodgings, and he 
was so well pleased with it he wanted me to accompany him to the 
lodgings of the President, in the same hotel, and show it to him. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 53 

This I declined, alleging it might be too late for the press. He 
laughed at ray diffidence, and disinclination on such occasions to 
approach the President. I told him my desire was to serve the 
cause, and not myself. I suppose he was incredulous. 

JUNE 18TH. The city is content at the evacuation. The peo- 
ple have unbounded confidence in the wisdom of the administra- 
tion, and the ability of our generals. Beauregard is the especial 
favorite. The soldiers, now arming daily, are eager for the fray ; 
and it is understood a great battle must come off before many 
weeks; as it is the determination of the enemy to advance from the 
vicinity of Washington, where they are rapidly concentrating. 
But our people must curb their impatience. And yet we dare not 
make known the condition of the army, the awful fact which 
may be stated here and will not be known until after-years, that 
we have not enough ammunition at Manassas to fight a battle. 
There are not percussion caps enough in our army for a serious 
skirmish. It will be obviated in a few weeks ; and until then I 
pray there may be no battle. But if the enemy advance, our brave 
men will give them the cold steel. We must win the first battle 
at all hazards, and at any cost; and, after that, how long after? 
we must win the last ! 

JUNE 19ie. Yesterday I saw Colonel Bartow, still accompa- 
nied by young Lamar, his aid. I wish all our officers were in- 
spired by the same zeal and determination that they are. And 
are they not ? 

JUNE 20TH. Gov. Wise has been appointed brigadier-general, 
of a subsequent date to General Floyd's commission. He goes to 
the West, where laurels grow; but I think it will be difficult to 
win them by any one acting in a subordinate capacity, and espe- 
cially by generals appointed from civil life. They are the aversion 
of the West Pointers at the heads of bureaus. 

JUNE 21 ST. A large, well-proportioned gentleman with florid 
complexion and intellectual face, who has been whispering with 
Col. Bledsoe several times during the last week, attracted my at- 
tention to-day. And when he retired, Colonel B. informed me it 
was Bishop Polk, a classmate of his and the President's at West 
Point. He had just been appointed a mo/or-general, and assigned 
to duty in the West, where he would rank Gen. Pillow, who was 
exceedingly unpopular in Adjutant-Gen. Cooper's office. I pre- 

6* 



54 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

sume this arose solely from mistrusfof his military abilities; for 
he had certainly manifested much enthusiasm in the cause, and was 
constantly urging the propriety of aggressive movements with his 
command. All his purposed advances were countermanded. The 
policy of the government is to be economical of the men. We have 
but a limited, the enemy an inexhaustible number. 

JUNE 22o. The Convention has appointed ten additional mem- 
bers to the Provisional Congress President Tyler among them. 
It will be observed that my Diary goes on, including every day. 
Fighting for our homes and holy altars, there is no intermission 
on Sunday. It is true, Mr. Memminger came in the other day 
with a proposition to cease from labor on Sunday, but our Secre- 
tary made war on it. The President, however, goes to church 
very regularly St. Paul's. 

On last Sunday the President surprised me. It was before 
church time, and I was working alone. No one else was in the 
large room, and the Secretary himself had gone home, quite ill. 
I thought I heard some one approaching lightly from behind, but 
wrote on without looking up ; even when he had been standing 
some time at the back of my chair. At length I turned my head, 
and beheld the President not three feet from me. He smiled, and 
said he was looking for a certain letter referred by him to the 
Secretary. I asked the name of the writer, which he told me. I 
said I had a distinct recollection of it, and had taken it into the 
Secretary with other papers that morning. But the Secretary was 
gone. We then proceeded into the Secretary's office in search of 
it. The Secretary's habit was to take the papers from his table, 
and after marking on them with his pencil the disposition he 
wished made of them, he threw them helter-skelter into a large 
arm-chair. This chair now contained half a bushel ; and the Pres- 
ident and I set to work in quest of the letter. We removed them 
one by one; and as we progressed, he said with an impatient 
smile, "it is always sure to be the last one." And so it was. 
Having found it, he departed immediately ; and soon after I saw 
him on his way to church. 

JUNE 23D. Every day as soon as the first press of business is 
over, the Secretary comes out of his office and taps me on the 
shoulder, and invites me to ride with him in quest of a house. 
We go to those offered for rent ; but he cannot be suited. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 55 

JUNE 24TH. To-day I was startled by the announcement from 
Col. Bledsoe that he would resign soon, and that it was his pur- 
pose to ask the President to appoint me chief of the bureau in his 
place. I said I preferred a less conspicuous position and less 
labor but thanked him. He said he had no influence with the 
Secretary an incontrovertible fact; and that he thought he 
should return to the University. While we were speaking, the 
President's messenger came in with a note to the colonel ; I did 
not learn the purport of it, but it put the colonel in a good 
humor. He showed me the two first words: "Dear Bledsoe." He 
said nothing more about resigning. 

I must get more lucrative employment, or find something for 
my son to do. The boarding of my family, alone, comes to more 
than my salary ; and the cost of everything is increasing. 

JUNE 25rH. More accounts of battles and massacres in Mis- 
souri and Kansas. I never thought the Yankees would be per- 
mitted to ascend the Missouri River. What has become of the 
marksmen and deer hunters of Missouri ? There has been also a 
fight at Leesburg, and one near Romney, Ya. Blood has been 
shed in all of them. These are the pattering drops that must in- 
evitably be succeeded by a torrent of blood ! 

JUNE 26TH. The President revised one of my articles for the 
press to-day, suggesting some slight modifications, which, perhaps, 
improved it. It was not a political article ; but designed exclu- 
sively to advance the cause by inciting the people of Yirginia 
and elsewhere to volunteer for the war. Such volunteers are ac- 
cepted, and ordered into active service at once ; whereas six and 
twelve months' men, unless they furnish their own arms, are not 
accepted. 

It is certain the United States intend to raise a grand army, to 
serve for three years or the war. Short enlistments constituted 
the bane of Washington's army ; and this fact is reiterated a thou- 
sand times in his extant letters. , 

There are a great many applications for clerkships in the de- 
partments by teachers who have not followed their pupils to the 
army. Army and naval officers, coming over at this late day, 
are commissioned in our service. In regard to this matter, the 
President is supposed to know best. 

JUNE 27TH. We have, I think, some 40,000 pretty well armed 



56 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

men in Yirginia, sent hither from other States. Virginia has I 
know not haw many; but she should have at least 40,000 in the 
field. This will enable us to cope with the Federal army of 70,000 
volunteers, and the regular forces they may hurl against us. 'But 
so far as this department is aware, Yirginia has not yet two regi- 
ments in the service for three years, or the war. And here the war 
will be sure to rage till the end ! 

JUNE 28TH. We have a flaming comet in the sky. It comes 
unannounced, and takes a northwestern course. I dreamed last 
night that I saw, a great black ball moving in the heavens, 
and it obscured the moon. The stars were in motion, visibly, and 
for a time afforded the only light. Then a brilliant halo illumin- 
ated the zenith like the quick-shooting irradiations of the aurora 
borealis. And men ran in different directions, uttering cries of 
agony. These cries, I remember distinctly, came from men. As 
I gazed upon the fading and dissolving moon, I thought of the war 
brought upon us, and the end of the United States Government. 
My family were near, all of them, and none seemed alarmed or dis- 
tressed. I experienced no perturbation ; but I awoke. I felt 
curious to prolong the vision, but sleep had fled. I was grati- 
fied, however, to be conscious of the fact that in this illusory view 
of the end of all things sublunary, I endured no pangs of remorse 
or misgivings of the new existence it seemed we were about to en- 
ter upon. 

JUNE 29TH. I cannot support ray family here, on the salary I 
receive from the government; and so they leave me in a few days 
to accept the tendered hospitality of Dr. Custis, of Newbern, N. C., 
my wife's cousin. 

JUNE 30TH. My family engaged packing trunks. They leave 
immediately. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 57 



CHAPTER IY. 

My family in North Carolina. Volunteers daily rejected. Gen. Winder 
appears upon the stage. Toombs commissioned. Hunter Secretary of 
State. Duel prevented. Col B. Secretary for a few hours. Gen. Gar- 
nett killed. Battle of Manassas. Great excitement. Col. Bartow. 

JULY IST. My family are gone. We have moved the depart- 
ment to Mechanics' Hall, which will be known hereafter as the 
War Department. In an evil hour, I selected a room to write 
my letters in, quite remote from the Secretary's office. I thought 
Mr. Walker resented this He had likewise been piqued at the 
effect produced by an article I had written on the subject of the dif- 
ficulty of getting arms from Georgia with the volunteers from that 
State. One of the spunky Governor's organs had replied with 
acerbity, not only defending the Governor, but striking at the 
Secretary himself, to whom the authorship was ascribed. My 
article had been read and approved by the Secretary before its 
insertion; nevertheless he now regretted it had been written not 
that there was anything improper in it, but that it should have 
been couched in words that suggested the idea to the Southern 
editor that the Secretary might be its author. I resolved to med- 
dle with edged tools no more; for I remembered that Gil Bias 
had done the same thing for the Duke of Lerma. Hereafter I 
shall study Gil Bias for the express purpose of being his antith- 
esis. But I shall never rise until the day of doom brings us all to 
our feet again. 

JULY 2D. There has been some brilliant fighting by several 
brothers named Ashby, who led a mounted company near Romney. 
One of the brothers, Richard, was slain. Turner Ashby put half 
a dozen Yankees hors du combat with his own arm. He will 
make a name. We have accounts of an extraordinary exploit of 
Col. Thomas, of Maryland. Disguised as a French lady, he took 
passage on the steamer St. Nicholas at Baltimore en route for 
Washington. During the voyage he threw off his disguise, and in 



58 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

company with his accomplices, seized the steamer. Coming down 
the Bay, he captured three prizes, and took the whole fleet into 
Fredericksburg in triumph. Lieut. Minor, C. S. K, participated 
in this achievement. Gen. Patterson, who conciliated the mob in 
Philadelphia, which had intended to hang me, seems to be true to 
his pledge to fight the Southern people. He is now advancing 
into Virginia at the head of a brigade. 

JULY 3D. The Secretary said to me to-day that he desired my 
young friend, the classical teacher, to assist me in writing letters. 
I told him I needed assistance, and Mr. Jacques was qualified. 
Major Tyler's ill health keeps him absent half the time. There 
was abundance of work for both of us. Mr. J. is an agreeable 
companion, and omitted no opportunity to oblige me. But he 
trenches on the major's manor, and can write as long letters as 
any one. I would never write them, unless the subject-matter de- 
manded it ; and so, all the answers marked "full" by the Secretary, 
when the sum and substance is to be merely an affirmative or a 
negative, will fall to my co -laborer's share. 

JULY 4iH. These simple things provoked some remarks from 
the young gentlemen in the department, and gave rise to predic- 
tions that he would soon supplant us all in the affections of the 
Secretary. And he is nimble of foot too, and enters the Secre- 
tary's room twice to Col. B.'s or Major T.'s once. I go not 
thither unless sent for ; for in a cause like this, personal advance- 
ment, when it involves catering to the caprices of functionaries 
dressed in a little brief authority, should be spurned with con- 
tempt. But Col. Bledsoe is shocked, and renews his threats of 
resignation. Major Tyler is eager to abandon the pen for the 
sword; but Congress has not acted on his nomination; and the 
West Pointers, many of them indebted to his father for their 
present positions, are inimical to his confirmation. 

JULY STII. We have news of a fight at Gainesville between Gen. 
Patterson and Col. Jackson ; the latter, being opposed by over- 
whelming numbers, fell back after punishing the Philadelphia 
general so severely that he will not be likely to have any more 
stomach for fighting during the remainder of the campaign. 

JULY GTH. Col. Bledsoe complains that the Secretary still has 
quite as little intercourse with him, personal and official, as pos- 
sible. The consequence is that the Chief of the Bureau is draw- 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 59 

ing a fine salary and performing no service. Still, it is not with- 
out the sweat of his brow, and many groans. 

JULY TTH. Major Tyler's health has improved, but I do not 
perceive a resumption of his old intimate relations with the Sec- 
retary. Yet he is doing the heavy epistolary work, being a lawyer ; 
and the correspondence sometimes embracing diverse legal points. 
My intimacy with the colonel continues. It seems he would do 
anything in the world for me. He has put Mr. Shepherd to issuing 
passports to the camps, etc. the form being dictated by the Sec- 
retary. These are the first passports issued by the government. I 
suggested that they should be granted by and in the name of the 
Chief of the Bureau of War and a few were so issued but the 
Secretary arrested the proceeding. The Secretary was right, 
probably, in this matter. 

The President is appointing generals enough, one would sup- 
pose. I hope we shall have men for them. From five to ten 
thousand volunteers are daily offered but not two thousand 
are accepted. Some have no arms; and others propose to serve 
only for six or twelve months. Infantry will not fight with hunt- 
ing rifles or shot-guns; and the department will not accept 
mounted men, on account of the expense of transportation, etc. 
Oh, that I had power but for a week ! There should then be ac- 
cepted fifty regiments of cavalry. These are the troops for quick 
marches, surprises, and captures. And our people, even down 
to the little boys, are expert riders. If it were to be a short war 
or if it were to be a war of invasion on our part it might he 
good policy, economically, to discourage cavalry organizations. 
But we shall want all our men ; and many a man would fight in 
the saddle who could not or would not march in the infantry. 
And mounted men are content to use the double-barreled shot- 
gun one barrel for ball, the other for buck-shot and close quar- 
ters. 

JULY STH. There is a stout gray-haired old man here from 
Maryland applying to be made a general. It is Major J. H. 
Winder, a graduate of West Point, I believe ; and I think he will 
be successful. He is the son, I believe, of the Gen. Winder whose 
command in the last war with England unfortunately permitted 
the City of Washington to fall into the hands of the enemy. I 
have almost a superstitious faith in lucky generals, and a cor- 



60 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

responding prejudice against unlucky ones, and their progeny. 
But I cannot suppose the President will order this general into 
the field. He may take the prisoners into his custody and do 
other jobs as a sort of head of military police ; and this is what I 
learn he proposes. And the French Prince, Polignac, has been 
made a colonel ; and a great nephew of Kosciusko has been com- 
missioned a lieutenant in the regular army. Well, Washington 
had his Lafayette and I like the nativity of these officers better 
than that of the Northern men, still applying for commissions. 

JULY 9iH. Mr. Toombs is to be a brigadier-general. That 
is what I looked for. The two brothers Cobb are to be colonels ; 
and Orr is to have a regiment. 

Mr. Hunter succeeds Toombs in the State Department and 
that disposes of him, if he will stay there. It is to be an obscure 
place; and if he were indolent, without ambition, it would be the 
very place for him. Wise is done for. He has had several fights, 
always drawing blood ; but when he gets ready to make a great 
fight, he is ordered back for fear of his "rashness." Exacting 
obedience in his own subordinates, of course he will obey the 
orders of Adjt.-Gen. Cooper. In this manner I apprehend that 
the three giants of Virginia, Wise, Hunter, and Floyd, yill be 
neutralized and dwarfed at the behest of West Point. Napoleon's 
marshals were privates once ours but perhaps West Point may 
be killed off in the end, since they rush in so eagerly at the begin- 
ning of the war. 

JULY IOTH. There are indications of military operations on a 
large scale on the Potomac. We have intelligence that McDowell 
is making preparations to advance against our forces at Manassas. 
Gen. Johnston is expected to be there in time ; and for that pur- 
pose is manoeuvring Gen. Patterson out of the way. Our men 
have caps now and will be found in readiness. They have short- 
commons under the Commissary Department ; but even with 
empty stomachs, they can beat the Yankees at the ordeal of dying. 
Fighting is a sport our men always have an appetite for. 

JULY HTH. The colonel tried his hand to-day at dictating 
answers to certain letters. Together we pitched upon the proper 
replies, which, after being marked with his pencil, I elaborated 
with the pen. These were first approved by the Secretary, then 
signed by the Chief of the Bureau, and copied by Mr. Scott. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 61 

To-day the colonel essayed a flight with his own plumage. I 
followed his dictation substantially in the answers. But the mo- 
jnent the Secretary's eyes rested upon them, they were promptly 
reversed. The Secretary himself, suspecting how it was, indeed 
he saw the colonel's pencil marks, brought them to me, while 
a humorous smile played upon his usually not very expressive 
lip. When the compel came in, and beheld what had been done, 
he groaned, and requested me to write the proper answers. From 
that day he ceased to have anything more to do with the cor- 
respondence than to sign his name to the letters I prepared for 
him. He remarked to-day that if he was to have nothing to do, 
he would do nothing. 

JULY !TH. The colonel's temper is as variable as an April 
day now all smiles and sunshine, but by-and-by a cloud takes all 
away. He becomes impatient with a long-winded story, told by 
some business applicant and storms whenever any one asks him 
if the Secretary is in. 

To-day, for the first time, I detected a smile on the lip of Col. 
Myers, the Quartermaster-General, as he passed through the 
office. A moment after, Gen. Walker, of Georgia, came in, and 
addressed the colonel thus : 

11 Is the Secretary in ?" 

Col. (with a stare). I don't know. 

Gen. W. (returning the stare). Could you not ascertain for 
me ? I have important business with him ; and am here by ap- 
pointment. 

Col. B. You can ascertain for yourself. I am not his door- 
keeper. There is his door. 

Gen. W. (after a moment's reflection). I asked you a civil 
question in a courteous manner, and have not deserved this harsh- 
ness, and will not submit to it. 

Col. B. It is not courteous to presume I am acting in the ca- 
pacity of a messenger or door-keeper. 

Just then the Secretary appeared at the door, having heard the 
loud language, and Gen. W. immediately entered his office. 

Afterward the colonel fumed and fretted like an angry volcano. 
He disliked Col. Myers, and believed he had sent the general in 
under prompting to annoy him about the Secretary, whom he 
(Myers) really hated. 



62 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

JULY 13TH. The Secretary made peace yesterday between the 
general and the colonel, or a duel might have transpired. 

To-day the colonel carried into the Secretary a number of ap-. 
plications for commissions as surgeons. Among the applicants 
were some of the colonel's friends. He returned soon after in a 
rage, slamming the door after him, and then throwing down the 
papers violently on the floor. He picked th^n up the next mo- 
ment, however, and sitting down beside me, became instantane- 
ously as gentle as a dove. He said the men of science were 
thrust aside to give way to quacks ; but, laughing, he remarked" 

that the quacks would do well enough for the wounded . 

Our men would have too much sense to submit to their mal- 
practice. 

JULY 14TH. The Secretary is sick a^ain. He has been recom- 
mended by his physician to spend some days in the country ; and 
to-morrow he will leave with his family. What will be the conse- 
quence ? 

JULY 15TH. Early this morning, Major Tyler was seated in 
the Secretary's chair, prepared to receive the visitors. This, I 
suppose, was of course in pursuance of the Secretary's request ; 
and accordingly the door-keeper ushered in the people. But not 
long after Col. Bledsoe arrived, and exhibited to me an order from 
the President for him to act as Secretary of War pro tern. The 
colonel was in high spirits, and full dress ; and seemed in no 
measure piqued at Major Tyler for occupying the Secretary's 
chair. The Secretary must have been aware that the colonel was 
to act during his absence but, probably, supposed it proper that 
the major, from his suavity of manners, was best qualified for the 
reception of the visitors. He had been longer in the department, 
and was more familiar with the routine of business. Yet the 
colonel was not satisfied ; and accordingly requested me to inti- 
mate the fact to Major Tyler, of which, it seemed, he had no pre- 
vious information, that the President had appointed Col. Bledsoe 
to act as Secretary of War during the absence of Mr. Walker. 
The major retired from the office immediately, relinquishing his 
post with grace. 

JULY 16TH. The Secretary was back again this evening. He 
could not procure comfortable quarters in the country. He seemed 
vexed, but from what cause, I did not learn. The colonel, how- 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 63 

ever, had rushed the appointments. He was determined to be 
quick, because Mr. W. was known to be slow and hesitating. 

JULY 17TH. The news is not so good to-day. Gen. Garnett's 
small command has been defeated by the superior numbers of Gen. 
McClellan. But the general himself was killed, fighting in the 
rear of his retreating men. His example will not be without its 
effect. Our generals will resolve never to survive a defeat. This 
will embolden the enemy to attack us at Manassas, where their 
suddenly acquired confidence will be snuffed out, or I am mis- 
taken. 

JULY 18TH. The major is sick again, and Jacques is away; 
therefore I have too much work, and the colonel groans for me. 
He is proud of the appointments he made with such rapidity, and 
has been complimented. And in truth there is no reason why the 
thousands of applications should not be acted on promptly ; and 
there are many against delay. A large army must be organized 
immediately, and it will be necessary to appoint thousands of field 
and staff officers unless all the governors are permitted to do as 
Gov. Brown desires to do. The Secretary is in better health, and 
quite condescending. My work pleases him ; and I shouldn't be 
astonished if he resented the sudden absence of Mr. Jacques. But 
he should consider that Mr. J. is only an amateur clerk getting no 
pay, rich, and independent of the government. 

JULY 19m. We had fighting yesterday in earnest, at Bull 
Run ! Several brigades were engaged, and the enemy were re- 
pulsed with the loss of several hundred left dead and wounded on 
the field. That was fighting, and we shall soon have more of it. 

Brig.-Gen. Holmes, my friend and fellow-fugitive, now stationed 
near Fredericksburg, has been ordered by Gen. Beauregard to be 
ready to march at an hour's notice. And Col. Northrop's chin 
and nose have become suddenly sharper. He is to send up fight- 
ing rations for three days, and discerns the approach of sanguinary 
events. 

Mr. Hunter calls every evening, just as the dusky shades of eve 
descend, to inquire if we have any news. 

JULY 20TH. The Secretary works too much or rather does 
not economize his labor. lie procrastinates final action ; and 
hence his work, never being disposed of, is always increasing in 
volume. Why does he procrastinate ? Can it be that his hesita- 



64 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

tion is caused by the advice of the President, in his great solici- 
tude to make the best appointments ? We have talent enough in 
the South to officer millions of men. Mr. Walker is a man of 
capacity, and has a most extraordinary recollection of details. 
But I fear his nerves are too finely strung for the official tread- 
mill. I heard him say yesterday, with a sigh, that no gentleman 
can be fit for office. Well, Mr. Walker is a gentleman by educa- 
tion and instincts ; and is fastidiously tenacious of what is due a 
gentleman. Will his official life be a long one ? I know one thing 

there are several aspiring dignitaries waiting impatiently for his 

shoes. But those who expect to reach the Presidency by a suc- 
cessful administration of any of the departments, or by the be- 
stowal of patronage, are laboring under an egregious error. None 
but generals will get the Imperial purple for the next twenty years 
if indeed the prematurely made "permanent" government should 
be permanent. 

JULY 21sx. The President left the city this morning for Ma- 
nassas, and we look for a battle immediately. I have always 
thought he would avail himself of his prerogative as commander- 
in-chief, and direct in person- the most important operations in the 
field ; and, indeed, I have always supposed he was selected to be 
the Chief of the Confederacy, mainly with a view to this object, 
as it was generally believed he possessed military genius of a high 
order. In revolutions like the present, the chief executive occu- 
pies a most perilous and precarious position, if he be not a mili- 
tary chieftain, and present on every battle-field of great magnitude. 
I have feith in President Davis, and believe he will gain great 
glory in this first mighty conflict. 

Early In the evening Secretary Walker returned from tea in 
great excitement. He strode to and fro in the room where we 

were sitting, d g his office. He said a great battle was then 

going on, and he wished himself present participating in its perils. 
Again he denounced the office he filled and seemed, for a time, 
almost frantic with anxiety. He said all young men ought to be 
in the field, and this was understood by those present, who had 
merely shouldered their pens. 

Before long the hall of the department was filled with people 
eager to hear the news ; and as successive dispatches were received, 
the excitement increased. All the cabinet were in our office ; 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. C,'t 

and Hon. Howell Cobb, President of Congress, making deductions 
from the dispatches, announced his belief that it was a drawn 
battle. This moved the wrath of Col. Bledsoe, and he denounced 
Cobb. Mr. Hunter did nothing but listen. It was night, now. 
Finally, Mr. Benjamin, who had gone to the Spottswood Hotel, 
where Mrs. Davis resided, returned with news that stopped every 
detracting tongue. Mrs. D. had just got a dispatch from the 
President announcing a dearly-bought but glorious victory. Some 
of the editors of the papers being present, and applying to me for 
a copy of the dispatch, Mr. Benjamin said he could repeat it from 
memory, which he did, and I wrote it down for the press. Then 
joy ruled the hour ! The city seemed lifted up, and every one ap- 
peared to walk on air. Mr. Hunter's face grew shorter ; Mr. 
Reagan's eyes subsided into their natural size ; and Mr. Benjamin's 
glowed something like Daniel Webster's after taking a pint of 
brandy. The men in place felt that now they held their offices 
for life, as the permanent government would soon be ratified by 
the people, and that the Rubicon had been passed in earnest. We 
had gained a great victory ; and no doubt existed that it would 
be followed up the next day. If so, the Federal city would in- 
evitably fall into our hands ; and this would soon be followed by 
the expulsion of the enemy from Southern soil. All men seemed 
to think that the tide of war would roll from that day northward 
into the enemy's country, until we should win a glorious peace. 

JULY 22D. Both Col. B. and I were in a passion this morning 
upon finding that the papers had published a dispatch from their 
own agent at Manassas, stating that the President did not arrive 
upon the field until the victory was won ; and therefore did not 
participate in the battle at all. From the President's own dis- 
patch, and other circumstances, we had conceived the idea that he 
was not only present, but had directed the principal operations in 
the field. The colonel intimated that another paper ought to be 
established in Richmond, that would do justice to the President ; 
and it was conjectured by some that a scheme was on foot to elect 
some other man to the Presidency of the permanent government 
in the autumn. Nevertheless, we learned soon after that the abused 
correspondent had been pretty nearly correct in his statement. 
The battle had been won, and the enemy were flying from the 
field before the President appeared upon it. It had been won by 

6* 



66 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

Beauregard, who, however, was materially assisted by his superior 
in command, Gen. Joseph E. Johnston. Gen. J. remained in the 
rear, and brought up the reinforcements which gained the day. 
Beauregard is, to-day, the most popular general in the service. 
Besides some 500 prisoners, the enemy, it is said, had 4500 killed 
and wounded. The casualties would have been much greater, if 
the enemy had not broken and fled. We lost some 2000 men, 
killed and wounded. 

The President returned to-day and made a speech at the Spotts- 
wood Hotel, wherein he uttered the famous words: "Never be 
haughty to the humble, or humble to the haughty." And he said 
that no doubt the Confederate flag then floated over Fairfax C. H., 
and would soon be raised at Alexandria, etc. etc. Never heard 
I more hearty cheering. Every one believed our banners would 
wave in the streets of Washington in a few days ; that the enemy 
would be expelled from the District and from Maryland, and that 
a peace would be consummated on the banks of the Susquehanna 
or the Schuylkill. The President had pledged himself, on one 
occasion, to carry the war into the enemy's country, if they would 
not let us go in peace. Now, in that belief, the people were well 
pleased with their President. 

JULY 23D. Jacques is back and as busy as a bee ; and, in truth, 
there is work enough for all. 

JULY 24TH. Yesterday we received a letter from Col. Bartow, 
written just before the battle (in which he fell, his letter being re- 
ceived after the announcement of his death), urging the appoint- 
ment of his gallant young friend Lamar to a lieutenancy. I noted 
these facts on the back of his letter, with the Secretary's approba- 
tion, and also that the request had been granted, and placed the 
letter, perhaps the last he ever wrote, in the archives for preserva- 
tion. 

JULY 25iH. Bartow's body has arrived, and lies in state at the 
Capitol. Among the chief mourners was his young friend Barton, 
who loved him as a son loves his father. From Lamar I learned 
some interesting particulars of the battle. He said when Bartow's 
horse was killed, he, Lamar, was sent to another part of the field 
for another, and also to order up certain regiments, Bartow then, 
being in command of a brigade. Lamar galloped through a hot 
cross-fire to the regiments and delivered the order, but got no 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 67 

horse. He galloped back, however, through the terrible fire, with 
the intention of giving his own horse to Bartow, if none other 
could be had. On his return he encountered Col. Jones, of the 
4th Alabama, wounded, his arms being around the necks of two 
friends, who were endeavoring to support him in a standing atti- 
tude. One of these called to Lamar, and asked for his horse, 
hoping that Col. Jones might be able to ride (his thigh-bone was 
terribly shattered), and thus get off the field. Lamar paused, and 
promised as soon as he could report to Bartow he would return 
with that or another horse. Col. Jones thanked him kindly, but 
cautioned him against any neglect of Bartow's orders, saying he 
probably could not ride. Lamar promised to return immediately ; 
and putting spurs to his noble steed, started off in a gallop. He 
had not gone fifty yards before his horse fell, throwing him over 
his head. He saw that the noble animal had been pierced by as 
many as eight balls, from a single volley. He paused a moment 
and turned away, when the poor horse endeavored to rise and fol- 
low, but could not. He returned and patted the groaning and 
tearful steed on his neck ; and, while doing this, Jive more balls 
struck him, and he jlied instantly. Lamar then proceeded on 
foot through a storm of bullets, and, untouched, rejoined Bartow 
in time to witness his fall. 

Our prisons are filled with Yankees, and Brig.-Gen. Winder has 
employment. There is a great pressure for passports to visit the 
battle-field. At my suggestion, all physicians taking amputating 
instruments, and relatives of the wounded and slain, have been 
permitted by the Secretary to go thither. 

JULY 26TH. Many amusing scenes occur daily between the 
Chief of the Bureau and applicants for passports. Those not in- 
cluded specially in the Secretary's instructions, are referred to the 
Chief of the Bureau ; and Col. Bledsoe cannot bear importunity. 
Sometimes he becomes so very boisterous that the poor applicants 
are frightened out of the office. 

JULY 2tTH. A large number of new arrivals are announced 
from the North. Clerks resigned at Washington, and embryo 
heroes having military educations, are presenting themselves daily, 
and applying for positions here. They represent the panic in 
the North as awful, and ours is decidedly the winning side. These 
gentry somehow succeed in getting appointments. 



68 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

Oar army does not advance. It is said both Beauregard and 
Johnston are anxious to cross the Potomac ; but what is said is 
not always true. The capabilities of our army to cross the Poto- 
mac are not known; and the policy of doing so if it were practi- 
cable, is to be determined by the responsible authority. Of one 
thing I am convinced : the North, so far from desisting from the 
execution of its settled purpose, even under this disagreeable re- 
verse, will be stimulated to renewed preparations on a scale of 
greater magnitude than ever. 

JULY 28TH. We have taken two prisoners in civilian's dress, 

Harris and , on the field, who came over from Washington in 

quest of the remains of Col. Cameron, brother of the Yankee Sec- 
retary of War. They claim a release on the ground that they are 
non-combatants, but admit they were sent to the field by the Yankee 
Secretary. Mr. Benjamin came to the department last night with 
a message for Secretary W T alker, on the subject. The Secretary 
being absent, he left it with me to deliver. It was that the pris- 
oners were not to be liberated without the concurrence of the 
President. There was no danger of Secretary Walker releasing 
them ; for I had heard him say the authorities might have obtained 
the remains, if they had sent a flag of truce. Disdaining to con- 
descend thus far toward a recognition of us as belligerents, they 
abandoned their dead and wounded; and he, Walker, would see 
the prisoners, thus surreptitiously sent on the field, in a very hot 
place before he would sign an order for their release. I was grati- 
fied to see Mr. Benjamin so zealous in the matter. 

JULY: 29m. To-day quite a number of our wounded men on 
crutches, and with arms in splints, made their appearance in the 
streets, and created a sensation. A year hence, and we shall be 
accustomed to such spectacles. 

JULY 30iH. Nothing of importance to-day. 

JULY 31ST. Nothing worthy of note. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 69 



CHAPTER Y. 

My son Custis appointed clerk in the War Department. N. Y. Herald con- 
tains a pretty correct army list of the C. S. Appearance of "Plug Ug- 
lies." President's rupture with Beauregard. President sick. Alien 
enemies ordered away. Brief interview with the President. "Imme- 
diate." Large numbers of cavalry offering. Great preparations in the 
North. 

AUGUST IST. Col. Bledsoe again threatens to resign, and again 
declares he will get the President to appoint me to his place. It 
would not suit me. 

AUGUST 2D. After some brilliant and successful fights, we 
have a dispatch to-day stating that Gen. Wise has fallen back in 
Western Virginia, obeying peremptory orders. 

AUGUST 3o. Conversed with some Yankees to-day who are to 
be released to-morrow. It appears that when young Lamar lost 
his horse on the plains of Manassas, the 4th Alabama Regiment 
had to fall back a few hundred yards, and it was impossible 
to bear Col. Jones, wounded, from the field, as he was large and 
unwieldy. When the enemy came up, some half dozen of their 
men volunteered to convey him to a house in the vicinity. They 
were permitted to do this, and to remain with him as a guard. 
Soon after our line advanced, and with such impetuosity as to 
sweep everything before it. Col. Jones was rescued, and his 
guard made prisoners. But, for their attention to him, he asked 
their release, which was granted. They say their curiosity to see 
a battle-field has been gratified, and they shall be contented to re- 
main at home in safety hereafter. They regarded us as rebels, 
and believed us divided among ourselves. If this should be true, 
the rebellion would yet be crushed ; but if we were unanimous and 
continued to fight as we did at Manassas, it would be revolution, 
and our independence must some day be acknowledged by the 
United States. But, they say, a great many Northern men remain 
to be gratified as they had been ; and the war will be a terrible 



70 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

one before they can be convinced that a redaction of the rebellion 
is not a practicable thing. 

AUQDST 4TH. To-day Mr. Walker inquired where my son 
Custis was. I told him he was with his mother at Newbern, 
N. C. He anthorized me to telegraph him to return, and he 
should be appointed to a clerkship. 

AUGUST STH. Col. Bledsoe has a job directly from the Presi- 
dent: which is to adapt the volume of U. S. Army Regulations to 
the service of the Confederate. States. It is only to strike out 
U. S. and insert C. S., and yet the colonel groans over it. 

AUGUST GTH. Custis arrived and entered upon the discharge 
of his duties. 

AUGUST TTH. Saw Col. Pendleton to-day, but it was not the 
first time. I have seen him in the pulpit, and heard him preach 
good sermons. He is an Episcopal minister. He it was that 
plowed such destruction through the ranks of the invaders at 
Manassas. At first the battery did no execution ; perceiving this, 
he sighted the guns himself and fixed the range. Then exclaim- 
ing, "Fire, boys ! and may God have mercy on their guilty souls!" 
he beheld the lanes made through the regiments of the enemy. 
Since then he has been made a colonel, and will some day be a 
general; for he was a fellow-cadet at West Point with the Presi- 
dent and Bishop Polk. 

A tremendous excitement ! The New York Herald has been 
received, containing a pretty accurate list of our military forces 
in the different camps of the Confederate States, with names and 
grades of the general officers. The Secretary told me that if he 
had required such a list, a more correct one could not have been 
furnished him. Who is the traitor? Is he in the Adjutant-Gen- 
eral's office ? Many suppose so ; and some accuse Gen. Cooper, 
simply because he is a Northern man by birth. But the same infor- 
mation might be supplied by the Quartermaster's or Commissary- 
General's office ; and perhaps by the Ordnance Bureau ; for all 
these must necessarily be in communication with the different or- 
ganizations in the field. Congress was about to order an investi- 
gation ; but it is understood the department suggested that the 
matter could be best searched into by the Executive. For my 
part, I have no doubt there are many Federal spies in the depart- 
ments. Too many clerks were imported from Washington. And 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 71 

yet I doubt if any one in a subordinate position, without assist- 
ance from higher authority, could have prepared the list published 
in the Herald 

AUGUST STH. For some time past (but since the battle at Manas- 
sas) quite a number of Northern and Baltimore policemen have 
made their appearance in Richmond. Some of these, if not in- 
deed all of them, have been employed by Gen. Winder. These 
men, by their own confessions, have been heretofore in Baltimore, 
Philadelphia, and New York, merely petty larceny detectives, 
dwelling in bar-rooms, ten-pin alleys, and such places. How can 
they detect political offenders, when they are too ignorant to com- 
prehend what constitutes a political offense ? They are illiterate 
men, of low instincts and desperate characters. But their low 
cunning will serve them here among unsuspecting men. They 
will, if necessary, give information to the enemy themselves, for 
the purpose of convincing the authorities that a detective police is 
indispensable; and it is probable a number of them will be, all the 
time, on the pay-rolls of Lincoln. 

AUGUST OTH. Gen. Magruder commands on the Peninsula. 
President Tyler had a villa near Hampton, which the Yankees 
despoiled in a barbarous manner. They cut his carpets, defaced 
the pictures, broke the statues, and made kindling wood of the 
piano, sofas, etc. 

AUGUST 10TH. Mr. Benjamin is a frequent visitor at the de- 
partment, and is very sociable : some intimations have been thrown 
out that he aspires to become, some day, Secretary of War. Mr. 
Benjamin, unquestionably, will have great influence with the Pres- 
ident, for he has studied his character most carefully. He will 
be familiar not only with his "likes," but especially with his "dis- 
likes." It is said the means used by Mr. Blair to hold Gen. 
Jackson, consisted not so much in a facility of attaching strong 
men to him as his friends, but in aiming fatal blows at the great 
leaders who had incurred the enmity of the President. Thus Cal- 
houu was incessantly pursued. 

AUGUST HTH. There is a whisper that something like a rup- 
ture has occurred between the President and Gen. Beauregard ; 
and I am amazed to learn that Mr. Benjamin is inimical to Gen. 
B. I know nothing of the foundation for the report ; but it is 
said that Beauregard was eager to pass with his army into Mary- 



72 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

land, immediately after the battle, and was prevented. It is now 
quite apparent, from developments, that a small force would have 
sufficed to take Washington, a few days or weeks after the battle. 
But was Beauregard aware of the fact, before the opportunity 
ceased to exist ? It is too late now 1 

AUGUST 12TH. There is trouble with Mr. Tochman, who was 
authorized to raise a regiment or so of foreigners in Louisiana. 
These troops were called (by whom ?) the Polish Brigade, though, 
perhaps, not one hundred Polanders were on the muster-rolls; 
Major Tochraan being styled General Tochman by "everybody," 
he has intimated to the President his expectation of being com- 
missioned a brigadier. The President, on his part, has promptly 
and emphatically, as is sometimes his wont, declared his purpose 
to give him no such commission. He never, for a moment, thought 
of making him more than a colonel. To this the major demurs, 
and furnishes a voluminous correspondence to prove that his 
claims for the position of brigadier-general had been recognized 
by the Secretary of War. 

AUGUST 13TH. The President sent to the department an inter- 
esting letter from Mr. Zollicoffer, in Tennessee, relating to the 
exposed condition of the country, and its capacities for defense. 

AUGUST 14TH. Zollicoffer has been appointed a brigadier-gen- 
eral ; and although not a military man by education, I .think he 
will make a good officer. 

AUGUST 15TH. No clew yet to the spies in office who furnish 
the Northern press with information. The matter will pass unin- 
vestigated. Such is our indifference to everything but desperate 
fighting. The enemy will make good use of this species of infor- 
mation. 

AUGUST 16TH. The President is sick, and goes to the country. 
I did not know until to-day that he is blind of an eye. I think an 
operation was performed once in Washington. 

AUGUST ItTH. Some apprehension is felt concerning the Presi- 
dent's health. If he were to die, what would be the consequences ? 
I should stand by the Yice-President, of course, because "it is so 
nominated in the bond," and because I think he would make as 
efficient an Executive as any other man in the Confederacy. But 
others think differently ; and there might be trouble. 

The President has issued a proclamation, in pursuance of the 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 73 

act of Congress passed on the 8th instant, commanding all alien 
enemies to leave in forty days; and the Secretary of War has in- 
dicated Nashville as the place of exit. This produces bat little 
excitement, except among the Jews, some of whom are converting 
their effects into gold and departing. 

Col. Bledsoe's ankles are much too weak for his weighty body, 
but he can shuffle along quite briskly when in pursuit of a refrac- 
tory clerk; and when he catches him, if he resists, the colonel is 
sure to leave him. 

AUGUST 18TH. Nothing worthy of note. 

AUGUST 19TH. The Secretary has gone to Orange C. H. f to 
see Col. Jones, of the 4th Alabama, wounded at Manassas, and 
now in a dying condition. 

Meeting with Mr. Benjamin this morning, near the Secretary's 
door, I asked him if he did not think some one should act as Sec- 
retary during Mr. Walker's absence. He replied quickly, and 
with interest, in the affirmative. There was much pressing busi- 
ness every hour ; and it was uncertain when the Secretary would 
return. I asked him if he would not speak to the President on 
the subject. He assented ; but, hesitating a moment, said he 
thought it would be better for me to see him. I reminded him of 
my uniform reluctance to approach the Chief Executive, and he 
smiled. He then urged me to go to the presidential mansion, and 
in his, Mr. B.'s name, request the President to appoint a Secre- 
tary ad interim. I did so, for the President was in the city that 
day, and fast recovering from his recent attack of ague. 

Arrived at the mansion in Clay Street, I asked the servant if I 
could see the President. He did not know me, and asked my 
name, saying the President had not yet left his chamber. I wrote 
my business on a card with a pencil, not omitting to use the name 
of Mr. Benjamin, and sent it up. A moment after the President 
came down, shook hands with me, and, in his quick and rather 
pettish manner, said "send me the order." I retired immediately, 
and" finding Mr. Benjamin still in the hall of the department, in- 
formed him of my success. Then, in conformity with his sugges- 
tion, I repaired to Adjutant- General Cooper, who wrote the order 
that A. T. Bledsoe discharge the duties of Secretary of War during 
the absence of Mr. Walker. This I sent by a messenger to the 
President, who signed it. 

7 



74 A REBEL WAR "CLERK'S DIARY 

Then I informed Col. Bledsoe of what had been done, and he 
proceeded without delay to the Secretary's office. It was not long 
before I perceived the part Mr. Benjamin and I had acted was 
likely to breed a storm ; for several of the employees, supposed 
to be in the conGdence of Mr. Walker, designated the proceeding 
as an "outrage;" and some went so far as to intimate that Mr. 
Benjamin's motive was to have some of his partisans appointed to 
lucrative places in the army during the absence of the Secretary. 
I know not ho'w that was; but I am sure I had no thought but 
for the public service. The Secretary ad in. made but few ap- 
pointments this time, and performed the functions quietly and with 
all the dignity of which he was capable. 

AUGUST 20TH. Secretary Walker returned last night, having 
heard of the death of Col. Jones before reaching his destination. 
I doubt whether the Secretary would have thought a second time 
of what had been done in his absence, if some of his friends had 
not fixed his attention upon it. He shut himself up pretty closely, 
and none of us could see or hear whether he was angry. But 
calling me into his room in the afternoon to write a dispatch 
which he dictated, I saw, lying on his table, an envelope directed 
in his own hand to the President. Hints had been circulated by 
some that it was his purpose to resign. Could this communica- 
tion be his resignation? It was placed so conspicuously before 
me where I sat that it was impossible not to see it. It was 
marked, too, "immediate." 

AUGUST 21 ST. Called in again by the Secretary to-day, I find 
the ominous communication to the President still there, although 
marked "immediate." And there are no indications of Mr. 
Walker's quitting office that I can see. 

AUGUST 22o. "Immediate" is still there; but the Secretary 
has not yet been to the council board, though yesterday was cab- 
inet day. Yet the President sends Capt. Josselyn regularly with 
the papers referred to the Secretary. These are always given to 
me, and after they are "briefed," delivered to the Secretary. 
Among these I see some pretty sharp pencil marks. Among the 
rest, the whole batch of Tochman papers being returned unread, 
with the injunction that "when papers of such volume are sent to 
him for perusal, it is the business of the Secretary to see that a 
brief abstract of their contents accompany them." 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 75 

AUGUST 23o. No arms yet of any amount from Europe; 
though our agent-writes that he has a number of manufactories 
at work. The U. S. agent has engaged the rest. All the world 
seems to be in the market buying arms. Mr. Dayton, U. S. Min- 
ister in Paris, has bought 30,000 flint-locks in France; and our 
agent wants authority to buy some too. He says the French 
statisticians allege that no greater mortalityjn battle, occurs from 
the use of the percussion and the rifled musket than from the old 
smooth-bore flint-lock musket. This may be owing to the fact 
that a shorter range is sought with the latter. 

AUGUST 24TH. We are resting on our oars after the victory at 
Manassas, while the enemy is drilling and equipping 500,000 or 
600,000 men. I hope we may not soon be floating down stream ! 
We know the enemy is, besides, building iron-clad steamers and 
yet we are not even erecting casemate batteries 1 We are losing 
precious time, and, perhaps, the government is saving money ! 

AUGUST 25TH. I believe the Secretary will resign; but "im- 
mediate" still lies on his table. 

News of a battle near Springfield, Mo. McCulloch and Price 
defeat the Federals, killing and wounding thousands. Gen. Lyon 
killed. 

AUGUST 26Tii. What a number of cavalry companies are daily 
tendered in the letters received at this department. Almost inva- 
riably they are refused ; and really it is painful to me to write 
these letters. This government must be aware, from the statis- 
tics of the census, that the South has quite as many horses as the 
North, and twice as many good riders. But for infantry, the 
North can put three men in the field to our one. Ten thousand 
mounted men, on the border of the enemy's country, would be 
equal to 30,000 of the enemy's infantry; not in combat: but that 
number would be required to watch and guard against the inroads 
of 10,000 cavalry. It seems to me that we are declining the only 
proper means of equalizing the war. But it is my duty to obey, 
and not to deliberate. 

AUGUST 27TH. We have news of a fight at Hawk's Nest, 
Western Virginia. Wise whipped the Yankees there quite hand- 
somely. 

AUGUST 28TH. Beauregard offers battle again on the plains of 
Manassas; but it is declined by the enemy, who retire behind their 



76 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

fortifications. Our banners are advanced to Munson's Hill, in 
sight of Washington. The Northern President and his cabinet 
may see our army, with good glasses, from the roof of the White 
House. It is said they sleep in their boots; and that some of 
them leave the city every night, for fear of being captured before 
morning. 

Generals Johnston, Wise, and Floyd are sending here, daily, the 
Union traitors they discover to be in communication with the 
enemy. We have a Yankee member of Congress, Ely, taken at 
Manassas; he rode out to witness the sport of killing rebels as 
terriers kill rats, but was caught in the trap himself. He says his 
people were badly whipped ; and he hopes they will give up the 
job of subjugation as a speculation that won't pay. Most of the 
prisoners speak thus while in confinement. 

AUGUST 29rn. We have intelligence from the North that im- 
mense preparations are being made for our destruction ; and some 
of our people begin to say, that inasmuch as we did not follow up 
the victory at Manassas, it was worse than a barren one, having 
only exasperated the enemy, and stimulated the Abolitionists to 
renewed eiforts. I suppose these critics would have us forbear to 
injure the invader, for fear of maddening him. They are making 
this war ; we must make it terrible. With them war is a new 
thing, and they will not cease from it till the novelty wears off, and 
all their fighting men are sated with blood and* bullets. It must 
run its course, like the measles. We must both bleed them and 
deplete their pockets. 

AUGUST 30TH. Gen. Floyd has had a fight in the West, and 
defeated an Ohio regiment. I trust they were of the Puritan 
stock, and not the descendants of Yirginians. 
AUGUST 31sT. We have bad news to-day. My wife and chil- 
dren are the bearers of it. They returned to the city with the 
tidings that all the women and children were ordered to leave 
Newbern. The enemy have attacked and taken Fort Hatteras, 
making many prisoners, and threaten Newbern next. This is the 
second time my family have been compelled to fly. But they are 
well. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 77 



CHAPTER VI. 

Four hundred thousand troops to be raised. Want of arms. Yankees offer 
to sell them to us. Walker resigns. Benjamin succeeds. Col. J. A. 
Washington killed. Assigned, temporarily, to the head of the passport 
office. 

SEPTEMBER IST. The press and congressional critics are open- 
ing their batteries on the Secretary of War, for incompetency. He 
is not to blame. A month ago, Capt. Lee, son of the general, 
and a good engineer, was sent to the coast of North Carolina to 
inspect the defenses. His report was well executed; and the 
recommendations therein attended to with all possible expedition. 
It is now asserted that the garrison was deficient in ammunition. 
This was not the case. The position was simply not tenable under 
the fire of the U. S. ships of war. 

SEPTEMBER 2o. I voluntarily hunted up Capt. Lee's report, 
and prepared an article for the press based on its statements. 

SEPTEMBER 3D. My article on the defenses of North Carolina 
seems to have silenced the censures of the cavilers. 

SEPTEMBER 4TH. J. R. Anderson, proprietor of the iron- works 
here, has been appointed brigadier-general by the President. He, 
too, was a West Pointer; but does not look like a military genius. 
He is assigned to duty on the coast of North Carolina. 

SEPTEMBER STH. Our Congress has authorized the raising and 
organizing of four hundred regiments. The Yankee Congress, 
500,000 men. The enemy will get their's first; and it is said that 
between 600,000 and 700,000, for three years or the war, have al- 
ready been accepted by the U. S. Government. Their papers 
boast that nearly a million volunteers were tendered. This means 
mischief. How many will rush forward a year hence to volunteer 
their services on the plains of the South ? Full many ensanguined 
plains will greet the horrific vision before this time next year; 
and many a venal wretch coming to possess our land, will occupy 
till the day of final doom a tract of six feet by two in some deso- 

7* 



78 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

late and unfrequented swamp. The toad will croak his requiem, 
and the viper will coil beneath the thistle growing over his head. 

SEPTEMBER GTII. We are not increasing our forces as rapidly 
as might be desired, for the want of arms. We had some 150,000 
stand of small arms, at the beginning of the war, taken from the 
arsenals; and the States owned probably 100,000 more. Half of 
these were flint-locks, which are being altered. None have been 
imported yet. Occasionally a letter reaches the department from 
Nashville, offering improved arms at a high price, for gold. 
These are Yankees. I am instructed by the Secretary to say they 
will be paid for in gold on delivery to an agent in Nashville. The 
number likely to be obtained in this manner, however, must be 
small ; for the Yankee Government is exercising much vigilance. 
Is not this a fair specimen of Yankee cupidity and character ? 
The New England manufacturers are furnishing us, with whom 
they are at war, with arms to fight with, provided we agree to pay 
them a higher price than is offered by their own Government! 
The philosophical conclusion is, that this war will end when it 
ceases to be a pecuniary speculation. 

SEPTEMBER 7TH. The Jews are at work. Having no nation- 
ality, all wars are harvests for them. It has been so from the day 
of their dispersion. Now they are scouring the country in all 
directions, buying all the goods they can find in the distant cities, 
and even from the country stores. These they will keep, until the 
process of consumption shall raise a greedy demand for all descrip- 
tions of merchandise. 

Col. Bledsoe has resigned, but says nothing now about getting 
me appointed in his place. That matter rests with the President, 
and I shall not be an applicant. 

9 SEPTEMBER STH. Major Tyler has been appointed acting Chief 
of the Bureau of War. 

SEPTEMBER OTH. Matters in statu quo, and Major Tyler still 
acting chief of the bureau. 

SEPTEMBER IOTH. Col. Bledsoe is back again! He says the 
President refuses to accept his resignation ; and tells me in confi- 
dence, not to be revealed for a few days, that Mr. Walker has ten- 
dered his resignation, and that it will be accepted. 

SEPTEMBER HTH. The colonel enjoys a joke. He whispered 
me to-day, as he beheld Major Tyler doing the honors of his office, 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 79 

that I might just hint at the possibility of his resumption soon of 
the functions of chief of the bureau. But he said he wanted a few 
days holiday. * 

SEPTEMBER 12TH. Gen. Pillow has advanced, and occupied 
Columbus, Ky. He was ordered, by telegraph, to abandon the 
town and return to his former position. Then the order was coun- 
termanded, and he remains. The authorities have learned that the 
enemy occupies Paducah. 

SEPTEMBER 13TH. The Secretary, after writing and tendering 
his resignation, appointed my young friend Jaques a special clerk 
with $2000 salary. This was allowed by a. recent act. 

SEPTEMBER HTH. Some of Mr. Walker's clerks must know 
that he intends giving up the seals of office soon, for they are en- 
gaged day and night, and all night, copying the entire letter-book, 
which is itself but a copy of the letters I and others have written, 
with Mr. Walker's name appended to them. Long may they be a 
monument of his epistolary administrative ability, and profound 
statesmanship ! 

SEPTEMBER 15TH. And, just as I expected, Mr. Benjamin is 
to be Mr. Walker's successor. Col. Bledsoe is back again ; and it 
devolved on me to inform Major Tyler that the old chief of the 
bureau was now the new chief. Of course he resigned the seals of 
office with the grace and courtesy of which he is so capable. And 
then he informed me (in confidence) that the Secretary had re- 
signed, and would be appointed a brigadier-general in the army of 
the Southwest; and that he would accompany him as his adjutant- 
general. 

SEPTEMBER 16TH. Mr. Benjamin's hitherto perennial smile 
faded almost away as he realized the fact that he was now the 
most important member of the cabinet. He well knew how ardu-. 
ous the duties were ; but then he was robust in health, and capable 
of any amount of labor. 

It seems, after all, that Mr. Benjamin is only acting Secretary of 
War, until the President can fix upon another. Can that be the 
reason his smile has faded almost away ? But the President will 
appoint him. Mr. Benjamin will please him; he knows how to 
do it. 

SEPTEMBER llTH. A man from Washington came into my of- 
fice to-day, saying he had important information from Washington. 



80 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

I went into the Secretary's room, and found Mr. Benjamin sur- 
rounded by a large circle of visitors, all standing hat in hand, and 
quite silent. I asked him if h.e would see the gentleman from 
Washington. He said he "didn't know who to see." This pro- 
duced a smile. He seemed to be standing there waiting for some 
one to speak, and they seemed to be waiting an invitation from 
him to speak. I withdrew from the embarrassing scene, remark- 
ing that my gentleman would call some other time. Meanwhile I 
wrote down the information, and sent it to the President. 

SEPTEMBER 18iH. Gen. Floyd has been attacked at Gauley, by 
greatly superior numbers. But he was intrenched, and slew hun- 
dreds of the enemy before he retreated, which was effected without 
loss. 

SEPTEMBER 19iH. We hear of several splendid dashes of cav- 
alry near Manassas, under Col. Stuart; and Wise's cavalry in the 
West are doing good service. 

SEPTEMBER 20TH. Col. J. A. Washington has been killed in a 
skirmish. He inherited Mount Yernon. This reminds me that 
Edward Everett is urging on the war against us. The universal 
education, so much boasted of in New England, like their religion, 
is merely a humbug, or worse than a humbug, the fruitful source 
of crime. I shall doubt hereafter whether superior intelligence is 
promotive of superior virtue. The serpent is wiser than the dove, 
but never so harmless. Ignorance is bliss in comparison with 
Yankee wisdom. 

SEPTEMBER 21si. The Secretary has authorized me to sign 
passports "for the Secretary of War." My son attends to his 
letters. I have now an opportunity of seeing more. I have 
authority to order transportation for the parents of soldiers, and 
for goods and provisions taken to the camps. 

SEPTEMBER 22D. Harris and Magraw, who were taken on the 
field of Manassas, looking for the remains of Col. Cameron, have 
been liberated by Gen. Winder, on the order of the acting Secre- 
tary of War. This is startling; for Mr. Benjamin was the most 
decided man, at the time of their capture, against their liberation. 
Per contra, a Mr. G., a rich New York merchant, and Mr. R., a 
wealthy railroad contractor, whom I feared would break through 
the meshes of the law, with the large sums realized by them here, 
have been arrested by the Secretary's order, on the ground that 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 81 

they have no right to transfer the sinews of war to the North, to 
be used against us. 

SEPTEMBER 23D. Thousands of dollars worth of clothing and 
provisions, voluntary and patriotic contributions to the army, are 
arriving daily. 

SEPTEMBER 24Tn. The time is up for the departure of alien 
enemies. This is the last day, according to the President's proc- 
lamation. We have had no success lately, and never can have sac- 
cess, while the enemy know all our plans and dispositions. Keep 
them in total ignorance of our condition and movements, and they 
will no more invade us than they would explore a vast cave, in 
which thousands of rattlesnakes can be heard, without lights. 
Their spies and emissaries here are so many torch -bearers for 
them. 

SEPTEMBER 25TH. Mr. Benjamin and Gen. Winder, after grant- 
ing a special interview to Messrs. G. and R , have concluded to 
let them depart for Pennsylvania and New York ! Nor is this all. 
/ have an order from Mr. Benjamin to give passports, until fur- 
ther orders, to leave the country to all persons who avow them- 
selves alien enemies, whether in person or by letter, provided 
they take no wealth with them. This may be a fatal policy, or 
it may be &trap. 

SEPTEMBER 26TH. Had a conversation with the Secretary to- 
day, on the policy of sending Union men out of the Confederacy. 
I told him we had 15,000 sick in the hospitals at Manassas, and 
this intelligence might embolden the enemy to advance, capture 
the hospitals, and make our sick men prisoners. He said such 
prisoners would be a burden to them, and a relief to us. ""I re- 
marked that they would count as prisoners in making exchanges ; 
and to abandon them in that manner, would have a discouraging 
effect on our troops. He said that sending unfriendly persons out 
of the country was. in conformity with the spirit of the act of Con- 
gress, and recommended me to reperase it and make explanations 
to the people, who were becoming clamorous for some restriction 
on the egress of spies. 

SEPTEMBER 27TH. To-day I prepared a leading editorial article 
for the Enquirer, taking ground directly opposite to that advo- 
cated by Mr. Benjamin. It was written with the law before me, 
which gave no warrant, as I could perceive, for the assumption of 
the Secretary. 

r 



82 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

SEPTEMBER 28TH. I sent the paper containing ray article to 
J. R. Davis, Esq., nephew of the President, avowing its author- 
ship, and requesting him to ask the President's attention to the 
subject. 

SEPTEMBER 29TH. To-day Mr. Benjamin issued several pass- 
ports himself, and sent several others to me with peremptory 
orders for granting them. 

SEPTEMBER 30iH. A pretty general jail delivery is now taking 
place. Gen. Winder, acting I suppose, of course, under the in- 
structions of the Secretary of War and Mr. Benjamin is now 
Secretary indeed is discharging from the prisons the disloyal 
prisoners sent hither during the last month by Gens. Johnston, 
Floyd, and Wise. Not only liberating them, but giving them 
transportation to their homes, mostly within the enemy's lines. 
Surely if the enemy reciprocates such magnanimous courtesy, the 
war will be merely child's play, and we shall be spared the usual 
horrors of civil war. We shall see how the Yankees will appre- 
ciate this kindness. 



CHAPTER VII. 

An order for the publication of the names of alien enemies. Some excite- 
ment. Efforts to secure property. G. A. Myers, lawyer, actively 
engaged. Gen. Price gains a victory in Missouri. Billy Wilson's cut- 
throats cut to pieces at Fort Pickens. A female spy arrives from Wash- 
ington. Great success at Leesburg or Ball's Bluff. 

OCTOBER IST. I find that only a few hundred alien enemies de- 
parted from the country under the President's proclamation, allow- 
ing them forty days, from the 16th of August, to make their 
arrangements; but under the recent order of Mr. Benjamin, if I 
may judge from the daily applications, there will be a large emi- 
gration. The persons now going belong to a different class of 
people : half of them avowing themselves friendly to our cause, 
and desiring egress through our lines on the Potomac, or in the 
West, to avoid being published as alien enemies going under flag 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 83 

of truce via Norfolk and Fortress Monroe. Many of them declare 
a purpose to return. 

OCTOBER 2o. A day or two ago Col. Bledsoe, who visits me 
now very seldom, sent an order by Mr. Brooks for me to furnish 
a list of the names of alien enemies for publication. This was 
complied with cheerfully ; and these publications have produced 
some excitement in the community. 

OCTOBER 3D. The President not having taken any steps in the 
matter, I have no alternative but to execute the order of the Sec- 
retary. 

OCTOBER 4TH. Sundry applications were made to-day to leave 
the country under flag of truce, provided I would not permit the 
names to be published. The reason for this request is that these 
persons have connections here who might be compromised. I re- 
fused compliance. In one or two instances they intimated that 
they would not have their names published for thousands of dol- 
lars. My response to this was such as to cause them to withdraw 
their applications. 

OCTOBER STII. To-day several Southern-born gentlemen, who 
have lived long in the North, and have their fortunes and families 
there, applied for passports. They came hither to save the invest- 
ments of their parents in Northern securities, by having them trans- 
ferred to-their children. This seems legitimate, and some of the 
parties are old and valued friends of mine. I know their sympathies 
are with their native land. Yet why are they so late in coming ? I 
know not. It is for me to send them out of the country, for such 
is the order of the Secretary of War. The loyalty of the connec- 
tions .of these gentlemen is vouched for in a note (on file) written 
by Mr. Hunter, Secretary of State. Their names must be pub- 
lished as alien enemies. They will take no part in the war. 

OCTOBER GTH. Nothing of importance. 

OCTOBER TTH. Nothing of note. 

OCTOBER STII. Mr. Gustavus Myers, a lawyer of this city, 
seems to take an active interest in behalf of parties largely en- 
gaged in business at Baltimore. And he has influence with the 
Secretary, for he generally carries his points over my head. The 
parties he engineers beyond our lines may possibly do us no harm ; 
but I learn they certainly do themselves much good by their suc- 
cessful speculations. And do they not take gold and other prop- 



84 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

erty to the North, and thereby defeat the object of the sequestra- 
tion act ? The means thus abstracted from the South will certainly 
be taxed by the North to make war on us. 

OCTOBER 9xn. Contributions of clothing, provisions, etc. are 
coming in large quantities; sometimes to the amount of $20,000 
in a single day. 

Never was there such a patriotic people as ours! Their blood 
and their wealth are laid upon the altar of their' country with 
enthusiasm. 

I must say here that the South Carolinians are the gentlest peo- 
ple I ever met with. They accede to every requisition with cheer- 
fulness ; and never have I known an instance where any one of 
them has used subterfuge to evade a rule, however hard it might 
bear upon them. They are the soul of honor, truth, and patri- 
otism. 

OCTOBER 10TH. A victory but not in the East. I expect 
none here while there is such a stream of travel flowing North- 
ward. It was in Missouri, at Lexington. Gen. Price has cap- 
tured the town and made several thousand prisoners, whom he 
dismissed on parole. 

OCTOBER UTII. And Wise has had bloody fighting with Rose- 
crans in Western Virginia. He can beat the enemy at fighting ; 
but they beat him at manoeuvring, with the use of the guides Gen. 
Winder has sent them from our prisons here. 

OCTOBER 12m. Col. Wright has had a race with the Yankees 
on the North Carolina coast. They fled to their works before his 
single regiment with such precipitation as to leave many of their 
arms and men behind. We lost but one man : and he was fat, 
broke his wind, and died in the pursuit. 

OCTOBER 13TH. Another little success, but not in this vicinity. 
Gen. Anderson, of South Carolina, in the night crossed to Santa 
Rosa Island and cut up Billy Wilson's regiment of New York cut- 
throats and thieves, tinder the very guns of Fort Pickens. 

OCTOBER 14TH. Kissing goes by favor ! Col. M r, of Ma- 
ryland, whose published letter of objuration of the United States 
Government attracted much attention some time since, is under 
the ban. He came hither and tendered his services to this govern- 
ment, but failed to get the employment applied for, though his 
application was urged by Mr. Hunter, the Secretary of State, who 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 85 

is his relative. After remaining here for a long time, vainly 
hoping our army would cross the Potomac and deliver his native 
State, and finding his finances diminishing, he sought permission 
of the Secretary to return temporarily to his family in Maryland, 
expecting to get them away and to save some portion of his effects. 
His fidelity was vouched for in strong language by Mr. Hunter, 
and yet the application has been refused ! I infer from this that 
Mr. Benjamin is omnipotent in the cabinet, and that Mr. Hunter 
cannot remain long in it. 

OCTOBER 15TH. I have been requested by Gen. Winder to-day 
to refuse a passport to Col. M r to leave the city in any direc- 
tion. So the colonel is within bounds ! I learn that he differed 
with Gen. Winder (both from Maryland) in politics. But if he 
was a Whig, so was Mr. Benjamin. Again, I hear that Col. M. 
had some difficulty with Col. Northrop, Commissary-General, and 
challenged him. This is a horse of another color. Col. N. is one 
of the special favorites of the President. 

OCTOBER 16TH. Col. M. applied to me to-day for a passport 
to Maryland, bringing a strong letter from Mr. Hunter, and also 
a note from Col. Bledsoe, Chief of the Bureau of War. He seemed 
thunderstruck when I informed him that Gen. Winder had obtained 
an order from the Secretary of War to detain him. A few mo- 
ments after Gen. Winder came with a couple of his detectives (all 
from Baltimore) and arrested him. Subsequently he was released 
on parole of honor, not to leave the city without Gen. Winder's 
permission. I apprehend bad consequences from this proceeding. 
It may prevent other high-toned Marylanders from espousing our 
side of this contest. 

OCTOBER HTH. Hurlbut has been released from prison. Mr. 
Hunter has a letter (intercepted) from Raymond, editor of the 
New York Times, addressed to him since the battle of Manassas. 

OCTOBER 18TH. I cannot perceive that our army increases 
much in strength, particularly in Virginia. The enemy have now 
over 660,000 in the field in various places, and seem to be prepar- 
ing for a simultaneous advance. 

It is said millions of securities, the property of the enemy, are 
transferred to the United States. It is even intimated that the 
men engaged in this business have the protection of men in high 

8 



86 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

positions on both sides. Can it be possible that we have men in 
power who are capable of taking bribes from the enemy ? If so, 
God help the country ! 

OCTOBER 19TH. Col. Ashby with 600 men routed a force of 
1000 Yankees, the other day, near Harper's Ferry. That is the 
cavalry again ! The spies here cannot inform the enemy of the 
movements of our mounted men, which are always made with 
celerity. 

OCTOBER 20TH. A lady, just from Washington, after striving 
in vain to procure an interview with the Secretary of War, left 
with me the programme of the enemy's contemplated movements. 
She was present with the family of Gen. Dix at a party, and heard 
their purposes disclosed. They meditate an advance immediately, 
with 200,000 men. The head of Banks's column is to cross near 
Leesburg ; and when over, a movement upon our flank is intended 
from the vicinity of Arlington Heights. This is truly a formida- 
ble enterprise, if true. We have not 70,000 effective men in 
Northern Virginia. The lady is in earnest and remains here. 

I wrote down the above information and sent it to the Presi- 
dent; and understood that dispatches were transmitted immedi- 
ately to Gen. Johnston, by telegraph. 

The lady likewise spoke of a contemplated movement by sea 
with gun-boats, to be commanded by Burnside, Butler, etc.' 

In the evening I met Mr. Hunter, and told him the substance 
of the information brought by the lady. He seemed much inter- 
ested, for he knows the calm we have been enjoying bodes no 
good ; and he apprehends that evil will grow out of the order of 
the Secretary of War, permitting all wlio choose to call themselves 
alien enemies to leave the Confederacy. While we were speaking 
(in the street) Mr. Benjamin came up, and told me he had seen 
the letter I sent to the President. He said, moreover, that he 
did not doubt the enemy intended to advance as set forth in the 
programme. 

OCTOBER 21sT. The enemy's papers represent that we have 
some 80,000 men in Kentucky, and this lulls us from vigilance and 
effort in Virginia. The Secretary of War knows very well that 
we have not 30,000 there, and that we are not likely to have more. 
We supposed Kentucky would rise. The enemy knows this fact; 
as well as we do ; nevertheless, it has been his practice from the 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 8t 

beginning to exaggerate our numbers. It lulls us into fancied 
security. 

OCTOBER 22D. We have news of a victory at Leesbnrg. It 
appears that the head of one of the enemy's columns, 8000 strong, 
attempted a passage of the Potomac yesterday, at that point pur- 
suant to the programme furnished by the lady from Washington. 
That point had been selected by the enemy because the spies had 
reported that there were only three Confederate regiments there. 
But crossing a river in boats in the face of a few Southern regi- 
ments, is no easy matter. And this being the People's War, 
although Gen. Evans, in command, had received orders to fall 
back if the enemy came in force, our troops decided for themselves 
to fight before retreating. Therefore, when seven or eight regi- 
ments of Yankees landed on this side of the river, two or three of 
our regiments advanced and fired into them with terrible effect. 
Then they charged ; and ere long such a panic was produced that 
the enemy rushed in disorder into the river, crowding their boats 
so much that several went to the bottom, carrying down hundreds. 
The result was that the head of the serpent received a tremendous 
bruising, and the whole body recoiled from the scene of disaster. 
We had only some 1500 men engaged, and yet captured 1600 
muskets ; and the enemy's loss, in killed, wounded, and prisoners, 
amounted to 2000 men. This battle was fought, in some respects, 
by the privates alone much of the time without orders, and often 
without officers. 

OCTOBER 23D. The President is highly delighted at the result 
of the battle of Leesburg; and yet some of the red-tape West 
Point gentry are indignant at Gen. Evans for not obeying orders, 
and falling back. There is some talk of a court-martial ; for it is 
maintained that no commander, according to strict military rules, 
should have offered battle against such superior numbers. They 
may disgrace Gen. Evans; but I trust our soldiers will repeat the 
experiment on every similar occasion. 

OCTOBER 24TH. We made a narrow escape; at least, we 
have a respite. If the Yankee army had advanced with its 
200,000 men, they would not have encountered more than 70,000 
fighting Confederate soldiers between the Potomac and Richmond. 
It was our soldiers (neither the officers nor the government) that 
saved us ; and they fought contrary to rule, and even in opposition 



88 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

to orders. Of course oar officers at Leesburg did their duty man- 
fully; nevertheless, the soldiers. had determined to fight, officers 
or no officers. 

But as the man in the play said, "it will suffice." The Yankees 
are a calculating people: and if 1500 Mississippians and Virgi- 
nians at Leesburg were too many for 8000 Yankees, what could 
200,000 Yankees do against 70,000 Southern soldiers? It made 
them pause, and give up the idea of taking Richmond this year. 
But the enemy will fight better every successive year; and this 
should not be lost sight of. They, too, are Anglo-Saxons. 

OCTOBER 25TH. Gen. Price, of Missouri, is too popular, and 
there is a determination on the part of the West Pointers to "kill 
him off." I fear he will gain no more victories. 

OCTOBER 26iH. Immense amounts of patriotic contributions, 
in clothing and provisions, are daily registered. 

OCTOBER 27TH. Still the Jews are going out of the country 
and returning at pleasure. They deplete the Confederacy of coin, 
and sell their goods at 500 per cent, profit. They pay no duty ; 
and Mr. Memminger has lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
this way. 

The press everywhere is thundering against the insane policy of 
permitting all who avow themselves enemies to return to the 
North; and I think Mr. B. is beginning to wince under it. I 
tremble when I reflect that those who made the present govern- 
ment, and the one to succeed it, did not represent one-third of the 
people composing the inhabitants of the Confederate States. 

OCTOBER 28TH. The most gigantic naval preparations have 
been made by the enemy ; and they must strike many blows on the 
coast this fall and winter. They are building great numbers of 
gun-boats, some of them iron-clad, both for the coast and for the 
Western rivers. If they get possession of the Mississippi River, 
it will be a sad day for the Confederacy. And what are we doing ? 
We have many difficulties to contend against ; and there is a defi- 
ciency in artisans and material. Nevertheless, the government is 
constructing a monster at Norfolk, and several similar floating 
batteries in the West. But we neglect to construct casemated 
batteries ! Our fortifications, without them, must fall before the 
iron ships of the enemy. The battle of Manassas has given us a 
long exemption from the fatigues and horrors of war ; but this 
calm will be succeeded by a storm. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 89 

OCTOBER 29xH. The election to take place during the ensuing 
month creates no excitement. There will be less than a moiety of 
the whle vote cast; and Davis and Stephens will be elected with- 
out opposition. No disasters have occurred yet to affect the pop- 
ularity of any of the great politicians ; and it seems no risks will 
be run. The battle of Manassas made everybody popular and 
especially Gen. Beauregard. If he were a candidate, I am pretty 
certain he would be elected. 

OCTOBER 30TH. I understand a dreadful quarrel is brewing be- 
tween Mr. Benjamin and Gen. Beauregard. Gen. B. being the 
only individual ever hinted at as an opponent of Mr. Davis for 
the Presidency, the Secretary of War fights him on vantage- 
ground, and likewise commends himself to the President. Van 
Buren was a good politician in his day, and so is Mr. Benjamin 
in his way. I hope these dissensions may expend themselves 
without injury to the country. 

OCTOBER 31sT. Mr. Benjamin, it is understood, will be a candi- 
date for a seat in the C. S. Senate. And I have learned from 
several members of the Louisiana legislature that he will be de- 
feated. They charge him with hob-nobbing too much with North- 
ern friends ; and say that he still retains membership in several 
clubs in New York and Boston. 



CHAPTER VIII. 

Quarrel between Gen. Beauregard and Mr. Benjamin. Great Naval prepa- 
rations in the North. The loss of Port Royal, S. C., takes some prestige. 
The affair at Belmont does not compensate for it. The enemy kills an 
old hare. Missouri secedes. Mason and Slidell captured. French Con- 
sul and the actresses. The lieutenant in disguise. Eastern Shore of 
Virginia invaded. Messrs. Breckinridge and Marshall in Richmond. 

NOVEMBER IST. There is an outcry against the appointment of 
two major-generals, recommended, perhaps, by Mr. Benjamin, Gus- 
tavus W. Smith and Gen. Lovell, both recently from New York. 
They came over since the battle of Manassas. Mr. Benjamin is 

8* 



90 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

perfectly indifferent to the criticisms and censures of the people and 
the press. He knows his own ground ; and since he is sustained 
by the President, we must suppose he knows his own footing in 
the government. If defeated in the legislature, he may have a six 
years' tenure in the cabinet. 

NOVEMBER 2o. It has culminated. Mr. Benjamin's quarrel 
with Beauregard is openly avowed. Mr. Benjamin spoke to me 
about it to-day, and convinced me at the time that Gen. B. was 
really in the wrong. He said the general had sent in his report of 
the battle of Manassas, in which he stated that he had submitted a 
plan to the department for the invasion of Maryland ; and no such 
plan having been received, as Mr. B. says, and the matter being 
foreign to the business in hand, the department had seen proper to 
withhold the report from publication. But this did not concern 
him, Mr. B., because he was not the Secretary of War when the 
alleged plan had been sent to Richmond. But his difference with 
the general grew out of an attempt of the latter to organize troops 
and confer commands without the sanction of the department. He 
had rebuked the general, he said ; and then the general had ap- 
pealed to the President, who sustained the Secretary. Mr. B. 
said that Gen. B. had ascertained who was strongest with the 
President. 

NOVEMBER 3D. 'From this day forth, I hope Mr. Benjamin and 
I will be of better accord. I have an official order, directed by 
him and written by Col. Bledsoe, to the effect that no more alien 
enemies are to have passports. On the contrary, when any one 
avows himself an alien enemy, and applies for permission to leave 
the country, Gen. Winder is to take him in charge. 

NOVEMBER 4TH. Several were arrested yesterday. Still I 
doubt whether we are dealing fairly, even with enemies. They 
have been encouraged to come into and go out of the country by 
the facilities afforded them ; and now, without any sort of notifica- 
tion whatever, they are to be arrested when they present them- 
selves. I hate all traps and stratagems for the purpose of stimu- 
lating one to commit a wrong; and hence this business, although 
it seems to afford employment, if not delight, to Gen. Winder and 
his Baltimore detectives, is rather distasteful to me. And when 
I reflect upon it, I cannot imagine how Mr. Benjamin may adjust the 
matter with his conscience. It will soon cure itself, however ; a 
few arrests will alarm them all. 



AT TIIE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 91 

NOVEMBER STH. To. my amazement, a man came to me to-day 
for a passport to Norfolk, saying he had one from the Secretary 
to pass by flag of truce to Fortress Monroe, etc. He wished me 
to give him one to show at the cars, not desiring to exhibit the 
other, as it might subject him to annoying looks and remarks. 

NOVEMBER GTH. All accounts from the North indicate that 
great preparations are being made to crush us on the coast this 
winter. I see no corresponding preparations on our side. 

NOVEMBER 7TH. We hear of the resignation of Gen. Scott, 
as Commander-in-Chief of the U. S. forces. 

NOVEMBER STH. There are many applications for passports to 
leave the country. I have declared my purpose to sign no more 
for the Secretary without his official order. But he is signing 
them himself, as I find out by the parties desiring the usual pass- 
ports from me to leave the city. They, like guilty men, dislike to 
exhibit their permits to leave the country at the depots. And the 
Northern press bears testimony of the fact that the spies in our 
midst are still at work, and from this I apprehend the worst con- 
sequences. Why did Mr. Benjamin send the order for every man 
to be arrested who applied for permission to leave the country ? 
Was it merely to deceive me, knowing that I had some influence 
with certain leading journals? I am told he says, "no one leaves 
the country now." 

NOVEMBER OTII. Gen. Winder and all his police and Plug Ugly 
gang have their friends or agents, whom they continually desire to 
send to Maryland. And often there comes a request from Gen. 
Huger, at Norfolk, for passports to be granted certain parties to 
go out under flag of truce. I suppose he can send whom he 
pleases. 

We have news of a bloody battle in the West, at Belmont. 
Gen. Pillow and Bishop Polk defeated the enemy, it is said, kill- 
ing and wounding 1000. Our loss, some 500. 

Port Royal, on the coast of South Carolina, has been taken by 
the enemy's fleet. We had no casemated batteries. Here the 
Yankees will intrench themselves, and cannot be dislodged. They 
will take negroes and cotton, and menace both Savannah and 
Charleston. 

NOVEMBER lOru. A gentleman from Urbana, on the Rappa- 
hannock, informs me that he witnessed the shelling of that village 



92 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

a few days ago. There are so few houses that the enemy did not 
strike any of them. The only blood shed was that of an old hare, 
that had taken refuge in a hollow stump. 

NOVEMBER 1 ITH. Bad news. The Unionists in East Tennessee 
have burnt several of the railroad bridges between this and Chat- 
tanooga. This is one of the effects of the discharge of spies cap- 
tured in Western Virginia and East Tennessee. A military police, 
if properly directed, composed of honest men, true Southern men, 
might do much good, or prevent much evil ; but I must not criti- 
cise Gen. Winder's inefficiency, for he acts under the instructions 
of Mr. Benjamin. 

The burning of these bridges not only prevents the arrival of an 
immense amount of clothing and provisions for the army, contrib- 
uted by the patriotic people, but it will embarrass the government 
in the transmission of men and muniments of war, which an emer- 
gency may demand at any moment. Until the avenues by which 
the enemy derives information from our country are closed, I shall 
look for a series of disasters. 

NOVEMBER 12m. We have news of the enemy's gun -boats 
penetrating the rivers of South Carolina. It is said they got 
some cotton. Why was it not burnt? 

NOVEMBER 13TH. Dry goods have risen more than a hundred 
per cent, since spring, and rents and boarding are advancing in 
the same ratio. 

NOVEMBER 14TH. The enemy, knowing our destitution of gun- 
boats, and well apprised of the paucity of our garrisons, are send- 
ing expeditions southward to devastate the coast. They say New 
Orleans will be taken before spring, and communication be opened 
with Cairo, at the mouth of the Ohio. They will not succeed so 
soon; but success is certain ultimately, if Mr. Benjamin, Gen. 
Winder, and Gen. Huger do not cease to pass Federal spies out 
of the country. 

NOVEMBER 15TH. We have intelligence that Missouri has 
joined the Confederacy. She will be scourged by the vengeful 
enemy ; but will rise some day and put her foot on the neck of 
the oppressor. Missouri is a giant. 

NOVEMBER 16TH. It is sickening to behold the corruption of 
the commercial men, which so much wounds our afflicted country. 
There are large merchants here who come over from Baltimore 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 93 

breathing vengeance against the Northern "despots, "and to mnko 
a show of patriotism they subscribed liberally to equip some vol- 
unteer companies in the city ; but now they are sending their agents 
North and importing large amounts of merchandise, which they 
sell to the government and the people at most fabulous prices. 
I am informed that some of them realize $50,000 per month profit! 
And this after paying officials on both sides bonuses to wink at 
their operations. 

After the order of Mr. Benjamin for applicants for passports to 
leave the country to be arrested, some of these men applied to me, 
and I reported the facts to Gen. Winder; but they were not mo- 
lested. Indeed, they came to me subsequently and exhibited pass- 
ports they had obtained from the Secretary himself. 

NOVEMBER HTH. There are also quite a number of letter-car- 
riers obtaining special passports to leave the Confederacy. They 
charge $1.50 postage to Washington and Maryland, and as much 
coming hither. They take on the average three hundred letters, 
and bring as many, besides diverse articles they sell at enormously 
high prices. Thus they realize $1000 per trip, and make two each 
month. They furnish the press with Northern journals ; but they 
give no valuable information : at least I have not conversed with 
any who could furnish it. They seem particularly ignorant of the 
plans and forces of the enemy. It is my belief that they render 
as much service to the enemy as to us; and they certainly do ob- 
tain passports on the other side. 

Gen. Winder and his alien detectives seem to be on peculiar 
terms of intimacy with some of these men ; for they tell me they 
convey letters for them to Maryland, and deliver them to their 
families. This is an equivocal business. Why did they not bring 
their families away before the storm burst upon them ? 

NOVEMBER ISTII. To-day the Secretary told me, in reply to 
my question, -that he had authentic information of the seizure of 
Messrs. Slidell and Mason, our commissioners to Europe, by Capt. 
Wilkes, of the U. S. Navy, and while on board the steamer Trent, 
a British vessel, at sea. I said I was glad of it. He asked 
why, in surprise. I remarked that it would bring the Eagle cow- 
ering to the feet of the Lion. He smiled, and said it was, per- 
haps, the best thing that could have happened. And he cautions 
me against giving passports to French subjects even to visit Nor- 



94 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

folk or any of our fortified cities, for it was understood that for- 
eigners at Norfolk were contriving somehow to get on board the 
ships of their respective nations. 

NOVEMBER 19TH. To-day Monsieur Paul, French Consul, ap- 
plied in person for passports on behalf, I believe, of some French 
players (Zouaves) to Norfolk. Of course I declined granting 
them. He grew enthusiastic, and alleged that British subjects 
had enjoyed the privilege. He said he cared nothing for the 
parties applying in this instance; but he argued vehemently 
against British subjects being favored over French subjects. I 
sent a note concerning our interview to the Secretary; and while 
Monsieur Paul still sat in the office, the following reply came in from 
the Secretary: "All you need do is to say to the French Consul, 
when he calls, that you obey your instructions, and have no au- 
thority to discuss with him the rights of French subjects. J. P. B." 
Monsieur Paul departed with "a flea in his ear." Bat he received 
an invitation to dine with the Secretary to-day. 

NOVEMBER 20Tii. I had a protracted and interesting interview 
to-day with a gaudily dressed and rather diminutive lieutenant, 
who applied for a passport to the Mississippi River, via Chatta- 
nooga, and insisted upon my giving him transportation also. This 
demand led to interrogatories, and it appeared that he was not going 
under special orders of the adjutant-general. It was unusual for 
officers, on leave, to apply for transportation, and my curiosity 
was excited. I asked to see his furlough. This was refused ; but 
he told me to what company he belonged, and I knew there was 
such accompany in Bishop or Gen. Polk's command. Finally he 
escaped further interrogatories by snatching up the passport I 
had signed and departing hastily. But instead of the usual mili- 
tary salute at parting, he courtesied. This, when I reflected on 
the fineness of his speech, the fullness of his breast, his attitudes 
and his short steps, led me to believe the person was a woman in- 
stead of a lieutenant. Gen. Winder coming in shortly after, upon 
hearing my description of the stranger, said he would ascertain 
all about the sex. 

NOVEMBER 21sT. My mysterious lieutenant was arrested this 
morning, on the western route, and proved, as I suspected, to be 
a woman. But Gen. Winder was ordered by the Secretary to have 
her released. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 95 

NOVEMBER 22D. We have information that the enemy have 
invaded and taken possession of the Eastern Shore of Virginia, 
Accomac and Northampton Counties. They invaded the two 
counties with a force of 3000 men, and we had only 800 to oppose 
them. Of course there could be no contest against such odds. 
They carried my tenant to Drummondtown, the county seat, and 
made him (I suppose) assist in raising the United States flag over 
the court-house. 

NOVEMBER 23D. J. C. Breckinridge and Humphrey Marshall, 
of Kentucky, have been here ; and both have been made brigadier- 
generals, and assigned to duty in the West. Although the former 
retained his seat in the Senate of the United States for many 
months after the war began, no one doubts that he is now with us, 
and will do good service. 

NOVEMBER 24TH. Gen. Floyd has retreated from Cotton Hill, 
and the enemy threatens our western communications. Gen. Lee 
has been sent to Western Virginia, but it is not an adequate field 
for him. He should have command of the largest army in the 
service, for his is one of the most capacious minds we have. 

NOVEMBER 25TH. Yesterday Fort Pickens opened fire on our 
batteries at Pensacola, but without effect. One of their ships was 
badly crippled. 

NOVEMBER 26TH. The enemy occupy Tybee Island, and threat- 
en Savannah. Vice- President Stephens was in my office to-day, 
and he too deprecates the passage of so many people to the North, 
who, from the admission of the journals there, give them informa- 
tion of the condition of our defenses. He thinks our affairs are 
not now in a prosperous condition, and has serious apprehensions 
for the fate of Savannah. 

NOVEMBER 27TH. Saw President Tyler to-day. He augurs 
the worst effects from the policy of permitting almost unrestricted 
intercourse with the enemy's country in time of war. 

NOVEMBER 28TH. Nothing of importance to-day. There will 
be no such quiet time after this year. 

NOVEMBER 29TH. Gen. Sydney Johnston has command of the 
army in Tennessee and Kentucky. I wish it were only as strong 
as the wily enemy is in the habit of representing it ! 

NOVEMBER 30TH. Mr. Benjamin has been defeated for the C. 
S. Senate. Mr. Hunter has been named as a candidate for the 



96 A EEBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

C. S. Senate from Virginia. I thought he would not remain in 
the cabinet, after his relative was arrested (with no reason assigned) 
by order of Mr. Benjamin. Besides, the office is a sinecure, and 
may remain so for a long time, if the powers at Washington should 
"stint, and say aye" to the demands of England. 



CHAPTER IX. 

Gen. Lee ordered South. Gen. Stuart ambuscaded at Drainsville. W. H. 
B. Custis returns tp the Eastern Shore. Winder's detectives. Kentucky 
secedes. Judge Perkins's resolution. Dibble goes North. Waiting for 
Great Britain to do something. Mr. Ely, the Yankee M. C. 

DECEMBER IST. The people here begin to murmur at the idea 
that they are questioned about their loyalty, and often arrested, by 
Baltimore petty larceny detectives, who, if they were patriotic 
themselves (as they are all able-bodied men), would be in the 
army, fighting for the redemption of Maryland. 

DECEMBER 3D. Gen. Lee has now been ordered South for the de- 
fense of Charleston and Savannah, and those cities are safe ! Give 
a great man a field worthy of his powers, and he can demonstrate 
the extent of his abilities ; but dwarf him in an insignificant position, 
and the veriest fool will look upon him with contempt. Gen. Lee 
in the streets here bore the aspect of a discontented man, for he 
saw that everything was going wrong; but now his eye flashes 
with zeal and hope. Give him time and opportunity, and he will 
hurl back the invader from his native land ; yes, and he will com- 
mend the chalice of invasion to the lips of the North ; but not 
this year it is too late for that. 

DECEMBER 3D. Several members of Congress came into my 
office and denounced the policy which the government seemed to 
have adopted of permitting Yankees, and those who sympathize 
with them, to be continually running over to the enemy with in- 
formation of our condition, and thus inviting attacks and raids at 
points where we are utterly defenseless. They seemed surprised 
when I told them that I not only agreed with them 'entirely, but 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 97 

that I had really written most of the articles they had read in the 
press denunciatory of the policy they condemned. I informed 
them, moreover, that I had long since refused to sign any such 
passports as they alluded to, at the risk of being removed. They 
said they believed the President, in his multiplicity of employments, 
was not aware of the extent of the practice, and the evil effects it 
was certain to entail on the country ; and it was their purpose to 
wait upon him and remonstrate against the pernicious practice of 
Mr. Benjamin. 

DECEMBER 4TH. We are now tasting the bitter fruits of a too 
indulgent treatment of our enemies. Yesterday Gen. Stuart's cav- 
alry and the 6th Regiment S. C. volunteers met with a bloody dis- 
aster at Drainsville. It appears that several of the traitors arrested 
and sent hither by Gen. Johnston were subsequently discharged by 
Gen. Winder, under the instructions of Mr. Benjamin, and sent to 
their homes, in the vicinity of Drainsville, at the expense of the 
government. These men, with revenge rankling in their breasts, 
reported to Gen. Stuart that a large amount of forage might be 
obtained in the vicinity of Drainsville, and that but a few compa- 
nies of the enemy were in the neighborhood. The general believ- 
ing these men to be loyal, since they seemed to have the confidence 
of the War Department, resolved to get the forage ; and for that 
purpose started some 80 wagons early the next morning, escorted 
by several regiments of infantry and 1000 cavalry, hoping to cap- 
ture any forces of the enemy in the vicinity. Meantime the Drains- 
ville traitors had returned to their homes the preceding evening, 
and sent off intelligence to the headquarters of the enemy of the 
purpose of Gen. Stuart to send out in that direction, early the 
next day, a foraging party consisting of so many wagons, and 
small forces of infantry, artillery, and cavalry. 

The enemy hastened away to Drainsville an overwhelming force, 
and ambuscaded the road, where it entered the woods, with artil- 
lery and men of all arms. Their line was the shape of a horse- 
shoe, and completely concealed from view. 

Gen. Stuart had not entered far into the jaws of this trap, be- 
fore some of his trusty scouts reported the presence of the enemy. 
Believing it to be only the pickets of the few companies previously 
reported, the general advanced still farther; but at the same time 
ordering the wagons to retire. He was soon undeceived by a 

9 



98 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

simultaneous and concentric fire of artillery and musketry, which 
brought down many of his men. Nevertheless, he charged through 
the lines in one or two places, and brought his guns to bear with 
effect on such portions of the enemy's line as were not wholly pro- 
tected by the inequalities of the ground and the dense growth of 
woods. He quickly ascertained, however, that he was contending 
against vastly superior numbers, and drew off his forces in good 
order, protecting his wagons. The enemy did not pursue, for 
Stuart had rather more men than the informers reported to the 
enemy. But we lost 200 men, while the enemy sustained but little 
injury; their killed and wounded not exceeding 30. 

This is the first serious wound inflicted on the country by Mr. 
Benjamin's policy. 

DECEMBER STH. The account of the Drainsville massacre was 
furnished me by an officer of the 6th S. C. Regiment, which suf- 
fered severely. The newspaper accounts of the occurrence, upon 
which, perhaps, the history of this war will be founded, give a dif- 
ferent version of the matter. And hence, although not so designed 
at first, this Diary will furnish more authentic data of many of 
the events of the war than the grave histories that will be writ- 
ten. Still, I do not aspire to be the Froissart of these interesting 
times : but intend merely to furnish my children, and such, others 
as may read them, with reliable chronicles of the events passing 
under my own observation. 

DECEMBER GTH. It is rumored to-day, I know not on what 
authority, that the President mentioned the matter of the Drains- 
ville disaster to the Secretary of War, and intimated that it was 
attributed to the machinations of the Union men discharged from 
prison here. It is said Mr. Benjamin denied it denied that any 
such men had been discharged by Gen. Winder, or had been con- 
cerned in the affair at all. Of course the President had no alter- 
native but to credit the solemn assertions of his confidential ad- 
viser. But my books, and the register of the prisons, would 
show that the Drainsville prisoners sent hither by Gen. Joseph E. 
Johnston were discharged by Gen. Winder, and that their expenses 
home were paid by the government; and officers of unimpeacha- 
ble veracity are ready to testify that Gen. Stuart was misled by 
these very men. 

DECEMBER TTH. Quite a commotion has been experienced in 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 99 

official circles by the departure of Mr. W. II. B. Custis, late Union, 
member of the Virginia Convention, without obtaining a passport 
to leave the city. Some of his secession constituents being in the 
city, reported that they knew it was his purpose to return to the 
Eastern Shore of Virginia, and avow his adherence to thellnited 
States authorities, alleging that he had signed the ordinance of 
secession under some species of duress, or instruction. Under 
these representations, it seems Gen. Winder telegraphed to Nor- 
folk, whither it was understood Custis had gone, to have him ar- 
rested. This was done ; and it is said he had passports from Gen. 
Huger to cross the Chesapeake Bay. I must doubt this. What 
right has a military commander to grant such passports? 

DECEMBER STH. I saw Mr. Benjamin to-day, and asked him 
what disposition he intended to make of Mr. Custis. He was ex- 
cited, and said with emphasis that he was investigating the case. 
He seemed offended at the action of Gen. Winder, and thought it 
was a dangerous exercise of military power to arrest persons of 
such high standing, without the clearest evidence of guilt. Mr. 
Cnstis had signed the ordinance of secession, and that ought to be 
sufficient evidence of his loyalty. 

DECEMBER OTH. Gen. Winder informed me to-day that he had 
been ordered to release Mr. Custis; and I learned that the Secre- 
tary of War had transmitted orders to Gen. Huger to permit him 
to pass over the bay. 

DECEMBER 10TH. Nothing new. 

DECEMBER HTH. Several of Gen. Winder's detectives came to 
me with a man named Webster, who, it appears, has been going 
between Richmond and Baltimore, conveying letters, money, etc. 
I refused him a passport. He said he could get it from the Sec- 
jretary himself, but that it was sometimes difficult in gaining access 
to him. I told him to get it, then; I would give him none. 

DECEMBER 12rH. More of Gen. Winder's men came with a 
Mr. Stone, whom they knew and vouched for, and who wanted a 
passport merely to Norfolk. I asked if it was not Ins design to 
go farther. They said yes, but that Gen. Winder would write 
to Gen. Huger to let him pass by way of Fortress Monroe. I 
refused, and great indignation was manifested. 

DECEMBER 13ra. One of the papers has a short account of the 
application of Stone in its columns this morning. One of the re- 



100 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

porters was present at the interview. The article bore pretty 
severely upon the assumption of power by the military commander 
of the department. Gen. Winder came in during the day, and 
denied having promised to procure a passport for Stone from Gen. 
HugerT 

DECEMBER 14TH. Nothing. 

DECEMBER 15xH. The President's private secretary, Capt. Jos- 
selyn, was in to-day. He had no news. 

DECEMBER 16TH. We hear to-day that the loyal men of Ken- 
tucky have met in convention and adopted an ordinance of seces- 
sion and union with our Confederacy. 

DECEMBER 17TH. Bravo, Col. Edward Johnson ! He was 
attacked by 5000 Yankees on the Alleghany Mountains, and he 
has beaten them with 1200 men. They say Johnson is an ener- 
getic man, and swears like a trooper; and instead of a sword, he 
goes into battle with a stout cane in his hand, with which he be- 
labors any skulking miscreant found dodging in the hour of 
danger. 

DECEMBER 18iH. Men escaped from the Eastern Shore of 
Virginia report that Mr. Custis had landed there, and remains 
quiet. 

DECEMBER 19TH. Judge Perkins came in to-day and den6unced 
in bitter terms the insane policy of granting passports to spies and 
others to leave the country, when every Northern paper bore tes- 
timony that we were betrayed by these people. He asked me how 
many had been permitted to go North by Mr. Benjamin since the 
expiration of the time named in the President's proclamation. 
This I could not answer : but suggested that a resolution of in- 
quiry might elicit the information. He desired me to write such a 
resolution. I did so, and he departed with it. An hour after- 
ward, I learned it had been passed unanimously. 

DECEMBER 20TH. A man by the name of Dibble, the identical 
one I passed on my way to Montgomery last spring, and whom I 
then thought acted and spoke like a Yankee, is here seeking per- 
mission to go North ; he says to Halifax. He confesses that he 
is a Yankee born ; but has Jived in North Carolina for many years, 
and has amassed a fortune. He declares the South does not contain 
a truer Southern man than himself; and he says he is going to the 
British Provinces to purchase supplies for the Confederacy. He 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 101 

brought me an order from Mr. Benjamin, indorsed on the back of 
a letter, for a passport. I declined to give it; and he departed in 
anger, saying the Secretary would grant it. He knew this, for 
he said the Secretary had promised him one. 

DECEMBER 21sT. Col. Bledsoe was in to-day. I had not seen 
him for a long time. He had not been sitting in the office two 
minutes before he uttered one of his familiar groans. Instantly 
we were on the old footing again. He said Secretary Benjamin 
had never treated him as Chief of the Bureau, any more than 
Walker. 

DECEMBER 22D. Dibble has succeeded in obtaining a passport 
from the Secretary himself. 

DECEMBER 23D. Gen. T. J. Jackson has destroyed a principal 
dam on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. That will give the 
enemy abundance of trouble. This Gen. Jackson is always doing 
something to vex the enemy; and I think he is destined to annoy 
them more. 

It is with much apprehension that I see something like a gen- 
eral relaxation of preparation to hurl back the invader. It seems 
as if the government were waiting for England to do it; and after 
all, the capture of Slidell and Mason may be the very worst thing 
that could have happened. Mr. Benjamin, I learn, feels very confi- 
dent that a rupture between the United States and Great Britain is 
inevitable. War with England is not to be thought of by Mr. Seward 
at this juncture, and he will not have it. And we should not rely 
upon the happening of any such contingency. Some of our officials 
go so far as to hint that in the event of a war between the United 
States and Great Britain, and our recognition by the former, it might 
be good policy for us to stand neutral. The war would certainly be 
waged on our account, and it would not be consistent with Southern 
honor and chivalry to retire from the field and leave the friend 
who interfered in our behalf to fight it out alone. The principal 
members of our government should possess the highest stamp of 
character, for never did there exist a purer people. 

DECEMBER 24TH. I am at work on the resolution passed by 
Congress. The Secretary sent it to me, with an order to prepare 
the list of names, and saying that he would explain the grounds 
upon which they were permitted to depart. I can only give the 
number registered in this office. 

9* 



102 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

DECEMBER 25-TH. Mr. Ely, the Yankee member of Congress, 
who has been in conflnement here since the battle of Manassas, 
has been exchanged for Mr. Faulkner, late Minister to France, 
who was captured on his return from Europe. Mr. Kly smiled at 
the brown paper on which I had written his passport. I told him 
it was Southern manufacture, and although at present in a crude 
condition, it was in the process of improvement, and that "neces- 
sity was the mother of invention." The necessity imposed on us 
by the blockade would ultimately redound to our advantage, and 
might injure the country inflicting it by diminishing its own pro- 
ducts. He smiled again, and said he had no doubt we should rise 
to the dignity of white paper. 

DECEMBER 26TH. I have been requested by several members of 
Congress to prepare a bill, establishing a passport office by law. 
I will attempt it; but it cannot pass, unless it be done in spite of 
the opposition of the Secretary, who knows how to use his patron- 
age so as to bind members to his interest. He learned that at 
Washington. 

DECEMBER 27TH. Notwithstanding the severe strictures, and 
the resolution of Congress, there is an increase rather than a dimi- 
nution of the number of persons going North. Some of our offi- 
cials seem to think the war is over, or that England will do the 
balance of our fighting ! 

DECEMBER 28iH. The fathers and mothers and sisters of our 
brave soldiers continue to send their clothing and provisions. 
They do not relax in the work of independence. 

DECEMBER 29TH. Persons are coming here from that portion 
of Western Virginia held by the enemy, with passports from Gen. 
Cox, the Yankee commander. They applied to me to-day for 
passports to return to Kanawha, which I refused. They obtained 
them from the Assistant Secretary of War, Mr. Ould. 

DECEMBER 30TH. Some of our officers on furlough complain of 
the dullness of the war. The second year will be different. 

DECEMBER 31 ST. Northern papers, received in this city, show 
very conclusively that the enemy are pretty accurately informed of 
the condition of our defenses and the paucity of the numbers in 
our regiments. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 103 



CHAPTER X. 

X 

Seward gives up Mason and Slidell. Great preparations of the enemy. 
Gen. Jackson betrayed. Mr. Memminger's blunders. Exaggerated re- 
ports of our troops in Kentucky and Tennessee. 

JANUARY IST, 1862. Seward has cowered beneath the roar of 
the British Lion, and surrendered Mason and Slidell, who have 
been permitted to go on their errand to England. Now we must 
depend upon aur own strong arms and stout hearts for defense. 

JANUARY 2D. The enemy are making preparations to assail us 
everywhere. Roanoke Island, Norfolk, Beaufort, and Newbern ; 
Charleston, Savannah, Mobile, Pensacola, and New Orleans are 
all menaced by numerous fleets on the sea-board, and in the West 
great numbers df iron-clad floating batteries threaten to force a 
passage down the Mississippi, while monster armies are concentra- 
ting for the invasion of Tennessee and the Cotton States. Will 
Virginia escape the scourge ? Not she ; here is the bull's-eye of 
the mark they aim at. 

JANUARY 3D. The enemy have in the field, according to their 
official reports, some three-quarters of a million of men ; we, about 
250,000, or one-quarter of a million. This might answer for de- 
fense if we could only know where their blows will fall ; but then 
they have a strong navy and thousands of transports, and we have 
next to nothing afloat to oppose to them. And there is no entente 
cordiale between Mr. Benjamin and any of our best generals. 

JANUARY 4Tii. It is just as I feared. Gen. T. J. Jackson, sup- 
posing his project to be a profound secret, marched on the 1st 
instant from Winchester, intending to surprise a force of the enemy 
at Romney. But he had not proceeded half the distance before 
he found a printed account of his intended expedition in a Balti- 
more paper at an inn on the roadside. This was treason of the 
blackest dye, and will cost us a thousand men. The enemy, of 
course, escaped, and our poor soldiers, frost-bitten and famished, 
must painfully retrace all steps of this fruitless march. 



104 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

JANUARY STH. There are rumors of a court-martial, and I fear 
the enterprising Jackson will be made to suffer for the crime of 
others. That men sympathizing with the Union cause were daily 
leaving Richmond for Baltimore was known to all, but how they 
gained intelligence of the contemplated movement of Jackson is 
the mystery. 

JANUARY GTH. No news. 

JANUARY 7ie. Brig-Gen. Wise is to command on Roanoke 
Island. It is not far from Princess Ann County, where his place 
of residence is. If they give him men enough, say half as many 
as the enemy, he will defend it. 

JANUARY STH. Dearth of news. 

JANUARY 9iH. Butter is 50 cts. per pound, bacon 25 cts., 
beef has risen from 13 cts. to 30 cts., wood is selling for $8 per 
cord, but flour is abundant, and cheap enough to keep us from 
starving. 

JANUARY IOTH. The President is rarely seen in the streets now, 
and it is complained that he is not so accessible as formerly in his 
office. I do not know what foundation there is for these reports, 
and see no reason to credit them. I know he rides out in the 
afternoon, if the weather be fair, after the labors of the day, and he 
is a regular attendant at St. Paul's Church. I am rather inclined 
to credit the rumor that he intends to join the church. All his 
messages and proclamations indicate that he is looking to a 
mightier power than England for assistance. There is a general 
desire to have the cabinet modified and Christianized upon the 
inauguration of the permanent government. 

JANUARY HTH. We have three candidates in the field in this 
district for Congress: President Tyler, James Lyons, and Wm. 
H. McFarland. The first will, of course, walk over the track. 

JANUARY 12TH. Gen. Wise, whose headquarters are to be 
fixed at Nag's Head on the beach near Roanoke Island, reports 
that the force he commands is altogether inadequate to defend the 
position. Burnside is said to have 20,000 men, besides a numerous 
fleet of gun-boats; and Gen. Wise has but 3000 effective men. 

JANUARY 13TH. The department leaves Gen. Wise to his su- 
perior officer, Gen. Huger, at Norfolk, who has 15,000 men. But 
I understand that Huger says Wise has ample means for the de- 
fense of the island, and refuses to let him have more men. This 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 105 

looks like a man-trap of the "Red-tapers" to get rid of a popu- 
lar leader. I hope the President will interfere. 

JANUARY 14TH. All calm and quiet to-day. 

JANUARY 15TH. I forgot to mention the fact that some weeks 
ago I received a work in manuscript from London, sent thither 
before the war, and brought by a bearer of dispatches from our 
Commissioner, Hon. Ambrose Dudley Mann, to whom I had writ- 
ten on the subject. I owe him a debt of gratitude for this kind- 
ness. When peace is restored, I shall have in readiness some 
contributions to the literature of the South, and my family, if I 
should not survive, may derive pecuniary benefit from them. I 
look for a long war, unless a Napoleon springs up among us, a 
thing not at all probable, for I believe there are those who are con- 
stantly on the watch for such dangerous characters, and they may 
possess the power to nip all embryo emperors in the bud. 

Some of our functionaries are not justly entitled to the great 
positions they occupy. They attained them by a species of snap- 
judgment, from which there may be an appeal hereafter.. It is very 
certain that many of our best men have no adequate positions, and 
revolutions are mutable things. 

JANUARY IGTH. To-day, Mr. Benjamin, whom I met in the hall 
of the department, said, "I don't grant any passports to leave the 
country, except to a few men on business for the government. I 
have ceased to grant any for some time past." I merely remarked 
that I was glad to hear it. 

Immediately on returning to my office I referred to my book, and 
counted the names of fifty persons to whom the Secretary had 
granted passports within thirty days ; and these were not all agents 
of the government. Mr. Benjamin reminded me of Daniel Web- 
ster, when he used to make solemn declarations that his friends in 
office were likewise the partisans of President Tyler. 

JANUARY 17TH. A Mr. O. Hendricks, very lately of the IT. S. 
Coast Survey, has returned from a tour of the coast of North 
Carolina, and has been commissioned a lieutenant by the Secretary 
of War. He says Burnside will take Roanoke Island, and that 
Wise and all his men will be captured. It is a man-trap. 

JANUARY 18TH. Gen. L. P. Walker, the first Secretary of War, 

is assigned to duty in the Southwest under Gen. Bragg. How 

. can he obey the orders of one who was so recently under his ccim- 



106 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

mand ? I think it probable he will resign again before the end of 
the campaign. 

JANUARY 19m. There has been a storm on the coast, sinking 
some of the enemy's ships. Col. Allen, of New Jersey, was lost. 
He was once at my house in Burlington, and professed to be friendly 
to the Southern cause. I think he said he owned land and slaves 
in Texas. 

JANUARY 20TH. Mr. Memminger advertises to pay interest on 
certain government bonds in specie. That won't last long. He 
is paying 50 per cent, premium in treasury notes for the specie, and 
the bonds are given for treasury notes. What sort of financiering 
is this ? 

JANUARY 21sT. A great number of Germans and others are 
going to Norfolk, thinking, as one remarked, if they can't go to 
the United States the United States will soon come to them. Many ' 
believe that Burnside will get Norfolk. I think differently, but I 
may be mistaken. 

JANUARY 22o. Some of the letter-carriers' passports from 
Mr. Benjamin, which have the countenance of Gen. Winder, are 
now going into Tennessee. What is this for ? We shall see. 

JANUARY 23D. Again the Northern papers give the most ex- 
travagant numbers to our army in Kentucky. Some estimates 
are as high as 150,000. I know, and Mr. Benjamin knows, that 
Gen. Johnston has not exceeding 29,000 effective men. And the 
Secretary knows that Gen. J. has given him timely notice of the 
inadequacy of his force to hold the position at Bowling Green. 
The Yankees are well aware of our weakness, but they intend to 
claim the astounding feat of routing 150,000 men with 100,000 I 
And they suppose that by giving us credit for such a vast army, 
we shall not deem it necessary to send reinforcements. Well, re- 
inforcements are not sent. 

JANUARY 24TH. Beauregard has been ordered to the West. I 
knew the doom was upon him ! But he will make his mark even at 
Columbus, though the place seems to ine to be altogether untena- 
ble and of no practicable importance, since the enemy may attack 
both in front and rear. It would seem that some of the jealous 
functionaries would submit to any misfortune which would destroy 
Beauregard's popularity. But these are exceptions : they are few 
arftl far between, thank Heaven ! 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 107 

JANUARY 25Tn. The French players have been permitted by 
the Secretary to leave the country. But British subjects are now 
refused passports. 

JANUARY 26TH. President Tyler has been elected to Congress 
by an overwhelming majority. 

JANUARY 27TH. The Secretary of War has issued such a per- 
emptory order to Gen. Wise, that the latter has no alternative but 
to attempt the defense of Roanoke Island with 3000 men against 
15,000 and a fleet of gun-boats. The general is quite sick, but he 
will fight. His son, Capt. 0. Jennings Wise, who has been under 
fire many times already, commands a company on the island. He 
will deserve promotion. The government seems to have pro- 
scribed the great men of the past and their families, as if this gov- 
ernment was the property of the few men who happen to wield 
power at the present moment. Arrogance and presumption in 
the South must, sooner or later, have a fall. The great men who 
were the leaders of this revolution may be ignored, but they can- 
not be kept down by the smaller fry who aspire to wield the des- 
tinies of a great and patriotic people. Smith and Lovell, New 
York politicians and Street Commissioners, have been made major- 
generals, while Wise and Breckiuridge are brigadiers. 

JANUARY 28TH. There must soon be collisions in the West on 
a large scale; but the system of lying, in vogue among the Yan- 
kees, most effectually defeats all attempts at reliable computation 
of numbers. They say we have 150,000 men in Tennessee and 
Kentucky, whereas we have not 60,000. Their own numbers they 
represent to be not exceeding 50,000, but I suspect they have three 
times that number. The shadows of events are crowding thickly 
upon us, and the events will speak for themselves and that 
speedily. 

JANUARY 29Tn. What we want is a military man capable of 
directing operations in the field everywhere. I think Lee is such 
a man. But can he, a modest man and a Christian, aspire to such 
a position ? Would not Mr. Benjamin throw his influence against 
such a suggestion ? I trust the President will see through the 
mist generated around him. 

JANUARY 30TH. Some of the mysterious letter-carriers, who 
have just returned from their jaunt into Tennessee, are applying 
again for passports to Baltimore, Washington, etc. I refuse them, 



108 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

though they are recommended by Gen. Winder's men; bnt they 
will obtain what they want from the Secretary himself, or his 
Assistant Secretary. 

JANUARY 31ST. What if these men (they have passports) 
should be going to Washington to report the result of their recon- 
noissances in Tennessee ? The Tennessee River is high, and we 
have no casemated batteries, or batteries of any sort, on it above 
Fort Henry. 



CHAPTER XL 

Fall of Fort Henry. Of Fort Donelson. Lugubrious Inauguration of the 
President in the Permanent Government. Loss of Roanoke Island. 

FEBRUARY IST. We had a startling rumor yesterday that New 
Orleans had been taken by the enemy, without firing a gun. I 
hastened to the Secretary and asked him if it could be true. He 
had not heard of it, and turned pale. But a moment after, recol- 
lecting the day on which it was said the city had fallen, he seized 
a New Orleans paper of a subsequent date, and said the news 
could not be true, since the paper made no mention of it. 

FEBRUARY 2D. The rumor of yesterday originated in the as- 
sertion of a Yankee paper that New Orleans would be taken with- 
out firing a gun. Some of our people fear it may be so, since Mr. 
Benjamin's friend, Gen. Lovell, who came from New York since 
the battle of Manassas, is charged with the defense of the city. 
He delivered lectures, it is said, last summer on the defenses of 
New York in that city. Have we not Southern men of sufficient 
genius to make generals of, for the defense of the South, without 
sending to New York for military commanders ? 

FEBRUARY 3D. We have intelligence of the sailing of an expe- 
dition from Cairo for the reduction of Fort Henry on the Tennes- 
see River. 

FEBRUARY 4TH. Bnrnside has entered the Sound at Hatteras 
with his fleet of gun-boats and transports. The work will soon 
begin. 



AT TIIE CONFEDERATE STATEif CAPITAL. 10U 

FEBRUARY STU. I am sorry to hear that Gen. Wise is qu^te ill. 
But, op his back, as on his feet, he will direct operations, and the 
enemy will be punished whenever he comes in reach of him. 

FEBRUARY GTH. The President is preparing his Inaugural 
Message for the 22d, when he is to begin his new administration 
of six years. He is to read it from the Washington Monument in 
Capitol Square. 

FEBRUARY TTH. We have vague rumors of fighting at Roanoke. 
Nothing reliable. 

FEBRUARY 8-20TH. Such astounding events have occurred 
since the 8th instant, such an excitement has prevailed, and so 
incessant have been my duties, that I have not kept a regular jour- 
nal. I give a running account of them. 

Roanoke has fallen before superior numbers, although we had 
15,000 idle troops at Norfolk within hearing of the battle. The 
government would not interfere, and Gen. Huger refused to allow 
the use of a few thousand of his troops. 

But Gen. Wise is safe ; Providence willed that he should escape 
the "man-trap." When the enemy were about to open fire on his 
headquarters at Nag's Head, knowing him to be prostrated with 
illness (for the island had then been surrendered after a heroic 
defense), Lieutenants Bagly and Wise bore the general away in a 
blanket to a distance of ten or fifteen miles. The Yankees would 
have gladly exchanged all their prisoners for Gen. Wise, who is 
ever a terror to the North. 

Capt. O. Jennings Wise fell, while gallantly cheering his men, 
in the heat of the battle. A thousand of the enemy fell before a 
few hundred of our brave soldiers. We lost some 2500 men, for 
there was no alternative but to surrender. 

Capt. Wise told the Yankee officers, who persisted in forcing 
themselves in his presence during his dying moments, that the South 
could never be subjugated. They might exterminate us, but every 
man, woman, and child would prefer death to abject subjugation. 
And he died with a sweet smile on his lip, eliciting the profound 
respect of his most embittered enemies. 

The enemy paroled our men taken on the island ; and we recov- 
ered the remains of the heroic Capt. Wise. His funeral here was 
most impressive, and saddened the countenances of thousands who 

10 



110 A RftBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

witnessed the pageant. None of the members of the government 
were present ; but the ladies threw flowers and evergreens upon 
his bier. He is dead but history will do him justice ; and his 
example will inspire others with the spirit of true hesoism. 

And President Tyler is no more on earth. He died after a very 
brief illness. There was a grand funeral, Mr. Hunter and others 
delivering orations. They came to me, supposing I had written 
one of the several biographies of the deceased which have appeared 
during the last twenty years. But I had written none and none 
published were worthy of the subject. I could only refer them to 
the bound volumes of the MADISONIAN in the State library for his 
messages and other State papers. The originals are among my 
papers in the hands of the enemy. His history is yet to be writ- 
ten and it will be read centuries hence. 

Fort Henry has fallen. Would that were all ! The catalogue 
of disasters I feared and foretold, under the policy adopted by the 
War Department, may be a long and a terrible one. 

The mission of the spies to East Tennessee is now apparent. 
Three of the enemy's gun-boats have ascended the Tennessee River 
to the very head of navigation, while the women and children on 
its banks could do nothing more than gaze in mute despair. No 
batteries, no men were there. The absence of these is what the 
traitors, running from here to Washington, have been reporting 
to the enemy. Their boats would no more have ventured up that 
river without the previous exploration of spies, than Mr. Lincoln 
would dare to penetrate a cavern without torch-bearers, in which 
the rattle of venomous snakes could be heard. They have 
ascended to Florence, and may get footing in Alabama and Mis- 
sissippi ! 

And Fort Donelson has been attacked by an immensely supe- 
rior force. We have 15,000 men there to resist, perhaps, 75,000 ! 
Was ever such management known before ? Who is responsible 
for it? If Donelson falls, what becomes of the ten or twelve 
thousand men at Bowling Green ? 

FEBRUARY 21sT. All our garrison in Fort Henry, with Gen. 
Tilghman, surrendered. I think we had only 1500 men there. 
Guns, ammunition, and stores, all gone. 

No news from Donelson and that is bad news. Benjamin 
says he has no definite information. But prisoners taken say the 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. Ill 

enemy have been reinforced, and are barling 80,000 against oar 
15,000. 

FEBRUARY 22D. Such a day! The heavens weep incessantly. 
Capitol Square is black with umbrellas ; and a shelter has been 
erected for the President to stand under. 

I walked up to the monument and heard the Inaugural read by 
the President. He read it well, and seemed self-poised in the 
midst of disasters, which he acknowledged had befallen us. And 
he admitted that there had been errors in our war policy. We had 
attempted operations on too extensive a scale, thus diffusing our 
powers which should have been concentrated. I like these candid 
confessions. They augur a different policy hereafter, and we may 
hope for better results in the future. We must all stand up for 
our country. 

Mr. Hunter has resigned, and taken his place in the Senate. 

FEBRUARY 23D. At last we have the astounding tidings that 
Donelson has fallen, and Buckner, and 9000 men, arms, stores, 
everything are in possession of the enemy ! Did the President 
know it yesterday ? Or did the Secretary keep it back till the new 
government (permanent) was launched into existence ? Where- 
fore ? The Southern people cannot be daunted by calamity ! 

Last night it was still raining and it rained all night. It was 
a lugubrious reception at the President's mansion. But the Presi- 
dent himself was calm, and Mrs. Davis seemed in spirits. For a 
long time 1 feared the bad weather would keep the people away ; 
and the thought struck me when I entered, that if there were a 
Lincoln spy present, we should have more ridicule iu the Yankee 
presses on the paucity of numbers attending the reception. But 
the crowd came at last, and filled the ample rooms. The perma- 
nent government had its birth in storm, but it may yet flourish in 
sunshine. For my own part, however, I think a provisional gov- 
ernment of few men, should have been adopted "for the war." 

FEBRUARY 24m. Gen. Sydney Johnston has evacuated Bowl- 
ing Green with his ten or twelve thousand men ! Where is his 
mighty army now ? It never did exist ! 

FEBRUARY 25TH. And Nashville must fall although no one 
seems to anticipate such calamity. We must run the career of 
disasters allotted us, and await the turning of the tide. 

FEBRUARY 26TH. Congress, in secret session, has authorized 



112 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S D>ARY 

the declaration of martial law in this city, and at some few other 
places. This might be well under other circumstances ; but it 
will not be well if the old general in command should be clothed 
with powers which he has no qualifications to wield advantage- 
ously. The facile old man will do anything the Secretary ad- 
vises. 

Our army is to fall back from Manassas ! The Rappahannock 
is not to be our line of defense. Of course the enemy will soon 
strike at Richmond from some direction. I have given great 
offense to some of our people by saying the policy of permitting 
men to go North at will, will bring the enemy to the gates of the 
city in ninety days. Several have told me that the prediction has 
been marked in the Secretary's tablets, and that I am marked for 
destruction if it be not verified. I reply that I would rather be 
destroyed than that it should be fulfilled. 

FEBRUARY 27TH. Columbus is to be evacuated. Beauregard 
sees that it is untenable with Forts Henry and Donelson in pos- 
session of the enemy. He will not be caught in such a trap as 
that. But he is erecting a battery at Island No. 10 that will give 
the Yankees trouble. I hope it may stay the catalogue of dis- 
asters. 

FEBRUARY 28TH These calamities may be a wholesome chast- 
ening for us. We shall now go to work and raise troops enough to 
defend the country. Congress will certainly pass the Conscription 
Act recommended by the President. 



CHAPTER XII. 

Nashville evacuated. Martial law. Passports. Com. Buchanan's naval 
engagement. Gen. Winder's blunders. Mr. Benjamin Secretary of 
State. Lee commander-in chief. Mr. G. W. Randolph Secretary of War. 

MARCH IST. It is certain that the City of Nashville has been 
evacuated, and will, of course, be occupied by the enemy. Gen. 
Johnston, with the remnant of his army, has fallen down to Mur- 
freesborough, and as that is not a point of military importance, 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 113 

will in turn be abandoned, and the enemy will drop oat of the 
State into Alabama or Mississippi. 

MARCH 2o. Gen. Jos. E. Johnston has certainly made a skill- 
ful retrograde movement in the face of the enemy at Manassas. 
He has been keeping McClellan and his 210,000 men at bay for a 
long time with about 40,000. After the abandonment of his 
works it was a long time before the enemy knew he had retrograded. 
They approached very cautiously, and found that they had been 
awed by a few Quaker guns logs of wood in position, and so 
painted as to resemble cannon. Lord, how the Yankee press will 
quiz McClellan ! 

MARCH 3o. But McClellan would not advance. He could not 
drag his artillery at this season of the year ; and so he is embark- 
ing his army, or the greater portion of it, for the Peninsula. 

MARCH 4TH. We shall have stirring times here. Our troops 
are to be marched through Richmond immediately, for the defense 
of Yorktown the same town surrendered by Lord Cornwallis to 
Washington. But its fall or its successful defense now will signify 
nothing. 

MARCH STH. Martial law has been proclaimed. 

MARCH GTH. Some consternation among the citizens they dis- 
like martial law. 

MARCH TTH. Gen. Winder has established a guard with fixed 
bayonets at the door of the passport office. They let in only a 
few at a time, and these, when they get their passports, pass out 
by the rear door, it being impossible for them to return through 
the crowd. 

MARCH STH. Gen. Winder has appointed Capt. Godwin Pro- 
vost Marshal. 

MARCH 9TH. Gen. Winder has appointed Col. Porter Provost 
Marshal, Godwin not being high enough in rank, I suppose. 

MA&OH 10TH. One of the friends of the Secretary of War 
came to me to-day, and proposed to have some new passports 
printed, with the likeness of Mr. Benjamin engraved on them. He 
said, I think, the engraving had already been made. I denounced 
the project as absurd, and said there were some five or ten thou- 
sand printed passports on hand. 

MARCH HTH. I have summed up the amounts of patriotic con- 

10* 



114 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

tributions received by the army in Virginia, and registered on my 
book, and they amount to $1,515,898.* 

The people of the respective States contributed as follows : 

North Carolina $325,417 

Alabama 317,600 

Mississippi 272,670 

Georgia 244,885 

South Carolina : 137,206 

Texas 87,800 

Louisiana 61,950 

Virginia* 48,070 

Tennessee 17,000 

Florida 2,350 

Arkansas 950 

MARCH 12TH. Gen. Winder moved the passport office up to 
the corner of Ninth and Broad Streets. 

The office at the corner of Ninth and Broad Streets was a filthy 
one ; it was inhabited for they slept there by his rowdy clerks. 
And when I stepped to the hydrant for a glass of water, the tum- 
bler repulsed me by the smell of whisky. There was no towel to 
wipe my hands with, and in the long basement room underneath, 
were a thousand garments of dead soldiers, taken from the hospi- 
tals and the battle-field, and exhaling a most disagreeable, if not 
deleterious, odor. 

MARCH 13TH. Nevertheless, I am (temporarily) signing my 
name to the passports, yet issued by the authority of the Secretary 
of War. They are filled up and issued by three or four of the 
Provost Marshal's clerks, who are governed mainly by my direc- 
tions, as neither Col. Porter nor the clerks, nor Gen. Winder him- 
self, have the slightest idea of the geography of the country occu- 
pied by the enemy. The clerks are all Marylanders, as well as the 
detectives, and the latter intend to remain here to my great 
chagrin. 

MARCH 14TH. The Provost Marshal, Col. Porter, has had new 
passports printed, to which his own name is to be appended. I am 
requested to sign it for him, and to instruct the clerks generally. 



* Virginia undoubtedly contributed more than any other State, but they 
were not registered. 






AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 115 

MARCH 15TH. For several days troops have been pouring 
through the city, marching down the Peninsula. The enemy are 
making demonstrations against Yorktown. 

MARCH 16TH. I omitted to note in its place the gallant feat of 
Commodore Buchanan with the iron monster Merriraac in Hamp- 
ton Roads. He destroyed two of the enemy's best ships of war. 
My friends, Lieutenants Parker and Minor, partook of the glory, 
and were severely wounded. 

MARCH HTH. Col. Porter has resigned his provost marshal- 
ship, and is again succeeded by Capt. Godwin, a Virginian, and I 
like him very well, for he is truly Southern in his instincts. 

MARCH 18TH. A Mr. MacCubbin, of Maryland, has been ap- 
pointed by Gen. Winder the Chief of Police. He is wholly illit- 
erate, like the rest of the policemen under his command. 

MARCH 19TH. Mr. MacCubbin, whom I take to be a sort of 
Scotch-Irishman, though reared in the mobs of Baltimore, I am 
informed has given some passports, already signed, to some of his 
friends. This interference will produce a rupture between Capt. 
Godwin and Capt. MacCubbin ; but as the former is a Virginian, 
he may have the worst of it in the bear fight. 

MARCH 20TH. There is skirmishing every day on the Peninsula. 
We have not exceeding 60,000 men there, while the enemy have 
158,000. It is fearful odds. And they have a fleet of gun-boats. 

MARCH 21sT. Gen. Winder's detectives are very busy. They 
have been forging prescriptions to catch the poor Richmond 
apothecaries. When the brandy is thus obtained it is confiscated, 
and the money withheld. They drink the brandy, and imprison 
the apothecaries. 9 

MARCH 22D. Capt. Godwin, the Provost Marshal, was swear- 
ing furiously this morning at the policemen about their iniquitous 
forgeries. 

MARCH 23D. Gen. Winder was in this morning listening to 
something MacCubbin was telling him about the Richmond Whig. 
It appears that, in the course of a leading article, enthusiastic for 
the cause, the editor remarked, " we have arms and ammunition 
now." The policemen, one and all, interpreted this as a violation 
of the order to the press to abstain from speaking of the arrivals 
of arms, etc. from abroad. Gen. Winder, without looking at the 
paper, said in a loud voice, " Go and arrest the editor and close 



116 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

his office !" Two or three of the policemen started off on this 
errand. But I interposed, and asked them to wait a moment, 
until I could examine the paper. I found no infraction of the 
order in the truly patriotic article, and said so to Gen. "Winder. 
" Well," said he, " if he has not violated the order, he must not be 
arrested." He took the paper, and read for himself; and then, 
without saying anything more, departed. 

When he was gone, I asked MacCubbin what was the phraseology 
of the order that. "had been served on the editors." He drew it 
from his pocket, saying it had been shown to them, and not left 
with them. It was in the handwriting of Mr. Benjamin, and signed 
by Gen. Winder. And I learned that all the orders, sumptuary 
and others, had been similarly written and signed. Mr. Benjamin 
used the pencil and not the pen in writing these orders, supposing, 
of course, they would be copied by Gen. W.'s clerks. But they 
were not copied. The policemen threaten to stop the Examiner 
soon, for that paper has been somewhat offensive to the aliens 
who now have rule here. 

MARCH 24m. Gen. Walker, of Georgia the same who had 
the scene with Col. Bledsoe has resigned. I am sorry that the 
Confederate States must lose his services, for he is a brave man, 
covered with honorable scars. He has displeased the Secretary 
of War. 

MARCH 25TH. Gen. Bonham, of South Carolina, has also re- 
signed, for being overslaughed. His were the first troops that 
entered Virginia to meet the enemy; and because some of his 
three months' men were reorganized into fresh regiments, his 
brigade was dissolved, and his commission canceled. 

Price, Beauregard, Walker, Bonham, Toombs, Wise, Floyd, 
and others of the brightest lights of the South have been some- 
how successively obscured. And Joseph E. Johnston is a doomed 
fly, sooner or later, for he said, not long since, that there could be 
no hope of success as long as Mr. Benjamin was Secretary of 
War. These words were spoken at a dinner-table, and will reach 
the ears of the Secretary. 

MARCH 2GTH. The apothecaries arrested and imprisoned some 
days ago have been tried and acquitted by a court-martial. Gen. 
Winder indorsed on the order for their discharge : "Not approved, 
and you may congratulate yourselves upon escaping a merited 
punishment." 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 117 

MARCH 27TH. It is said Mr. Benjamin has been dismissed, or 
resign ed. 

MARCH 28TH. Mr. Benjamin has been promoted. He is now 
Secretary of State. 

His successor in the War Department is G. W. Randolph, a 
lawyer of modest pretensions, who, although he has lived for seve- 
ral years in this city, does not seem to have a dozen acquaintances. 
But he inherits a name, being descended from Thomas Jefferson, 
and, I believe, likewise from the Mr. Randolph in Washington's 
cabinet. Mr. Randolph was a captain at Bethel under Ma- 
gruder ; and subsequently promoted to a colonelcy. Announcing 
his determination to quit the military service more than a month 
ago, he entered the field as a competitor for the seat in Congress 
left vacant by the death of President Tyler. Hon. James Lyons 
was elected, and Col. Randolph got no votes at all. 

MARCH 30TH. Gen. Lee is to have command of all the armies 
but will not be in the field himself. He will reside here. Con- 
gress passed an act to create a commanding general ; but this 
was vetoed, fo* trenching on the executive prerogative or failed 
in some way. The proceedings were in secret session. 

MARCH 31sT. Gen. Joseph E. Johnston is to command on the 
Peninsula. The President took an affectionate leave of him the 
other day ; and Gen. Lee held his hand a long time, and admon- 
ished him to take care of his life. There was no necessity for him 
to endanger it as had just been done by the brave Sydney John- 
ston at Shiloh, whose fall is now universally lamented. This Gen 
Johnston (Joseph E.) I believe has the misfortune to be wounded 
in most of his battles. 



118 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 



CHAPTER XIII. 

Gen. Beauregard succeeds Gen. Sydney Johnston. Dibble, the traitor. 
Enemy at Fredericksburg. They say we will be subdued by the 15th of 
June. Lee rapidly concentrating at Richmond. Webster, the spy, hung. 

APRIL IST. Gen. Sydney Johnston having fallen in battle, the 
command in the West devolved on Gen. Beauregard, whose recent 
defense at Island No. 10 on the Mississippi, has revived his pop- 
ularity. Bnt, I repeat, he is a doomed man. 

APRIL 2D. Gen. Wise is here with his report of the Roanoke 
disaster. 

APRIL 3D. Congress is investigating the Roanoke affair. Mr. 
Benjamin has been denounced in Congress by Mr. Foote and 
others as the sole cause of the calamities which hare befallen the 
country. 

I wrote a letter to the President, offering to show that I had 
given no passport to Mr. Dibble, the traitor, and also the evidences, 
in his own handwriting, that Mr. Benjamin granted it. 

APRIL 4TH. The enemy are shelling our camp at Yorktown. 
I can hear the reports of the guns, of a damp evening. We are 
sending back defiance with our guns. 

The President has not taken any notice of my communication. 
Mr. Benjamin is too powerful to be affected by such proofs of such 
small matters. 

APRIL 5TH. Newbern, N. C., has fallen into the hands of the 
enemy ! Our men, though opposed by greatly superior numbers, 
made a brave resistance, and killed and wounded 1000 of the in- 
vaders. 

The enemy were piloted up the river to Newbern by the same 
Mr. Dibble to whom I refused a passport, but to whom the Sec- 
retary of War granted one. 

The press everywhere is commenting on the case of Dibble 
but Mordecai still sits at the gate. 

APRIL GTH. Two spies (Lincoln's detective police) have been 






AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 119 

arrested here, tried by court-martial, and condemned to be hang. 
There is an awful silence among the Baltimore detectives, which 
bodes no harm to the condemned. They will not be executed, 
though guilty. 

APRIL 7TH. R. G. H. Kean, a young man, and a connection 
of Mr. Randolph, has been appointed Chief of the Bureau of War 
in place of Col. Bledsoe, resigned at last. Mr. Kean was, I be- 
lieve, a lieutenant when Mr. Randolph was colonel, and acted as 
his adjutant. 

APRIL 8rn. Col. Bledsoe has been appointed Assistant Secre- 
tary of War by the President. Now he is in his glory, and has 
forgotten me. 

APRIL OTH. There are several young officers who have sheathed 
the sword, and propose to draw the pen in the civil service. 

To-day I asked of the department a month's respite from labor, 
and obtained it. But I remained in the city, and watched closely, 
still hoping I might serve the cause, or at least prevent more in- 
jury to it, from the wicked facility hitherto enjoyed by spies to 
leave the country. 

APRIL IOTH. The condemned spies have implicated Webster, 
the letter-carrier, who has had so many passports. He will hang, 
probably. Gen. Winder himself, and his policemen, wrote home 
by him. I don't believe him any rnoje guilty than many who used 
to write by him ; and I mean to tell the Judge Advocate so, if 
they give me an opportunity. 

APRIL HTH. The enemy are at Fredericksbnrg, and the Yankee 
papers say it will be all over with us by the 15th of June. I doubt 
that. 

APRIL 12TH. The committee (Congressional) which have been 
investigating the Roanoke Island disaster have come to the con- 
clusion, unanimously, and the House has voted accordingly, and 
with unanimity, that the blame and guilt of that great calamity 
rest solely upon "Gen. Huger and Judah P. Benjamin." 

APRIL 13TH. Gen. Wise now resolved to ask for another com- 
mand, to make another effort in defense of his country. But, when 
he waited upon the Secretary of War, he ascertained that there 
was no brigade for him. Returning from thence, some of his 
officers, who had escaped the trap at Roanoke, crowded round 
him to learn the issue of his application. 



120 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

" There is no Secretary of War !" said he. 

"What is Randolph?" asked one. 

" He is not Secretary of War !" said he ; " he is merely a clerk, 
an underling, and cannot hold up his head in his humiliating 
position. He never will be able to hold up his head, sir." 

APRIL 14TH. There will soon be hard fighting on the Pen- 
insula. 

APRIL 15TH. Gen. Beauregard has written to Gen. Wise, offer- 
ing him a command in his army, if the government will consent to 
it. It will not be consented to. 

APRIL 16iH. Troops are being concentrated rapidly in Yir- 
ginia by Gen. Lee. 

APRIL HTH. To-day Congress passed an act providing for 
the termination of martial law within thirty days after the meeting 
of the next session. This was as far as they could venture ; for, 
indeed, a majority seem to be intimidated at the glitter of bayonets 
in the streets, wielded by the authority of martial law. The press, 
too, has taken the alarm, and several of the publishers have con- 
fessed a fear of having their offices closed, if they dare to speak 
the sentiments struggling for utterance. It is, indeed, a reign of 
terror ! Every Virginian, and other loyal citizens of the South 
members of Congress and all must now, before obtaining Gen. 
Winder's permission to leave the city for their homes, bow down 
before the aliens in the Provost Marshal's office, and subscribe to 
an oath of allegiance, while a file of bayonets are pointed at his 
back ! 

APRIL 18TH. The President is thin and haggard; and it has 
been whispered on the street that he will immediately be baptized 
and confirmed. I hope so, because it may place a great gulf be- 
tween him and the descendant of those who crucified the Saviour. 
Nevertheless, some of his enemies allege that professions of Chris- 
tianity have sometimes been the premeditated accompaniments of 
usurpations. It was so with Cromwell and with Richard III. 
Who does not remember the scene in Shakspeare, where Richard 
appears on the balcony, with prayer book in hand and a priest on 
either side ? 

APRIL 19TH. All believe we are near a crisis, involving the 
possession of the capital. 

APRIL 21 ST. A calm before the storm. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 121 

APRIL 22D. Dibble, the traitor, has been captured by oar 
soldiers in North Carolina. 

APRIL 23o. The North Carolinians have refused to give up 
Dibble to Gen. Winder. And, moreover, the governor has de- 
manded the rendition of a citizen of his State, who was arrested 
there by one of Gen. Winder's detectives, and brought hither. 
The governor says, if he be not delivered up, he will institute 
measures of retaliation, and arrest every alien policeman from 
Richmond caught within the limits of his jurisdiction. 

Is it not shameful that martial law should be playing such fan- 
tastic tricks before high heaven, when the enemy's guns are boom- 
ing within hearing of the capital? 

APRIL 24TH Webster has been tried, condemned, and hung. 

APRIL 25TH. Gen. Wise, through the influence of Gen. Lee, 
who is a Christian gentleman as well as a consummate general, has 
been ordered into the field. He will have a brigade, but not with 
Beauregard. The President has unbounded confidence in Lee's 
capacity, modest as he is. 

Another change ! Provost Marshal Godwin, for rebuking the 
Baltimore chief of police, is to leave us, and to be succeeded by a 
Marylander, Major Griswold, whose family is now in the enemy's 
country. 

APRIL 26TH. Gen. Lee is doing good service in bringing for- 
ward reinforcements from the South against the day of trial and 
an awful day awaits us. It is understood that he made fully known 
to the President his appreciation of the desperate condition of 
affairs, and demanded carte blanche as a condition of his accept- 
ance of the position of commanding general. The President 
wisely agreed to the terms. 

APRIL 2?TH. Gen. Lee is calm but the work of preparation 
goes on night and day. 

APRIL 28TH. We have rumors of an important cabinet meeting, 
wherein it was resolved to advise or command Gen. Johnston to evac- 
uate Yorktown and retire toward Richmond I Also that Norfolk is 
to be given up 1 I don't believe it ; Lee's name is not mentioned. 

APRIL 29TH. Major Griswold is here, and so is a new batch of 
Marylanders. 

APRIL 30TH. Troops from the South are coming in and march- 
ing down the Peninsula.

CHAPTER XIV. 

Disloyalists entrapped. Norfolk abandoned. Merrimac blown up. 
Army falling back. Mrs. Davis leaves Richmond Preparing to burn 
the tobacco. Secretary of War trembles for Richmond. Richmond to 
be defended. The tobacco. Winking and blinking. Johnston's great 
battle. Wounded himself. The wounded. The hospitals. 

MAY IST. The ladies shower loaves of bread and slices of ham 
on the passing troops. 

MAY 2o. An iniquitous-looking prisoner was brought in to-day 
from Orange C. H., by the name of Robert Stewart. The evi- 
dence against him is- as follows : He is a Pennsylvanian, though a 
resident of Virginia for a number of years, and owns a farm in 
Orange County. Since the series of disasters, and the seeming 
downward progress of our affairs, Stewart has cooled his ardor 
for independence. He has slunk from enrollment in the. militia, 
and under the Conscription Act. And since the occupation of 
Fredericksburg by the enemy he has made use of such equivocal 
language as to convince his neighbors that his sympathies are 
wholly with the Northern invader. 

A day or two since, near nightfall, three troopers, weary and 
worn, halted at Stewart's house and craved food and rest for them- 
selves and horses. Stewart, supposing them to be Confederate 
soldiers, declared he had nothing they wanted, and that he was des- 
titute of every description of refreshments. They said they were 
sorry for it, as it was a long ride to Fredericksburg. 

"Are you Union soldiers ?" asked Stewart, quickly. 

"Yes," said they, "and we are on scooting duty." 

" Come in ! Come in ! I have everything you want !" cried Stew- 
art, and when they entered he embraced them. 

A sumptuous repast was soon on the table, but the soldiers re- 
fused to eat ! Surprised at this, Stewart demanded the reason ; 
the troopers rose, and said they were Confederate soldiers, and it 
was their duty to arrest a traitor. They brought him hither. Will 
he, too, escape merited punishment ? 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 123 

MAY 3o I fear there is something in the rumor that Norfolk 
and Portsmouth and Yorktown and the Peninsula will be given up. 
The Secretaries of War and Navy are going down to Norfolk. 

MAY 4TH. The Yankees on the Peninsula mean to fight. Well, 
that is what our brave army pants for. 

MAY STH. The prospect of battle produces a joyous smile on 
every soldier's face to-day. 

MAY BTH, YTH. We have not yet reached the lowest round 
of the ladder. The Secretary is at Norfolk, and the place is to 
be evacuated. I would resign first. 

MAY STII. Norfolk and Portsmouth are evacuated! Our army 
falling back ! The Merrimac is to be, or has been, blown up ! 

MAY 9rn. My family, excepting my son Custis, started to-day 
for Raleigh, N. C., where our youngest daughter is at school. But 
it is in reality another flight from the enemy. No one, scarcely, 
supposes that Richmond will be defended. But it must be ! 

MAY 10TH. The President's family have departed for Raleigh, 
and the families of most of the cabinet to their respective homes, 
or olher places of refuge. The President has been baptized (at 
home) and privately confirmed in St. Paul's Church. 

MAY HTH. The Baltimore detectives are the lords of the as- 
cendant. They crook a finger, and the best carriages in the street 
pause, turn round, and are subject to their will. They loll and 
roll in glory. And they ride on horseback, too government 
horses, or horses pressed from gentlemen's stables. One word of 
remonstrance, and the poor victim is sent to Castle Godwin. 

MAY 12TH. I suggested to the Provost Marshal several days 
ago that there was an act of Congress requiring the destruction 
of tobacco, whenever it might be in danger of falling into the 
hands of the enemy. He ran to Gen. Winder, and he to some 
one else, and then a hundred or more negroes, and as many 
wagons, were "pressed" by the detectives. They are now gath- 
ering the weed from all quarters, and piling it in " pressed" ware- 
houses, mixed with "combustibles," ready for the conflagration. 

And now the consuls from the different nations are claiming 
that all bought on foreign account ought to be spared the torch. 
Mr. Myers, the little old lawyer, has been employed to aid them. 
He told me to-day that none ought to be burnt, that the Yankees 
having already the tobacco of Missouri, Kentucky, and Maryland, 



124 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

if we burn ours it will redound to their benefit, as it will enhance 
the price of that in their hands. That is a Benjaraite argument. 
He hastened away to see the Secretary of State, and returned, 
saying, in high glee (supposing T concurred with him, of course), Mr. 
B. agreed with him. I told him, very gravely, that it mattered 
not who agreed with him ; so soon as the enemy came to Richmond 
all the tobacco would be burned, as the retiring army would attend 
to it; several high officers were so resolved. He looked astounded, 
and departed. 

MAY 1 STII. This morning I learned that the consuls had carried 
the day, and were permitted to collect the tobacco alleged to be 
bought on foreign account in separate warehouses, and to place the 
flags of their respective nations over them. This was saving the 
property claimed by foreigners whose governments refused to rec- 
ognize us (these consuls are accredited to the United States), and 
destroying that belonging to our own citizens. I told the Provost 
Marshal that the act of Congress included all tobacco and cotton, 
and he was required by law to see it all destroyed He, however, 
acknowledged only martial law, and was, he said, acting under the 
instructions of the Secretary of State. What has the Secretary 
of State to do with martial law ? Is there really no Secretary of 
War? 

Near the door of the Provost Marshal's office, guarded by bay- 
oneted sentinels, there is a desk presided over by Sergeant Crow, 
who orders transportation on the cars to such soldiers as are per- 
mitted to rejoin their regiments. This Crow, a Marylander, keeps 
a little black-board hung up and notes with chalk all the regiments 
that go down the Peninsula. To day, I saw a man whom I sus- 
pected to be a Yankee spy, copy with his pencil the list of regi- 
ments; and when I demanded his purpose, he seemed confused. 
This is the kind of information Gen. McClellan can afford to pay 
for very liberally. I drew the Provost Marshal's attention to this 
matter, and he ordered a discontinuance of the practice. 

MAY HTH. Our army has fallen back to within four miles of 
Richmond. Much anxiety is felt for the fate of the city. Is there 
no turning point in this long lane of downward progress ? Truly 
it may be said, our affairs at this moment are in a critical condition. 
I trust in God, and the chivalry and patriotism of the South in the 
field. 






AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 125 

The enemy's fleet of gun-boats are ascending James River, and 
the obstructions are not completed. We have but one or two 
casemated guns in battery, but we have brave men there. 

MAY 15TH. The enemy's gun-boats, Monitor, Galena, etc. are 
at Drewry's Bluff, eight miles below the city, shelling our batteries, 
and our batteries are bravely shelling them. The President rode 
down to the vicinity this morning, and observed the firing. 

The guns are heard distinctly in the city, and yet there is no 
consternation manifested by the people. If the enemy pass the 
obstructions, the city will be, it is true, very much at their mercy. 
They may shell us out of It, and this may occur any hour. South 
of the city the enemy have no forces, and we can find refuge there. 
I suppose the government would go to Lynchburg. I shall remain 
with the array, and see that the tobacco be burnt, at all hazards, 
according to law. I have seen some of our generals, and am con- 
vinced that the Baltimore rabble, and those that direct them, will 
be suppressed, or exterminated, if they attempt to throw impedi- 
ments in the way of our soldiers in the work of destroying the 
tobacco, as enjoined by C.ongress. 

Our marksmen will keep up an incessant fire into the port-holes 
of the gun-boats; and if it be at all practicable, we will board 
them. So hope is by no means extinct. But it is apprehended, if 
the enemy get within shelling distance of the city, there will be an 
attack along our lines by McClellan. We must beat him there, as 
we could never save our guns, stores, etc. retreating across the 
river. And we will beat him, for we have 80,000 men, and more 
are coming. 

Joyful tidings ! the gun-boats have been repulsed ! A heavy 
shot from one of our batteries ranged through the Galena from 
stem to stern, making frightful slaughter, and disabling the ship ; 
and the whole fleet turned about and steamed down the river ! 
We have not lost a dozen men. We breathe freely ; and the gov- 
ernment will lose no time in completing the obstructions and 
strengthening the batteries. 

MAY 16Tn. McClellan is intrenching that is, at least, signifi- 
cant of a respite, and of apprehension of attack. 

MAY 17TH. Gen. Lee has admonished Major Griswold on the 
too free granfing of passports. Will it do any good ? 

11* 



12(> A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

MAY 18TH. All quiet to-day except the huzzas as fresh troops 
arrive. 

MAY 19TH. We await the issue before Richmond. It is still 
believed by many that it is the intention of the government and the 
generals to evacuate the city. If the enemy were to appear in 
force on the south side, and another force were to march on us 
from Fredericksburg, we should be inevitably taken, in the event 
of the loss of a battle an event I don't anticipate. Army, gov- 
ernment, and all, might, it is true, be involved in a common ruin. 
Wrote as strong a letter as I could to the President, stating what 
I have every reason to believe would be the consequences of the 
abandonment of Richmond. There would be demoralization and 
even insubordination in the army. Better die here ! With the 
exception of the business portion of the city, the enemy could not 
destroy a great many houses by bombardment. But if defeated 
and driven back, our troops would make a heroic defense in the 
streets, in the walled grave-yards, and from the windows. Better 
electrify the world by such scenes of heroism, than surrender the 
capital and endanger the cause. I besought him by every consid- 
eration, not to abandon Richmond to the enemy short of the last 
extremity. 

The legislature has also passed resolutions calling upon the C. 
S. Government to defend Richmond at all hazards, relieving the 
Confederate authorities, in advance, of all responsibility for any 
damage sustained. 

This will have its effect. It would be pusillanimous to retire 
now. 

But every preparation had been made to abandon it. The 
archives had been sent to Columbia, S. C., and to Lynchburg. 
The tracks over the bridges had been covered with plank, to facili- 
tate the passage of artillery. Mr. Randolph had told his page, 
and cousin, "you must go with my wife into the country, for to- 
morrow the enemy will be here." Trunks were packed in readi- 
ness for what ? Not one would have been taken on the cars ! 
The Secretary of the Treasury had a special locomotive and cars, 
constantly with steam up, in readiness to fly with the treasure. 

Nevertheless, many of the old secessionists have resolved not to 
leave their homes, for there were no other homes for them to fly 
to. They say they will never take the oath of allegiance to the 






AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 127 

despised government of the North, but suffer whatever penalties 
may be imposed on them. There is a sullen, but generally a calm 
expression of inflexible determination on the countenances of the 
people, .men, women, and children. But there is no consternation ; 
we have learned to contemplate death with composure. It would 
be at least an effectual escape from dishonor; and Northern 
domination is dishonor. 

MAY 20TH. The President, in response to the Legislative 
Committee, announced that Richmond would be defended. A 
thrill of joy electrifies every heart* a smile of triumph is on every 
lip. The inhabitants seem to know that their brave defenders in 
the field will prove invincible; and it is understood that Gen. Lee 
considers the city susceptible of successful defense. The ladies 
are in ecstasies. 

MAY 21 ST. There are skirmishes every day, and we can hear 
both the artillery and musketry from the hills on the outskirts of 
the city, whither some of us repair every afternoon. 

But the Provost Marshal's administration is abominable. Mr. 
Garnett, M. C.,told me that in an interview with the President, 
the latter informed him that he had just received a letter from 
Gen. Johnston, stating that the enemy not only knew everything 
going on within our lines, but seemed absolutely to know what we 
intended doing in the future, as if the most secret counsels of the 
cabinet were divulged. 

Count Mercier, the French Minister residing at Washington, 
has been here on a mysterious errand. They said it referred to 
our recognition. He had prolonged interviews with Mr. Benja- 
min. I think it was concerning tobacco. There are $60,000,000 
worth in Richmond, at French prices. For $1,000,000, Mr. 
Seward might afford to wink very hard ; and, after distributing 
several other millions, there would be a grand total profit both to 
the owners and the French Emperor. I smile at their golden ex- 
pectations, for I know they will not be realized. If one man can 
prevent it, the South shall never be betrayed for a crop of tobacco. 
This is a holy cause we are embarked in, worthy to die for. 

The British Minister, Lord Lyons, has embarked for England, 
to report to his government that "the rebellion is on its last legs," 
and must speedily succumb. He is no prophet, or the son of a 
prophet. 



128 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

MAY 22D. There is lightning in the Northwest, and the deep 
thunder of avenging guns is heard at Washington! Gen. Jack- 
son, sent thither by Gen. Lee, is sweeping everything before him, 
defeating Shields, Banks, Fremont, and one or two other .Yankee 
major generals, with his little corps d'armee! And his coadjutor, 
Ewell, is worthy of his companionship. He has swept them out 
of the valley, scattering their hosts like quails before the fowler ! 
They fly in every direction ; and the powers at Washington are 
trembling for the safety of their own capital. Glorious Jackson ! 
and he gives, as is justly due, the glory to God. 

MAY 23o. Oh, the extortioners ! Meats of all kinds are sell- 
ing at 50 cts. per pound ; butter, 75 cts. ; coffee, $1.50; tea, $10; 
boots, $30 per pair; shoes, $18; ladies' shoes, $15; shirts, $6 each. 
Houses that rented for $500 last year, are $1000 now. Boarding, 
from $30 to $40 per month. Gen. Winder has issued an order 
fixing the maximum prices of certain articles of marketing, which 
has only the effect of keeping a great many things out of market. 
The farmers have to pay the merchants and Jews their extortion- 
ate prices, and complain very justly of the partiality of the general. 
It does more harm than good. 

MAY 24TH. Every day the two armies are shelling each other, 
more or less; and every gun can be heard from the Hospital Hill, 
north of the city, whither many repair to listen. 

MAY 25TH. The enemy send up several balloons every day. 
Sometimes three can be seen at once. They are stationary, being 
fastened by ropes to trees ; and give us an idea of the extent 
of his lines. But with glasses they can not only see our camps 
around the city, but they can view every part of the city itself. 

MAY 26iH. Gen. Lee is still strengthening the army. Every 
day additional regiments are coming. We are now so strong 
that no one fears the result when the great battle takes place. 
McClellan has delayed too long, and he is doomjed to defeat. The 
tobacco savers know it well, and their faces exhibit chagrin and 
disappointment. Their fortunes will not be made this year, and so 
their reputations may be saved. 

MAY 27TH. More troops came in last night, and were marched 
to the camp at once, so that the Yankees will know nothing of it. 

MAY 28TH. Prisoners and deserters from the enemy say the 
Yankees get the Richmond papers, every day, almost as soon as 



I 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 129 

we do. This is a great advantage they possess; and it demon- 
strates the fact that the Provost Marshal has interposed no effect- 
ual barriers between us and the enemy. 

MAY 29TH. More troops are marching into the city, and Gen. 
Lee has them sent out in such manner and at such times as to 
elude the observations of even the spies. 

MAY 30TH. It is said some of the enemy's mounted pickets 
rode through the city last night ! Northern papers manifest much 
confidence in the near approach of the downfall of Richmond, and 
the end of the "rebellion." The 15th of June is the utmost limit 
allowed us for existence. A terrific storm arose yesterday ; and 
as our scouts report the left wing of the enemy on this side of the 
Chickahominy, Gen. Johnston has determined to attack it to-mor- 
row. Thank God, we are strong enough to make the attack I 

MAY 31 ST. Everybody is upon the tip-toe of expectation. It 
has been announced (in the streets !) that a battle would take place 
this day, and hundreds of men, women, and children repaired to 
the hills to listen, and possibly to see, the firing. The great storm , 
day before yesterday, it is supposed, has so swollen the Chicka- 
hominy as to prevent McClellan's left wing from retreating, and 
reinforcements from being sent to its relief. The time is well 
chosen by Gen. Johnston for the attack, but it was bad policy to 
let it be known where and when it would be made ; for, no doubt, 
McClellan was advised of our plans an hour or so after they were 
proraulged in the streets. Whose fault is this ? Johnston could 
hardly be responsible for it, because he is very reticent, and appre- 
ciates the importance of keeping his purposes concealed from the 
enemy. Surely none of his subordinates divulged the secret, for 
none but generals of division knew it. It must have been found out 
and proclaimed by some one in the tobacco interest. It is true, Mr. 
Randolph told Mr. Jacques a great battle would be'gin at 8 A.M., 
to-day ; but he would not propagate such news as that ! 

But the battle did not occur at the time specified. Gen. Hnger's 
division was not at the allotted place of attack at the time fixed 
upon. His excuse is that there was a stream to cross, and under- 
standing Gen. Longstreet was his senior in command (which is not 
the fact, however), he permitted his division to have precedence. 
All the divisions were on the ground in time but Huger's, but 
still no battle. Thousands of impatient spectators are venting 



130 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

their criticisms and anathemas, like an audience at a theater when 
some accident or disarrangement behind the scenes prevents the 
curtain from rising. 

At last, toward noon, a few guns are heard ; but it was not till 
4 P.M. that Huger's division came upon the field. Nevertheless, 
the battle began in earnest before that hour ; and we could hear 
distinctly not only the cannon but the musketry. 

The hearts of our soldiers have been inspired with heroic reso- 
lution, and their arms nerved with invincible power to overcome 
the difficulties known to be in the way. Every one is aware that 
the camp of the enemy, on this side of the Chickahominy, is almost 
impregnably intrenched; and in front of the works trees have been 
cut down and the limbs sharpened, so as to interpose every obsta- 
cle to our advance. 

Ever and anon after rapid firing of cannon, and a tremendous rat- 
tle of musketry, a pause would ensue ; and we knew what this meant 1 
A battery had been taken at the point of the bayonet, and we 
cheered accordingly. One after another, we could in this manner 
perceive the strongholds of the enemy fall into our hands. 

Toward sundown it was apparent that the intrenched camp had 
been taken ; and as the deep booming of cannon became more dis- 
tant, and the rattle of musketry less distinct, we felt certain that the 
foe was flying, and that our men were pursuing them. But we 
knew that our men would take everything they were ordered to 
take. They care not for wounds and death. This is their only 
country. But the enemy have a country to run to, and they hope 
to live, even if defeated here. If they kill all our young men, the 
old men and women, and even our children, will seize their arms 
and continue the conflict. 

At night. The ambulances are coming in with our wounded. 
They report that all the enemy's strong defenses were stormed, 
just as we could perceive from the sounds. They say that our 
brave men suffered much in advancing against the intrenchments, 
exposed to the fire of cannon and small arms, without being able 
to see the foe under their shelter ; but when they leaped over the 
breastworks and turned the enemy's guns on them, our loss was 
more than compensated. Our men were shot in front ; the enemy 
in the back and terrible was the slaughter. We got their tents, 
all standing, and a sumptuous repast that had just been served 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 131 

np when the battle began. Gen. Casey's headquarters were 
taken, and his plate and smoking viands were found on his table. 
His papers fell into our hands. We got a large amount of stores 
and refreshments, so much needed by our poor braves I There 
were boxes of lemons, oranges, brandies and wines, and all the 
luxuries of distant lands which enter the unrestricted ports of the 
United States. These things were narrated by the pale and bleed- 
ing soldiers, who smiled in triumph at their achievement. Not 
one in the long procession of ambulances uttered a complaint. 
Did they really suffer pain from their wounds ? This question was 
asked by thousands, and the reply was, "not much." Women and 
children and slaves are wending to the hospitals, with baskets of 
refreshments, lint, and bandages. Every house is offered for a 
hospital, and every matron and gentle daughter, a tender nurse. 

But how fares it with the invader ? Unable to recross the 
swollen Chickahominy, the Yankees were driven into an almost 
impenetrable swamp, where they must pass the night in water up 
to their knees. The wounded borne off by them will have no 
ministrations from their sisters and mothers, and their dead are 
abandoned on the field. If Huger had come up at the time ap- 
pointed, the enemy would have been ruined. 



CHAPTER XV. 

Huger fails again. A wounded boy. The killed and wounded. Lee 
assumes command. Lee prepares to attack McClellan Beauregard 
watches the gold. Our generals scattered. Hasty letter from Gen. Lee. 
Opening of grand battle. First day, 26th June. Second, etc. Lee's 
consummate skill. Every day for a week it rages. Streets crowded 
with Blue Jackets. McClellan retires. 

JUNE IST. The ambulances are now bringing in the enemy's 
wounded as well as our own. It is the prompting of humanity. 
They seem truly grateful for this magnanimity, as they call it ; a 
sentiment hitherto unknown to them. 

The battle was renewed to-day, but not seriously. The failure 
of Gen. Huger to lead his division into action at the time ap- 



132 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

pointed, is alleged as the only reason why the left wing of the 
enemy was not completely destroyed. But large masses of the 
enemy did cross the river, on bridges constructed for the purpose, 
and they had 50,000 men engaged against a much less number on 
our part ; and their batteries played upon us from the north batik 
of the Chickahominy. The flying foe kept under shelter of this 
fire and these guns could not be taken, as the pontoon bridge 
was defended by heavy artillery. 

All day the wounded were borne past our boarding-house in 
Third Street, to the general hospital; and hundreds, with shat- 
tered arms and slight flesh wounds, came in on foot. I saw a boy, 
not more than fifteen years old (from South Carolina), with his 
hand in a sling. He showed me his wound. A ball had entered 
between the fingers of his left hand and lodged near the wrist, 
where the flesh was much swollen. He said, smiling, "I'm going 
to the hospital just to have the ball cut out, and will then return 
to the battle-field. I can fight with my right hand." 

The detectives are jubilant to-day. They say one of their 

number, , did heroic feats of arms on the field, killing a 

Yankee colonel, and a private who came to the rescue. At all 
events, they brought in a colonel's sword, pistols, and coat, as tro- 
phies. This story is to be in the papers to-morrow ! 

JUNE 2o. Great indignation is expressed by the generals in 
the field at the tales told of the heroism of the amateur fighters. 

They say stripped a dead colonel, and was never in reach of 

the enemy's guns. Moreover, the civilians in arms kept at such a 
distance from danger that their balls fell among our own men, and 
wounded some of them 1 An order has been issued by one of the 
major-generals, that hereafter any stragglers on the field of battle 
shall be shot. No civilians are'to be permitted to be there at all, 
unless they go into the ranks. 

Gen. Johnston is wounded badly wounded, but not mortally. 
It is his misfortune to be wounded in almost every battle he fights. 
Nevertheless, he has gained a glorious victory. Our loss in killed 
and wounded will not exceed 5000 ; while the enemy's killed, 
wounded, and prisoners will not fall short of 13,000. They lost, 
besides, many guns, tents, and stores all wrung from them at the 
point of the bayonet, and in spite of their formidable abattis. 
Prisoners taken on the field say : " The Southern soldiers would 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 133 

charge into hell if there was a battery before them and they 
would take it from a legion of devils !" The moral effect of this 
victory must be great. The enemy have been taught that none of 
the engines of destruction that can be wielded against us, will pre- 
vent us from taking their batteries ; and so, hereafter, when we 
charge upon them, they might as well run away from their own 
guns. 

JUNE 3o. Gen. Lee henceforth assumes command of the 
army in person. This may be hailed as the harbinger of bright 
fortune. 

JUNE 4TH. Col. Bledsoe sent word to me to-day by my son 
that he wished to see me. When I met him he groaned as usual, 
and said the department would have to open another passport 
office, as the major-generals in the field refused to permit the rela- 
tives of the sick and wounded in the camps to pass with orders 
from Brig. -Gen. Winder or his Provost Marshal. 
JUNE STH. I reopened my office in the department. 
JUNE GTH. Gen. Winder getting wind of what was going on, 
had an interview, first with Mr. Benjamin, who instructed him 
what to say ; and then bringing forward the Provost Marshal, they 
had a rather stormy interview with Mr. Randolph, who, as usual, 
yielded to their protestations against having two passport offices, 
while martial law existed. 

And so Col. Bledsoe came in and told me to "shut up shop." 
The Secretary had revoked his order. 

JUNE 7TH. But business is in a great measure suspended, and 
so I have another holiday. 

JUNE STH. I learn that Col. Bledsoe has to grant passports 
to the army, as the pickets have been instructed to let no one pass 
upon the order of Gen. Winder or his Provost Marshal. 

JUNE 9TH. It is now apparent that matters were miserably 
managed on the battle-field, until Gen. Lee assumed command 
in person. Most of the trophies of the victory, and thousands of 
arms, stores, etc. were pillaged by the promiscuous crowds of 
aliens and Jews who purchased passports thither from the Provost 
' Marshal's detectives. 

JUNE 10TH. Col. Bledsoe sent for me again. This time he 
wanted me to take charge of the letter room, and superintend the 
young gentlemen who briefed the letters. This I did very cheer- 

12 



134 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

fully ; I opened all the letters, and sent to the Secretary the im- 
portant ones immediately. These, for want of discrimination, had 
sometimes been suffered to remain unnoticed two or three days, 
when they required instant action. 

JUNE HTH, 12xH. Gen. Smith, the New York street com- 
missioner, had been urged as commander-in-chief. 

JUNE 13TH. Gen. Lee is satisfied with the present posture of 
affairs and McClellan has no idea of attacking us now. He don't 
say what he means to do himself. 

JUNE 14TH. The wounded soldiers bless the ladies, who nurse 
them unceasingly. 

JUNE 15TH. What a change ! No one now dreams of the loss 
of the capital. 

JUNE 17iH. It is not yet ascertained what amount of ordnance 
stores we gained from the battle. 

JUNE 18TH. Lee is quietly preparing to attack McClellan. 
The President, who was on the battle-field, is very cheerful. 

JUNE 19TH. To-day so many applications were made to the 
Secretary himself for passports to the armies, and beyond the lines 
of the Confederate States, that, forgetting the revocation of his 
former order, he sent a note into the Assistant Secretary, saying 
he thought a passport agent had been appointed to attend to such 
cases ; and he now directed that it be done. Bledsoe came to me 
immediately, and said : " Jones, you'll have to open a passport 
office again I shall sign no more." 

JUNE 20TH. Moved once more into the old office. 

JUNE 21sT. Gen. Beauregard is doubly doomed. A few weeks 
ago, when the blackness of midnight brooded over our cause, 
there were some intimations, I know not whether they were well 
founded, that certain high functionaries were making arrange- 
ments for a flight to France ; and Gen. Beauregard getting inti- 
mation of an order to move certain sums in bullion in the custody 
of an Assistant Treasurer in his military department, forbid its 
departure until he could be certain that it was not destined to 
leave the Confederacy. I have not learned its ultimate destina- 
tion ; but the victory of the Seven Pines intervening, Gen. Beaure- ' 
gard has been relieved of his command, " on sick leave." But I 
know his army is to be commanded permanently by Gen. Bragg. 
There are charges against Beauregard. It is said the Yankee 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 135 

army might have been annihilated at Shiloh, if Beauregard had 
fought a little longer. 

JUNE 23D. And Gen. Johnston. I learn, has had his day. 
And Magroder is on "sick leave." He is too open in his censures 
of the late Secretary of War. But Gen. Huger comes off scot- 
free ; he has always had the confidence of Mr. Benjamin, and used 
to send the flag of truce to Fortress Monroe as often as could be 
desired. 

JUNE 24TH. Gen. Lee's plan works like a charm i Although 
I have daily orders from Mr. Randolph to send persons beyond 
our lines, yet the precautions of Lee most effectually prevent 
any spies from knowing, anything about his army. Even the 
Adjutant-General, S. Cooper, don't know how many regiments are 
ordered into Virginia, or where they are stationed. Officers re- 
turning from furlough, cannot ascertain in the Adjutant-General's 
office where their regiments are ! They are referred to me for 
passports to Gen. Lee's headquarters. No man with a passport 
from Gen. Winder, or from his Provost Marshal, can pass the 
pickets of Gen. Lee's army. This is the harbinger of success, 
and I predict a career of glory for Lee, and for our country ! 
There are some vague rumCrs about the approach of Stonewall 
Jackson's army ; but no one knows anything about it, and but few 
believe it. Recent Northern papers say he is approaching Win- 
chester, and I see they are intrenching in the valley to guard 
against his terrible blows. This is capital 1 And our people are 
beginning to fear there will be no more fighting around Rich- 
mond until McClellau digs his way to it. The moment fighting 
ceases, our people have fits of gloom and despondency ; but when 
they snuff battle in the breeze, they are animated with confidence. 
They regard victory as a matter of course ; and are only indignant 
at our long series of recent reverses, when they reflect that our 
armies have so seldom been led against the embattled hosts of the 
enemy. 

JUNE 25TH. The people of Louisiana .are protesting strongly 
Hirain>t permitting Gen. Lovell to remain in command in that 
State, since the fall of New Orleans (which I omitted to note in 
regular order in these chronicles), and they attribute that dis- 
graceful event, some to his incompetency, and others to treason. 
These remonstrances come from such influential parties, I think 



136 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

the President must listen to them. Yes, a Massachusetts man 
(they say Gen. L. came from Boston) was in command of the 
troops of New Orleans when that great city surrendered without 
firing a gun. And this is one of the Northern generals who came 
over to our side after the battle of Manassas. 

JUNE 26TH. To-day a letter, hastily written by Gen. Lee to 
the Secretary of War, stated that his headquarters would be at 

, or beyond that point, whence couriers could find him if there 

should be anything of importance the Secretary might desire to 
communicate during the day. This is the day of battle! Jack- 
son is in the rear of McClellan's right wing ! I sent this note to 
the Secretary at once. I suppose Mr. Randolph had been pre- 
viously advised of Gen. Lee's intention to fight to-day ; but I do 
not know it. I know some of the brigadier-generals in the army 
do not know it ; although they have all been ordered to their 
commands. This is no uncommon order; but it is characteristic 
of Lee's secretiveness to keep all of his officers in profound igno- 
rance of his intentions, except those he means to be engaged. The 
enemy cannot possibly have any intimation of his purpose, be- 
cause the spies here have no intelligence ; and none are permitted 
to pass the rear, pickets in sight of the city without my passport. 
What a change since the last battle ! 

To-day, in compliance with an intimation of the President, all 
in the departments, who felt so -disposed, formed a military organ- 
ization for the defense of the city, and especially of the archives, 
which had been brought back since the assumption of command 
by Gen. Lee. Col. Bledsoe denounced the organization as a hum- 
bug! Defending the government, or readiness to defend it, in 
such times as these, is no humbug 1 In the fluctuations of a great 
battle, almost in the suburbs of the city, a squadron of the enemy's 
horse might penetrate even to the office of the Chief Executive, 
when a few hundred muskets, in the hands of old men and boys, 
might preserve the papers. 

After dinner I repaired, with Custis and a few friends, to my 
old stand on the hill north of the Jews' Cemetery, and sat down 
in the shade to listen. Many persons were there as usual for 
every day some firing could be heard who said, in response to 
my inquiries, that distant guns had been heard in the direction of 
the Pamunky River. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 137 

"That is Jackson!" I exclaimed, as the sounds were distinctly 
discerned bylmyself; "and he is in their rear, behind their right 
wing!" 

All were incredulous, and some doubted whether he was within 
a hundred miles of us. But the sounds grew more distinct* and 
more frequent, and I knew he was advancing. But how long 
could he advance in that direction without being overwhelmed ? 
Everywhere else along the line a deathlike silence reigned, that 
even the dropping fire of the pickets, usually so incessant, could 
be heard. 

This suspense continued only a few minutes. Two guns were 
then heard northeast of us, and in such proximity as to startle 
some of the anxious listeners. These were followed by three or 
four more, and then the fire continued with increasing rapidity. 
This was Gen. A. P. Hill's division in front of the enemy's right 
wing, and Lee's plan of battle was developed. Hill was so near 
us as to be almost in sight. The drums and fifes of his regiments, 
as they marched up to the point of attack, could be easily heard ; 
how distinctly, then, sounded his cannon in our ears! And the 
enemy's guus, pointed in the direction of the city, were as plainly 
discerned. I think McClellan is taken by surprise. 

One gentleman, who had been incredulous on the subject of 
a battle to-day, held his watch in his hand ten minutes, during 
which time one hundred and ninety guns were heard. Saying he 
believed a battle was in progress, he replaced the watch in his 
pocket, and sat down on the ground to listen. 

Another hour, and the reports come with the rapidity of seconds, 
or 3600 per hour ! And now, for the first time, we hear the rattle 
of small arms. And lo! two guns farther to the right, from 
Longstreet's division, I suppose. And they were followed by 
others. This is Lee's grand plan of battle : Jackson first, then 
Hill, then Longstreet time and distance computed with mathe- 
matical precision ! The enemy's balloons are not up now. They 
know what is going on, without further investigations up in the 
air. The business is upon earth, where many a Yankee will 
breathe his last this night ! McClellan must be thunderstruck at 
this unexpected opening of a decisive battle. Our own people, 
and even our own general officers, except those who were to 
participate in the attack, were uninformed of Lee's grand pur- 

12* 



138 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

pose, until the booming of Jackson's guns were heard far on our 
left. 

As the shades of evening fall, ^he fire seems to increase in 
rapidity, and a gentle breeze rising as the stars come out, billows 
of smoke are wafted from the battle-field. And now, occasionally, 
we can distinctly see the bursting of shells in the air, aimed too 
high by the enemy, and exploding far this side of our line of 
battle. 

Darkness is upon us, save the glimmer of the stars, as the sul- 
phurous clouds sink into the humid valleys. But the flashes of 
the guns are visible on the horizon, followed by the deep intona- 
tions of the mighty engines of destruction, echoing and reverber- 
ating from hill to hill, arid through the vast valley of the James 
in the rear. 

Hundreds of men, women, and children were attracted to the 
heights around the city to behold the spectacle. From the Capitol 
and from the President's mansion, the vivid flashes of artillery 
could be seen ; but no one doubted the result. It is'only silence 
and inaction we dread. The firing ceased at nine o'clock P.M. 
The President was on the field, but did not interfere with Lee. 

JUNE 27TH. At the first dawn of day, the battle recommenced, 
farther round to the east. This was enough. The enemy had 
drawn in his right wing. And courier after courier announced the 
taking of his batteries by our brave defenders ! But the battle rages 
loud and long, and the troops of Jackson's corps, like the march 
of Fate, still upon McClellan's right flank and rear. Jackson's 
horse, and the gallant Stuart, with his irresistible cavalry, have 
cut the enemy's communications with their base on the Pamunky. 
It is said they are burning their stores ! 

What genius ! what audacity in Lee ! He has absolutely taken 
the greater portion of his army to the north side of the Chicka- 
hominy, leaving McClellan's center and left wing on the south 
side, with apparently easy access to the city. This is (to the 
invaders) impenetrable strategy. The enemy believes Lee's main 
forces are here, and will never think of advancing. We have so 
completely closed the avenues of intelligence that the enemy has 
not been able to get the slightest intimation of our strength or the 
dispositions of our forces. 

JUNE 28TH. The President publishes a dispatch from Lee, 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 139 

announcing a victory ! The enemy has been driven from all his 
intrenchments, losing many batteries. 

Yesterday the President's life was saved by Lee. Every day 
he rides out near the battle-field, in citizen's dress, marking the 
fluctuations of the conflict, but assuming no direction of affairs in 
the field. Gen. Lee, however, is ever apprised of his position ; 
and once, when the enemy were about to point one of their most 
powerful batteries in the direction of a certain farm-house oc- 
cupied by the President, Lee sent a courier in haste to inform him 
of it. No sooner had the President escaped than a storm of shot 
and shell riddled the house. 

Some of the people still think that their military President is 
on the field directing every important movement in person. A 
gentleman told me to-day, that he met the President yesterday, 
and the day before, alone, in the lanes and orchards, near the bat- 
tle-field. He issued no orders ; but awaited results like the rest 
of us, praying fervently for abundant success. 

To-day some of our streets are crammed with thousands of blue- 
jackets Yankee prisoners. There are many field officers, and 
among them several generals. 

General Reynolds, who surrendered with his brigade, was thus 
accosted by one of our functionaries, who knew him before the 
war began : 

" General, this is in accordance with McClellan's prediction ; 
you are in Richmond." 

" Yes, sir," responded the general, in bitterness ; " and d n me, 
if it is not precisely in the manner I anticipated." 

" Where is McClellan, general ?" 

"I know not exactly; his movements have been so frequent of 
late. But I think it probable he too may be here before night!" 

" I doubt that," said his fellow-prisoner, Gen. McCall; "beware 
of your left wing ! Who commands there ?" 

" Gen. Jackson." 

" Stonewall Jackson ? Is he in this fight ? Was it really 
Jackson making mince-meat of our right ? Then your left wing 
is safe !" 

Four or five thousand prisoners have arrived. 

JUNE 29TH. The battle still rages. But the scene has shifted 
farther to the east. The enemy's array is now entirely on this 



140 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

side of the Chickahominy. McCtellau is doggedly retiring toward 
the James River. 

JUNE 30TH. Once more all men are execrating Gen. Huger. 
It is alleged that he again failed to obey an order, and kept his 
division away from the position assigned it, which would have 
prevented the escape of McClellan. If this be so, who is re- 
sponsible, after his alleged misconduct at the battle of the Seven 
Pines ? 



CHAPTER XVI. 

Terrific fighting. Anxiety to visit the battle-field. Lee prepares for other 
battles. Hope for the Union extinct. Gen. Lee brings forward con- 
scripts Gen. Cobb appointed to arrange exchange of prisoners. Mr. 
Ould as agent. Pope, the braggart, comes upon the stage. Meets a 
braggart's fate. The war transferred to Northern Virginia. 

JULY IST. To-day Gen. Magruder led his division into action 
at Malvern Hill, it is said, contrary to the judgment of other com- 
manders. The enemy's batteries commanded all the approaches 
in most advantageous position, and fearful was the slaughter. A 
wounded soldier, fresh from the field to-night, informs me that our 
loss in killed in this engagement will amount to as many as have 
fallen in all the others combined. 

JULY 2o. More fighting to-day. The enemy, although their 
batteries were successfully defended last night at Malvern Hill, 
abandoned many guns after the charges ceased, and retreated 
hastily. The grand army of invasion is now some twenty-five 
miles from the city, and yet the Northern papers claim the victory. 
They say it was a masterly strategic movement of McClellan, and 
a premeditated change of base from the Pamunky to the James ; 
and that he will certainly take Richmond in a week and end the 
rebellion. 

JULY 3D. Our wounded are now coming in fast, under the di- 
rection of the Ambulance Committee. I give passports to no one 
not having legitimate business on the field to pass the pickets of 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 141 

the array. There is no pilfering on this field of battle ; no " Plug 
Ugly" detectives stripping dead colonels, and, Falstaff like, claim- 
ing to be made "either Earl or Duke" for killing them. 

So great is the demand for vehicles that the brother of a North 
Carolina major, reported mortally wounded, paid $100 for a hack 
to bring his brother into the city. He returned with him a few 
hours after, and, fortunately, found him to be not even dangerously 
wounded. 

I suffer no physicians not belonging to the army to go upon the 
battle-field without taking amputating instruments with them, and 
no private vehicle without binding the drivers to bring in two or 
more of the wounded. 

There are fifty hospitals in the city, fast filling with the sick and 
wounded. I have seen men in my office and walking in the streets, 
whose arms have been amputated within the last three days. The 
realization of a great victory seems to give them strength. . 

JULY 4Tii. Lee does not follow up his blows on the whipped 
enemy, and some sage critics censure him for it. But he knows 
that the fatal blow has been dealt this "grand array" of the North. 
The serpent has been killed, though its tail still exhibits some spas- 
modic motions. It will die, so far as the Peninsula is concerned, 
after sunset, or when it thunders. 

The commanding general neither sleeps nor slumbers. Already 
the process of reorganizing Jackson's corps has been commenced 
for a blow at or near the enemy's capital. Let Lincoln beware the 
hour of retribution. 

The enemy's losses in the seven days' battles around Richmond, 
in killed, wounded, sick, and desertions, are estimated at 50,000 
men, and their losses in cannon, stores, etc., at some $50,000,000. 
Their own papers say the work is to be begun anew, and subju- 
gation is put off six months, which is equivalent to a loss of 
$500,000,000 inflicted by Lee's victory. 

By their emancipation and confiscation measures, the Yankees 
have made this a war of extermination, and added new zeal and 
resolution to our brave defenders. All hope of a reconstruction 
of the Union is relinquished by the few, comparatively, in the South, 
who still clung to the delusion. It is well. If the enemy had pur- 
sued a different course we should never have had the same una- 
nimity. If they had made war only on men in arms, and spared 



142 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

private property, according to the usages of civilized nations, 
there would, at least, have been a neutral party in the South, 
and never the same energy and determination to contest the last 
inch of soil with the cruel invader. Now they will find that 
3,000,000 of troops cannot subjugate us, and if subjugated, that 
a standing array of half a million would be required to keep us in 
subjection. 

JULY STH Gen. Lee is bringing forward the conscript regi- 
ments with rapidity; and so large are his powers that the Secre- 
tary of War has but little to do. He is, truly, but a mere clerk. 
The correspondence is mostly referred to the different bureaus for 
action, whose experienced heads know what should be done much 
better than Mr. Randolph could tell them. 

JULY BTH. Thousands of fathers, brothers, mothers, and sisters 
of the wounded are arriving in the city to attend their suffering 
relations, and to recover the remains of those who were slain. 

JULY TTH. Gen. Huger has been relieved of his command. 
He retains his rank and pay as major-general "of ordnance." 

Gen. Pope, Yankee, has been assigned to the command of the 
army of invasion in Northern Virginia, and Gen. Halleck has 
been made commanding general, to reside in Washington. Good I 
The Yankees are disgracing McClellan, the best general they 
have. 

JULY STH. Glorious Col. Morgan has dashed into Kentucky, 
whipped everything before him, and got off unharmed. He had 
but little over a thousand men, and captured that number of pris- 
oners. Kentucky will rise in a few weeks. 

JULY 9iH. Lee has turned the tide, and I shall not be surprised 
if we have a long career of successes. Bragg, and Kirby Smith, 
and Loring are in motion at last, and Tennessee and Kentucky, 
and perhaps Missouri, will rise again in "Rebellion." 

JULY IGTH. I forgot to note in its place a feat of Gen. 
Stuart and his cavalry, before the recent battles. He made a com- 
plete girdle around the enemy, destroying millions of their property, 
and returned without loss. He was reconnoitering for Jackson, 
who followed in his track. This made Stuart major-general. 

I likewise omitted to note the death of the brave Gen. Ashby, 
who fell in one of Jackson's brilliant battles in the Valley. But 
history will do him justice. TMy chronicles are designed to assist 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 1 43 

history, and to supply the smaller incidents and details which the 
grand historian would be likely to omit] 

JULY HTH. Gen. Howell Cobb has been sent down the river 
under flag of truce to negotiate a cartel with Gen. Dix for the ex- 
change of prisoners. It was decided that the exchange should be 
conducted on the basis agreed to between the United States and 
the British Government during the war of 1812, and all men taken 
hereafter will be released on parole within ten days after their cap- 
ture. We have some 8000 prisoners in this city, and altogether, 
I dare say, a larger number than the enemy have of our men. 

JULY 12TH. Mr. Ould has been appointed agent to effect ex- 
changes of paroled men. He is also acting as judge advocate. 

JULY 13TH. We have some of Gen. Pope's proclamations and 
orders. He is simply a braggart, and will meet a braggart's fate. 
He announces his purpose to subsist his army in our country, and 
moreover, he intends to shoot or hang our non-combating citizens- 
that may fall into his hands, in retaliation for the killing of any of 
his thieving and murdering soldiers by our avenging guerrillas. He 
says his headquarters will be on his horse, and that he will make 
no provision for retreat. That he has been accustomed to see the 
backs of his enemies ! Well, we shall see how he will face a Stone- 
wall! 

JULY HTH. Jackson and Ewell and Stuart are after Pope, but 
I learn they are not allowed to attempt any enterprise for some 
weeks yet. Fatal error, I fear. For we have advices at the de- 
partment that Pope has not now exceeding 20,000 men, but that 
all the rolling stock of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad is ordered 
West to bring reinforcements. Besides, the United States Gov- 
ernment is calling for 600,000 additional men. Then again, Mc- 
Clellan and Burnside will form a junction with Pope, and we will 
be outnumbered. But the President and Gen. Lee know best what 
is to be done. We have lost many of the flower of Southern 
chivalry in the late conflicts. 

JULY 15TH Gen Pendleton has given McClellan a scare, and 
might have hurt him if he had fired lower. He planted a number 
of batteries (concealed) on the south side of the river, just oppo- 
site the enemy's camp. The river was filled with gun-boats and 
transports. At a signal, all the guns were fired, at short range, 
too, for some minutes with great rapidity, and then the batteries 



144 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

were withdrawn. I happened to be awake, and could not conjee- 
tare what the rutrfpus meant. But we fired too high in the dark, 
and did but little execution. Our shells fell beyond the enemy's 
camp on the opposite side of the river. We lost a few men, by 
accident, mostly. But hereafter in "each bush they fear an officer." 

JULY 16TH. Gen. Lee is hurrying up reinforcements from the 
South, old regiments and conscripts, and pays very little attention 
to McClellan on the Peninsula, knowing no further enterprises 
will be attempted by the enemy in that quarter for some time to 
come. 

JULY HTH. The people are too jubilant, I fear, over our 
recent successes near the city. A great many skulkers from the 
army are seen daily in the streets, and it is said there are 3000 
men here subject to conscript duty, who have not been enrolled. 
The business of purchasing substitutes is prevailing alarmingly. 

JULY 18TH. To-day several ladies applied in person to the 
Secretary of War for passports to Norfolk and Baltimore, and he 
sent me written orders to grant them. They next applied to Gen. 
Winder to go with the flag of truce, exhibiting their passports. 
He repudiated them, however, and sent the ladies back to me, say- 
ing he wanted something with the Secretary's signature, showing 
me to be authorized to sign them. I wrote such a note as I sup- 
posed he wanted, and the Secretary signed it as follows : 

"RICHMOND, July 18th, 1862. 

"BRIG. -GEN. J. H. WINDER. 

"SiR : The passports issued by J. B. Jones from this Depart- 
ment to pass the lines of the Confederate armies, and the lines of 
the Confederate States, are granted by my direction, evidences of 
which are on file in the Passport Office. 
"Respectfully, 

" G. W. RANDOLPH, 

"Secretary of War." 

This, one of the ladies delivered to him. I hope I am now done 
with Gen. Winder and his "Plug Ugly" dynasty. 

JULY 19TH. This morning early, while congratulating myself 
on the evidence of some firmness and independence in the new 
Secretary, I received the following note: 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 145 

"RICHMOND, July 19th, 1862. 
" Mr. J. B. JONES. 

" SIR : I have just been directed by the Secretary of War that 
he has turned over the whole business of passports to Gen. Win- 
der, and that applications for passports will not be received at this 

office at all. 

" Very respectfully, 

"A. G. BLEDSOE, 

"Asst. Sec. War." 

Of course I ceased operations immediately. So large a con- 
course of persons now accumulated in the hall, that it was soon 
necessary to put up a notice that Gen. Winder would grant them 
passports. But the current set back again. Gen. Winder refused 
to issue passports to the relatives of the sick and wounded in the 
camps, well knowing the generals, his superiors in rank, would not 
recognize his authority. He even came into the department, and 
tore down the notice with his own hands. 

JULY 20TH. I am back again, signing passports to the army. 
But yesterday, during the interregnum, the Beaverdam Depot was 
burnt by the enemy, information of its defenseless condition hav- 
ing been given by a Jew peddler, who obtained no passport from 
me. 

JULY 21sT. A Marylander, a lieutenant employed by Gen. 
Winder to guard the prisoners (the generals and other high 
Yankee officers), came to me to-day, with a friend who had 
just arrived from Baltimore, and demanded passports to visit 
Drewry's Bluff, for the purpose of inspecting the defenses. I 
refused, fearing he might (I did not like his face) have been cor- 
rupted by his prisoners. He said very significantly that he would 
go in spite of me. This I reported to the Assistant Adjutant- 
General, and also wrote a note to Gen. Wise, to examine him 
closely if he came within his lines. 

JULY 22D. To-day Gen. Winder came into my office in a pas- 
sion with a passport in his hand which I had given, a week before, 
to Mr. Collier, of Petersburg, on the order of the Assistant Secretary 
of War threatening me with vengeance and the terrors of Castle 
Godwin, his Bastile ! if I granted any more passports to Peters- 
burg where he was military commander, that city being likewise 

13 



146 A REBEL. WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

under martial law. I simply uttered a defiance, and he departed, 
boiling over with rage. 

JULY 23r. To-day I received the following note from the 
Secretary : 

"JULY 23D, 1862. 
" J. B. JONES, ESQ. 

" SIR : You will not issue passports except to persons going to 
the camps near Richmond. 

"Passports elsewhere will be granted by Brig.-Gen. Winder. 
"Respectfully, 

" GEO. W. RANDOLPH, 

"Secretary of War." 

JULY 24TH. Already the flood-gates of treasonable intelli- 
gence flowing North seem to be thrown wide open. The Balti- 
more papers contain a vast amount of information concerning our 
condition, movements in progress, and projected enterprises. And 
to crown all, these rascals publish in the same papers the passports 
given them by Gen. Winder. I doubt not they are sold by the 
detectives, Winder being ignorant. 

JULY 25TH. More Northern papers received to-day, 'contain- 
ing news from the South. Most fortunately, they can know no- 
thing reliable of what is passing within Gen. Lee's lines. The 
responsibility of keeping his gates closed against spies rests in a 
great measure on myself, and I endeavor to keep even our own 
people in profound ignorance of what transpires there. 

JULY 26TH. There is a pause in the depreciation of C. S. secu- 
rities. 

JULY 2TTH. Gen. Lovell, it is said, will be tried by a court- 
martial. The same has been said of Generals Magruder and 
Huger. But I doubt it. 

JULY 28TH. The Examining Board of Surgeons, established 
by the Secretary of War, has been abolished by order of Gen. Lee. 
It was the only idea of the Secretary yet developed, excepting the 
"handing over" of the "whole business of passports to Gen. 
Winder." 

JULY 29TH. Pope's army, reatly reinforced, are committing 
shocking devastations in Culpepper and Orange Counties. His 
brutal orders, and his bragging proclamations, have wrought our 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 147 

men to such a pitch of exasperation that, when the day of battle 
comes, there will be, must be terrible slaughter. 

JULY 30TH. Both Gen. Jackson and Gen. Stuart were in the 
department to-day. Their commands have preceded them, and 
must be near Orange C. H. by this time. These war-worn heroes 
(neither of them over forty years of age) attracted much attention. 
Everybody wished to see them; and if they had lingered a few 
minutes longer in the hall, a crowd would have collected, cheer- 
ing to the echo. This they avoided, transacting their business in 
the shortest possible space of time, and then escaping observation. 
They have yet much work to do. 

JULY 3lsT. Gen. Breckinridge has beaten the Yankees at 
Baton Rouge, but without result, as we have no co-operating fleet. 



CHAPTER XVII. 

Vicksburg shelled. Lee looks toward Washington. Much mano3iivring in 
Orange County. A brigade of the enemy annihilated. McClcllan flies 
to Washington. Cretans. Lee has a mighty army. Missouri risings. 
Pope's coat and papers captured. Cut up at Manassas. Clothing cap- 
tured of the enemy. 

AUGUST IST. Vicksburg has triumphantly withstood the shell- 
ing of the enemy's fleet of gun-boats. This proves that New Or- 
leans might have^een successfully defended, and could have been 
held to this day by Gen. Lovell. So, West Point is not always 
the best criterion of one's fitness to command. 

AUGUST 2o. The Adjutant- General, "by order" (I suppose 
of the President), is annulling, one after another, all Gen. Winder's 
despotic orders. 

AUGUST 3o. There is a rumor that McClellan is "stealing 
away" from his new base! and Burnside has gone up the Rappa- 
hannock to co-operate with Pope in his "march to Richmond." 

AUGUST 4TH. Lee is making herculean efforts for an "on to 
Washington," while the enemy think he merely designs a defense 



148 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

of Richmond. Troops are on the move, all the way from Florida 
to Gordonsville. 

AUGUST STH. The enemy have postponed drafting, that com- 
pulsory mode of getting men being unpopular, until after the 
October elections. I hope Lee will make the most of his time, 
and annihilate their drilled and seasoned troops. He can put 
more fighting men in Virginia than the enemy, during the next 
two months. "Now's the day, and now's the hour 1" 

AUGUST GTH. Jackson is making preparations to fight. I know 
the symptoms. He has made Pope believe he's afraid of him. 

AUGUST 7TH. Much incomprehensible manoeuvring is going on 
in Orange County. 

AUGUST STH. We hear of skirmishing in Orange County, and 
the enemy seem as familiar with the paths and fords as our own 
people; hence some surprises, attempted by our cavalry, have 
failed. 

AUGUST 9TH. Jackson and Ewell are waiting and watching. 
Pope will expose himself soon. 

AUGUST 10TH. Jackson struck Pope yesterday ! It was a 
terrible blow, for the numbers engaged. Several thousand of the 
enemy were killed, wounded, and taken prisoners. Among the 
latter is Gen. Prince, who arrived in this city this morning. He 
affected to be ignorant of Pope's brutal orders, and of the Presi- 
dent's retaliatory order concerning the commissioned officers of 
Pope's army taken in battle. When Prince was informed that he 
and the fifty or sixty others taken with him were not to be treated 
as prisoners of war, but as felons, he vented his execrations upon 
Pope. They were sent into close confinement. 

AUGUST HTH. Our killed, wounded, and captured did not 
amount to more than 600. We might have captured a whole 
brigade at one time during the battle, but did not. They charged 
our batteries, not perceiving a brigade of our own lying concealed 
just in the rear of the guns: so, when they advanced, shouting, to 
within thirty yards of our troops, they rose and "let them have 
it." Nine-tenths of the enemy fell, and the rest were soon dis- 
patched, before they could get away. One of their dying officers 
said they would have surrendered to us, if we had demanded it. 
He was reminded of Pope's beastly orders, and died with a horri- 
ble groan. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 149 

AUGUST 12TH. Pope claims a victory! So did McClellan. 
But truth will rise, in spite of everything. I will not quote Bry- 
ant literally, because he is an enemy in this war, and falsifies his 
own precepts. 

AUGUST 13TH. McClellan is gone, bag and baggage, abandon- 
ing his "6ase;" to attain which, he said he had instituted his 
magnificent strategic movements, resulting in an unmolested re- 
treat from the Peninsula and flight to Washington, for the defense 
of his own capital. So the truth they crushed to earth on the 
Chickahominy has risen again, and the Yankees, like the Cretans, 
are to be known henceforth as a nation of liars. 

AUGUST HTH. Lee has gone up the country to command in 
person. Now let Lincoln beware, for there is danger. A mighty 
army, such as Napoleon himself would have been proud to com- 
mand, is approaching his capital. This is the triumph Lee has 
been providing for, while the nations of the earth are hesitating 
whether or not to recognize our independence. 

AUGUST 15iH. Moved my office to an upper story of the Bank 
of Virginia, where the army intelligence office is located an office 
that keeps a list of the sick and wounded. 

AUGUST 16TH. We have intelligence from the West of a si- 
multaneous advance of several of our columns. Thil is the work 
of Lee. May God grant that our blows be speedy and effectual 
in hurling back the invader from our soil ! 

AUGUST 17iH. We have also news from Missouri of indica- 
tions of an uprising which will certainly clear the State of the 
few Federal troops remaining there. The draft will accelerate 
the movement. And then if we get Kentucky, as I think we 
must, we shall add a hundred thousand to our army I 

AUGUST 18TH. From Texas, West Louisiana, and Arkansas, 
we shall soon have tidings. The clans are gathering, and 20,000 
more, half mounted on hardy horses, will soon be marching for 
the prairie country of the enemy. Glorious Lee ! and glorious 
Jackson ! They are destined to roll the dark clouds away from 
the horizon. 

AUGUST 19iH. Day and night our troops are marching; they 
are now beyond the right wing of Pope, and will soon be accumu- 
lated there in such numbers as to defy the combined forces of Pope, 
Buruside, and McClellan ! 

13* 



150 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

AUGUST 20TH. We have now a solution of the secret of Pope's 
familiarity with the country. His guide and pilot is the identi- 
cal Robt. Stewart who was sent here to the Provost Marshal a 
prisoner. How did he get out ? They say money did it. 

AUGUST 2isT. Some apprehensions are felt by a few for the 
safety of this city, as it is supposed that all the troops have been 
withdrawn. This is not so, however. From ten to fifteen thou- 
sand men could be concentrated here in twenty-four hours. Rich- 
mond is not in half the danger that Washington is. 

AUGUST 22o. Saw Yice-President Stephens to day, as cordial 
and enthusiastic as ever. 

AUGUST 23u. Members of Congress are coming to my office 
every day, getting passports for their constituents. Those I have 
seen (Senator Brown, of Mississippi, among the rest) express a 
purpose not to renew the act, to expire on the 18th September, au- 
thorizing martial law. 

AUGUST 24TH. In both Houses of Congress they are thunder- 
ing away at Gen. Winder's Provost Marshal and his Plug Ugly 
alien policemen. Senator Brown has been very bitter against 
them. 

AUGUST 25iH. Mr. Russell has reported a bill which would 
give us martial law in such a modified form as to extract its 
venom. 

AUGUST 26TH. Mr. Russell's bill will not pass. The machinery 
of legislation works too slowly. 

Fredericksburg has been evacuated by the enemy ! It is said the 
Jews rushed in and baught boots for $7. 00, which they now demand 
$25.00 for, and so with various other articles of merchandise. 
They are now investing money in real estate for the first time, 
which is evidence that they have no faith in the ultimate redemp- 
tion of Confederate money. 

AUGUST 27TH. Huzza for Gen. Stuart! He has made another 
circumvention of the enemy, getting completely in Pope's rear, 
and destroying many millions worth of stores, etc. 

AUGUST 28TH. Pope's coat was captured, and all his papers. 
The braggart is near his end. 

AUGUST 29TH. Bloody fighting is going on at Manassas. All 
the news is good for us. It appears that Pope, in his consummate 
egotism, refused to believe that he had been outwitted, and "pitched 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 151 

into" oar corps and divisions, believing them to be merely brigades 
and regiments. He has been terribly cut up. 

AUGUST 30TH. Banks, by the order of Pope, has burnt 400 
Yankee cars loaded with quartermaster's and commissary stores. 
But our soldiers have fared sumptuously on the enemy's provisions, 
and captured clothing enough for half the army. 

AUGUST 31sT. Fighting every day at Manassas. 



CHAPTER XVIII. 

Lee announces a victory. Crosses the Potomac. Battle of Sharpsburg. 
McClellan pauses at the Potomac. Lee moves mysteriously. The cam- 
paign a doubtful one in its material results. Horrible scene near Wash- 
ington. Conscription enlarged. Heavy loss at Sharpsburg. 10,000 in 
the hospitals here. 

SEPTEMBER IST. Official dispatches from Lee, announcing a 
" signal victory," by the blessing of God, " over the combined 
forces of the enemy." That is glory enough for a week. When 
Lee says " signal victory," we know exactly what it means, and we 
breathe freely. Our generals never modify their reports of vic- 
tories. They see and know the extent of what has been done 
before they speak of it, and they never mislead by exaggerated ac- 
counts of successes. 

SEPTEMBER 2o. Winchester is evacuated ! The enemy fled, 
and left enough ordnance stores for a campaign I It was one of 
their principal depots. 

SEPTEMBER 3D. We lament the fall of Swell not killed, but 
his leg has been amputated. The enemy themselves report the 
loss, in killed and wounded, of eight generals! And Lee says, 
up to the time of writing, he had paroled 7000 prisoners, taken 
10,000 stand of small arms, 50 odd cannon, and immense stores ! 

SEPTEMBER 4TH. The enemy's loss in the series of battles, in 
killed, wounded, and prisoners, is estimated at 30,000. Where is 
the braggart Pope now ? Disgraced eternally, deprived of his com- 



152 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

mand by his own government, and sent to Minnesota to fight the 
Indians ! Savage in his nature, he is only fit to fight with savages ! 

SEPTEMBER 5xn Our army knows no rest. But I fear this 
incessant marching and fighting may prove too much for many of 
the tender boys. 

SEPTEMBER 6TH. We have authentic accounts of our army 
crossing the Potomac without opposition. 

SEPTEMBER ITH. We see by the Northern papers that Pope 
claimed a great victory over Lee and Jackson ! It was too much 
even for the lying editors themselves ! The Federal army being 
hurled back on the Potomac, and then compelled to cross it, it was 
too transparently ridiculous for the press to contend for the vic- 
tory. And now they confess to a series of defeats from the 26th 
June to the culminating calamity of the 30th August. They ac- 
knowledge they have been beaten badly beaten but they will not 
admit that our army has crossed into Maryland. Well, Lee's 
dispatch to the President is dated "Headquarters, Frederick 
City." We believe him. 

SEPTEMBER STH. But the Marylanders have not risen yet. 
Some of our divisions have touched the soil of Pennsylvania. 
And I believe the whole Yankee host would leave Washington, 
escaping by the Potomac, if it were not for the traitors here, who 
go to Norfolk and Baltimore by flag of truce, and inform the Lin- 
coln Government (for pay) that we have no troops here none 
between this and Manassas, none all the way to Lee, while thou- 
sands in the army are prostrated with physical exhaustion. 

SEPTEMBER BTH. Lord, what a scare they are having in the 
North ! They are calling everybody to arms for the defense of 
Philadelphia, and they are removing specie, arms, etc., from Har- 
risburg and all the intervening towns. This is the chalice so long 
held by them to our lips. 

SEPTEMBER 10 m. On the very day that Lee gained the signal 
victory at Manassas, Kirby Smith gained one at Richmond, Ken- 
tucky, capturing thousands of prisoners. This is not chance it 
is God, to whom all the glory is due. 

SEPTEMBER HTH And Cincinnati is trembling to its center. 
That abolition city, half foreign and half American, is listening 
for the thunder of our avenging guns. 

SEPTEMBER 12TH. The ranks of the enemy are broken every- 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 153 

where in the West. Buell is flying to Nashville as a city of ref- 
uge, but we have invincible columns interposed between him and 
his country. 

SEPTEMBER 13TH. Buell has impressed 10,000 slaves, and is 
fortifying Nashville. 

SEPTEMBER 14m. Our army has entered the City of Lexing- 
ton, and the population hail our brave soldiers as deliverers. Three 
regiments were organized there in twenty-four hours, and thirty 
thousand recruits, it is thought, will flock to our standard in Ken- 
tucky. 

SEPTEMBER 15TH. Our flag floats over the Capitol at Frank- 
fort ! And Gen. Marshall, lately the exile and fugitive, is en- 
camped with his men on his own farm, near Paris. 

SEPTEMBER 16TH. Intelligence from Missouri states that the 
Union militia have rallied on the side of the South. 

SEPTEMBER HTH. Everything seems to indicate the "breaking 
up" of the armies of our enemies, as if our prayers had been an- 
swered, and the hosts of Lincoln were really to be "brought to 
confusion." 

SEPTEMBER 18th. To-day, in response to the President's proc- 
lamation, we give thanks to Almighty God for the victories HE has 
blessed us with. 

SEPTEMBER 19TH. And God has blessed us even more abund- 
antly than we supposed. The rumor that our invincible Stone- 
wall Jackson had been sent by Lee to Harper's Ferry, and had 
taken it, is TRUE. Nearly 12,000 men surrendered there on the 
15th inst, after the loss of two or three hundred on their side, and 
only three killed and a few wounded on ours. We got 90 guns, 
15,000 stand of small arms, 18,000 fine horses, 200 wagons, and 
stores of various kinds, worth millions. 

SEPTEMBER 20TH. While Jackson was doing his work, Mc- 
Clellan, who has been restored to command, marched at the head 
of 100,000 men to the rescue of Harper's Ferry, but D. P. Hill, 
with his single division, kept him at bay for many hours, until 
Lougstreet came to his assistance, and night fell upon the scene. 

But Lee soon concentrated his weary columns at Sharpsburg, 
Dear Shepherdstown, and on the 17th inst. gave battle. We got 
the first news of this battle from a Northern paper the Philadel- 
phia Inquirer which claimed a great victory, having killed and 



154 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

taken 40,000 of our men, made Jackson prisoner, and wounded 
Longstreet ! But the truth is, we lost 5000 and the enemy 20,000. 
At the next dawn Lee opened fire again but, lo ! the enemy had 
fled! 

SEPTEMBER 21 ST. We have one day of gloom. It is said that 
our army has retreated back into Virginia. 

SEPIEMBER 22o. There are rumors that only Jackson's corps 
recrossed the Potomac to look after a column of the enemy sent 
to recapture Harper's Ferry and take Winchester, our grand 
depot. 

SEPTEMBER 23D. Jackson, the ubiquitous and invincible, fell 
upon Burnside's division and annihilated it. This intelligence has 
been received by the President. 

We have, also, news from Kentucky. It comes this time in the 
New York Herald, and is true, as far as it goes. A portion of 
Buell's army, escaping from Nashville, marched to Mumfordsville, 
where Bragg cut them to pieces, taking 5000 prisoners ! It can- 
not be possible that this is more than half the truth. 

The newsboys are selling extras in the streets containing these 
glorious accounts. 

SEPTEMBER 24TH. The papers this morning are still in doubt 
whether Lee has returned to the Virginia side of the Potomac, or 
remains in Maryland. My theory is that he is perdue for the 
present, hoping all the enemy's forces will enter Virginia, from 
Washington when he will pounce upon that city and cut off their 
retreat. 

The Northern papers contain intimations of the existence of a 
conspiracy to dethrone Lincoln, and put a military Dictator at the 
head of the government. Gen. Fremont is named as the man. It 
is alleged that this movement is to be made by the Abolitionists, 
as if Lincoln were not sufficiently radical for them ! 

A call has been made by Congress for explanations of the arrest 
of a citizen of Virginia, by Gen. Winder, for procuring a substi- 
tute for a relative. Gen. W., supposing his powers ample, under 
martial law, had forbidden agents to procure substitutes. This 
was in contravention of an act of Congress, legalizing substitutes. 
If Winder be sustained, it is said we shall have inaugurated a 
military despotism. 

I have just seen persons from the Eastern Shore of Virginia. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 155 

They say my farm there has not been disturbed * by the enemy. I 
think it probable they knew nothing about its ownership, or it 
would have been devastated. My agent sent me a little money, 
part of the rent of year before last. My tenant is getting rich. 
After peace I shall reside there myself. How I long for the inde- 
pendent life of a farmer ! 

Wood is selling at $16 per cord, and coal at $9 per load. How 
can we live here, unless our salaries are increased ? The matter 
is under consideration by Congress, and we hope for favorable 
action. 

Col. Bledsoe has resigned and gone back to his school at Char- 
lottesville. 

SEPTEMBER 25TH. Blankets, that used to sell for $6, are now 
$25 per pair ; and sheets are selling for $15 per pair, which might 
have been had a year ago for $4. Common 44 bleached cotton 
shirting is selling at $1 a yard. 

Gen Lee's locality and operations, since the battle of Sharps- 
burg or Shepherdstown, are still enveloped in mystery. 

About one hundred of the commissioned officers of Pope's army, 
taken prisoners by Jackson, and confined as felons in our prisons, 
in conformity to the President's retaliatory order, were yesterday 
released on parole, in consequence of satisfactory communications 
from the United States Government, disavowing Pope's orders, I 
presume, and stating officially the fact that Pope himself has been 
relieved from command. 

We have taken, and paroled, within the last twelve or fifteen 
weeks, no less than forty odd thousand prisoners! The United 
States must owe us some thirty thousand men. This does not 
look like progress in the work of subjugation. 

Horrible 1 I have seen men just from Manassas, and the battle- 
field of the 30th August, where, they assure me, hundreds of dead 
Yankees still lie unburied ! They are swollen " as large as cows," 
say they, "and are as black as crows." No one can now under- 
take to bury them. When the wind blows from that direction, it 
is said the scent of carrion is distinctly perceptible at the White

homeless and destitute. Onancock, Accomac County, Va. J. B. J.

House in Washington. It is said the enemy are evacuating Alex- 
andria. I do not believe this. 

A gentleman (Georgian) to whom I gave a passport to visit the 
army, taking two substitutes, over forty-five years of age, in place 
of two sick young men in the hospitals, informs me that he got 
upon the ground just before the great battle at Sharpsburg com- 
menced. The substitutes were mustered in, and in less than an 
hour after their arrival, one of them was shot through the hat and 
hair, but his head was untouched. He says they fought as well as 
veterans. 

SEPTEMBER 26TH. The press here have no knowledge of the 
present locality of Gen. Lee and his army. But a letter was re- 
ceived from Gen. L. at the department yesterday, dated on this 
side of the Potomac, about eighteen miles above Harper's Ferry. 

It is stated that several hundred prisoners, taken at Sharpsburg, 
are paroled prisoners captured at Harper's Ferry. If this be so 
(and it is said they will be here to-night), I think it probable an 
example will be made of them. This unpleasant duty may not be 
avoided by our government. 

After losing in killed and wounded, in the battle of Sharpsburg, 
ten generals, and perhaps twenty thousand men, we hear no more 
of the advance of the enemy ; and Lee seems to be lying perdue, 
giving them an opportunity to ruminate on the difficulties and 
dangers of "subjugation." 

I pray we may soon conquer a peace with the North ; but then 
I fear we shall have trouble among ourselves. Certainly there is 
danger, after the war, that Virginia, and, perhaps, a sufficient 
number of the States to form a new constitution, will meet in 
convention and form a new government. 

Gen. Stark, of Mississippi, who fell at Sharpsburg, was an ac- 
quaintance of mine. His daughters were educated with mine at 
St. Mary's Hall, Burlington, N. J. and were, indeed, under my 
care. Orphans now ! 

SEPTEMBER 27TH. The papers this morning contain accounts 
of the landing of Yankees at White House, York River ; and of 
reinforcements at Williamsburg and Suffolk. They might attempt 
to take Richmond, while Lee's army is away ; for they know we 
have no large body of troops here. 

A battery passed through the city this morning early, at double- 
quick, going eastward. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 157 

Yesterday Congress passed an act, supplemental and araenda 
tory to the Conscription Act of last April, authorizing the Presi- 
dent to call into the military service all residents between the ages 
of thirty-five and forty- five. The first act included only those be- 
tween the ages of eighteen and thirty-five. 

By the 1st of January there will be $300,000,000 Treasury notes 
in circulation. It is proposed in Congress to make a forced loan 
of one-fifth of the incomes of the people. 

It is said Lincoln has issued a proclamation declaring the slaves 
of Rebels free, on and after the 1st of January, 1863. This will 
only intensify the war, and add largely to our numbers in the 
field. 

A letter was received from General Lee to-day, dated at Mar- 
tinsburg, giving a sad account of the army. It seems that with- 
out some additional power given the President by Congress to 
enforce discipline, he fears the army will melt away. He suggests 
that incompetent officers be reduced to the ranks, and that more 
stringent regulations be adopted. He is in no condition to ad- 
vance now, since so many thousands of his men are permitted to 
wander away. We shall be afflicted with fresh invasions and 
that, if nothing else, may cause the stragglers to return. 

The substance of Lee's letter has been communicated to Con- 
gress, and that body, I understand, has postponed the day of ad- 
journment until the 6th October. 

In future times, I wonder if it will be said that we had great 
men in this Congress ? Whatever may be said, the truth is, 
there are not a dozen with any pretensions to statesmanship. 

SEPTEMBER 29TH. We have Lincoln's proclamation, freeing 
all the slaves from and after the 1st January next. And another, 
declaring martial law throughout the United States ! Let the 
Yankees ruminate on that ! Now for a fresh gathering of our 
clans for another harvest of blood. 

On Saturday the following resolutions were reported by Mr. 
Semmes, from the Committee of the Judiciary, in the Senate : 

"1st. That no officer of the Confederate Government is by law 
empowered to vest Provost Marshals with any authority whatever 
over citizens of the Confederate States not belonging to the land 
and naval forces thereof, or with general police powers and duties 

14 



158 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

for the preservation of the peace and good order of any city, town, 
or municipal district in any State of this Confederacy, and any 
such exercise of authority is illegal and void. 

"2d. That no officer of the Confederate Government has con- 
stitutional or other lawful authority to limit or restrict, or in any 
manner to control, the exercise of the jurisdiction of the civil judi- 
cial tribunals of the States of this Confederacy, vested in them by 
the Constitution and laws of the States respectively ; and all orders 
of any such officer tending to restrict or control or interfere with 
the full and normal exercise of the jurisdiction of such civil judicial 
tribunals are illegal and void." 

We shall see what further action will follow. This is in marked 
contrast to the despotic rule in the Yankee nation. Nevertheless, 
the Provost Marshal here keeps his establishment in full blast. 
He was appointed by Gen. Winder, of Maryland, who has been 
temporarily subordinated by Major- Gen. Smith, of New York. 

Since Gen. Smith has been in command, the enemy has made 
raids to Leesburg, Manassas, and even Warrenton, capturing and 
paroling our sick and wounded men. Who is responsible ? 

Accounts from Nashville state that our cavalry is beleaguering 
that city, and that both the United States forces there, and the 
inhabitants of the town, are reduced nearly to starvation. 

Buell, it is said, has reached Louisville. We hope to hear soon 
of active operations in Kentucky. Bragg, and Smith, and Price, 
and Marshall are there with abundant forces to be striking heavy 
blows. 

Beauregard is assigned to the defense of South Carolina and 
Georgia. 

Harper's Ferry is again occupied by the enemy but we have 
removed everything captured there. The -Northern papers now 
admit that the sanguinary battle of Sharpsburg was without 
result. 

I sent my wife money to-day, and urged her to return to Rich- 
mond as soon as possible, as the enemy may cut the communica- 
tions being within forty miles of the railroad. How I should like 
to think they were cut to pieces ! Then they would let us alone. 

Hitherto 100,000 sick and wounded patients have been admitted 
into the army hospitals of this city. Of these, about 10,000 have 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 159 

been furlonghed, 3000 discharged from the service, and only 7600 
have died. At present there are 10,000 in the hospitals. There 
is not so much sickness this year as there was last, nor is it near 
so fatal. 

Many of the Northern papers seem to dissent from the policy of 
Lincoln's proclamation, and hope that evil consequences may not 
grow out of it. But how can it be possible for the people of the 
North to submit to martial law ? The government which directs 
and enforces so obnoxious a tyranny cannot be sure of its stability. 
And when the next army of invasion marches southward, it will 
be likely to have enemies in its rear as well as in its front. The 
Tribune exclaims "God bless Abraham Lincoln." Others, even 
in the North, will pray for "God to him !" 

SEPTEMBER 30TH. Lincoln's proclamation was the subject of 
discussion in the Senate yesterday. Some of the gravest of our 
senators favor the raising of the black flag, asking and giving no 
quarter hereafter. 

The yellow fever is raging at Wilmington, North Carolina. 

The President, in response to a resolution of inquiry concern- 
ing Hyde, the agent who procured a substitute and was arrested 
for it, sent Congress a letter from the Secretary of Waf, stating 
that the action of Gen. Winder had not been approved, and that 
Mr. Hyde had been discharged. The Secretary closes his letter 
with a sarcasm, which, I think, is not his own composition. He 
asks, as martial law is still existing, though the writ of habeas 
corpus is not suspended, for instructions as to the power of the 
military commander, Winder, to suppress tippling shops! Sev- 
eral members declared that martial law existed in this city with- 
out any constitutional warrant. There is much bad feeling be- 
tween many members and the Executive. 

No fighting has occurred on the Peninsula, and I believe Gen. 
Wise has returned with bis forces to Chaffin's Bluff. 



160 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 



CHAPTER XIX. 

McClellan has crossed the Potomac. Another battle anticipated. I am 
assured here that Lee had but 40,000 men engaged at Sharpsburg. He 
has more now, as he is defending Virginia. Radicals of the North want 
McClellan removed. Our President has never taken the field. Lee 
makes demonstrations against McClellan. A Jew store robbed last night. 
We have 40,000 prisoners excess over the enemy. My family arrived 
from Raleigh. My wife's substitute for coffee. Foul passports. My 
friend Brooks dines and wines with members of Congress. The Herald 
and Tribune tempt us to return to the Union Lee writes, no immediate 
advance of McClellan. Still a rumor of Bragg's victory in Kentucky. 
Enemy getting large reinforcements. Diabolical order of Governor Bay- 
lor. Secretary's estimate of conscripts and all others, 500,000 Bragg 
retreating from Kentucky. Bickering between Bragg and Beauregard. 
Lee wants Confederate notes made a legal tender. There will be no 
second Washington. 

OCTOBER IST. They are still striking at martial law in the 
Senate, as administered by Gen. Winder. A communication 
from the Secretary of War admits that Gen. W. was authorized 
to suppress substitute agencies "but this did not justify impress- 
ment and confiscation." It appears that Gen Winder ordered the 
agents to be impressed into the service, and the money paid for 
substitutes to be confiscated ! Notwithstanding his blundering 
ignorance is disavowed, he is still retained in command. 

The enemy are at Warrenton ; and McCIellan's army has 
crossed the Upper Potomac. Another battle is imminent and 
fearful will be the slaughter this time. Lee had but little if any 
more than 40,000 in the battle of Sharpsburg ; the Northern papers 
said McClellan had 200,000 ! a fearful odds. But Lee now has 
70,000 and, besides, he will be defending Virginia. McClellan, 
with his immense army, must advance, or else relinquish command. 
The Abolitionists of the North have never liked him, and they 
wield the power at present. A defeat of Lee near Winchester 
would produce consternation here. 

There are, as usual, thousands of able-bodied meu still in our 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 161 

streets. It is probable every man, able to march, will be required 
on the field of battle. If we cau get out all, we shall certainly 
gain the day, and establish our independence. 

How shall we subsist this winter ? There is not a supply of 
wood or coal in the city and it is said there are not adequate 
means of transporting it hither. Flour at $16 per barrel, and 
bacon at 75 cts. per pound, threaten a famine. And yet there 
are no beggars in the streets. We must get a million of men in 
arms and drive the invader from our soil. We are capable of it, 
and we must do it. Better die in battle than die of starvation 
produced by the enemy. 

The newspapers are printed on half sheets and I think the 
publishers make money; the extras (published almost every day) 
are sold to the newsboys for ten cents, and often sold by them for 
twenty-five cents. These are mere slips of paper, seldom contain- 
ing more than a column which is reproduced in the next issue. 
The matter of the extras is mostly made up from the Northern 
papers, brought hither by persons running the blockade. The 
supply is pretty regular, and dates are rarely more than three or 
four days behind the time of reception. We often get the first 
accounts of battles at a distance in this way, as our generals and 
our government are famed for a prudential reticence. When the 
Northern papers simply say they have gained a victory, we re- 
joice, knowing their Cretan habits. The other day they announced, 
for European credulity, the capture and killing of 40,000 of our 
men : this staggered us ; but it turned out that they did capture 
700 of our stragglers and 2000 wounded men in field hospitals. 
Now they are under the necessity cf admitting the truth. Truth, 
like honesty, is always the best policy. 

OCTOBER 2D. News from the North indicate that in Europe 
all expectation of a restoration of the Union is at an end; and 
the probability is that we shall soon be recognized, to be followed, 
possibly, by intervention. Nevertheless, we must rely upon our 
own strong arms, and the favor of God. It is said, however, an 
iron steamer is being openly constructed in the Mersey (Liver- 
pool), for the avowed purpose of opening the blockade of Charles- 
ton harbor. 

Yesterday in both Houses of Congress resolutions were intro- 

14* 



162 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

duced for the purpose of retaliating upon the North the barbari- 
ties contemplated in Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. 

The Abolitionists of the North want McClellan removed I 
hope they may have their will. The reason assigned by his 
friends for his not advancing farther into Virginia, is that he has 
not troops enough, and the Secretary of War has them not to send 
him. I hope this may be so. Still, I think he must fight soon if 
he remains near Martinsburg. 

The yellow fever is worse at Wilmington. I trust it will not 
make its appearance here. 

A resolution was adopted yesterday in the Senate, to the effect 
that martial law does not apply to civilians. But it has been 
applied to them here, and both Gen. Winder and his Provost 
Marshal threatened to apply it to me. 

Among the few measures that may be attributed to the present 
Secretary of War, is the introduction of the telegraph wires into 
his office. It may possibly be the idea of another ; but it is not 
exactly original ; and it has not been productive of good. It has 
now been in operation several weeks, all the way to Warrenton ; 
and yet a few days ago the enemy's cavalry found that section of 
country undefended, and took Warrenton itself, capturing in that 
vicinity some 2000 wounded Confederates, in spite of the Secre- 
tary's expensive vigilance. Could a Yankee have been the in- 
ventor of the Secretary's plaything? One amused himself tele- 
graphing the Secretary from Warrenton, that all was quiet there ; 
and that the Yankees had not made their appearance in that 
neighborhood, as had been rumored! If we had imbeciles in the 
field, our subjugation would be only pastime for the enemy. It 
is well, perhaps, that Gen. Lee has razeed the department down to 
a second-class bureau, of which the President himself is the chief. 

I see by a correspondence of the British diplomatic agents, that 
their government have decided no reclamation can be made on 
us for burning cotton and tobacco belonging to British subjects, 
where there is danger that they may fall into the hands of the 
enemy. Thus the British government do not even claim to have 
their subjects in the South favored above the Southern people. 
But Mr. Benjamin is more liberal, and he directed the Provost 
Marshal to save the tobacco bought on foreign account. So far, 
however, the grand ^peculation has failed. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 1 63 

OCTOBER 3D. Gen. Wise was countermanded in his march 
against Williamsburg, by Major-Gen. Gustavus W. Smith. He 
had 2700 men, the enemy 1500, and he would have captured and 
slain them all. Gen. Wise was the trusted and revered Governor 
of Virginia, while Smith was the Street Commissioner in New 
York. 

A strong letter from Yice-President Stephens is published to- 
day, in which it is successfully maintained that no power exists, 
derived either from the Constitution or acts of Congress, for the 
declaration of martial law. He says all punishments inflicted by 
military governors on civilians are clearly illegal. 

There is a rumor that we have Louisville, but it does not seem 
to be authentic. We have nothing from Lee, and know not 
exactly where McClellan is. 

Many people thought the President himself would take the 
field. I doubt not he would have done so if the Provisional 
Government had continued in existence until independence was 
achieved. 

OCTOBER 4TH. A splendid aurora borealis last night. 

Yesterday, most of the Helegation in Congress from Kentucky 
and Tennessee petitioned the President to order Gen. Breckin- 
ridge, at Knoxville, to march to the relief of Nashville, and expel 
the enemy, without waiting for orders from Gen. Bragg, now in 
Kentucky. The President considers this an extraordinary request, 
and will not, I suppose, grant it. 

It is said Gen Lee is advancing against Gen. McClellan at 
Martinsburg. If Lee attacks him, and beats him, he will probably 
be ruined, for the Potomac will be in his rear. 

The enemy's paper, printed at Nashville, thinks Bragg has 
taken Louisville. I hope so. I think we shall get Nashville 
soon. 

Gen. Butler, the Yankee commander in New Orleans, has issued 
an order to all the inhabitants of that city, sympathizing with the 
Southern Confederacy, to present themselves immediately, and 
take the oath of allegiance, when they will be recommended for 
pardon. If they do not comply with the order, they will be arrested 
by his police, cast into prison, and their property confiscated. 
These are the orders which rally our men and make them fight 
like heroes. How many Yankees will bleed and die in consequence 



164 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

of this order? And Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation will 
seal the doom of one hundred thousand of his own people 1 

A letter from Gen. Lee, dated October 1st, says that McClellan 
has not crossed the Potomac. Some of his scouts have been at 
Martinsburg, or in its vicinity. It is not to be supposed that Lee 
can be amused by McClellan, while a force of any magnitude is 
sent against Richmond. Some fear this, but I don't. 

OCTOBER (,TH, MONDAY. A Jew store, in Main Street, was 
robbed of $8000 worth of goods on Saturday night. They were 
carted away. This is significant. The prejudice is very strong 
against the extortionists, and I apprehend there will be many 
scenes of violence this winter. And our own people, who ask 
four prices for wood and coal, may contribute to produce a new 
Reign of Terror. The supplies necessary for existence should 
not be withheld from a suffering people. It is dangerous. 

There is great diversity of opinion yet as to the locality of 
McClellan's army and Lee's intentions. 

A dispatch from Gen. Yan Dorn, in West Tennessee, indicates 
that we are gaining a victory over Rosecrans. The battle was in 
progress, not completed. *^ 

OCTOBER 7TH. Nothing further has been heard from Corinth. 
A great battle is looked for in Kentucky. All is quiet in Northern 
Yirginia. 

Some 2500 Confederate prisoners arrived from the North last 
evening. They are on parole, and will doubtless be exchanged 
soon, as we have taken at least 40,000 more of the enemy's men 
than they have captured of ours. 

Yesterday, Congress, which has prolonged the session until the 
13th instant, passed a bill increasing the pay of soldiers four dollars 
per month. I hope they will increase our pay before they ad- 
journ. Congress also, yesterday, voted down the proposition of a 
forced loan of one-fifth of all incomes. But the Committee of 
Ways and Means are instrutcted to bring forward another bill. 

This evening Custis and I expect the arrival of my family from 
Raleigh, N. C. We have procured for them one pound of sugar, 
80 cents; one quart of milk, 25 gents; one pound of sausage- 
meat, 37^ cents ; four loaves of bread, as large as my fist, 20 cents 
each; and we have a little coffee, which is selling at $2.50 per 
pound. In the morning, some one must go to market, else there 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 165 

will be short-commons. Washing is $2.50 per dozen pieces. 
Common soap is worth 75 cents per pound. 

OCTOBER STH. At last we have definite accounts of the battle 
of Corinth, on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday last. We have 
been defeated, and fearful has been the slaughter on both sides. 
The enemy had overwhelming numbers. We have no particulars, 
further than that our army retreated This is bad for Van Dorn 
and Price. 

My family arrived last night, well, and pleased with the cottage, 
which they call Robin's Nest. But we were saddened by the loss 
of a trunk the most valuable one containing some heavy spoons, 
forks, and other plate, saved from the wreck at Burlington ; my 
wife's velvet cloak, satin dress (bought in Paris), my daughter's 
gold watch, and many other things of value. Twelve trunks, the 
right number, were delivered ; but one did not belong to us. 

OCTOBER OTH. Early this morning I was at the depot. The 
superintendent suggested that I should send some one to Weldon 
in search of the trunk. He proffered to puss him free. This was 
kind ; but I desired first to look among the baggage at the depot, 
and the baggage-master was called in. Only two were unclaimed 
last night ; but he said a gentleman had been there early in the 
morning looking for his trunk, who stated that by some mistake 
he had got- the wrong one last night. He said he stopped at the 
Exchange, and I repaired thither without delay, where I found 
my trunk, to the mutual joy of the traveler and myself. It was 
sent to the cottage, and the stranger's taken to the hotel. Had it 
not been for my lucky discovery, we should have had no spoons, 
forks, etc. 

My wife has obviated one of the difficulties of the blockade, by 
a substitute for coffee, which I like very well. It is simply corn 
meal, toasted like coffee, and served in the same manner. It 
costs five or six cents per pound coffee, $2.50. 

I heard a foolish North Carolinian abusing the administration 
to-day. He said, among other things, that the President himself, 
and his family, had Northern proclivities. That the President's 
family, when they fled from Richmond, in May, took refuge at St. 
Mary's Hall, Raleigh, the establishment of the Rev. Dr. Smedes, 
a Northern man. of open and avowed partiality for the Union; 
and that the Rev. Dr. Mason of the same place, with whom they 



166 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

were in intimate association, was a Northern man, and an open 
Unionist. That the President's aid, and late Assistant Secretary 
of State, was an Englishman, imported from the North ; Gen. 
Cooper, the highest in rank of any military officer, was a Northern 
man ; Col. Gorgas, Chief of Ordnance, was also a Northern man ; 
Gen. Lovell, who was in the defeat at Corinth, and who had sur- 
rendered New Orleans, was from Pennsylvania; Gen. Smith, in 
command of Virginia and North Carolina, from New York ; and 
Gen. Winder, commanding this metropolis, a Marylander, and his 
detectives strangers and aliens, who sold passports to Lincoln's 
spies for $100 each. He was furious, and swore all the distresses 
of the people were owing to a Nero-like despotism, originating 
in the brain of Benjamin, the Jew, whose wife lived in Paris. 

The Senate, yesterday, passed the following resolutions, almost 
unanimously: 

1st. Resolved by the Congress of the Confederate States of 
America, That no officer of the Confederate Government is by 
law empowered to vest Provost Marshals with any authority 
whatever over citizens of the Confederate States not belonging to 
the land or naval forces thereof or with general police powers and 
duties for the preservation of the peace and good order of any 
city, town, or municipal district in any State of this Confederacy, 
and any such exercise of authority is illegal and void. 

2d. Resolved, That no officer of the Confederate Government 
has constitutional or other lawful authority to limit or restrict, or 
in any manner to control the exercise of the jurisdiction of the 
civil judicial tribunals of the States of this Confederacy, vested in 
them by the constitutions and laws of the States respectively, and 
all orders of any such officer, tending to restrict or control or in- 
terfere with the full and normal exercise of the jurisdiction of such 
civil judicial tribunals are illegal and void. 

3d. Resolved, That the military law of the Confederate States 
is, by the courts and the enactments of Congress, limited to the 
land and naval forces and the militia when in actual service, 
and to such other persons as are within the lines of any army, 
navy, corps, division or brigade of the army of the Confederate 
States. 

Yesterday, the Dispatch contained an article, copied from the 
Philadelphia Inquirer, stating that a certain person who had 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 167 

been in prison here, arrested by order of Gen. Winder, for dis- 
loyalty, and for attempting to convey information to the enemy, 
had succeeded in obtaining his release ; and, for a bribe of $100, 
a passport to leave the Confederacy had been procured from Gen. 
Winder's alien detectives. The passport is printed in the Phila- 
delphia paper, and the bearer, the narrative says, has entered the 
United States service. 

This must have been brought to the attention of the President; 
for a lady, seeking a passport to go to her son, sick and in prison 
in the North, told me that when she applied to Gen. Winder to- 
day, he said the President had ordered him to issue no more 
passports. And subsequently several parties, government agents 
and others, came to me with orders from the Secretary (which I 
retain on file), to issue passports for them. I hope this may be 
the end of Winder's reign. 

A letter from Gen. Lee states that, in view of certain move- 
ments, he had, without waiting for instructions, delivered the 
sword, horse, etc. of Gen. Kearney, lately killed, to his wife, who 
had made application for them. The movements referred to we 
shall know more about in a few days. 

Gen. Van Doru dispatches the department that his army is 
safe; that he took thirteen guns and 700 prisoners. So it was 
not so disastrous a defeat. But the idea of charging five times 
his number ! 

OCTOBER 10iH. Mr. Brooks called this morning to get me to 
draft a passport bill, which he said he would get Congress to pass. 
I doubt it. I wrote the bill, however. He says fifteen or twenty 
members of Congress visit his house daily. They dine with him, 
and drink his old whisky. Mr. B. has a superb mansion on Clay 
Street, which he bought at a sacrifice. He made his money at 
trade. In one of the rooms Aaron Burr once dined with Chief 
Justice Marshall, and Marshall was assailed for it afterward by 
Mr. Jefferson. It was during Burr's trial, and Marshall was his 
judge. Mr. Wickham, who was Burr's counsel, then occupied the 
house, and gave a dinner party. Marshall did not know Burr was 
to be one of the guests. I got these facts from Mr. Foote, whom 
I met there the other evening. 

A letter from Gen. Bragg to the President, indicates but too 
clearly that the people of Kentucky hesitate to risk the loss of 



168' A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

property by joining us. Only one brigade has been recruitecHso 
far. The general says 50,000 more men are requisite. Can he 
have them? None 1 

OCTOBER HTH. There are rumors of Abolition gun-boats in 
the York and James Rivers. A battery of long range guns was 
sent down yesterday. 

It is said that an army of raw Abolitionists, under Sigel, has 
marched from Alexandria toward Culpepper County. If this be 
so, we shall soon have more fighting, and more running, I hope. 
Lee keeps his own counsel wisely. 

OCTOBER 13TH. Northern papers, received last night, speak of 
a battle at Perryville, Kentucky, on the 9th instant, in which the 
Abolitionists lost, by their own confession, 2000 killed and wounded, 
which means 10,000. They say Bragg's forces held a portion of 
the field after the battle. If this prove not a glorious victory for 
our arms, I don't know how to read Abolition journals. 

I see that our Congress, late on Saturday night (they adjourn 
to-day), passed an act increasing the salaries of officers and em- 
ployees in the departments residing at Richmond. This will make 
the joint compensation of my son and myself $3000; this is not 
equal to $2000 a year ago. But Congress failed to make the 
necessary appropriation. The Secretary might use the contingent 
fund. 

Another act authorizes the President to appoint twenty ad- 
ditional brigadier-generals, and a number of lieutenant-generals. 

The New York Herald, and even the Tribune, are tempting us 
to return to the Union, by promises of protecting slavery, and an 
offer of a convention to alter the Constitution, giving us such 
guarantees of safety as we may demand. This is significant. We 
understand the sign. 

Letters from Gen. Lee do not indicate an immediate purpose to 
retire from the Potomac ; on the contrary, he has ordered Gen. 
Loring, if practicable, to menace Wheeling and Pennsylvania, 
and form a junction with him via the Monongahela and Upper 
Potomac. But Loring does not deem it safe to move all his forces 
(not more than 6000) by that route ; he will, however, probably 
send his cavalry iuto Pennsylvania. 

And Gen. Lee does not want any more raw conscripts. They 
get sick immediately, and prove a burden instead of a benefit. He 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 109 

desires them to be kept in camps of instruction, until better sea- 
soned (a term invented by Gen. Wise) for the field. 

Senator Brown, of Mississippi, opposed the bill increasing our 
salaries, on the ground that letters from himself, indorsed by the 
President, applying for clerkships for his friends, remained un- 
answered. He did not seem to know that this was exclusively 
the fault of the head clerk, Mr. Randolph, who has the title of 
Secretary of War. 

And the Examiner denounces the bill, because it seems to 
sanction a depreciation of our currency ! What statesmanship ! 
What logic ! 

OCTOBER 14TH. Congress adjourned yesterday at five o'clock 
P.M. I have heard nothing of Mr. Brooks and the Passport Bill 
I drafted. The truth is that, with few exceptions, the members of 
this Congress are very weak, and very subservient to the heads of 
departments. 

Congress has given him (the President) power to suspend the 
writ of habeas corpus anywhere, until thirty days after the reas- 
sembling of Congress and they have failed to pass the joint 
resolution declaring no power exists under the Constitution to 
institute martial law. They voted it separately, but flinched 
when put to the test to act conjointly ; and martial law still exists 
in this city. 

We have Northern accounts of a dash into Pennsylvania by 
Gen. Stuart and 1500 of his cavalry. He went as far as Cham- 
bersburg, which surrendered ; and he was gathering horses, etc., 
for the use of the army, paying for them in Confederate notes. 
They say he did not disturb any other description of private prop- 
erty without paying for it. I hope he is safely back again by this 
time. The Northern papers claim a victory in Kentucky but I 
shall wait until we hear from Bragg. 

Gen. Magruder has been assigned to duty in Texas. What 
Gen. Johnston is to do, does not yet appear. A great many new 
assistant adjutants and inspector-generals are to be appointed for 
the generals, lieutenant-generals, majors, and brigadier-generals, 
having rank and pay of colonels, majors, captains, and lieutenants 
of cavalry. Like the Russian, perhaps, we shall have a purely 
military government ; and it may be as good as any other. 

15 



170 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

Gold, in the North, is selling at 28 per cent, premium ; and 
Exchange on England at $1.40. This is an indication that the 
Abolitionists are bringing distress upon their own country. 

The financial bill did not pass so there is to be no forced loan. 
Neither did a bill, making Confederate notes a legal tender so 
there will be a still greater depreciation. 

Gen. Hardee is a lieutenant-general. 

OCTOBER 15TH. A young man showed me a passport to-day to 
return to Washington. It appears that Secretary Randolph has 
adopted another plan, which must be a rare stroke of genius. The 
printed passport is " by order of the Secretary of War," and is 
signed by " J. H. Winder, Brig.-Gen." But this is not all: on 
the back it is "approved by order of Major-Gen, Gustavus W. 
Smith," and signed by one of Smith's "adjutants." So the com- 
mand of the Secretary of War is approved by the New Yorker, 
Smith, after being first manipulated by Winder. It is an improve- 
ment, at all events, on the late mode of sending out spies they 
cannot get passports for bribes now, without Smith's adjutant 
knowing something about it. Heretofore the " Plug TJglies" 
might take the bribe, and by their influence with Gen. Winder, 
obtain his signature to a blank passport. 

The following was received yesterday : 

"WINCHESTER, VA., Oct. 14, 1862. 
"HON..G. W. RANDOLPH. 

" The cavalry expedition to Pennsylvania has returned safe. 
They passed through Mercersburg, Charabersburg, Emmetsburg, 
Liberty, New Market, Syattstown, and Burnesville. The expedi- 
tion crossed the Potomac above Williamsport, and recrossed at 
White's Ford, making the entire circuit, cutting the enemy's com- 
munications, destroying arms, etc., and obtaining many recruits. 

"R. E. LEE, General." 

Thus, Gen. Stuart has made another circle round the enemy's 
army ; and hitherto, every time he has done so, a grand battle 
followed. Let McClellan beware ! 

A letter, just received from Gen. Lee, says there is no appre- 
hension of an immediate advance of McClellan's army. This he 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 171 

has ascertained from his scouts sent out to obtain information. 
He says the enemy is in no condition to advance. Will they go 
into winter quarters ? Or will Lee beat them up in their quarters ? 

But the government has desired Lee to fall back from the Po- 
tomac ; and Lee, knowing best what he should do at present, de- 
clines the honor. He says he is now subsisting his army on what, 
if he retreated, would subsist the enemy, as he has but limited 
means of transportation. He says, moreover, that our cavalry 
about Culpepper and Manassas (belonging to the command of 
Gen. Gustavus W. Smith), should be more active and daring in 
dashing at the enemy ; and then, a few weeks hence, McClellan 
would go into winter quarters. That would insure the safety of 
Richmond until spring. 

There is a rumor, generally credited, that Bragg has led the 
enemy, in Kentucky, into an ambuscade, and slaughtered 25,000. 
A traveler from the West reports having read an account to this 
effect in the Louisville Journal. If the Journal really says so 
that number won't cover the loss. The Abolitionist journals are 
incorrigible liars. And, indeed, so are many of those who bring 
us news from the West. 

OCTOBER 16TH. There is no confirmation of the reported vic- 
tory in Kentucky. 

An Englishman, who has been permitted to go North, publishes 
there a minute and pretty accurate description of our river de- 
fenses. 

I have written a leading article for the Whig to-morrow, on 
" Martial Law and Passports." My plan is to organize committees 
in all the border counties to examine the passports of strangers 
seeking egress from the country ; and to permit loyal citizens, not 
desiring to pass our borders, or the lines of the armies, to travel 
without passports. An officer and a squad of soldiers at the 
depots can decide what soldiers are entitled to pass on the roads. 

OCTOBER 17TH. The article in the Whig is backed by one of 
a similar character in the Examiner. We shall see what effect 
they will have on the policy adopted by the Secretary of War. 

Although still unofficial, we have confirmatory accounts of 
Bragg's victory in Kentucky. The enemy lost, they say, 25,000 
men. Western accounts are generally exaggerated. 



172 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

The President has appointed the following lieutenant-generals: 
Jackson, Longstreet, (Bishop) Polk, Hardee, Pemberton, Holmes, 
and Smith (Kirby). 

The raid of Stuart into Pennsylvania was a most brilliant 
affair. He captured and destroyed much public property re- 
specting that of individuals. The Abolitionists are much mortified, 
and were greatly frightened. The plan of this expedition was 
received at the department to-day just as conceived and pre- 
pared by Lee, and it was executed by Stuart in a masterly 
manner. 

Advices from Winchester inform the government that McClel- 
lan is receiving large reinforcements. He may be determined to 
cross the Potomac and offer battle as nothing less will satisfy the 
rabid Abolitionists. Gen. Lee is tearing up the rails on the road 
from Harper's Ferry. 

Our improvident soldiers lose a great many muskets. We 
should not have arms enough on the Potomac, were it not for 
those captured at Harper's Ferry. An order will be issued, 
making every man responsible for the safe-keeping of his gtfn. 

OCTOBER 18TH. Major-Gen. Jones telegraphs from Knoxville, 
Term., that a wounded officer arrived from Kentucky, reports a 
victory for Bragg, and that he has taken over 10,000 prisoners. 
We shall soon have positive news. 

A letter from Admiral Buchanan states that he has inspected 
the defenses of Mobile, and finds them satisfactory. 

I traversed the markets this morning, and was gratified to find the 
greatest profusion of all kinds of meats, vegetables, fruits, poultry, 
butter, eggs, etc. But the prices are enormously high. If the 
army be kept away, it seems the supply must soon be greater than 
the demand. Potatoes at $5 per bushel, and a large crop ! Half- 
grown chickens at $1 each ! Butter at $1.25 per pound I And 
other things in the same proportion. 

Here is a most startling matter. Gov. Baylor, appointed Gov- 
ernor of Arizona, sent an order some time since to a military com- 
mander to assemble the Apaches, under pretense of a treaty 
and when they came, to kill every man of them, and sell their, 
children to pay for the whisky. This order was sent to the 
Secretary, who referred it to Gen. Sibley, of that Territory, to 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 173 

ascertain if it were genuine. To-day it came back from Gen. S. 
indorsed a true bill. Now it will go to the President and we 
shall see what will follow. He cannot sanction such a perfidious 
crime. I predict he will make Capt. Josselyn, his former private 
Secretary, and the present Secretary of the Territory, Governor 
in place of Baylor. 

OCTOBER 20TH. The news from Kentucky is very vague. It 
seems there has been a battle, which resulted favorably for us, so 
far as the casualties are concerned. But then Bragg has fallen 
back forty miles, and is probably retiring toward Cumberland 
Gap, that he may not be taken in the rear by the enemy's forces 
lately at Corinth. 

The President intends suspending the Conscription Act in 
Western Virginia, for the purpose, no doubt, of organizing an 
army of Partisan Rangers in that direction. 

It seems, from recent Northern papers received in this city, that 
the elections in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana have gone 
against the Abolitionists. What then ? If the war should be 
waged by the Democrats for the restoration of the Union, and 
waged according to the rules of civilized nations, respecting non- 
combatants, and exempting private property from pillage, it would 
be a still more formidable war than that now waged against us. 

I have just received the following note from the Secretary: 

"OCTOBER 17th, 1862. 

"MR. J. B. JONES will hereafter refer all applicants for passports 
to Gen. Smith's Adjutant- General, and grant none from the de- 
partment. 

" GEORGE W. RANDOLPH, 

''Sec. of War." 

Neither the acting Assistant Secretary, nor Mr. Kean, with his 
whole alphabet of initials, could be certain whether the order re- 
ferred merely to applicants to go out of the Confederacy, or all 
applicants of whatever kind. If the latter, I am funclus officio, 
so far as passports are concerned. But Capt. Kean says there is 
plenty of work for me to do ; and I presume I will not be entirely 
out of employment. 

15* 



I took a good look at Mr. Randolph to-day. He is thin, frail. 
His face is pale, and will soon be a mass of wrinkles, although he 
is not over forty. His eyes are extremely small, blue, and glisten 
very much. 

OCTOBER 21ST. Still nothing definite from Kentucky, more 
than the retreat of Bragg. Gen. Loring is here he would not 
act upon the suggestions of Lee, and so he is recalled. 

The government is uneasy about Richmond. They want a 
portion of Lee's army sent hither. But Lee responds, that 
although he is not advised of the condition of things on the south 
side of James River, yet, if he detaches a portion of his army, he 
may be too weak to encounter McClellan, if he should advance. 

I saw the Secretary again this morning ; he wished me to tarn 
over all the passport business to the military. I said I was glad 
to be rid of that business, and would never touch it again. 

OCTOBER 22c. Back at ihf. department at work, but not much 
to do yet. The mails are not heavy. 

We have Bragg's report of the battle of Perryville. He beat 
the enemy from his positions, driving him back two miles, when 
night set in. But finding overwhelming masses accumulating 
around him, he withdrew in good order to Bryattsville. Thus 
Kentucky is given up for the present ! 

McClellan has retired back into Maryland, hoping, I suppose, 
Lee will follow and fall into his ambuscade. 

The President will call out, under the Conscription Act, all be- 
tween the ages of eighteen and forty. This will furnish, according 
to the Secretary's estimate, 500,000, after deducting the exempts. 
A great mistake. 

A letter from Gen. Lee indicates that he is in favor of making 
Treasury notes a legal tender. It was so with Washington con- 
cerning Continental money but Congress pays no attention to 
the subject. Why does not the President recommend it ? It 
would then pass for, at present, he is master. 

The paper from the Provost Marshal, referred by the latter to 
the President, came back to-day. The Secretary, in referring it, 
seems to incline to the opinion that the writ of habeas corpus not 
being suspended, there was no remedy for the many evils the Pro- 
vost Marshal portrayed. The President, however, did not wholly 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 115 

coincide in that opinion. He says : " The introduction and sale of 
liquors must be prevented. Call upon the city authorities to with- 
hold licenses, and to abate the evil in the courts, or else an order 
will be issued, such as the necessity requires." 

Judge Campbell, late of the United States Supreme Court, has 
been appointed Assistant Secretary of War. 

OCTOBER 23D. The Gov. of Florida calls for aid, or he thinks 
his State will fall. 

Albert Pike, writing from Texas, says if the Indian Territory 
be not attended to "instantly," it will be lost. 

Per contra, we have a rumor that Lee is recrossing the Potomac 
into Maryland. 

OCTOBER 24TH. Bragg is in full retreat, leaving Kentucky, and 
racing for Chattanooga the point of interest now. But Beaure- 
gard, from whom was taken the command of the "Western army, 
day before yesterday repulsed with slaughter a large detachment 
of the Yankees that had penetrated to the Charleston and Savan- 
nah Railroad. Thus, in spite of the fantastic tricks of small men 
here, ihe-popular general is destined to rise again. 

OCTOBER 25TH. Many severe things are alleged against the 
President for depriving Beauregard of the command of the West- 
ern army. It is alleged that Bragg reported that the enemy would 
have been annihilated at Shiloh, if Beauregard had fought an hour 
longer. Now, it appears, that Bragg would have annihilated the 
enemy at Perryville, if he had fought an hour longer ! And just 
at the moment of his flying out of Kentucky, news comes of Beau- 
regard's victory over the enemy in the South. Nor is this all. 
The enemy some time since intercepted a letter from Beauregard 
to Bragg (a copy of which was safely sent to the government here), 
detailing his plan of the campaign in the West, if he had not 
been unjustly deprived of the command. But Bragg chose to 
make a plan of his own, or was directed to disregard Beauregard's 
advice. No one doubts that Beauregard's plan would have been 
successful, and would have given us Cincinnati and Louisville ; 
but that of Bragg, as the one sent him by the government, has re- 
sulted in the loss of Kentucky, and, perhaps, Tennessee ! 

Brig.-Gen. Edward Johnson is recommended by Gen. Lee for 
promotion to major-general, and to be placed in command of the 
army in Western Virginia. 



176 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

OCTOBER 27TH. From information (pretty direct from Wash- 
ington), I believe it is the purpose of the enemy to make the most 
strenuous efforts to capture Richmond and Wilmington this fall 
and winter. It has been communicated to the President that if it 
takes their last man, and all their means, these cities must fall. 
Gen. Smith is getting negroes to work on the defenses, and the 
subsistence officers are ordered to accumulate a vast amount of 
provisions here. 

Letters from Beauregard show that the Commissary-General, 
because he thinks Charleston cannot be defended, opposes the 
provisioning the forts as the general would have it done ! The 
general demands of the government to know whether he is to be 
overruled, and if so, he must not be held responsible for the con- 
sequences. We shall see some of these days which side the Pres- 
ident will espouse. Beauregard is too popular, I fear, to meet 
with favor here. But it is life or death to the Confederacy, and 
danger lurks in the path of public men who endanger the liberties 
of the people. 

OCTOBER 28TH. Gen. Bragg is here, but will not probably be 
deprived of his command. He was opposed by vastly superior 
numbers, and succeeded in getting away with the largest amount 
of provisions, clothing, etc., ever obtained by an army. He brought 
out 15,000 horses and mules, 8000 beeves, 50,000 barrels of pork, 
a great number of hogs, 1,000,000 yards of Kentucky cloth, etc. 
The army is now at Knoxville, Tennessee, in good condition. 
But before leaving Kentucky, Morgan made still another capture 
of Lexington, taking a whole cavalry regiment prisoners, destroy- 
ing several wagon trains, etc. It is said Bragg's train of wagons 
was forty miles long ! A Western tale, I fear. 

Letters from Lee urge the immediate completion of the railroad 
from Danville to Greenville, North Carolina, as of vital import- 
ance. He thinks the enemy will cut the road between this and 
Weldon. He wants Confederate notes made a legal tender ; and 
the President says that, as the courts cannot enforce payment in 
anything else, they are substantially a legal tender already. And 
he suggests the withholding of pay from officers during their ab- 
sence from their regiments. A good idea. 

Everything indicates that Richmond will be assailed this fall, 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 177 

and that operations in the field are not to be suspended in the 
winter. 

Polk, Bragg, Cheatham, etc. are urging the President to make 
Col. Preston Smith a brigadier- general. Unfortunately, Bragg's 
letter mentioned the fact that Beauregard had given Smith com- 
mand of a brigade at Shiloh ; and this attracting the eye of the 
President, he made a sharp note of it with his pencil. "What 
authority had he for this ?" he asked ; and Col. Smith will not be 
appointed. 

OCTOBER 29TH. There was a rumor yesterday that the enemy 
were marching on Weldon ; but we have no confirmation of it 
to-day. 

Loring, after all, did not send his cavalry into Pennsylvania, I 
presume, since nothing has been heard of it. 

The Charleston Mercury has some strictures on the President 
for not having Breckinridge in Kentucky, and Price in Missouri, 
this fall. They would doubtless have done good service to the 
cause. The President is much absorbed in the matter of appoint- 
ments. 

Gen. Wise was again ordered down the Peninsula last Satur- 
day ; and again ordered back when he got under way. They will 
not let him fight. 

OCTOBER 30Tn. The Commissary-General is in hot water on 
account of some of his contracts, and a board of inquiry is to sit 
on him. 

The President has delayed the appointment of Gen. E. John- 
son, and Gen. Echols writes that several hundred of his men 
have deserted ; that the enemy, 10,000 or 15,000 strong, is press- 
ing him, and he must fall back, losing Charleston, Virginia, the 
salt works, and possibly the railroad. He has less than 4000 
men ! 

But we have good news from England if it be true. The New 
York Express says Lord Lyons is instructed by England, and 
perhaps on the part of France and other powers, to demand of 
the United States an armistice; and in the event of its not being 
acceded to, the governments will recognize our independence. 
One of the President's personal attendants told me this news was 
regarded as authentic by our government. I don't regard it so. 



178 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

Yesterday the whole batch of "Plug Ugly" policemen, in the 
Provost Marshal's " department," were summarily dismissed by 
Gen. Winder, for "malfeasance, corruption, bribery, and incom- 
petence." These are the branches: the roots should be plucked 
up, and Gen. Winder and his Provost Marshal ought to resign. 
I believe the President ordered the removal. 

OCTOBER 31sT. If it be not a Yankee electioneering trick to 
operate at the election in New York, on the fourth of November, 
the Northern correspondence with Europe looks very much like 
speedy intervention in our behalf. 

Winder has really dismissed all his detectives excepting Cash- 
meyer, about the worst of them. 

If we gain our independence by the valor of our people, or 
assisted by European intervention, I wonder whether President 
Davis will be regarded by the world as a second Washington ? 
What will his own country say of him ? I know not, of course; 
but I know what quite a number here say of him now. They say 
he is a small specimen of a statesman, and no military chieftain at 
all. And worse still, that he is a capricious tyrant, for lifting up 
Yankees and keeping down great Southern men. Wise, Floyd, 
etc. are kept in obscurity ; while Pemberton, who commanded the 
Massachusetts troops, under Lincoln, in April, 1861, is made a 
lieutenant-general ; G. W. Smith and Lovell, who were office- 
holders in New York, when the battle of Manassas was fought, 
are made major-generals, and the former put in command over 
Wise in Virginia, and all the generals in North Carolina. Rip- 
ley, another Northern general, was sent to South Carolina, and 
Winder, from Maryland, has been allowed to play the despot in 
Richmond and Petersburg. Washington was maligned. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 179 



CHAPTER XX. 

General Lee in Richmond: beard white. First proposition to trade cotton 
to the enemy. Secretary in favor of it. All the letters come through 
my bands ngain. Lee falling back. 5000 negroes at work on the forti- 
fications. Active operations looked for. Beauregard advises non-com- 
batants to leave the city. Semmes's operations. Making a nation. 
Salt works lost in Virginia. Barefooted soldiers. Intrigues of Butler in 
New Orleans. Northern army advancing everywhere. Breach between 
the President and Secretary of War. President's servant arrested for 
robbing the Treasury. Gen. J. E. Johnston in town. Secretary has re- 
signed. Hon. J. A. Seddon appointed Secretary of War. The 'enemy 
marching on Fredericksburg. Lee writes that he will be ready for them. 
Kentuckians will not be hog drivers. Women and children flying from 
the vicinity of Fredericksburg. Fears for Wilmington. No beggars 
Quiet on the Rappahannock. M. Paul, French Consul, saved the French 
tobacco. Gen. Johnston goes West. President gives Gov. Pettit full 
authority to trade cotton to France. 

NOVEMBER IST. Gen. Winder's late policemen have fled the 
city. T*heir monstrous crimes are the theme of universal execra- 
tion. But I reported them many months ago, and Gen. Winder 
was cognizant of their forgeries, correspondence with the enemy, 
etc. The Secretary of War, and the President himself, were in- 
formed of them, but it was thought to be a "small matter." 

Gen. Lee made his appearance at the department to-day, and 
was hardly recognizable, for his beard, now quite white, has 
been suffered to grow all over his face. But he is quite robust 
from his exercises in the field. His appearance here, coupled with 
the belief that we are to have the armistice, or recognition and 
intervention, is interpreted by many as an end of the war. But I 
apprehend it is a symptom of the falling back of our army. 

I have been startled to-day by certain papers that came under 
my observation. The first was written by J. Foulkes, to L. B. 
Northrop, Commissary- General, proposing to aid the government 
in procuring meat and bread for the army from ports in the 
enemy's possession. They were to be paid for in cotton. The 



180 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

next was a letter from the Commissary- General to G. W. Ran- 
dolph, Secretary of War, urging the acceptance of the proposi- 
tion, and saying without it, it would be impossible to subsist the 
army. He says the cotton proposed to be used, in the South- 
west will either be burned or fall into the hands of the enemy ; 
and that more than two-thirds is never destroyed when the enemy 
approaches. But to effect his object, it will be necessary for the 
Secretary to sanction it, and to give orders for the cotton to pass 
the lines of the army. The next was from the Secretary to the 
President, dated October thirtieth, which not only sanctioned 
Colonel Northrop's scheme, but went further, and embraced shoes 
and blankets for the Quartermaster-General. This letter inclosed 
both Foulkes's and Northrop's. They were all sent back to-day 
by the President, with his remarks. He hesitates, and does not 
concur. But says the Secretary will readily see the propriety of 
postponing such a resort until January and he hopes it may not 
be necessary then to depart from the settled policy of the govern- 
ment to forbear trading cotton to the Yankees, etc. etc. . 

Mr. Benjamin, Secretary of State, has given Mr. Dunuock per- 
mission to sell cotton to the Yankees and the rest of the world on 
the Atlantic and Gulf coast. Can it be that the President knows 
nothing of this ? It is obvious that the cotton sold by Mr. Dun- 
nock (who was always licensed by Mr. Benjamiu to trade with 
people in the enemy's country beyond the Potomac) will be very 
comfortable to the enemy. And it may aid Mr. Dunnock and 
others in accumulating a fortune. The Constitution defines trea- 
son to be giving aid and comfort to the enemy. I never supposed 
Mr. Randolph would suggest, nay urge, opening an illicit trade 
with "Butler, the Beast." This is the first really dark period of 
our struggle for independence. 

We have acres enough, and laborers enough, to subsist 
30,000,000 of people; and yet we have the spectacle of high func- 
tionaries, under Mr. Davis, urging the necessity of bartering cot- 
ton to the enemy for stores essential to the maintenance of the 
army 1 I cannot believe it is a necessity, but a destitution of that 
virtue necessary to achieve independence. If they had any knowl- 
edge of these things in Europe, they would cease their commend- 
ations of President Davis. 

Mr. Randolpn says, in his letter to the President, that trading 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 181 

with ports in possession of the enemy is forbidden to citizens, and 
not to the government ! The archives of the department show 
that this is not the first instance of the kind entertained by the 
Secretary. He has granted a license to citizens in Mobile to 
trade cotton in New Orleans for certain supplies in exchange, in 
exact compliance with Gen. Butler's proclamation. Did Pitt ever 
practice such things during his contest with Napoleon ? Did the 
Continental Government ever resort to such equivocal expedients ? 
A member of Washington's cabinet (and he, too, was a Randolph) 
once violated the "settled policy of the government," but he was 
instantly deprived of the seals of office. He acted under the ad- 
vice of Jefferson, who sought to destroy Washington ; and the 
present Secretary Randolph is a grandson of Jefferson. Wash- 
ington, the inflexible patriot, frowned indignantly upon every 
departure -from the path of rectitude. 

I can do nothing more than record these things, and WATCH ! 

NOVEMBER 2D, SUNDAY. I watch the daily orders of Adjutant 
and Inspector-Gen. Cooper. These, when "by command of the 
Secretary of War," are intelligible to any one, but not many are 
by his command. When simply "by order," they are promulgated 
by order of the President, without even consulting the Secretary; 
and they often annul the Secretary's orders. They are edicts, and 
sometimes thought very arbitrary ones. One of these orders says 
liquor shall not be introduced into the city ; and a poor fellow, 
the other day, was sentenced to the ball-and-chain for trying to 
bring hither his whisky from Petersburg. On the same day Gov. 
Brown, of Georgia, seized liquor in his State, in transitu over the 
railroad, belonging to the government 1 

Since the turning over of the passports to Generals Smith and 
Winder, I have resumed the position where all the letters to the 
department come through my hands. I read them, make brief 
statements of their contents, and send them to the Secretary. Thus 
all sent by the President to the department go through my hands, 
being epitomized in the same manner. 

The new Assistant Secretary, Judge Campbell, has been order- 
ing the Adjutant-General too peremptorily; and so Gen. Cooper 
has issued an order making Lieut.-Col. Deas an Acting Assistant 
' Secretary of War, thus creating an office in defiance of Congress. 

NOVEMBER 3o. The right wing of Lee's array has fallen back 

1G 



182 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

as far as Culpepper County, and the enemy advances. Active 
movements are speedily looked for; many suppose a desperate 
attempt to take Richmond. 

Our government has decided that no one shall be permitted to 
go North for thirty days. 

A requisition for heavy guns to defend Cumberland Gap, elicited 
from the Inspector of Ordnance a statement of the fact that we are 
"short" of guns for the defense of Richmond. 

There was a rumor yesterday that the enemy was marching in 
force on Petersburg. This, at all events, was premature. 

A letter from Hon. C. C. Clay, Senator, says there is much de- 
fection in North Alabama, and that many people are withdrawing 
themselves to avoid conscription. 

Just at this time, if it were not for Lincoln's proclamation, if 
the war were conducted according to the rules of civilized nations, 
I verily believe a very formidable party in favor of RECONSTRUC- 
TION might spring up in the South. With a united South, two 
million of Abolitionists could not subjugate us. 

NOVEMBER 4TH. An expose of funds in the hands of disburs- 
ing agents shows there are nearly seventy millions of dollars not 
accounted for ! 

The members of the legislature are fearful of an attack on the 
Southern Railroad, and asks that Gen. Mahone be sent to Peters- 
burg. 

The government is impressing flour at $12 per barrel, when it is 
selling at $24 ; and as the railroads are not allowed to transport 
any for private use, it may be hoped we shall have our bread 
cheaper some of these days. But will the government make itself 
popular with the people ? 

The Examiner says a clerk in the War Department is making 
money in the substitute business. If this be true, it is rank cor- 
ruption ! But, then, what is the cotton business ? 

The Chief of Ordnance Bureau, Col. J. Gorgas (Northern by 
birth), recommends the Secretary of War to remove the lighter 
guns, some sixty in number, from the lower tiers of Forts Sumter, 
Moultrie, and Morgan, for the defense of the rivers likely to be 
ascended by the enemy's gun-boats. 

I saw, to-day, the President's order to revoke the authority 
heretofore given Gov. Baylor to raise a brigade, aud in regard to 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 183 

his conduct as governor (ordering the massacre of the Indians 
after collecting them under pretense of forming a treaty of peace). 
The President suggests that nothing be done until the Gov- 
ernor be heard in his own defense. It was diabolical ! If it 
had been consummated, it would have affixed the stigma of infamy 
to the government in all future time, and might have doomed us 
to merited subjugation. 

NOVEMBER STH Major Ruffin, in the Commissary Depart- 
ment, says the army must go on half rations after the 1st of Jan- 
uary next. 

It is alleged that certain favorites of the government have a 
monopoly of transportation over the railroads, for purposes of 
speculation and extortion ! 

NOVEMBER GTH. I believe the commissaries and quartermas- 
ters are cheating the government. The Quartermaster-General 
sent in a paper, to-day, saying he did not need the contributions 
of clothes tendered by the people of Petersburg, but still would 
pay for them, ^hey were offered for nothing. 

The Commissary-General to-day says there is not wheat enough 
in Virginia (when a good crop was raised) for Gen. Lee's army, 
and unless he has millions in money and cotton, the army must dis- 
band for want of food. I don't believe it. 

There are 5000 negroes working on the fortifications near the 
city, and 2500 are to work on the Piedmont Railroad. 

We are all hoping that New York and other States declared 
against the Republicans, at the elections in the United States, on 
Tuesday last. Such a communication would be regarded as the 
harbinger of peace. We are all weary of the war, but must and 
will fight on, for no other alternative remains. Everything, how- 
ever, indicates that we are upon the eve of most interesting events. 
This is the time for England or France to come to the rescue, and 
enjoy a commercial monopoly for many years. I think the Sec- 
retary of War has abandoned the idea of trading cotton to the 
enemy. It might cost him his head. 

NOVEMBER 7TH. Yesterday I received from the agent of the 

City Councils fourteen pounds of salt, having seven persons in my 

family, including the servant. One pound to each member, per 

month, is allowed at 5 cts. per pound. The extortionists sell it at 

70 cts. per pound. One of them was drawing for his family. He 



184 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

confessed it ; but said he paid 50 cts. for the salt he sold at TO cts. 
Profit $10 per bushel I I sent an article to-day to the Enquirer, 
suggesting that fuel, bread, meat, etc. be furnished in the same 
manner. We shall soon be in a state of siege. 

Last night there was a heavy fall of snow. 

The authorities of Charleston, with the concurrence of Beaure- 
gard, advise all the non-combating population to leave the city, 
and remove their personal property. The city will be defended to 
the last extremity. 

What a change in the Executive Department ! Before the elec- 
tion, the President was accessible to all ; and even a member of 
Congress had no preference over the common citizen. But now 
there are six aids, cavalry colonels in rank and pay, and one of 
them an Englishman, who see the people, and permit only certain- 
ones to have access to th*e President. This looks like the begin- 
ning of an imperial court. But what may not its ending be ? ' 

I see that Mr. Hurlbut, incarcerated once as a spy, or as a 
writer for an Abolition paper in New York, and% Northern man 
himself, after being protected by Mr. Browne (the English A. B.C. 
of the President) and released by Mr. Benjamin from prison, has 
escaped to the North, and is out in a long article in the Times! 
He says he got a passport from Gen. Winder's Provost Marshal. 
Mr. James Lyons thought he had made H. a Southern man; what 
does he think now ? 

The "290" or Alabama, the ship bought in Europe, and com- 
manded by Capt. Semmes, C. S. N., is playing havoc with the com- 
merce of the United States. If we had a dozen of them, our foes 
would suffer incalculably, for they have an immense amount of 
shipping. I see Semmes had captured the Tonawanda, that used 
to lie at the foot of Walnut Street, Philadelphia; but he released 
her, first putting the master under bond to pay President Davis 
$80,000 after the war. I hope he will pay it, for I think the 
President will want the money. 

NOVEMBER STH. The European statesmen, declining interven- 
tion in our behalf, have, nevertheless, complimented our President 
by saying he has, at all events, "made a nation." He is pleased 
with this, I understand. But it is one of the errors which the wise 
men over the water are ever liable to fall into. The "nation " was 
made before the President existed : indeed, the nation made the 
President. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 185 

We have rumors of fighting near the mouth of the Shenandoah, 
and that our arms were successful. It is time both armies were in 
winter quarters. Snow still lies on the ground here. 

We have tidings from the North of the triumph of the Democrats 
in New York, New Jersey, etc. etc. This news produces great 
rejoicing, for it is hailed as the downfall of Republican despotism. 
Some think it will be followed by a speedy peace, or else that the 
European powers will recognize us without further delay. I should 
not be surprised if Seward were now to attempt to get the start of 
England and France, and cause oar recognition by the United 
States. I am sure the Abolitionists cannot now get their million 
men. The drafting must be a failure. 

The Governor of Mississippi (Pettus) informs the President that 
a Frenchman, perhaps a Jew, proposes to trade salt for cotton 
ten sacks of the first for one of the latter. The Governor says 
he don't know that he has received the consent of "Butler, the 
Beast" (but he knows the trade is impossible without it), but that 
is no business of his. He urges the traffic. And the President 
has consented to it, and given him power to conduct the exchange 
in spite of the military authorities. The President says, however, 
that twenty sacks of salt ought to be given for one of cotton. 
Salt is worth in New Orleans about one dollar a sack, cotton $160 
per bale. The President informed the Secretary of what had 
been done, and sends him a copy of his dispatch to Gov. Pettus. 
He don't even ask Mr. Randolph's opinion. 

NOVEMBER OTH. It is too true that Charleston, Va., and the great 
Kanawha salt works have been abandoned by Gen. Echols for the 
want of an adequate force to hold them. If the President had 
only taken Gen. Lee's advice a month ago, and ordered a few thou- 
sand more men there, under the command of Gen. Ed. Johnson, 
we should have kept possession of the works. The President may 
seem to be a good nation-maker in the eyes of distant statesmen, but 
he does not seem to be a good salt-maker for the nation. The works 
he has just relinquished to the^enemy manufacture 7000 bushels 
of salt per day two million and a half a year an ample supply 
for the entire population of the Confederacy, and an object ade- 
quate to the maintenance of an array of 50,000 in that valley. 
Besides, the troops necessary for its occupation will soon be in 
winter quarters, and quite as expensive to the government as if in 

16* 



186 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

the valley. A Caesar, a Napoleon, a Pitt, and a Washington, all 
great nation-makers, would have deemed this work worthy their 
attention. 

Only three days ago the President wrote to the Secretary that 
the idea of trading cotton to the enemy must be postponed until 
the first of January, and perhaps indefinitely, but now he informs 
Mr. Randolph that he has sent the requisite authority to his friend, 
Gov. Pettus, to launch out in that trade. 

No, the people have made the nation. It is a people's war, and 
it is the momentum of a united, patriotic people, which carries 
everything with it. Our brave men win victories under adverse 
circumstances, and often under incompetent officers, and the people 
feed and clothe the armies in spite of the shortcomings of dishon- 
est commissaries and quartermasters. They are now sending ten 
thousand pairs of shoes to Lee's army in opposition to the will of 
the Jew Myers, Quartermaster- General, who says everything must 
be contracted and paid for by his agents, according to red-tape 
rule and regulation. 

The weather continues cold, 38, and snow still lies on the 
ground. This must produce a cessation of hostilities, and afford 
Lincoln's drafted recruits opportunity for meditation. 

If it be true that the Democrats have carried the day in the 
North, I think the war is approaching a termination. 

NOVEMBER IOTH. A day or two ago some soldiers marched 
through the city without shoes, in the snow. A committee of cit- 
izens to-day obtained an order from the War Department, for the 
impressment of all the boots, shoes, blankets, and overcoats in the 
shops. What a commotion among the Jews 1 

It is certain that the enemy are advancing upon Culpepper, on 
the way to Richmond, in great force. This we have in letters from 
Geu. Lee, dated 7th inst, near Culpepper C. H. He says the 
enemy's cavalry is very numerous, while our horses have the "sore 
tongue," and tender hoofs. Lee has ordered the stores, etc. from 
Gordonsville to Lynchburg. He says Jackson may possibly march 
through one of the gaps and fall upon the enemy's flank, and inti- 
mates that an opportunity may be offered to strike the invaders "a 
blow." 

Yesterday, Sunday, a cavalry company dashed into Fredericks- 
burg, and after robbing the stores, and reporting that the Demo- 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 187 

crats had swept the North, that England and France had recog- 
nized us, etc., they dashed out again. 

The President sent to the department to day, without comment, 
a defense by Col. Baylor of his atrocious order for the massacre of 
the Indians. It was in a Texas paper. Baylor acknowledges its 
genuineness, and says the Apaches murdered our people invited to 
make a treaty with them, and he says it is his intention to retaliate 
by extermination of them. 

Another proposition was received by the government to-day 
from a French firm of New Orleans merchants, to furnish us salt, 
meat, shoes, blankets, etc., in unlimited quantities, and guarantee 
their delivery, if we will allow them, with the proceeds of salt, the 
privilege ofbuying cotton on the Mississippi River, and they will, 
moreover, freight French ships above New Orleans, and guarantee 
that not a bale shall be landed in any U. S. port. Is it not 
certain that " Butler, the Beast," is a party to the speculation ? 
This is a strong temptation, and we shall see what response our 
government will make to this proposition to violate an act of 
Congress. 

NOVEMBER HTH. More projects from the Southwest. Mr. 
Jno. A. S. has just arrived from New Orleans, where, he states 
in his communication to the government, he had interviews and 
correspondence with the TJ. S. authorities, Butler, etc., and they 
had given him positive assurances that he will be permitted to take 
any supplies to the planters (excepting arms and ammunition) 
in exchange for cotton, which may be shipped to any part of the 
world. S. says that Butler will let us have anything for a bribe. 
No doubt ! And Mr.'L., President of the L. Bank, writes that he 
will afford facilities to Mr. S It remains to be seen what our 
government will do in these matters. They smack of treason. 

It is said heavy firing was heard yesterday in the direction of 
Culpepper C. H., and it is supposed a battle is in progress to-day. 
No danger of it. 

NOVEMBER 12TH. The heavy firing heard did no execution. 
Letters from Gen. Lee indicate no battle, unless the enemy should 
make an egregious blunder. He says he has not half men enough 
to resist McClellan's advance with his mighty army, and prefers 
manoeuvring to risking his army. He says three-fourths of our 
caralry horses are sick with sore-tongue, and their hoofs are fall- 



188 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

ing off, and the soldiers are, not fed and clad as they should be. 
He urges the sending of supplies to Gordonsville. 

And we have news of a simultaneous advance of Northern 
armies everywhere; and everywhere we have the same story of 
deficiency of men and provisions. North and south, east and 
west of us, the enemy is reported advancing. 

Soon we shall have every one blaming the Secretary of War for 
the deficiency of men, and of quartermaster and commissary stores. 

The Commissary- General, backed by the Secretary of War, 
made another effort to-day to obtain the President's permission to 
trade cotton with "Butler, the Beast." But the President and 
Gov. Pettus will manage that little matter without their assist- 
ance. 

Major RunWs (Commissary's Bureau) statement of the alarm- 
ing prospects ahead, unless provisions be obtained outside of the 
Confederacy (for cotton), was induced by reports from New 
Orleans. A man was in the office to-day exhibiting Butler's 
passport, and making assurances that all the Yankee generals are 
for sale for cotton. Butler will make a fortune and so will 
some of our great men. Butler says the reason he don't send 
troops into the interior is that he is afraid we will burn the 
cotton. 

It is reported that a fleet of the enemy's gun-boats are in the 
James River. 

NOVEMBER 13TH. The President has rebuked the Secretary of 
War in round terms for ordering Gen. Holmes to assume the com- 
mand on this side the Mississippi. Perhaps Mr. Randolph has 
resolved to be really Secretary. This is the first thing I have 
ever known him to do without previously obtaining the Presi- 
dent's sanction and it must be confessed, it was a matter of some 
gravity and importance. Of course it will be countermanded. I 
have not been in the Secretary's office yet, to see if there is an 
envelope on his table directed to the President marked "Imme- 
diate." But he has not been to see the President and that may 
be significant, as this is the usual day. 

A gentleman, arrived to-day from Maryland, reports that Gen. 
McClellan has been removed, and the command given to Burn- 
side I He says, moreover, that this change has given umbrage to 
the army. This may be our deliverance; for if McClellau had 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 189 

been let alone two weeks longer (provided he ascertained our 
present condition), he might have captured Richmond, which 
would be holding all Eastern and much of Central Virginia, 
This blunder seems providential. 

We learn, also, that the Democracy have carried Illinois, Mr. 
Lincoln's own State, by a very large majority. This is hailed 
with gladness by our people; and if there should be a "rebellion 
in the North," as the Tribune predicts, this intervention of the 
Democrats will be regarded altogether in our favor. Let them 
put down the radical Abolitionists, and then, no doubt, they will 
recover some of our trade. It will mortify the Republicans, here- 
after, when the smoke clears away, to learn that Gen. Butler was 
trading supplies.for our army during this November, 1862 and it 
will surprise our secessionists to learn that our government is 
trading him cotton ! 

NOVEMBER HTH. An order has gone forth to-day from the 
Secretary of War, that no more flour or wheat shall leave the 
States. This order was given some time ago then relaxed, and 
now reissued. How soon will he revoke it again ? 

Never before did such little men rule such a great people. Our 
rulers are like children or drunken men riding docile horses, that 
absolutely keep the riders from falling off by swaying to the right 
and left, and preserving an equilibrium. There is no rule for any- 
thing, and no stability in any policy. 

To-day more propositions from Frenchmen (in New Orleans) 
have been received. Butler is preparing to do a great business 
and no objection to the illicit traffic is filed by the Secretaries of 
State or Treasury. 

Yesterday one of the President's servants was arrested for 
stealing Treasury notes. The Treasury Department is just under 
the Executive Department; and this negro (slave) has been used 
by the President to take important papers to the departments. 
The amount abstracted was $5000 unsigned but some one, per- 
haps the negro, for he is educated, forged the Register's and 
Treasurer's names. 

I saw Gen. J. E. Johnston standing idle in the street to-day. 

NOVEMBER 15TH. "Now, by St. George, the work goes 
bravely on 1" Another letter on my desk from the President to 
the Secretary. Well, being in an official envelope, it was ray duty 



100 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

to open it, note its contents, and send it to the Secretary. The 
Secretary has been responding to the short espistle he received 
yesterday. It appears he could not clearly understand its purport. 
But the President has used such plain language in this, that it 
must be impossible to misunderstand him. He says that the trans- 
ferring of generals commanding important military districts, with- 
out conference with him and his concurrence ; and of high dis- 
bursing officers; and, above all, the making of appointments with- 
out his knowledge and consent, are prerogatives that do not 
pertain to the Secretary of War in the first instance ; and can 
only be exercised by him under the direction of the Chief Execu- 
tive. In regard to appointments, especially, the President has no 
constitutional authority nor any disposition to transfer the power. 
He discussed thefr relative duties, for the benefit of all future 
Secretaries, I suppose. 

But it looks like a rupture. It seems, then, after acting some 
eight months merely in the humble capacity of clerk, Mr. Ran- 
dolph has all at once essayed to act the PRESIDENT. 

The Secretary of War did not go to the President's closet to- 
day. This is the third day he has absented himself. Such- inci- 
dents as these preceded the resignation of Mr. Walker. It is a 
critical time, and the Secretary of War ought to confer freely 
with the President. 

NOVEMBER 16m, SUNDAY. Yesterday the Secretary of War 
resigned his office, and his resignation was promptly accepted by 
the President. 

NOVEMBER IfTH. A profound sensation has been produced in 
the outside world by the resignation of Mr. Randolph ; and most 
of the people and the press seem inclined to denounce the Presi- 
dent, for they know not what. In this matter the President is not 
. to blame ; but the Secretary has acted either a very fo'olish or a 
very desperate part. It appears that he wrote a note in reply to 
the last letter of the President, stating that as no discretion was 
allowed him in such matters as were referred to by the President, 
he begged respectfully to tender his resignation. The President 
responded, briefly, that inasmuch as the Secretary declined acting 
any longer as one of his constitutional advisers, and also declined 
a personal conference, no alternative remained but to accept his 
resignation. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 191 

Randolph's friends would make it appear that he resigned in 
consequence of being restricted in his action ; but he knows very 
well that the latitude allowed him became less and less circum- 
scribed ; and that, hitherto, he was well content to operate within 
the prescribed limits. Therefore, if it was not a silly caprice, it was 
a deliberate purpose, to escape a cloud of odium he knew must 
sooner or later burst around him. 

A letter from Gen. Magruder, dated 10th inst., at Jackson, 
Mississippi, intimates that we shall lose Holly Springs. He has 
also been in Mobile, and doubts whether that city can be success- 
fully defended by Gen. Forney, whose liver is diseased, and 
memory impaired. He recommends that Brig. -Gen. Whiting be 
promoted, and assigned to the command in place of Forney, re- 
lieved. 

A letter from Gen. Whiting, near Wilmington, dated 13th. inst., 
expresses serious apprehensions whether that place can be held 
against a determined attack, unless a supporting force of 10,000 
men be sent there immediately. It is in the command of Major- 
Gen. G. A. Smith. 

More propositions to ship cotton in exchange for the supplies 
needed by the country. The President has no objection to ac- 
cepting them all, provided the cotton don't go to any of the 
enemy's ports. How can it be possible to avoid this liability, if 
the cotton be shipped from the Mississippi River ? 

NOVEMBER 18TH. Well, the President is a bold man ! He has 
put in Randolph's place, temporarily at least, Major-Gen. Gus- 
tavus W. Smith who was Street Commissioner in the City of 
New York, on the day that Capt. G. W. Randolph was fighting 
the New Yorkers at Bethel ! 

Gen. Wise is out in a card, stating that in response to a requi- 
sition for shoes for his suffering troops, Quartermaster- Gen. A. C. 
Myers said, " Let them suffer." 

The enemy attacked Fredericksburg yesterday, and there was 
some skirmishing, the result of which we have not heard. It is 
rumored they are fighting there to-day. We have but few regi- 
ments between here and F*redericksburg. 

NOVEMBER 19TH. Hon. James A. Seddon (Va.) has been ap- 
pointed Secretary of War. He is an able man (purely a civilian), 
and was member of our Revolutionary Convention, at Metropoli- 



192 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

tan Hall, 16th April, 1861. But some thought him then rather 
inclined to restrain than to urge decisive action. He is an orator, 
rich, and frail in health. He will not remain long in office if he 
attempts to perform all the duties. 

Two letters were received from Gen. Lee to-day. Both came 
unsealed and open, an omission of his adjutant-general, Mason. 
The first inclines to the belief that Burnside intends to embark his 
army for the south side of James River, to operate probably in 
Eastern North Carolina. 

The second, dated 17th inst. 6^ P.M., says the scouts report 
large masses advancing on Fredericksburg, and it may be Burn- 
side's purpose to make that town his base of operations. (Per- 
haps for a pleasant excursion to Richmond.) Three brigades of 
the enemy had certainly marched to Fredericksburg. A division 
of Longstreet's corps were marched thither yesterday, 18th, at 
early dawn. Lee says if the reports of the scouts be confirmed, 
the entire corps will follow immediately. And he adds: "Before 
the enemy's trains can leave Fredericksburg (for Richmond) this t 
whole army will be in position." These letters were sent imme- 
diately to the President. 

A letter from Gen. Holmes calls for an immediate supply of 
funds ($24,000,000) for the trans- Mississippi Department. A letter 
from Geu. Pike says if Gen. Hindman (Ark.) is to control there, 
the Indian Country will be lost. 

We shall soon have a solution of Burnside's intenti&ns. Lee is 
in spirits. He knows Burnside can be easily beaten with greatly 
inferior numbers. 

We hear of sanguinary acts in Missouri ten men (civilians) 
being shot in retaliation for one killed by our rangers. These 
acts exasperate our people, and will stimulate them to a heroic 
defense. 

The cars this afternoon from the vicinity of Fredericksburg were 
crowded with negroes, having bundles of clothing, etc., their 
owners sending them hither to escape the enemy. A frightened 
Jew, who came in the train, said there was an army of 100,000 
near Fredericksburg, and we should he*ar more in a few days. I 
doubt it not. 

Salt sold yesterday at auction for $1.10 per pound. Boots are 
now bringing $50 per pair ; candles (tallow) 75 cts. per pound ; but- 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 193 

ter $2.00 per pound. Clothing is almost unattainable. We are 
all looking shabby enough. 

Mr. K., the young Chief of the Bureau, who carae in with Mr. 
Randolph, declines the honor of going out with him, to the great 
chagrin of several anxious applicants. It is an office "for life." 

I shall despair of success unless the President puts a stop to 
Gen. Winder's passport operations, for, if the enemy be kept ad- 
vised of our destitute condition, there will be no relaxation of 
efforts to subjugate us. And Europe, too, will refuse to recognize 
us. I believe there are traitors in high places here who encourage 
the belief in the North and in Europe that we must soon succumb. 
And some few of our influential great men might be disposed to 
favor reconstruction of the Union on the basis of the Democratic 
party which has just carried the elections in the North. 

Everything depends upon the result of approaching military 
operations. If the enemy be defeated, and the Democrats of the 
North should call for a National Convention but why anticipate ? 

NOVEMBER 20TH. A letter from Brig. H. Marshall, Abingdon, 
Ky., in reply to one from the Secretary, says his Kentuckians are 
not willing to be made Confederate hog-drivers, but they will pro- 
tect the commissary's men in collecting and removing the hogs. 
Gen. M. criticises Gen. Bragg's campaign very severely. He says 
the people of Kentucky looked upon their fleeting presence as a 
horse-show, or military pageantry, and not as indicating the stern 
reality of war. Hence they did not rise in arms, and hence their 
diffidence in following the fortunes of the new Confederacy. Gen. 
M. asks if it is the purpose of the government to abandon Ken- 
tucky, and if so, is he not funclus officio, being a Kentucky gen- 
eral, commanding Kentucky troops ? 

Col. Myers has placed on file in the department a denial of 
having said to Gen. Wise's quartermaster, "Let them suffer." 

Several ladies, near relatives of Judge Campbell, Assistant Sec- 
retary of War, came over yesterday under flag of truce. They 
lived, I believe, in Alexandria. 

Another requisition has been made by the engineer for 5000 
negroes to work on the fortifications of Richmond. 

No letters were received from Gen. Lee to-day, and he may be 
busy in the field. Accounts say the enemy is planting batteries 
.on the heights opposite Fredericksburg. 

17 



194 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

It has been raining occasionally the last day or two. I hope 
the ground is soft, and the mud deep ; if so, Burnside cannot move 
on Richmond, and. we shall have time to prepare for "contingen- 
cies." 

Yesterday salt sold at auction for $1.30 per pound. We are 
getting into a pretty extreme condition. 

NOVEMBER 21s r r. It rained all night, which may extinguish 
Burnside's ardent fire. He cannot drag his wagons and artillery 
through the melting snow, and when it diies we may look for an- 
other rain. 

The new Secretary is not yet in his seat. It is generally sup- 
posed he will accept. 

President Davis hesitates to retaliate life for life in regard to the 
Missouri military executions. 

Common shirting cotton, and Yankee calico, that used to sell 
at 12^ cts. per yard, is now $1.75 ! What a temptation for the 
Northern manufacturers ! What a rush of trade there would be if 
peace should occur suddenly ! And what a party there would be 
in the South for peace (and unity with Northern Democrats) if 
the war were waged somewhat differently. The excesses -of the 
Republicans compel our people to be almost a unit. This is all 
the better for us. Still, we are in quite a bad way now, God 
knows ! 

The passengers by the cars from Fredericksburg this morning 
report that Gen. Patrick (Federal) came over under a flag of 
truce, demanding the surrender of the town, which was refused by 
Gen. Lee, in compliance with the unanimous sentiments of the 
people. Gen. Patrick, it is stated, said if it were not surrendered 
by 9 A.M. to-day, it would be shelled. 

Mr. Dargan, M. C., writes to the President from Mobile that 
the inhabitants of that city are in an awful condition. Meal is 
selling for $3.50 per bushel, and wood at $15 per cord, and that the 
people are afraid to bring supplies, apprehending that the govern- 
ment agents will seize them. The President (thanks to him !) has 
ordered that interference with domestic trade must not be per- 
mitted. 

Mr. Seddon has taken his seat. He has, at least, a manly ap- 
pearance his predecessor was said to look like a m y. 

The President has ordered our generals in Missouri, if the Yan- 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 195 

kee accounts of the executions of our people be true, to execute 
the next ten Federal officers taken in that State. 

The Enquirer, to-day, publishes Col. Baylor's order to execute 
the Indians in Arizona, coupled with Mr. Randolph's condemna- 
tion of the act. Who furnished this for publication ? 

It is rumored that Fredericksburg is in flames, shelled by the 
enemy. We will know how true this is before night. 

NOVEMBER 23o. The cars which came in from the North last 
night brought a great many women, children, and negroes from 
Fredericksburg and its vicinity. The benevolent and patriotic 
citizens here had, I believe, made some provision for their accom- 
modation. But the enemy had not yet shelled the town. 

There is a rumor that Jackson was to appear somewhere in the 
rear of the enemy, and that the Federal stores which could not be 
moved with the army had been burnt at Manassas. 

Yesterday the President remitted the sentence of a poor lad, 
sentenced to ball-and-chain for six months, for cowardice, etc. He 
had endured the penalty three months. I like this act, for the boy 
had enlisted without the consent of his parents, and was only six- 
teen years of age. 

J. R. Anderson & Co. (having drawn $500,000 recently on the 
contract) have failed to furnish armor for the gun-boats the 
excuse being that iron could not be had for their rolling-mills. The 
President has ordered the Secretaries of the Navy and War to 
consult on the propriety of taking railroad iron, on certain tracks, 
for that purpose. 

NOVEMBER 24TH. Fredericksburg not shelled yet; but the 
women and children are flying hither. The enemy fired on a train 
of women and children yesterday, supposing the cars (baggage) 
were conveying military stores. The Northern press says Burn- 
side is determined to force his way, directly from the Rappahan- 
nock to Richmond, by virtue of superior numbers. The thing Lee 
desires him to attempt 

The enemy are landing troops at Newport News, and we shall 
soon hear of gun-boats and transports in the James River. But 
no one is dismayed. We have supped on horrors so long, that 
danger now is an accustomed condiment. Blood will flow in tor- 
rents, and God will award the victory. 

Another letter from Gen. Whiting says there is every reason to 



196 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

suppose that Wilmington will be attacked immediately, and if re- 
inforcements (1 0,000) be not sent him, the place cannot be defended 
against a land assault. Nor is this all : for if the city falls, with 
the present force only to defend it, none of our men can escape. 
There is no repose for us 1 

NOVEMBER 25TH. Fredericksburg is not shelled yet ; and, more- 
over, the enemy have apologized for the firing at the train contain- 
ing women and children. Affairs remain in statu quo the mayor 
and military authorities agreeing that the town shall furnish neither 
aid nor comfort to the Confederate army, and the Federals agreeing 
not to shell it for the present. 

Gen. Corcoran, last year a prisoner in this city, has landed his 
Irish brigade at Newport News. It is probable we shall be assailed 
from several directions simultaneously. 

No beggars can be found in the streets of this city. No cry 
of distress is heard, although it prevails extensively. High officers 
of the government have no fuel in their houses, and give nearly 
$20 per cord for wood for cooking purposes. And yet there are 
millions of tons of coal almost under the very city ! 

NOVEMBER 26TH. No fighting on the Rappahannock yet, that 
I hear of; and it is said the enemy are moving farther down the 
river. Can they mean to cross? Nothing more is heard of Gen. 
Corcoran, with his Irish bogtrotters, on the Peninsula. 

The government has realized 50,000 pounds of leather from two 
counties in Eastern North Carolina, in danger of falling into the 
hands of the enemy. This convinces me that there is abundance 
of leather in the South, if it were properly distributed. It is held, 
like everything else, by speculators, for extortioners' profits. The 
government might remedy the evils, and remove the distresses of 
the people; but instead of doing so, the bureaus aggravate them 
by capricious seizures, and tyrannical restrictions on transporta- 
tion. Letters are coming in from every quarter complaining of 
the despotic acts of government agents. 

Mr. J. Foulkes writes another letter to the department on his 
cotton scheme. He says it must be embraced now or never, as 
the enemy will soon make such dispositions as would prevent his 
getting supplies through their lines. The Commissary- General 
approves, and the late Secretary approved ; but what will the new 
one do ? The President is non-committal. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 197 

What a blunder France and England made in hesitating to 
espouse our cause 1 They might have had any commercial ad- 
vantages. 

NOVEMBER 27TH. Some of the late Secretary's friends are 
hinting that affairs will go amiss now, as if he would have pre- 
vented any disaster! Who gave up Norfolk? That was a calam- 
itous blunder ! Letters from North Carolina are distressing 
enough. They say, but for the influence of Gov. Vance, the 
legislature would favor reconstruction ! 

Gen. Marshall writes lugubriously. He says his men are all 
barefoot. 

Gen. Magruder writes that Pemberton has only 20,000 men, 
and should have 50,000 more at once else the Mississippi Valley 
will be lost, and the cause ruined. He thinks there should be a 
concentration of troops there immediately, no matter how much 
other places might suffer; the enemy beaten, and the Mississippi 
secured at all hazards. If not, Mobile is lost, and perhaps Mont- 
gomery, as well as Vicksburg, Holly Springs, etc. 

One of our paroled men from Washington writes the President 
that, on the 6th instant, Burnside had but seventy regiments ; and 
the President seemed to credit it ! The idea of Burnside advanc- 
ing with seventy regiments is absurd. But how many absurd 
ideas have been entertained by the government, and have influ- 
enced it ! Nous verrons. 

NOVEMBER 28m. All is quiet on the Rappahannock ; the 
enemy reported to be extending his line up the river some twenty 
miles, intending to find a passage. He might have come over last 
week but for a ruse of Gen. Lee, who appeared near Fredericks- 
burg twenty-four hours in advance of the array. His presence 
deceived Burnside, who took it for granted that our general was 
at the head of his army ! 

M. Paul carried the day yesterday, in the Confederate Court, in 
the matter of $2,000,000 worth of tobacco, which, under pretense 
of its belonging to French citizens (though bought by Belmont, 
of New York, an alien enemy), is rescued from sequestration. In 
other words, the recognition of M. Paul as Consul, and the valid- 
ity of his demands, deprives the Confederate Government of two 
millions; and really acknowledges the exequatur ctf the United 

17* 



198 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

States, as M. Paul is not Consul to the Confederate States but to 
the United States. This looks like submission ; and a great fee 
has been realized by somebody. If the enemy were to take Rich- 
mond, this tobacco would be destroyed by the military. 

Gen. Joseph E. Johnston is assigned to the command of the 
army of the West. 

To-day we have a dispatch from Gov. Pettus, saying authority 
to pass cotton through the lines of the army, and for salt to have 
ingress, must be given immediately. The President directs the 
Secretary to transmit orders to the generals to that effect. He 
says the cotton is to go to France without touching any port in 
the possession of the enemy. 

NOVEMBER 29TH. The Quartermaster-General publishes a no- 
tice that he will receive and distribute contributions of clothing, 
etc. to the army, and even pay for the shirts $1 each ! Shirts are 
selling at $12. The people will not trust him to convey the cloth- 
ing to their sons and brothers, and so the army must suffer on. 
But he is getting in bad odor. A gentleman in Alabama writes 
that his agents are speculating in food : the President tells the 
Secretary to demand explanations, and the Secretary does so.. Col. 
Myers fails, I think, to make the exhibit required, and it may be 
the worse for him. 

I see by the papers that another of Gen. Winder's police has 
escaped to Washington City, and is now acting as a Federal de- 
tective. And yet many similar traitors are retained in service 
here ! 

The Governor of North Carolina writes the President that his 
State intends to organize an army of 10,000 men for its own de- 
fense, besides her sixty regiments in the Confederate States ser- 
vice; and asks if the Confederate States Government can furnish 
any arms, etc. The President sends this to the Secretary of War, 
for his advice. He wants to know Mr. Seddon's views on the 
subject a delicate and embarrassing predicament for the new 
Secretary, truly ! He must know that the President frowns on all 
military organizations not under his own control, and that he 
counteracted all Gen. Floyd's efforts to raise a division under 
State authority. Beware, Mr. Seddon ! The President is & little 
particular concerning his prerogatives ; and by the advice you 
now give, you stand or fall. What is North Carolina to the Em- 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 199 

pire ? You tread on dangerous ground. Forget your old State- 
Rights doctrine, or off goes your head. 

NOVEMBER 30TH. It is said there is more concern manifested 
in the government here on the indications that the States mean 
to organize armies of non-conscripts for their own defense, than 
for any demonstration of the enemy. The election of Graham 
Confederate States Senator in North Carolina, and of H. Y. 
Johnson in Georgia, causes some uneasiness. These men were 
not original secessionists, and have been the objects of aversion, 
if not of proscription, by the men who secured position in the 
Confederate States Government. Nevertheless, they are able 
men, and as true to Southern independence as any. But they are 
opposed to despotic usurpation and their election seems like a 
rebuke ad condemnation of military usurpation. 

From all sections of the Confederacy complaints are coming in 
that the military agents of the bureaus are oppressing the people; 
and the belief is expressed by many, that a sentiment is prevailing 
inimical to the government itself. ^ 



CHAPTER XXI. 

% 

The great crisis at hand. The rage for speculation raises its head. Great 
battle of Fredericksburg. The States called on for supplies. Randolph 
resigns as Brigadier-General. South Carolina honor. Loss at Frede- 
ricksburg. Great contracts. Lee's ammunition bad. Small-pox here. 

DECEMBER IST, MONDAY. There is a rumor to-day that we are 
upon the eve of a great battle on the Rappahannock. I doubt 
it not. 

I am sorry to see that Col. McRae, a gallant officer, has resigned 
his commission, charging the President with partiality in appoint- 
ing junior officers, and even his subordinates, brigadiers over his 
head. Nevertheless, he tenders his services to the Governor of 
his State, and will be made a general. But where will this end ? 
I fear in an issue between the State and Confederate authorities. 

The news from Europe is not encouraging. France is willing 



200 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

to interfere, and Russia is ready to participate in friendly media- 
tion to stay the effusion of blood but England seems afraid of 
giving offense to the United States. They refer to the then ap- 
proaching elections in the North, and lay some stress on the antici- 
pated change in public opinion. Popular opinion ! What is it 
worth in the eyes of European powers ? If it be of any value, and 
if the voice of the people should be allowed to determine such 
contests, why not leave it to a vote of the Southern people to de- 
cide under which government they will live? But why make such 
an appeal to monarchies, while the Republican or Democratic 
government of the North refuses to permit 8,000,000 of people to 
have the government they unanimously prefer ? Can it be pos- 
sible that the United States are ignorant of popular sentiment 
here ? I fear so ; I fear a few traitors in our midst contrive to 
deceive even the Government at Washington. Else why a pro- 
longation of the war ? They ought to know that, under almost 
any conceivable adverse circumstances, we can maintain the war 
twenty^fcars. And if our lines should be everywhere broken, and 
our country overrun it would require a half million soldiers to 
hold us down, and this would cost the United States $500,000,000 
per annum. 

God speed the day of peace ! Our patriotism is mainly in the 
army and among the ladies of the South. The avarice and cupidity 
of the men at home, could only be excelled by ravenous wolves ; 
and most of our sufferings are fully deserved. Where a people 
will not have mercy on one another, how can they expect mercy ? 
They depreciate the Confederate notes by charging from $20 to 
$40 per bbl. for flour; $3.50 per bushel for meal ; $2 per Ib. for 
butter; $20 per cord for wood, etc. When we shall have peace, 
let the extortionists be remembered ! let an indelible stigma be 
branded upon them. 

A portion of the people look like vagabonds. We see men and 
women and children in the streets in dingy and dilapidated clothes ; 
and some seem gaunt and pale with hunger the speculators, and 
thieving quartermasters and commissaries only, looking sleek and 
comfortable. If this state of things continue a year or so longer, 
they will have their reward. There will be governmental bank- 
ruptcy, and all their gains will turn to dust and ashes, dust and 
ashes ! 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 201 

And I learn they are without shirts in the North cotton being 
unattainable. A universal madness rules the hour ! Why not 
throw aside the instruments of death, and exchange commodities 
with each other ? Subjugation is an impossibility. Then why 
not strive for the possible and the good in the paths of peace ? 
The Quakers are the wisest people, after all. I shall turn Quaker 
after this war, in one sense, and strive to convince the world that 
war is the worst remedy for evils ever invented and MAN the 
most dangerous animal ever created. 

DECEMBER 2o There was skirmishing this morning on the 
line of the Rappahannock. The Chief of Ordnance is ordering 
arms and ammunition to Gen. Pemberton, in Mississippi. This 
indicates a battle in the Southwest. 

A writer in the London Times, who is from Nashville, Tenn., 
says the South is willing to go into Convention with the North, 
and be bound by its decisions. I doubt that. 

But the Enquirer to-day contains a communication from T. E. 
Chambliss, not the Virginia member of Congress, proposing the 
election of Commissioners from North and South, to put an end 
to the war. What can this mean but reconstruction on the old 
Democratic basis ? It will not meet with favor, unless we meet 
great reverses this winter. Still, but few have faith in foreign in- 
tervention, to terminate the war ; and there is a growing party 
both in the North and the South opposed to its indefinite prolonga- 
tion. If we beat Burnside, / think it will be the last battle of 
magnitude. If he beats us, no one can see the end of the struggle. 
But from every State complaints are made against the military 
agents of the Confederate Government, for their high-handed op- 
pressions. We may split up into separate States, and then con- 
tinue the war but it will be a sad day for us ! The President 
ought to change his cabinet immediately, and then change his 
policy. He should cultivate the friendship and support of the 
people, and be strong in their affections, if he would rule with a 
strong hand. If he offends and exasperates them, they will break 
his power to pieces. And he should not attempt to destroy, nor 
permit others to destroy, the popular leaders. That way lies his 
own destruction. 

DECEMBER 3D. One of the President's Aids, Mr. Johnston, has 
asked the Secretary's permission for Mrs. E. B. -Hoge, Mrs. M. 



202 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

Anderson, Miss Judith Tenable, and Mrs. R. J. Breckinridge, 
with children and servants, to leave Richmond by flag of truce, 
and proceed to their homes in Kentucky. Of course it will be 
granted the President sanctions it, but does not commit himself 
by ordering it. 

There was no fighting on the Rappahannock yesterday, and no 
rumors to-day. 

Letters were received from Gen. Lee to-day. He says several 
thousand of his men are barefoot ! He suggests that shoes be 
taken from the extortioners at a fair price. That is right. He 
also recommends a rule of the department putting cavalry on foot 
when they cannot furnish good horses, and mounting infantry that 
can and will procure them. This would cause better care to be 
taken of horses. Gen. Lee also writes for more arms which may 
indicate a battle. But the weather is getting bad again, and the 
roads will not admit of marching. 

Mr. Gastrell, M. C., writes to the Secretary of War for per- 
mission for Messrs. Frank and Gernot, a Jew firm of Augusta, 
Ga., to bring through the lines a stock of goods they have just 
purchased of the Yankees in Memphis. Being a member of Con- 
gress, I think his request will be granted. And if all such applica- 
tions be granted, I think money-making will soon absorb the war, 
and bring down the prices of goods. 

We are a confident people. There are no symptoms of trepida- 
tion, although a hostile army of 150,000 men is now within two 
day's march of our capital. A few of guilty consciences, the ex- 
tortioners, may feel alarm but not the women and children. 
They reflect that over one hundred thousand of the enemy were 
within four miles of the city .last spring and summer and were 
repulsed. 

The negroes are the best-clad people in the South. They have 
their Sunday clothing, and the half-worn garments of their mas- 
ters and mistresses ; and having worn these but once a week, they 
have a decidedly fresher aspect than the dresses of their owners. 
They are well fed, too, at any cost, and present a happy appear- 
ance. And they are happy. It is a great mistake of the Aboli- 
tionists, in supposing the slaves hail their coming with delight; 
on the contrary, nearly all the negroes regard their approach with 
horror. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 203 

It might be well for the South if 500,000 of the slaves were 
suddenly emancipated. The loss would not be felt and the North 
would soon be conscious of having gained nothing ! My friend, 
Dr. Powell, near the city, abandoned his farm last summer, when 
it was partly in possession of the enemy, leaving fifty negroes on 
it which he could have sold for $50,000. They promised not to 
leave him, and they kept- their word. Judge Donnell, in North 
Carolina, has left his plantation with several hundred thousand 
dollars worth on it rather risking their loss than to sell them. 

DECEMBER 4TH. All is quiet (before the storm) on the Rappa- 
hannock, Gen. Jackson's corps being some twenty miles lower 
down the river than Longstreet's. It is said Burnside has been 
removed already and Hooker given the command. 

Gen. S. Cooper takes sides with Col. Myers against Gen. Wise. 
Geu. W.'s letter of complaint of the words, "Let them suffer," was 
referred to Gen. C., who insisted upon sending the letter to the 
Quartermaster- General before either the Secretary or the Presi- 
dent saw it, and it was done. Why 'do the Northern men here 
hate Wise ? 

Gen. Lee dispatches to-day that there is a very large amount of 
corn in the Kappahannock Valley, which can be procured, if wagons 
be sent from Richmond. What does this mean ? That the enemy 
will come over and get it if we do not take it away ? 

A letter from the President of the Graniteville Cotton Mills, 
complains that />nly 75 per ct. profit is allowed by Act of Con- 
gress, whose operatives are exempted from military duty, if the 
law be interpreted to include sales to individuals as well as to the 
government, and suggesting certain modifications. He says he 
makes 14,000 yards per day, which is some 4,000,000 per annum. 
It costs him 20 cts. per yard to manufacture cotton cloth, includ- 
ing, of course, the cotton, and 75 per ct. will yield, I believe, 
$500,000 profits, which would be equivalent to 32 cts. per yard. 
But the market price, he says, is 68 cts. per yard, or some 
$2,000,000 profits! This war is a great encourager of domestic 
manufacturers, truly ! 

The Governor sends out a proclamation to-day, saying the Pres- 
ident has called on him and other governors for assistance, in return- 
ing absent otficers and men to their camps ; in procuring supplies of 
food aud clothing for the army ; in drafting slaves to work on for- 



204 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

tifications ; and, finally, to put down the extortioners. The Gov- 
ernor invokes the people to respond promptly and fully. But how 
does this speak for the government, or rather the efficiency of the 
men who by "many indirect ways" came into power? Alas ! it is 
a sad commentary. 

The 'President sent a hundred papers to the department to-day, 
which he has been diligently poring over, as his pencil marks bear 
ample evidence. They were nearly all applications for office, and 
this business constitutes much of his labor. 

DECEMBER STH. Yesterday there was some little skirmishing 
below Fredericksburg. But it rained last night, and still rains. 
Lee has only 30,000 or 40,000 effective men. 

We have the Federal President's Message to-day. It is mod- 
erate in tone, and is surprising for its argument on a new proposi- 
tion that Congress pass resolutions proposing amendments to the 
Constitution, allowing compensation for all slaves emancipated be- 
tween this and the year 1900 ! He argues that slaves are property, 
and that the South is no more responsible for the existence of slavery 
than the North ! The very argument I have been using for twenty 
years. He thinks if his proposition be adopted that "several of the 
border States will embrace its terms, and that the Union will be 
reconstructed." He says the money expended in this way will not 
amount to so much as the cost of a war of subjugation. He is 
getting sick of the war, and therein I see the " beginning of the 
end" of it. It is a good sign for us, perhaps. I should not be 
surprised if his proposition had advocates in the South. 

Lt.-Col. T. C. Johnson sent in a communication to-day. He 
alludes to an interview with the Secretary, in which the latter in- 
formed him that the government intended to exchange cotton for 
supplies for the army, and Lt.-Col. J. suggests that it be extended 
to embrace all kinds of merchandise for the people, and informs 
him that New York merchants are willing to send merchandise to 
our ports if we will permit their ships to return laden with cotton, 
at 50 cts. per pound, and pledging themselves to furnish goods at 
50 per cent, advance on cost. He advocates a trade of this na- 
ture to the extent of $100,000,000, our government (and not in- 
dividuals) to sell the cotton. The goods to be sold by the gov- 
ernment to the merchants here. I know not what answer the 
Secretary will make. Bu^ I know our people are greedy for the 
merchandise. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 205 

The enemy have shelled Port Royal, below Fredericksburg, in 
retaliation for some damage done their gun-boats in the river by 
one of our land batteries. And we have news of the evacuation 
of Winchester by the enemy. The Northern papers say Burnside 
(who is not yet removed) will beat Lee on the Rappabannock, and 
that their array on the James River will occupy Richmond. When 
Lee is beaten, perhaps Richmond will fall. 

A large number of our troops, recruited in Kentucky, have 
returned to their homes. It is said, however, that they will fight 
the enemy there as guerrillas. 

The President has appointed his nephew, J. R. Davis, a briga- 
dier-general. I suppose no president could escape denunciation, 
nevertheless, it is to be regretted that men of mind, men who 
wrought up the Southern people, with their pens, to the point of 
striking for national independence, are hurled into the background 
by the men who arranged the programme of our government. 
De Bow was offered a lower clerkship by Mr. Secretary Memmin- 
ger, which he spurned ; Fitzhugh accepted the lower class clerk- 
ship Mr. M. offered him after a prolonged hesitation; and others, 
who did more to produce the revolution than any one of the high 
functionaries now enjoying its emoluments, are to be found in the 
lowest subordinate positions ; while Tom, Dick, and Harry, never 
heard of before, young, and capable of performing military service, 
rich, and able to live without office, are heads of bureaus, chief 
clerks of departments, and staff-officers flourishing their stars 1 
Even this is known in the North, and they exult over it as a just 
retribution on those who were chiefly instrumental in fomenting 
revolution. But they forget that it was ever thus, and that our 
true patriots and bold thinkers who furnish our lesser men, in 
greater positions, with ideas, are still true and steadfast in the 
cause they have advocated so long. 

DECEMBER 7TH. Last night was bitter cold, and this morning 
there was ice on my wash-stand, within five feet of the fire. Is this 
the "sunny South" the North is fighting to possess ? How much 
suffering must be in the armies now encamped in Virginia ! I sup- 
pose there are not less than 250,000 men in arms on the plains of 
Virginia, and many of them who survive the war will have cause 
to remember last night. Some must have perished, and thousands, 
no doubt, had frozen limbs. It is terrible, and few are aware that 

18 



206 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

the greatest destruction of life, in such a war as this, is not pro- 
duced by wounds received in battle, but by disease, contracted from 
exposure, etc., in inclement seasons. But the deadly bullet claims 
its victims. A friend just returned from the battle-field of June, 
near the city, whither he repaired to recover the remains of a rel- 
ative, says the scene is still one of horror. So great was the 
slaughter (2f th June) that we were unable to bury our own dead 
for several days, for the battle raged a whole week, and when the 
work was completed, the weather having been extremely hot, it 
was too late to inter the enemy effectually, so the earth was merely 
thrown over them" forming mounds, which the rains and the wind 
have since leveled. And now the ground is thickly strewn with 
the bleaching bones of the invaders. The flesh is gone, but their 
garments remain. He says he passed through a wood, not a tree 
of which escaped the missiles of the contending hosts. Most of 
the trees left standing are dead, being often perforated by scores 
of Minie-balls, but thousands were prostrated by cannon-balls and 
shells. It will long remain a scene of desolation, a monument of 
the folly and wickedness of man. 

And what are we fighting for ? What does the Northern Gov- 
ernment propose to accomplish by the invasion ? Is it supposed 
that six or eight million of free people can be exterminated ? 
How many butchers would be required to accomplish the beneficent 
feat ? More, many more, than can be sent hither. The Southern 
people, in such a cause, would fight to the last, and when the men 
all fell, the women and children would snatch their arms and slay 
the oppressors. Without complete annihilation, it is the merest 
nonsense to suppose our property can be confiscated. 

But if a forced reconstruction of the Union were consummated, 
does the North suppose any advantage would result to that sec- 
tion ? In the Union we could not be compelled to trade with them 
again. Nor would intercourse of any kind be re-established. 
Their ships would be destroyed, and their people could never come 
among as but at the risk of ill treatment. They could not main- 
tain a standing army of half .a million, and they could not disarm 
us in such an extensive territory. 

The best plan, the only plan, to redeem the past and enjoy 
blessings in the future, is to cease this bootless warfare and be the 
first to recognize our independence. We are exasperated with 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 207 



Europe, and like the old colonel in Bulwer's play, we can like a 
brave foe after fighting him. Let the North do this, and we will 
trade with its people, I have no doubt, and a mutual respect will 
grow up in time, resulting, probably, in combinations against Euro- 
pean powers in their enterprises against governments on this con- 
tinent. 

DECEMBER STH. A letter from Gen. Lee, received to-day, 
states that, in' the recent campaigns, he has experienced the 
effects of having inferior artillery and fixed ammunition. Bat 
this discrepancy is rapidly disappearing, from captures of the 
enemy's batteries, etc. He recommends that our 12-pounder how- 
itzers and 6-pounder smooth bores be recast into 12-pounder 
Napoleons, 10-pounder Parrott guns, and 3-inch rifle cannon. 
He wants four 12-pounder Napoleons sent him immediately, for 
a special purpose. His next battle will be principally with 
artillery. 

Gov. Yance sends a letter, referring to an order of the govern- 
ment that 'all cotton not removed west of the Weldon and Wil- 
liamsburg Railroad, by the 16th instant, is to be destroyed. He 
says his State is purchasing 15,000 to 20,000 bales, to establish a 
credit in Europe, and asks that the Confederate Government 
authorities will respect the cotton designed for this purpose. He 
says he will de.^tcoy it himself, when the enemy approaches. He 
says, moreover, that the order will have an unhappy effect; that 
many of the people have already lost their slaves, grain, etc. from 
the inroads of the enemy, and have nothing to live on but their 
cotton. If it remains where it is, how can they subsist on it with- 
out selling it to the enemy ? And that would be treason, pretty 
nearly. But why does the government issue such an order in 
North Carolina, when the government itself is selling, not destroy- 
ing, the cotton of Mississippi ? 

The President of the Central Railroad says that Messrs. Hax- 
hall, Crenshaw & Co., who have the gigantic contract with the 
government to furnish flour, and who have a preference of trans- 
portation by the contract, are blocking up their depots, and fail to 
remove the grain. They keep whole trains waiting for days to be 
unladen ; and thus hundreds of thousands of bushels, intended for 
other mills and the people are delayed, and the price kept up to 
the detriment of the community. Thus it is that the government 



208 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

contractors are aiding and abetting the extortioners. And for 
this reason large amounts of grain may fall into the hands of the 
enemy. 

DECEMBER 9iH. W 1, another of Provost Marshal Gris- 

wold's policemen, has arrived in Washington. I never doubted 
he was secretly in the Yankee service here, where many of his fel- 
lows still remain, betraying the hand that feeds them. Gen. 
Winder and the late Secretaries of War must be responsible for 
all the injury they may inflict upon the country. 

Yesterday, the President received a letter from a gentleman 
well known to him, asserting that if Mississippi and Alabama be 
overrun by the enemy, a large proportion of the people of those 
States will certainly submit to the Government of the United 
States. The President sent this letter to the Secretary of War 
"for his information." 

A letter from W. P. Harris, Jackson, Mississippi, urges the 
government to abandon the cities and eastern seaboard, and con- 
centrate all the forces in the West, for the defense of the Mis- 
sissippi Yalley and River, else the latter must be lost, which will 
be fatal to the cause, etc. 

Hon. J. H. Reagan has written a savage letter to the Secretary 
of War, withdrawing certain papers relating to an application for 
the discharge from service of his brother-in-law, on account of 
feeble health. He says he will not await the motions (uncertain) 
of the circumlocution office, and is unwilling to produce evidence 
of his statements of the disability of his relative. Mr. Seddon will 
doubtless make a spirited response to this imputation on his office. 

We have a rumor that Morgan has made another brilliant raid 
into Kentucky, capturing 1800 of the enemy. 

The small -pox is spreading in this city to an alarming extent. 
This is the feast to which Burnside is invited. They are vaccina- 
ting the clerks in the departments. 

Gen. Floyd writes the government that, as the enemy cannot 
advance from the West before spring, Echol's and Marshall's 
forces (10,000) might be used on the seaboard. I wish they were 
here. 

The United States forces in the field, by their own estimates, 
amount to 800,000. We have not exceeding 250,000 ; but they 
are not aware of that. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 209 

DECEMBER IOTH. Not a word from the Rappahannock. Bat 
there soon will be. 

Official dispatches from Gen. Bragg confirm the achievement of 
Col. Morgan, acting as brigadier-general. There was a fight, 
several hundred being killed and wounded on both sides; but 
Morgan's victory was complete, his captures amounting to 1800 
men, a battery, wagon train, etc. 

We have also a dispatch that Major-Gen. Lovell, the Yankee, 
had a battle with the enemy, killing, wounding, and capturing 34 1 

A characteristic letter was received to-day from Mr. Sanford, 
Alabama, recommending Col. Dowdell for a brigadiership. I hope 
he may get it, as he is a gallant Southerner. Mr. S. has some 
hard hits at the government ; calling it a government of chief 
clerks and subordinate clerks. He hopes Mr. Seddon will not be 
merely a clerk. 

Gen. Jos. E. Johnston has written from the "West a gloomy 
letter to Mr. Wigfall, Texan Senator. He says he is ordered to 
reinforce Lieut. -Gen. Pemberton (another Northern general) from 
Bragg's army. Pemberton is retreating on Grenada, Mississippi, 
followed by 40,000 of the enemy. How is he, Gen. J., to get 
from Tennessee to Grenada with reinforcements, preceded by one 
army of the enemy, and followed by another ? 

Mr. Wigfall recommends the Secretary (as if he could do it !) 
to concentrate all the armies of the West, and beat the enemy out 
of the Mississippi Valley. Gen. Johnston says Lieut.-Gen. Holmes 
7ms been ordered to reinforce Pemberton. Why, this is the very 
thing Mr. Randolph did, and lost his clerkship for it! The 
President must have changed his mind. 

Gen. Randolph sent in his resignation as brigadier-general to- 
day. The younger brigadiers, Davis (the President's nephew) 
and Pryor, have been recently assigned to brigades, and this may 
have operated on Randolph as an emetic. 

There are two war steamers at Charleston from abroad ; one a 
Frenchman, the other an Englishman. Gen. Beauregard enter- 
tained the officers of the first the other day. 

Gen. Banks has sailed down the coast on an expedition, the 
nature of which, no doubt, will be developed soon. 

DECEMBER UTII. Gen. Lee dispatched this morning early that 
the enemy were constructing three pontoon bridges, and that 

18* 



210 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

firing bad commenced on both sides. At nine o'clock A.M. the 
firing increased, and Gen Lee dispatched for ammunition, looking 
to the contingency of a prolonged battle. 

At three P.M., Gen. Lee says, the enemy had been repulsed in 
two of their attempts to throw bridges over the river; but the 
third attempt would probably succeed, as it was under cover of 
batteries which commanded the river, and where his sharpshooters 
could not reach the workmen. But, he says, his batteries com- 
mand the plain where the enemy must debouch. We may speedily 
hear of a most sanguinary conflict. 

Burnside must have greatly superior numbers, or else he is a 
great fool to precipitate his men into a plain, where every Southern 
soldier is prepared to die, in the event of failure to conquer 1 
There is no trepidation here ; on the contrary, a settled calm on 
the faces of the people, which might be mistaken for indifference. 
They are confident of the success of Lee, and really seem appre- 
hensive that Burnside will not come over and fight him in a de- 
cisive battle. We shall soon see, now, of what stuff Burnside and 
his army are made. I feel some anxiety; because the destruction 
of our little army on the Rappuhannock might be the fall of Rich- 
mond. 

It is rumored that the President started two days ago for the 
West Tennessee and Mississippi. No papers have been sent in 
by him since Tuesday, and it may be true. If so, he means to re- 
turn speedily. I think we shall soon have news from the lower 
James River. 

A letter from the Governor of Alabama calls urgently for heavy 
guns, and a. reserve force, for the defense of Mobile. 

Major Hause, the government's agent in Europe, has purchased, 
up to this time, 157,000 stand of arms, besides many cannon, much 
ammunition, quartermaster's stores, etc. A portion was lost in 
transitu, however, but not a large amount. Besides the large 
sums he has expended, he*has obtained credit to the extent of 
$6,000,000! 

They are calling for a guard at Petersburg against incendiaries. 
A factory was burned the other night. This is bad. 

Scully and Lewis, condemned to die as spies, have been pardoned 
by the President, and are to be sent North. 

Another dispatch from Gen. Lee, dated 3^ P.M., says the enemy 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 211 

has nearly completed his bridge, and will probably commence 
crossing this evening or in the morning. The bulletin boards in 
the city purport to give intelligence of the passage having been 
effected in part ; but I do not see how the editors could have ob- 
tained their information. 

At 6 P.M., passengers by the Fredericksburg train (which left 
at 1 P.M.) report the shelling of the town, and a great battle in 
progress on this side of the river. I doubt both ; and I saw but 
one excited man (a Jew) who said he was in Fredericksburg when 
the shelling began. I do not believe it. The cars were not within 
four miles of the town, and perhaps merely conjectured the can- 
nonading they heard to be directed at the town. There were no 
ladies or children in the cars. But doubtless the enemy will cross 
the river, and there will be a battle, which must result in a great 
mortality. 

DECEMBER 12m. The enemy have possession of Fredericks- 
burg, and succeeded in crossing a large portion of their force 
three miles below, on their pontoon bridge. Up to 3 P.M. to-day, 
we have no other intelligence but that "they are fighting." We 
shall know more, probably, before night. 

The President has passed through East Tennessee on his way to 
Mississippi. 

Lieut. -Col. Nat Tyler, publisher of the Enquirer, the organ of 
the government, was in my office this morning, denouncing Mr. 
Memminger, Secretary of the Treasury. He says Mr. M.'s head 
is as worthless as a pin]s-head. He also denounced the rules of 
admission to our Secretary, adopted by Mr. R. G. H. Kean, Chief 
of the Bureau, and asked for a copy of them, that he might de- 
nounce them in his paper. It appears that Mr. Jacques is to 
say who can see the Secretary; and to do this, he must catechize 
each applicant as to the nature of his business. This is deemed 
insulting by some of the hot bloods, and will make friend Mr. J.'s 
position rather a disagreeable and derogatory one. 

DECEMBER 13TH. After all, Fredericksburg was severely 
shelled whether designedly or incidentally in the fight, does not 
yet appear. 

Our army has fallen back a little for a purpose. Lee knows 
every inch of the ground. 

Again we have rumors of a hostile fleet being in the river; and 



212 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

Major-Gen. G. W. Smith has gone to Petersburg to see after the 
means of defense, if an attack should be made in that quarter. 
Some little gloom and despondency are manifested, for the first 
time, in this community. 

Major-Gen. S. Jones writes that although the Federal Gen. 
Cox has left the valley of the Kanawha, 5000 of his men remain; 
and he deems it inexpedient, in response to Gen. Lee's suggestion, 
to detach any portion of his troops for operations elsewhere. He 
says Jenkins's cavalry is in a bad condition. 

Here is an instance of South Carolina honor. During the battle 
of Williamsburg, last spring, W. R. Ervvin, a private in Col. Jen- 
kins's Palmetto sharpshooters, was detailed to take care of the 
wounded, and was himself taken prisoner The enemy supposing 
him to be a surgeon, he was paroled. He now returns to the 
service ; and although the mistake could never be detected, he in- 
sists on our government exchanging a private of the enemy's for 
himself. With the assurance that this will be done, he goes again 
to battle. 

Yesterday flour and tobacco had a fall at auction. Some sup- 
pose the bidders had in view the contingency of the capture of the 
city by the enemy. 

In the market-house this morning, I heard a man speaking 
loudly, denounce a farmer for arsking about $6 a bushel for his 
potatoes, and hoping that the Yankees would take them from him 
for nothing ! 

DECEMBER 14TH, SUNDAY. Yesterday was a bloody day. Gen. 
Lee telegraphs that the enemy attacked him at 9 A.M., and as 
the fog lifted, the fire ran along the whole line, and the conflict 
raged until darkness (6 P.M.) put an end to the battle. The 
enemy was repulsed at all points, he continued, thanks be to God I 
But we have to mourn, as usual, a heavy loss. Lee expects 
another blow at Burnside to-day. 

It is understood that Gens. Hood, Texas, was wounded ; T. R. R. 
Cobb, Georgia, and a brigadier from South Carolina were killed. 
A dispatch says that where our generals fell, the colonels could 
no longer restrain their regiments ; and the men ran into the 
ranks of the enemy, and, animated with a spirit of desperation, 
slaughtered the foe in great numbers with their bayonets, pistols, 
and knives. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 213 

Preparations are being made here for the reception of the 
wounded. The request was to provide for a large number. 

Last night, at nine o'clock, a number of regiments which had 
been encamped among the fortifications northwest of the city, 
were marched down to Drewry's Bluff. It is probable Gen. Smith 
has heard of the enemy's approach from that quarter. I hope he 
may prove the right man in the right place. 

It is rumored that we were repulsed yesterday, this side of Suf- 
folk. 

At this critical moment the President is away. 

A dispatch from Gen. Lee says Gen. Wade Hampton dashed 
into Dumfries, the other side of the Rappahannock, and in the 
rear of the enemy, capturing some wagons, and taking a few men. 
This seems most extraordinary. If he be not taken himself, the 
diversion must have a good effect; but if he be taken, it will be 
considered a wild and desperate sally, boding no good to the cause. 
But Lee knows what he is about. 

From the dispositions of our troops (few in number) in the 
vicinity of Richmond, at this moment, it seems to me that Gen. 
Smith is putting the city to great hazard. There are not a thou- 
sand men to guard the approach from the head of York River; 
and if a dozen of the enemy's swift transports were to dash up 
that river, the city could be surprised by 5000 men 1 

Ten o'clock A.M. No dispatches from Lee have come over the 
wires to-day. He may have interdicted others. We got no in- 
telligence whatever. From this I infer the battle was resumed at 
early dawn, and the general deems it best to have no announce- 
ments but results. If this be so, it is a day big with events and 
upon its issue may depend the fate of governments. And yet our 
people exhibited no trepidation. The foreign portion of the pop- 
ulation may be seen grouped on the pavements indulging in specu- 
lation, and occasionally giving vent to loud laughter, when a Jew 
is asked what will be the price of his shoes, etc. to-morrow. They 
care not which side gains the day, so they gain the profits. 

But our women and children are going to church as usual, to 
pray for the success of the cause, and not doubting but that our 
army will triumph as usual on the field of combat. It is a bright 
and lovely Sabbath morning, and as warm as May. 
DECEMBER 15TH. Yesterday evening several trains laden with 



214 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

wounded arrived in the city. The remains of Brig. -Gen. T. R. 
R. Cobb, of Georgia, were brought down. Brig.-Gen. Gregg, of 
South Carolina, is said to be mortally wounded. It is now be- 
lieved that Major-Gen. Hood, of Texas, did not fall. The number 
of our killed and wounded is estimated, by a surgeon who came 
with the wounded, to be not over a thousand. 

To-day, stragglers from the battle-field say that our loss in 
killed and wounded is 3000. It is all conjecture. 

There was heavy skirmishing all day yesterday, and until to-day 
at noon, when the telegraph operator reports that the firing had 
ceased. We know not (yet) what this means. We are still send- 
ing artillery ammunition to Gen. Lee. 

Gen. Evans dispatches from Kinston, N. C., that on the 14th, 
yesterday, he repulsed the enemy, 15,000 strong, and drove them 
back to their boats in Neuse River. A portion of Gen. R. A. 
Pryor's command, in Isle of Wight County, was engaged with the 
enemy's advance the same day. They have also lauded at Glou- 
cester Point. This is pronounced a simultaneous attack on our 
harbors and cities in Virginia and North Carolina. Perhaps we 
shall have more before night. Our people seem prepared Tor any 
event. 

Another long train of negroes have just passed through the city, 
singing, to work on the fortifications. 

DECEMBER 16iH. To-day the city is exalted to the skies ! *Gen. 
Lee telegraphed that the enemy had disappeared from his front, 
probably meditating a design to cross at some other place. Such 
were his words, which approach nearer to a practical joke, and an 
inkling of exultation, than anything I have seen from his pen. 
He has saved the capital. Before the enemy could approach 
Richmond from "some other place," Lee would be between him 
and the city, and if he could beat him on the Rappahannock he 
can beat him anywhere. 

Doubtless Burnside has abandoned his heavy stores, siege guns, 
etc., and at this moment our army must occupy the town. Lee 
allowed the invaders to cross the river, and, in exact accordance 
with his promise, made a month ago, before they could advance 
from Fredericksburg, his "whole army was in position." They 
could not debouch without passing through our crescent line, the 
extreme ends of which touched the river above and below them. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 215 

They attempted this on Saturday, and met with a bloody defeat, 
and until last night, when they retraced their steps, were confined 
to an exceedingly narrow and uncomfortable strip of land along 
the south bank of the river. 

Our loss in the battle will not exceed, perhaps, 2000 men, not 
more than 500 being slain. It is estimated that the enemy's loss 
is over 10,000, and it may greatly exceed that number, as our posi- 
tions were strong and our batteries numerous. The enemy fought 
well, charging repeatedly over the plain swept completely by our 
guns, and leaving the earth strewn with their dead. We have 
many prisoners, but I have heard no estimate of the number. 

The enemy have taken Kinston, N. C., having overwhelming 
numbers, and a letter from Gen. Bragg, dated at Raleigh, yester- 
day, says it is probable Goldsborough will fall into their hands. 
This will cut our railroad communication with Wilmington, which 
may likewise fall but not without its price in blood. 

Why not let the war cease now ? It is worse than criminal to 
prolong it, when it is apparent that subjugation is an impossi- 
bility. 

There were no stragglers from Lee's army, and never were men 
in better spirits and condition. They are well clad and fed, and 
exceedingly anxious for Burnside to resume his "On to Richmond" 
after the skirmish, of Saturday. They call it but a skirmish, for 
not a brigade was blown, not a regiment fatigued. 

Although men shake hands over this result, they all say they 
never looked for any other termination of Burnside. The ladies 
say he is now charred all over. Well, he may come again by some 
other route, but I have doubts. The rigors of winter are sufficient 
punishment for his troops. It is said Burnside intended to resume 
the battle on Sunday morning, but his generals reported that their 
men could not be relied upon to approach our batteries again. I 
shall look with interest for the next Northern papers. 

DECEMBER HTH. A dispatch from Gen. G. W. Smith, last 
night, says we have repulsed the enemy from Kinston, N. C., but 
a dispatch this morning says a cavalry force has cut the railroad 
near Goldsborough, broken down the wires, and burnt the bridge. 
We had no letters from beyond ihat point this morning. 

Last night large quantities of ammunition and some more regi- 
ments were sent to North Carolina. This is done because Rich- 



216 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

mond is relieved by the defeat and retreat of Burnside. Bat sup- 
pose it should not be relieved, and a force should be sent suddenly 
up the James and York Rivers? 

We have not a word from Fredericksburg, and it is probable 
Burnside's batteries still command the town. Lee is content and 
has no idea of crossing the river. 

There are two notable rumors in the streets : first, that we have 
gained a great battle in Tennessee ; and, second, that the govern- 
ment at Washington has arrested John Yan Buren and many other 
Democratic leaders in the North, which has resulted in a riot, 
wherein 1000 have fallen, making the gutters in ISfew York run 
with blood ! 

Gen. Lee's official report says our loss in the battle of the 13th 
in killed and wounded did not exceed 1200, whereas our papers 
said 2050 wounded have already been brought to this city. 

Well, our government must have spies at Washington as an off- 
set to Federal spies here among Gen. Winder's policemen ; for we 
knew exactly when the enemy would begin operations .in North 
Carolina, and ordered the cotton east of the Weldon Railroad to 
be burnt on the 16th inst, yesterday, and yesterday the road was 
cut by the enemy. I have not heard of the cotton being burnt 
and I don't believe it was destroyed. Nor do I believe Gen. 
Smith knew that Bnrnside would be defeated in time to send 
troops from here to North Carolina. 

Elwood Fisher died recently in Georgia, and his pen, so highly 
prized by the South for its able vindication of her rights, was for- 
gotten by the politicians who have power in the Confederate Gov- 
ernment. All Mr. Memminger would offer him was a lowest class 
clerkship. He died of a broken heart. He was more deserving, 
but less fortunate, than Mr. M. 

It was Mr. Memminger, it seems, who refused to contribute any- 
thing to supply the soldiers with shoes, and the press is indignant. 
They say he is not only not a native South Carolinian, but Hes- 
sian born. 

DECEMBER 18TH. We have more accounts of the battle of 
Fredericksburg now in our possession. Our loss in killed and 
wounded will probably be more than the estimate in the official 
report, while Federal prisoners report theirs at 20,000. This may 
be over the mark, but the Examiner's correspondent at Fredericks- 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 217 

burg pots down their loss at 19,000. The Northern papers of the 
14th inst. (while they supposed the battle still undecided) express 
the hope that Burnside will fight his last man and fire his last car- 
tridge on that field, rather than not succeed in destroying Lee's 
army ! Lee's army, after our victory, is mostly uninjured. The 
loss it sustained was not a " flea-bite." 

The enemy, in their ignominous flight on Saturday night, left 
their dead propped up as sentinels and pickets, besides 3000 on the 
plain. 

Accounts from North Carolina indicate the repulse of the 
enemy, though they have burnt some of the railroad bridges. We 
shall hear more anon. Reinforcements are flying to the scene of 
action. 

DECEMBER 19TH. Gen. Burnside acknowledges a loss of up- 
wards of 5000, which is good evidence here that his loss was not 
less than 15,000. The Washington papers congratulate them- 
selves on the escape of their army, and say it might have been 
easily captured by Lee. They propose, now, going into winter 
quarters. 

We have nothing further from North Carolina or Mississippi. 
Gen. Banks's expedition had passed Hilton Head. 

A Mr. Bunch, British Consul, has written an impudent letter to 
the department, alleging that an Irishman, unnaturalized, is forci- 
bly detained in one of our camps. He says his letters have not 
been answered, which was great discourtesy, and he means to in- 
form Lord John Russell of it. This letter was replied to in 
rather scathing terms, as the Irishman had enlisted and then 
deserted. Besides, we are out of humor with England now, and 
court a French alliance. 

The President was at Chattanooga on the 15th instant; and 
writes the Secretary that he has made some eight appointments of 
brigadiers, and promotions to major-generals. Major-Gen. Buck- 
ner is assigned to command at Mobile. 

We are straightened for envelopes, and have taken to turning 
those we receive. This is economy ; something new in the South. 
My family dines four or five times a week on liver and rice. We 
cannot afford anything better; others do not live so well. 

Custis and I were vaccinated to-day, with the rest of the officers 
of the department. 

19 



218 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

The Northern papers now want the Federal army to go into 
winter quarters. This was, confessedly, to be the final effort to 
take Richmond. It failed. Many of the people regard the disaster 
of Burnside as the harbinger of peace. 

An officer from the field informs me that all our generals were 
sadly disappointed, when it was discovered that Burnside had fled. 
They wanted one more blow at him, and he would have been com- 
pletely destroyed. 

DECEMBER 20TH. Last accounts from Fredericksburg state 
that the enemy are retiring toward the Potomac and Washington. 
We have got some of their pontoon bridges, and other things left 
behind. It is now very cold, with a fair prospect of the Potomac 
freezing over. Let them beware ! 

But we were in a bad way : our army, instead of numbering 
200,000 as the Federal journals report, did not exceed 50,000 
men; and not half that number went into action. The Secretary 
of War had ordered several regiments- from Gen. S. Jones, in 
Western Virginia; now sent to North Carolina. 

There is no mail yet from beyond Goldsborough, and the news 
from North Carolina seems vague and unsatisfactory. They say 
we beat the enemy at Kinston ; yet they have destroyed a portion 
of the railroad between Goldsborough and Wilmington. They say 
the Federals are retreating on Newbern ; yet we know they made 
500 of our men prisoners after they crossed the Neuse. It is re- 
ported that our loss is small, and the enemy's large; and that our 
3000 men fought successfully their 18,000. However, we have 
sent some 15,000 reinforcements. 

It is reported that the Federals are evacuating Nashville ; but 
reports from the West are not always reliable. 

A communication has been received by Secretary Seddon from 
S. B. M., of Vicksburg, proposing to purchase shoes, blankets, etc. 
in the United States, and sell them to the government for cotton 
or for Confederate notes. This was referred to the Quartermaster- 
General, who favors it. Now what will Mr. Secretary do ? Bet- 
ter wait till the President returns I 

The late Secretary of War, Mr. Randolph, has formed a part- 
nership with Mr. G. A. Myers. To-day a paper was sent in by them 
to the new Secretary, containing the names often clients, all Jews 
and extortioners, who, it appears, at the beginning of the war, and 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 219 

before Virginia had fully seceded, joined several Virginia compa- 
nies of artillery, but did not drill with them. They hired substi- 
tutes for a small sum, all, as the memorial sets forth, being foreign- 
ers of the class subsequently exempted by act of Congress. And 
these counselors demand the exemption of the Jew extortioners 
ou the ground that they once furnished substitutes, now out of the 
service I And it is probable they will carry their point, and gain 
large fees. Substitutes now are worth $2000 then, $100. 

A dispatch from Charleston to-day says: "Iron steamer Colum- 
bia, formerly the Giraffe, of Liverpool, with cargo of shoes, blank- 
ets, Whitworth guns, and ammunition, arrived yesterday." I 
suppose cargoes of this nature have been arriving once a week 
ever since the war broke out. This cargo, and the ship, belong to 
the government. 

9 O'CLOCK P.M. After a very cold day, it has become intensely 
frigid. I have two fires in our little Robin's Nest (frame) on the 
same floor, and yet ice forms rapidly in both rooms, and we have 
been compelled to empty the pitchers ! This night I doubt not 
the Potomac will be closed to Burnside and his transports 1 Dur- 
ing the first Revolution, the Chesapeake was frozen over. If we 
have a winter like that, we shall certainly have an armistice in 
Virginia without the intervention of any other than the Great 
Power above. But we shall suffer for the want of fuel: wood is 
$18 per cord, and coal $14 per cart load. 

Gen. Bonhara, who somehow incurred the dislike of the author- 
ities here, and was dropped out of the list of brigadiers, has been 
made Governor of South Carolina. 

And Gen. Wise, who is possessed of perhaps the greatest mind 
in the Confederacy, is still fettered. They will not let him fight a 
battle, because he is "ambitious!" When Norfolk was (wickedly) 
given up, his home and all his possessions fell into the hands of 
the enemy. He is now without a shelter for his head, bivouacing 
with his devoted brigade at Cbaffin's farm, below the city. He is 
the senior brigadier in the army, and will never be a major-general. 

DECEMBER 21sT, SUNDAY. Nothing, yet, has been done by the 
immense Federal fleet of iron-clad gun-boats which were to devas- 
tate our coast this winter. But the winter is not over yet, and I 
apprehend something will be attempted. However, we shall make 
a heroic defense of every point assailed. 



220 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

I omitted to state, in connection with the partnership formed 
between Mr. Myers and Mr. Randolph, that the former had 
already succeeded, when the latter was Secretary of War, in get- 
ting the substitutes of the Jew extortioners out of the army, on 
the ground that they were not domiciled in this country ; and now 
both are intent on procuring the exemption of the principals. 
This may be good practice, but it is not good service. Every 
man protected and enriched by the government, owes service to 
the country in its hour of peril. 

I am glad to hear that W. H. B. Custis, of the Eastern Shore 
of Virginia, takes no part in the war. This is the proper course 
for him under the circumstances. It is said he declined a high 
position tendered by the Federal Government. No doubt he has 
been much misrepresented: his principles are founded on the 
Constitution, which is violated daily at Washington, and there- 
fore he can have no sympathy with that government. 

DECEMBER 22o. We shall never arrive at the correct amount 
of casualties at the battle of Fredericksburg. The Enquirer to- 
day indicates that our loss in killed, wounded, and missing (pris- 
oners), amounted to nearly 4000. On the other hand, some of the 
Federal journals hint that their loss was 25,000. Gen. Armstrong 
(Confederate), it is said, counted 3500 of their dead on the field ; 
and this was after many were buried. There are five wounded to 
one killed. But where Burnside is now, or what he will attempt 
next, no doubt Lee knows; but the rest of our people are pro- 
foundly ignorant in relation thereto. The New York Herald 
says: "The finest and best appointed army the world ever saw, has 
been beaten by a batch of Southern ragamuffins !" And it advises 
that the shattered remains of the army be put into winter quar- 
ters. 

The weather has greatly moderated. I hope, now, it will con- 
tinue moderate ! 

Mr. Crenshaw, who has the gigantic flour contract with the 
War Department, effected with Mr. Randolph, has just (in the 
President's absence) made another contract with Mr. Seddon. 
The department becomes a partner with him, and another party 
in England, in a huge commercial transaction, the object of which 
is to run goods in, and cotton out. We shall have our Girards, 
as well as the United States. Mr. Crenshaw proceeds to England 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 221 

immediately, bearing letters of credit to Mr. Mason, onr Minis- 
ter, etc. 

An immense sum is to be sent West to pay for stores, etc., and 
Mr. Benjamin recommends the financial agent to the department. 
The illicit trade with the United States has depleted the country 
of gold, and placed us at the feet of the Jew extortioners. It still 
goes on. Mr. Seddon has granted passports to two agents of a 
Mr. Baumgartien and how many others I know not. These Jews 
have the adroitness to carry their points. They have injured the 
cause more than the armies of Lincoln. Well, if we gain our in- 
dependence, instead of being the vassals of the Yankees, we shall 
find all our wealth in the hands of the Jews. 

The accounts from North Carolina are still conflicting. It is 
said the enemy have retired to Newbern ; but still we have no let- 
ters beyond Goldsborough. From Raleigh we learn that the legis- 
lature have postponed the array bill until the 20th of January. 

DECEMBER 23o. The battle of Fredericksburg is still the topic, 
or the wonder, and it transpired more than nine days ago. It will 
have its page in history, and be read by school-boys a thousand 
years hence. The New York Times exclaims, "God help us for 
man cannot." This is another war sheet. The Tribune is be- 
wildered, and knows not what to say. The Herald says "every- 
thing by turns, and nothing long." Its sympathies are ever with 
the winning party. But it is positively asserted that both Seward 
and his son have resigned, to be followed by the rest of the cabinet. 
That example might be followed here without detriment to our 
cause. And it is said Burnside has resigned. I doubt that but 
no doubt he will be removed. It is said Fremont has been 
appointed his successor. That would be good news. I think 
Halleck will be removed, and McClellan will be recalled. No 
matter. 

It is said our President will command in Mississippi himself 
the army having no confidence in Pemberton, because he is a 
Yankee. 

We have a letter to-day from Gen. Pike (another Yankee), say- 
ing the Indian country is lost lost, because Gens. Holmes and 
Hindman Southern men won't let him have his own way I 

*The news from North Carolina is still cloudy. Gen. G. W. 
Smith is there (another Northern man). 

19* 



222 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

Gen. Elzey has been appointed to command this department dur- 
ing Gen. L.'s absence. Gen. E. is a Marylander. In the President's 
absence, it is said this appointment-was made by Gen. S. Cooper 
(another Yankee) to insult Virginia by preventing the capital from 
being in the hands of a Virginian. The Richmond papers occa- 
sionally allude to the fact that the general highest in rank in the 
Confederacy is a Yankee Gen. S. Cooper. 

Gen. Lee says his ammunition is bad in quality, and that his 
new guns burst in the late battle all under charge of the chief 
of the Bureau of Ordnance another Yankee. Gen. D. H. Hill 
writes a scathing letter to the department in response to a rebuke 
from the new Secretary, occasioned by some complaints of Major 
Palfrey in Gen. Cooper's (A. and I. General) office. I do not 
know where Major P. came from ; but the fact that he was not in 
the field, gave the general occasion to rasp him severely. It 
must have been caused by an order transferring, furloughing, or 
discharging some soldier in Gen. H.'s division and his patience 
vanished at the idea of having his men taken out of the ranks 
without consulting him, by carpet knights and civilian lawyers. 
He says 8000 are now absent from his command and that Gen. 
Johnston's army, last spring, was reduced from the same cause to 
40,000 men, where he had to oppose 138,000 of the "rascally 
Yankees." He concludes, however, by saying it is the duty of 
subordinate generals in the field to submit in all humility to the 
behests of their superiors comfortably quartered in Richmond. 
.But if justice were done, and the opinions of the generals in the 
field were regarded in the matter of discharges, etc., the lawyers, 
who have grown fat on fees by thinning our ranks, would be com- 
pelled to resort to some more laudable means of making a living. 

A letter from Gov. Shorter, of Alabama, introduces Judge 
Rice, agent for P. S. Gerald and J. R. Powell, who propose to 
bring goods into the Confederate States through Mexico, to be 
paid for in cotton, etc. This was referred by the Secretary to the 
Quartermaster- General who protests against it on the ground 
that it might interfere with his agents already engaged in the 
business. 

The President publishes a retaliatory proclamation to-day 
against Gen. Butler, for hanging Mr. Munford, of New Orleans, 
who took down the United States flag before the city had sur- 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 223 

rendered. He declares Butler to be out of the pale of civiliza- 
tion ; and orders any commander who may capture him, to hang 
him as an outlaw. And all commissioned officers serving under 
Butler, and in arms with negroes, to be reserved for execution. 

There is a rumor that an agent of the Federal Government has 
arrived in the city, to propose an armistice. No armistice, unless 
on the basis of uti possidetis ante bellum! 

Bethel, Leesburg, and Fredericksburg are victories memorable 
for our great success when fighting in advantageous positions. 
They teach a lesson to generals ; and it will be apparent that no 
necessity exists for so great an expenditure of life in the prosecu- 
tion of this war. The disparity of numbers should be considered 
by our generals. I fear the flower of our chivalry mostly perished 
in storming batteries. It is true a prestige was gained. 

DECEMBER 24TH. The Louisville Journal says the defeat of 
Burnside is "sickening," and that this sad condition of affairs 
cannot be borne long. 

It is said that Confederate bonds are bringing quite as much in 
New York as in Richmond ; and that the bonds of Southern men 
are freely discounted in the North. These, if true, are indications 
of approaching peace. Cotton at 50 cents per pound, and our 
capacity to produce five million bales per annum, must dazzle the 
calculating Yankees. A single crop worth $1,000,000,000 1 What 
interest or department of industry in the United States can 
promise such results ? 

Letters were received to-day from Nassau, dated 12th December. 
Mr. L. Heyliger, our agent, reports a number of steamers sailing, 
and about to sail, with large amounts of stores and goods of all 
kinds, besides plates for our navy. A Mr. Wiggs has several 
steamers engaged in this business. Our government own some, 
and private individuals (foreign speculators) are largely engaged 
in the trade. Most of these steamers run sixteen miles an hour. 

A Mr. Hart, agent for S. Isaac Campbell & Co., London, pro- 
poses to clothe and equip 100,000 men for us, and to receive cer- 
tificates for specific amounts of cotton. This same house has, on 
this, it is said, advanced as much as $2,000,000 on our account. 
This looks cheering. We have credit abroad. But they are 
JEWS. 

Mr. Heyliger says he has seen letters from the United States, 



224 A REBEL WAK CLERK'S DIARY 

conveying information that Charleston is to be attacked about the 
holidays the ensuing wee.k by four iron-clad gun-boats. Well, 
Ibelieve we have three there ; so let them come ! 

Every day we have propositions to supply the army and the 
country with goods, for cotton ; and they succeed in delivering 
stores, etc., in spite of the vigilance of the Federal blockading 
squadrons. There is a prospect that we shall have abundance of 
everything some of these days. But there is some wrangling. 
The Quartermaster- General complains to-day that Lieut. -Gen. 
Pemberton has interfered with his agents, trading cotton for 
stores. Myers is a Jew, and Pemberton a Yankee so let them 
fight it out. 

DECEMBER 25TH, CHRISTMAS DAY. Northern papers show 
that there is much distraction in the North ; that both Seward 
and Chase, who had resigned their positions, were with difficulty 
persuaded to resume them. This news, coupled with the recent 
victory, and some reported successes in the West (Van Dorn's 
capture of Holly Springs), produces some effect on the spirits of 
the people here ; and we have a merrier Christmas than the last 
one. 

It is said the Federal Congress is about to provide fop the or- 
ganization of 100 regiments of negroes. This does not occasion 
anxiety here. The slaves, once armed, would cut their way back 
to their masters. The only possible way to restore the Union 
if indeed it be possible is to withdraw all the Federal troops, 
and maintain an effective blockade. There might possibly ensue 
dissensions among our politicians and States, detrimental to any 
required unity of purpose. But the Yankees, with all their smart- 
ness, cannot perceive this. They can never appal us with horrors, 
for we have fed upon nothing else for so long a period, that we 
have become accustomed "to them. And they have not men 
enough to subjugate us and hold us in subjugation. Two millions 
would not suffice ! 

The boys are firing Chinese crackers everywhere, and no little 
gunpowder is consumed in commemoration of the day. 

But turkeys are selling at $11 each! Shoes for $25 per pair. 
Salt, however, has fallen from $1.50 to 33 cents per pound. Fresh 
meats sell at from 35 to 50 cents per pound. 

A silver (lever) watch, which had been lying in my trunk for 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 225 

two years, and which cost me $25, sold at auction yesterday for 
$75. This sufficed for fuel for a month, and a Christmas dinner. 
At the end of another month, my poor family must be scattered 
again, as this house will be occupied by its owner. I have adver- 
tised for boarding in the country, but get no response. It would 
require $300 per month to board my family here, and that is more 
than my income. What shall we do? Trust in God ! 

DECEMBER 26TH. We have no news to-day not even a rumor. 
We are ready for anything that may come. No doubt the as- 
sailants of Mobile, Wilmington, or Charleston, will meet with 
determined resistance. 

The President will be in Richmond about the first day of Janu- 
ary. I saw a man who traveled with him in Alabama. 

Yicksburg, I understand, cannot be taken by water. And 
Grant, the Federal general, is said to be retreating out of Mis- 
sissippi. 

DECEMBER 27TH. The successes in the West have been con- 
firmed. Morgan captured 2000 and Van Dorn 1500 prisoners 
at Holly Springs. They likewise destroyed a large amount of 
stores. 

We have intelligence of a great armament, under Gen. Sher- 
man, sailing from Memphis against Vicksburg. At the last ac- 
counts the President was at Vicksburg ; and he may be witness 
of this decisive struggle for the possession of the Mississippi 
River, the result of which involves immense interests. We await 
with much anxiety the issue of the naval operations during the 
ensuing month. We are content with the land achievements of 
this year; and if we should be equally successful in resisting the 
enemy's fleets, we shall deem ourselves fortunate indeed. 

The agents of the Commissary and Quartermaster-General make 
grievous complaints against Lieut.-Gen. Pemberton, at Grenada, 
Mississippi; they say he interferes with their arrangements to 
procure supplies for cotton ; and it is intimated that he has 
some little arrangements of his own of that nature. This illicit 
trade is very demoralizing in its nature. 

Oh, that peace would return I But with INDEPENDENCE! 

DECEMBER 28TH. We have no news to-day from the West. 
If the great battle ,has been fought at Vicksburg, we ought to 
know it to-day or to-morrow; and if the enemy be beaten, it 



226 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

should be decisive of the war. It would be worse than madness 
to continue the contest for the Union. 

Several fine brass batteries were brought down from Fredericks- 
burg last night, an indication that the campaign is over for the 
winter in that direction. 

If we should have disasters in the West, and on the Southern 
seaboard, the next session of Congress, to begin a fortnight hence, 
will be a stormy one. 

DECEMBER 29iH. We have a dispatch from Yicksburg at last. 
The enemy, 25,000 strong, were repulsed three times yesterday, 
and finally driven back seven miles, to their gun-boats. It was no 
battle, for our loss was only 30, and that of the enemy 400. It 
will be fought to-day, probably. 

It is said an attempt will be made this week on Weldon, as well 
as Charleston. 

Our Morgan has been in Kentucky again, and captured 1200 
men. Glorious Morgan ! 

The accounts from the United States are rather cheering. The 
Herald proposes a convention of all the " loyal States," that re- 
construction may be tried in that way. A dispatch from Ten- 
nessee says, even the New York Tribune expresses the opinion 
that our independence must be recognized. The Philadelphia 
Press proposes another route to Richmond via the rivers, and 
thinks Richmond may be taken yet, and the rebellion crushed. 

The surgeon in charge of the Howard Hospital reports that the 
small-pox is greatly on the increase, and terminating fatally in 
almost every case. He says men die of it without eruptions on 
the surface, the disease striking inward. It is proposed to drive 
away the strangers (thousands in number), if they will not leave 
voluntarily. There are too many people here for the houses, and 
the danger of malignant diseases very great. 

My vaccination was not a success; very little inflammation and 
a small scab being the only evidences. But I have a cough, and 
much lassitude. 

DECEMBER 30TH. We have another crisis. Dispatches from 
Murfreesborough state the hostile armies are facing each other, 
and not a mile apart; the skirmishing increases, and a decisive 
battle may occur at any moment. 

From Vicksburg we have no further intelligence ; but from the 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 227 

Rappahannock we learn that both artillery and infantry were dis- 
tinctly heard yesterday in the direction of Dumfries. Is Stuart 
there ? 

DECEMBER 31 ST. There were more skirmishes near Yicksburg 
yesterday; and although several of the Louisiana regiments are 
said to have immortalized themselves (having lost only two or 
three men each), I suppose nothing decisive was accomplished. I 
have not implicit faith in Western dispatches; they are too often 
exaggerations. And we have nothing further from Murfrees- 
borough. 

But there is reliable intelligence from Albemarle Sound, where 
a large ffeet of the enemy's transports appeared yesterday. We 
must look now for naval operations. Perhaps Weldon is aimed at. 

Gen. Wise writes a remarkable letter to the department. His 
son, just seventeen years old, a lieutenant in 10th Virginia Cavalry, 
was detailed as ordnance officer of the general's brigade, when that 
regiment was taken from his father. Now Gen. Cooper, the Northern 
head of the Southern army, orders him to the 10th Cavalry., The 
general desires his son to remain with him, or that the lieutenant 
may be permitted to resign. He says he asks no favors of the 
administration, and has never received any. His best blood (Capt. 
0. J. W.) has been given to the country, and his home and prop- 
erty lost by the surrender of Norfolk, etc. 

To-day, Gen. Winder's account for disbursement of "secret 
service" money was sent in. Among the persons who were the 
recipients of this money, I noticed Dr. Rossvally, a notorious 

spy, and S w, one of his policemen, who, with W 11, very 

recently fled to the enemy, and is now in the service of the United 
States, at Washington 1 

Gen. Lee has given the command in Northwestern Virginia to 
Gen. W. E. Jones; and he asks the Secretary to hold a major he 
has captured as a hostage for the good conduct of the Federal 
Gen. Milroy, who is imitating Gen. Pope in his cruelties to 
civilians.

CHAPTER XXII. 

Lee in winter qunrters. Bragg's victory in the Southwest. The President 
at Mobile. Enemy withdraw from Vicksburg. Bragg retreats as usual. 
Bureau of Conscription. High rents. Flour contracts in Congress. 
Efforts to escape conscription. Ships coming in freely. Sneers at negro 
troops. Hopes of French intervention. Gen. Rains blows himself up. 
Davis would be the last to give up. Gov. Vance protests against Col. 
August's appointment as commandant of conscripts. Financial diffi- 
culties in the United States. 

JANUARY IST, 1863. This first day of the year dawned in gloom, 
but the sun, like the sun of Austerlitz, soon beamed forth in great 
splendor upon a people radiant with smiles and exalted to the 
empyrean. 

A letter from Gen. H. Marshall informed the government that 
Gen. Floyd had seized slaves in Kentucky and refused to restore 
them to their owners, and that if the government did not promptly 
redress the wrong, the Kentuckians would at once "take the law 
into their own hands." 

We had a rumor (not yet contradicted) that the enemy, or 
traitors, had burned the railroad bridge between Bristol and 
Knoxville, cutting our communication with the West. 

Then it was said (and it was true) that Gen. Lee had sent his 
artillery back some 30 miles this side of the Rappahannock, pre- 
paratory to going into winter quarters. But this was no occasion 
for gloom. Lee always knows what is best to be done. 

Next there was a rumor (not yet confirmed, but credited) that 
Stuart had made another of his wonderful reconnoissances, captur- 
ing prisoners and destroying much of the enemy's stores beyond the 
Rappahannock. 

Then came a dispatch from Bragg which put us almost "beside" 
ourselves with joy, and caused even enemies to pause and shake 
hands in the street. Yesterday he attacked Rosecrans's army near 
Murfreesborough, and gained a great victory. He says he drove 
him from all his positions, except on the extreme left, and after ten 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 229 

hours' fighting, occupied the whole of the field except (those ex- 
ceptions !) the point named. We had, as trophies, thirty-one guns, 
two generals, 4000 prisoners, and 200 wagons. This is a Western 
dispatch, it is true, but it has Bragg's name to it, and he does not 
willingly exaggerate. Although I, for one, shall await the next 
dispatches with anxiety, there can be no question about the vic- 
tory on the last day of the bloody year 1862. Bragg says the 
loss was heavy on both sides. 

I noticed that one of the brass pieces sent down by Lee to go to 
North Carolina had been struck by a ball just over the muzzle, 
and left a glancing mark toward the touch-hole. That ball, prob- 
ably, killed one of our gunners. 

JANUARY 2D. A dispatch from Gov. Harris gives some addi- 
tional particulars of the battle near Murfreesborough, Tenn. He 
says the enemy was driven back six miles, losing four generals 
killed and three captured, and that we destroyed $2,000,000 com- 
missary and other stores. But still we have no account of what 
was done yesterday on the "extreme left." 

Gen. Stuart has been near Alexandria, and his prisoners are 
coming in by every train. He captured and destroyed many 
stores, and, up to the last intelligence, without loss on his side. 
He is believed, now, to be in Maryland, having crossed the Poto- 
mac near Leesburg. 

The mayor of our city, Jos. Mayo, meeting two friends last 
night, whom he recognized but who did not recognize him, play- 
fully seized one of them, a judge, and, garroter fashion, demanded 
his money or his life. The judge's friend fell upon the mayor 
with a stick and beat him dreadfully before the joke was dis- 
covered. 

The President was at Mobile on the 30th December, having 
visited both Murfreesborough and Vicksburg, but not witnessing 
either of the battles. 

We are in great exaltation again ! Dispatches from Gen. 
Bragg, received last night, relieve us with the information that the 
stronghold of the enemy, which he failed to carry on the day of 
battle, was abandoned the next day; that Forrest and Morgan 
were operating successfully far in the rear of the invader, and 
that Gen. Wheeler had made a circuit of the hostile army after 
the battle, burning several hundred of their wagons, capturing an 

20 



230 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

ordnance train, and making more prisoners. Bragg says the 
enemy's telegraphic and railroad communications with his rear have 
been demolished, and that he will follow up the defeated foe. I 
think we will get Nashville now. 

JANUARY 3D. To-day we have a dispatch from Vicksburg stat- 
ing that the enemy had re-embarked, leaving their intrenching in- 
struments, etc., apparently abandoning the purpose of assaulting 
the city. This is certainly good news. 

Gen. Stuart did not cross the Potomac, as reported in the North- 
ern press, but, doubtless, the report produced a prodigious panic 
among the Yankees. But when Stuart was within eight miles of 
Alexandria, he telegraphed the government at Washington that if 
they did not send forward larger supplies of stores to Burnside's 
army, he (Stuart) would not find it worth while to intercept them. 

Capt. Semmes, of the Alabama, has taken another prize the 
steamer Ariel but no gold being on board, and having 800 pas- 
sengers, he released it, under bonds to pay us a quarter million 
dollars at the end of the war. 

A large meeting has been held in New York, passing resolutions 
in favor of peace. They propose that New Jersey send a delega- 
tion hither to induce us to meet the United States in convention 
at Louisville, to adopt definitive terms of peace, on the basis of 
the old Union, or, that being impracticable, separation. Too 
late! 

JANUARY 4TH. We have nothing additional from Murfreesbo- 
rough, but it is ascertained that the bridges burned by the enemy 
on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad cannot be repaired in a 
month. 

It really does seem that some potent and malign influence, resi- 
dent at the capital, some high functionary, by some species of oc- 
cultation, controlling the action of the government, a Talleyrand in 
the pay of both governments, and balancing or equalizing disasters 
between them to magnify his importance and increase his reward, 
has been controlling many events since the beginning of this war, 
and is still engaged in the diabolical work. It now appears that 
several regiments were withdrawn from the vicinity of Bristol, whose 
presence there was necessary for the protection of the railroad and 
the bridges. They were brought hither after Lee's defeat of 
Bumside, for the protection of the capital I The President was 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 231 

away, and Mr. Seddon was now in the War Office. But Gen. Cooper 
is old in office, and should have known better; and Gen. G. W. 
Smith certainly must have known better. Just suppose we had 
been beaten at Murfreesborough, and our communications cut, 
west and east and south 1 There would have been no escape. 

It had even been proposed to take a large portion of Lee's men 
from him, so that he must be inevitably defeated on the Rappa- 
hannock, but Lee's resignation would have shocked the people un- 
bearably. Great injury was done him by abstracting some 20,000 
of his men by discharges, transfers, and details. Nothing but his 
generalship and the heroism of his men saved us from ruin. The 
disasters of Donelson, Newbern, Nashville, Memphis, Roanoke, 
New Orleans, Norfolk, etc. may be traced to the same source. 
But all new governments have been afflicted by a few evil-disposed 
leaders. 

Our people in arms have upheld the State; they have success- 
fully resisted the open assaults of the invader, and frustrated the 
occult machinations of the traitors in our midst. We have great 
generals, but what were they without great men to obey them ? 
Generals have fallen, and divisions and brigades have fought on 
without them. Regiments have lost their field officers and contin- 
ued the fight, and companies have maintained their position after 
all their commissioned officers were stricken down. The history 
which shall give the credit of their achievements to others will be 
a vile calumny. Our cause would have been ruined if it had not 
been for the bravery and heroism of the people the privates in 
our armies. 

There is a rumor this morning that the enemy are advancing 
toward Petersburg from Suffolk. If this be so, some spy, under 
the protection of martial law, has informed the Yankees of our 
defenseless condition at that place, being alarmed at the success of 
our brave and patriotic men in the West. 

JANUARY STH. We learn from Gen. Bragg that the enemy did 
not retire far on the 2d inst., but remain still in the vicinity of 
Murfreesborough. He says, however, that our cavalry are still 
circling the Yankees, taking prisoners and destroying stores. 
During the day an absurd rumor was invented, to the effect that 
Bragg had been beaten. We are anxious to learn the precise par- 
ticulars of the battle. It is to be feared that too many of Bragg's 



232 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

men were ordered to reinforce Pemberton. If that blunder should 
prove disastrous, the authorities here will have a hornet's nest 
about their ears. The President arrived yesterday, and his pa- 
triotic and cheering speech at Jackson, Miss., appeared in all the 
papers this morning. 

We hear of no fighting at Suffolk. But we have dispatches 
from North Carolina, stating that a storm assailed the enemy's 
fleet dff Hatteras, sinking the Monitor with all on board, and so 
crippling the Galena that her guns were thrown overboard ! This 
is good news if it be confirmed. 

A letter from Major Boyle, in command at Gordonsville, gives 
information that the smugglers and extortioners are trading to- 
bacco (contraband) with the enemy at Alexandria. He arrested 
B. Nussbaum, E. Wheeler, and S. Backrack, and sent them with 
their wagons and goods to Gen. Winder, Richmond. But instead 
of being dealt with according to law, he learns that Backrack 
is back again, and on his way to this city with another wagon 
load of goods from Yankee-land, and will be here to-day or to- 
morrow. I sent the letter to the Secretary, and hope it will not 
be intercepted on its way to him from the front office. The Sec- 
retary never sees half the letters addressed him, or knows of one- 
half the attempts of persons to obtain interviews. The Assistant 
Secretary's duty is to dispose of the less important communica- 
tions, bat to exhibit his decisions. 

JANUARY GTH. To-day we are all down again. Bragg has 
retreated from Murfreesborough. It is said he saved his prisoners, 
captured cannon, etc., but it is not said what became of his own 
wounded. The Northern papers say they captured 500 prisoners 
in the battle, which they claim as a victory. I do not know how 
to reconcile Bragg's first dispatches, and particularly the one 
saying he had the whole field, and would follow the enemy, with 
this last one announcing his withdrawal and retirement from the 
field. 

Eight thousand men were taken from Bragg a few days before 
the battle. It was not done at the suggestion of Gen. Johnston ; 
for I have seen an extract of a letter from Gen. J. to a Senator 
(Wigfall), deprecating the detachment of troops from Bragg, and 
expressing grave apprehensions of the probable consequences. 

A letter was received from R. R. Collier, Petersburg, to-day, 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 233 

in favor of civil liberty, and against the despotism of martial 
law. 

Senator Clark, of Missouri, informed me to-day that my nephew, 
R. H. Musser, has been made a colonel (under HindnTan or 
Holmes), and has a fine regiment in the trans-Mississippi Depart- 
ment. 

Lewis E. Harvie, president of the railroad, sends a communica- 
tion to the Secretary (I hope it will reach him) inclosing a request 
. from Gen. Winder to permit liquors to be transported on his road 
to Clover Hill. Mr. Harvie objects to it, and asks instructions 
from the Secretary. He says Clover Hill is the point from which 
the smuggling is done, and that to place it there, is equivalent to 
bringing it into the city. 

JANUARY TTH. To-day I was requested to aid, temporarily, in 
putting in operation a new bureau, created by the military author- 
ities, not by law, entitled the Bureau of Conscription. From con- 
scription all future recruits must be derived. I found Gen. Rains, 
the chief, a most affable officer; and Lieut.-Col. Lay, his next 
officer, was an acquaintance. I shall not now, perhaps, see so 
much of the interior of this moving picture of Revolution ; my 
son, however, will note important letters. It is said that Sumner's 
corps (of Burnside's army) has landed in North Carolina, to take 
Wilmington. We shall have news soon. 

We are sending troops rapidly from Virginia to North Caro- 
lina. 

The Northern papers say the following dispatch was sent to 
Washington by our raiding Stuart: "Gen. Meigs will in future 
please furnish better mules ; those you have furnished recently 
are very inferior." . He signed his own name. 

A large body of slaves passed through the city to-day, singing 
happily. They had been working on the fortifications north of the 
city, and go to work on them south of it. They have no faith in 
the efficacy of Lincoln's Emancipation. 

But it is different in Norfolk; 4000 enfranchised slaves marched 
in procession through the town the other day in a sort of frantic 
jubilee. They will bewail their error ; and so will the Abolition- 
ists. They will consume the enemy's commissary stores ; and if 
they be armed, we shall get their arms. 

Lee and Beauregard were telegraphed to-day in relation to the 

20* 



234 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

movement on Wilmington ; and the President had the cabinet 
with him many hours. 

Gen. Rains is quite certain that the fall of New Orleans was the 
result of treachery. 

By the emancipation, Gen. Wise's county, Princess Ann, is ex- 

cepted and so are Accomac and Northampton Counties ; but I 

have no slaves. All I ask of the invaders is to spare my timber, 
and I will take care of the land and I ask it, knowing the request 
will never be known by them until the war is over. 

JANUARY STH. Gen. French writes that the enemy at Suffolk 
and Newbern amounted to 45,000 ; and this force now threatens 
Weldon and Wilmington, and we have not more than 14,000 to 
oppose them. With generalship that should suffice. 

All the Virginia conscripts are ordered to Gen. Wise, under 
Major-Gen. Elzey. The conscripts from other States are to be 
taken to Gen. Lee. If the winter should allow a continuance of 
active operations, and the enemy should continue to press us, we 
might be driven nearly to the wall. We must help ourselves all 
we can, and, besides, invoke the aid of Almighty God ! 

We have nothing fresh from Bragg nothing from Yicksburg 
and that is bad news. 

I like Gen. Rains. He comes in and sits with me every day. 
Col. Lay is the active business man of the bureau. The general 
is engaged in some experiments to increase the efficiency of small 
arms. 

He is very affable and communicative. He says he never wit- 
nessed more sanguinary fighting than at the battle of the Seven 
Pines, where his brigade retrieved the fortunes of the day ; for at 
one time it was lost. He was also at Yorktown and Williamsburg ; 
and he cannot yet cease condemning the giving up of the Peninsula, 
Norfolk, etc. Gen. Johnston did that, backed by Randolph and 
Mallory. 

We have all been mistaken in the number of troops sent to the 
rescue of North Carolina; but four or five regiments, perhaps 
3000 men, have gone thither from Virginia. A letter from Gen. 
Lee, dated the 5th inst., says he has not half as many men as 
Burnside, and cannot spare any. He thinks North Carolina, her- 
self, will be able to expel the Federals, who probably meditate 
only a marauding expedition. And he supposes Bragg's splendid 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 235 

victory (what did he suppose the next day?) may arrest the in- 
roads of the enemy everywhere for a season. At this moment I 
do not believe we have 200,000 men in the field against 800,000 ! 
Bat what of that, after seeing Lee beat 150,000 with only 20,000 
in action ! True, it was an ambuscade. 

JANUARY 9TH. The Northern papers say the Federals have 
taken Vicksburg ; but we are incredulous. Yet we have no reli- 
able intelligence from thence ; and it may be so. It would be a 
terrible blow, involving, for a time, perhaps, the loss of the Mis- 
sissippi River. 

But we have cheering news from Galveston, Texas. Several of 
our improvised gun-boats attacked the enemy's war vessels in the 
harbor, and after a sanguinary contest, hand to hand, our men 
captured the Harriet Lane, a fine United States ship of war, iron 
clad. She was boarded and taken. Another of the enemy's ships, 
it is said, was blown up by its officers, rather than surrender, and 
many perished. If this be Magruder's work, it will make him 
famous. 

Our public offices are crowded with applicants for clerkships, 
mostly wounded men, or otherwise unfit for field duty. 

How can we live here ? Boarding is $60 per month, and I have 
six to support 1 They ask $1800 rent for a dwelling and I have 
no furniture to put in one. Gen. Rains and I looked at one to- 
day, thinking to take it jointly. But neither of us is able to fur- 
nish it. Perhaps we shall take it, nevertheless. 

JANUARY 10TH. We have news from the West, which is be- 
lieved to be reliable, stating that Bragg captured 6000 prisoners 
altogether in his late battles ; took 30 cannon, 800 stand of arms, 
and destroyed 1500 wagons and many stores. The estimated 
loss of the enemy in killed and wounded is put down at 12,000. 
Our loss in killed and wounded not more than half that number. 

To-day we have official intelligence confirming the brilliant 
achievement at Galveston ; and it was Magruder's work. He has 
men under him fitted for desperate enterprises ; and he has 
always had a penchant for desperate work. So we shall expect 
to hear of more gallant exploits in that section. He took 600 
prisoners. 

We have news also from Vicksburg, and the city was not taken ; 
on the contrary, the enemy had sailed away. I trust this is reli- 



236 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

able ; but the Northern papers persist in saying that Vicksburg 
has fallen, and that the event took place on the 3d inst. 

Six hundred women and children refugees arrived at Peters- 
burg yesterday from the North. They permit them to come now, 
when famine and pestilence are likely to be added to the other 
horrors of war ! We are doomed to suffer this winter 1 

JANUARY HTH. The message of Gov. Seymour, of New York, 
if I am not mistaken in its import and purposes, will have a dis- 
tracting effect on the subjugation programme of the government 
at Washington. I shall look for riots, and perhaps rebellions and 
civil wars in the North. 

Mr. Stanley, ycleped Governor of North Carolina, has written 
a letter (dated 31st December) to Gen. French, complaining that 
our soldiery have been guilty of taking slaves from their humane 
and loyal masters in Washington County, against their will ; and 
demanding a restoration of them to their kind and beneficent 
owners, to whom they are anxious to return. Gen. French replies 
that he .will do so very cheerfully, provided the United States 
authorities will return the slaves they have taken from masters 
loyal to the Confederate States. These may amount to 100 ; 000. 
And he might have added that on the next day all 4,000,000 
were to be emancipated, so far as the authority of the United 
States could accomplish it. 

The enemy's gun-boats (two) came up the York River last week, 
and destroyed an oyster boat. Beyond the deprivation of oysters, 
pigs, and poultry, we care little for these incursions. 

JANUARY 12TH. The news of the successful defense of Vicks- 
burg is confirmed by an official dispatch, to the effect that the 
enemy had departed up the Mississippi River. By the late 
Northern papers, we find they confess to a loss of 4000 men in 
the several attacks upon the town ! Our estimate of their loss did 
not exceed that many hundred. They lost two generals, Morgan 
and another. We did not lose a hundred men, according to our 
accounts. The Herald (N. Y.) calls it '' another Fredericksburg 
affair." 

The estimate of the enemy's loss, at Murfreesborough.from 12,000 
to 20,000, in killed, wounded, and prisoners, and ours at from four 
to nine thousand. Bragg says he will fight again near the same 
place, and his men are in high spirits. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 237 

Our men fight to kill now, since the emancipation doom has 
been pronounced. But we have had a hard rain and nightly frosts, 
which will put an end to campaigning during the remainder of the 
winter. The fighting will be on the water, or near it. 

The legislature is in session, and resolutions inimical to the 
passport system have already been introduced. But where are 
State Rights now ? 

Congress meets to-morrow. 

JANUARY 13TH. The generals in North Carolina are impor- 
tunate for reinforcements. They represent the enemy as in great 
force, and that Weldon, Goldsborough, Raleigh, and Wilmington 
are in extreme peril. Lee cannot send any, or, if he does, Rich- 
mond will be threatened again, and possibly taken. 

How shall we live ? Boarding ranges from $60 to $100 per 
month. Our landlord says he will try to get boarding in the 
country, and if he succeeds, probably we may keep the house we 
now occupy, furnished, at a rent of $1200, for a mere robin's nest 
of four rooms ! 'But 1 hope to get the house at the corner of First 
and Casey, in conjunction with Gen. Rains, for $1800. It has a 
dozen rooms. 

JANUARY 14TH. Gen. Beauregard, some of whose forces have 
been taken from him and sent to the defense of Wilmington, is 
apprehensive that they may be lost, in the event of the enemy 
making a combined naval and land attack, and then Charleston 
and Savannah would be in great peril. Gens. Smith and Whiting 
call lustily for aid, and say they have not adequate means of de- 
fense. 

Some 4000 more negroes have been called for to work on 
the fortifications near Richmond. I believe 10,000 are at work 
now. 

A letter "by order" of the Secretary of War to Col. Godwin, 
in King and Queen County, written by Judge Campbell, says 
that blockaders are allowed to run through, provided they be not 
suspicious parties. The gpvernment takes what it wants at seventy- 
five per cent, and releases the rest. The parties are liable to have 
their goods confiscated by the Secretary of the Treasury, who, 
however, the letter proceeds to say, has never molested any one in 
the illicit trade smuggling. 

In Congress, yesterday, Mr. Foote called for a committee to in- 



238 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

vestigate the commissary's contract with Haxhall, Crenshaw & Co., 
and was particularly severe on Major Ruffin, in the commissary's 
office, whom he understood was a partner in the flour concern. 

Mr. Foote introduced a series of resolutions to-day, tempting 
the Northern States to make peace with us separately, excluding 
the New England States, and promising commercial advantages, 
etc. But we must treat as independent States, pledging a league 
with those that abandon the United States Government offensive 
and defensive and guaranteeing the navigation of the Mississippi 
River to the Northwestern States. They were referred to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations, of which he is the chairman. 
This is nothing. 

But neither yesterday nor the day before was there a quorum of 
both houses ; a sad spectacle in such a season of gloom. It was 
enlivened, however, by a communication from the Surgeon-General, 
proposing to send surgeons to vaccinate all the members. They 
declined the honor, though the small-pox is raging frightfully. 

To-day a quorum was found in each house, and the President's 
message was sent in. I have not read it yet. 

JANUARY 15iH. The President's message is highly applauded. 
It is well written ; but I do not perceive much substance in it, be- 
sides some eloquent reproaches of England and France for the 
maintenance of their neutrality, which in effect is greatly more 
beneficial to the United States than to us. The President essays 
to encourage the people to continued effort and endurance and 
such encouragement is highly judicious at this dark epoch of the 
struggle. He says truly we have larger armies, and a better 
supply of arms, etc., now, than we have had at any time pre- 
viously. 

The President says he will, unless Congress directs differently, 
have all Federal officers that we may capture, handed over to the 
States to be dealt with as John Brown was dealt with. The 
Emancipation Proclamation, if not revoked, may convert the war 
into a most barbarous conflict. 

Mr. Foote, yesterday, introduced a resolution requesting, the 
recall of our diplomatic agents ; and, after a certain time, to 
notify the foreign consuls to leave the country, no longer recog- 
nizing them in an official capacity. 

A bill was introduced making Marylanders subject to conscription. 



I 

AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 239 

JANUARY 16TH. Gen. Lee is in the city, doubtless to soe about 
the pressure upon him for reinforcements in North Carolina. Gen. 
Smith still writes from Goldsborough for more men, with doleful 
forebodings if they be refused. 

From Eastern Tennessee, we have bad accounts of outrages by 
the disloyal inhabitants, who have fled, to escape conscription, to 
the mountains and caves, many of them taking their families. At 
night they emerge from their hiding-places, and commit depreda- 
tions on the secessionists. 

It has been blowing a gale for two days, and there are rumors 
of more losses of the enemy's ships on the coast of North 
Carolina. 

A letter was received by the government to-day from Arizona, 
justifying Col. Baylor for his policy of dealing with the Indians. 
I do not hear of any steps yet on the part of the President. 

A report of the commandant at Camp Holmes, Raleigh, N. C., 
states that 12,000 conscripts have been received there altogether; 
8000 have been sent off to regiments, 2000 detailed on govern- 
ment work, 500 deserted, etc. . 

The Enquirer to-day publishes the fact that a ship, with stores, 
merchandise, etc., has just arrived at Charleston; that six more 
are on the way thither, and that a steamer has successfully run the 
blockade from Wilmington with cotton. This notification may 
increase the vigilance of the blockading fleet. The Enquirer is 
also perpetually tilting with the Raleigh Standard. I doubt the 
policy of charging the leading journals in North Carolina with 
predilections for the Union. I believe the Enquirer has no settled 
editor now. 

Mr. Foote favors the conscription of Marylanders. If such an 
act should be likely to pass, Gen. Winder will be beset with ap- 
plications to leave the Confederacy. 

JANUARY 17TH. Gen. Lee has left the city. His troops, en- 
camped thirty miles north of Richmond, marched northward last 
night. So it is his determination to cross the Rappahannock ? 
Or is it a demonstration of the enemy to prevent him from sending 
reinforcements to North Carolina ? We shall know speedily. 

North Carolina, one would think, is soon to be the scene of 
carnage; and it is asked what can 16,000 men do against 60,000 ? 

The enemy began the attack on Fort Caswell yesterday; no 



240 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY ; 

result. But one of his blockaders went ashore in the storm, and 
we captured the officers and crew. 

All the conscripts in the West have been ordered to Gen. 
Bragg. 

Shall we starve ? Yesterday beef was sold for 40 cts. per pound ; 
to-day it is 60 cts. Lard is $1.00. Butter $2.00. They say the 
sudden rise is caused by the prisoners of Gen. Bragg, several 
thousand of whom have arrived here, and they are subsisted from 
the market. Thus they injure us every way. But, n'imporle, say 
some; if Lincoln's Emancipation be not revoked, but few more 
prisoners will be taken on either side. That would be a barbar- 
ous war, without quarter. 

I see that Col. J. W. Wall, of New Jersey, has been nominated, 
and I suppose will be elected, U. S. Senator. He was confined 
for months in prison at Fort Lafayette. I imagine the colonel is 
a bold, able man. 

JANUARY 18TH. It was bitter cold last night, and everything 
is frozen this morning ; there will be abundance of ice next summer, 
if we keep our ice-houses. 

In these times of privation and destitution, I see many men, 
who were never prominent secessionists, enjoying comfortable posi- 
tions, and seeking investments for their surplus funds. Surely 
there must be some compensation in this world or the next for the 
true patriots who have sacrificed everything, and still labor in sub- 
ordinate positions, with faith and patient suffering. These men 
and their families go in rags, and upon half-rations, while the others 
fare most sumptuously. 

We are now, in effect, in a state of siege, and none but the opu- 
lent, often those who have defrauded the government, can obtain 
a sufficiency of food and raiment. Calico, which could once be 
bought for 12^ cts. per yard, is now selling at $2.25, and a lady's 
dress of calico costs her about $30.00. Bonnets are not to be had. 
Common bleached cotton shirting brings $1.50 per yard. All 
other dry goods are held in the same proportion. Common tallow 
candles are $1.25 per pound ; soap, $1.00 ; hams, $1.00 ; oppossum 
$3.00; turkeys $4 to $11.00; sugar, brown, $1.00; molasses $8.00 
per gallon; potatoes $6.00 per bushel, etc. 

These evils might be remedied by the government, for there is no 
great scarcity of any of the substantials and necessities of life in 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. , 241 

the country, if they were only equally distributed. The difficulty 
is in procuring transportation, and the government monopolizes 
the railroads and canals. 

Our military men apprehend no serious consequences from the 
army of negroes in process of organization by the Abolitionists at 
Washington. Gen. Rains says the negro cannot fight, and will 
always run away. He told me an anecdote yesterday which hap- 
pened under his own observation. An officer, when going into 
battle, charged his servant to stay at his tent and take care of 
his property. In the fluctuations of the battle, some of the enemy's 
shot fell in the vicinity of the tent, and the negro, with great white 
eyes, fled away with all his might. After the fight, and when the 
officer returned to his tent, he was vexed to learn that his slave 
had run away, but the boy soon returned, confronting his indignant 
master, who threatened to chastise him for disobedience of orders. 
Caesar said : " Massa, you told me to take care of your property, 
and dis property" (placing his hand on his breast) "is worf fifteen 
hundred dollars." He escaped punishment. 

Some 200,000 of the Abolition army will be disbanded in May 
by the expiration of their terms of enlistment, and we have every 
reason to believe that their places cannot be filled by new recruits. 
If we hold out until then, we shall be able to resist at all vital 
points. 

JANUARY 19ra. We have rumors of fighting this morning on 
the Rappahannock ; perhaps the enemy is making another advance 
upon Richmond. 

There was a grand funeral to-day, Gen. D. R. Jones's ; he died 
of heart disease. 

Gen. Bragg dispatches that Brig. -Gen. Wheeler, with his cav- 
alry, got in the rear of Rosecrans a few days ago, and burned a 
railroad bridge. He then penetrated to the Cumberland River, 
and destroyed three large transports and bonded a fourth, which 
took off his paroled prisoners. After this he captured and de- 
stroyed a gun-boat and its armament sent in quest of him. 

We have taken Springfield, Missouri. 

Rosecrans sends our officers, taken at Murfreesborough, to Alton, 
111., to retaliate on us for the doom pronounced in our President's 
proclamation, and one of his generals has given notice that if we 

21 



242 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

burn a railroad bridge (in our own country) all private property 
within a mile of it shall be destroyed. The black flag next. 

We have no news from North Carolina. 

Mr. Caperton was elected C. S. Senator by the Virginia Legis- 
ture on Saturday, in place of Mr. Preston, deceased. 

An intercepted letter from a Mr. Sloane, Charlotte, N. C., to 
A. T. Stewart & Co., New York, was laid before the Secretary of 
War yesterday. He urged the New York merchant, who has con- 
tributed funds for our subjugation, to send merchandise to the 
South, now destitute, and he would act as salesman. The Secre- 
tary indorsed "conscript him, "and yet the Assistant Secretary has 
given instructions to Col. Godwin, in the border counties, to wink 
at the smugglers. This is consistency ! And the Assistant Secre- 
tary writes "by order of the Secretary of War!" 

JANUARY 20TH. The rumor of fighting on the Rappahannock 
is not confirmed. But Gen. Lee writes that his beeves are so poor 
the soldiers won't eat the meat. He asks the government to send 
him salt meat. 

From Northern sources we learn that Arkansas Post has fallen, 
and that we have lost from 5000 to 7000 men there. If this be 
true, our men must have been placed in a man-trap, as at Roanoke 
Island. 

Mr. Perkins, in Congress, has informed the country that Mr. 
Metnminger, the Secretary of the Treasury, has hitherto opposed 
and defeated the proposition that the government buy all the 
cotton. Mr. M. should never have been appointed. He is head- 
strong, haughty, and tyrannical when he imagines he is dealing 
with inferiors, and he deems himself superior to the rest of man- 
kind. But he is no Carolinian by birth or descent. 

We see accounts of public meetings in New Jersey, wherein the 
government at Washington is fiercely denounced, and peace de- 
manded, regardless of consequences. Some of the speakers openly 
predicted that the war would spread into the North, if not term- 
inated at once, and in that event, the emancipationists would have 
foes to fight elsewhere than in the South. Among the participants 
I recognize the names of men whom I met in convention at Tren- 
ton in 1860. They clamor for the "Union as it was, the Consti- 
tution as it is," adopting the motto of my paper, the " Southern 
Monitor," the office of which was sacked in Philadelphia in April, 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 243 

1861. Our government will never agree to anything short of in- 
dependence. President Davis will be found inflexible on that point. 

There was a rumor yesterday that France had recognized us. 
The news of the disaster of Burnside at Fredericksburg having 
certainly been deemed very important in Europe. But France 
has not yet acted in our behalf. We all pray for the Emperor's 
intervention. We suffer much, and but little progress is made in 
conscription. Nearly all our resources are in the field. Another 
year of war, and ! 

JANUARY 21sT. Last night the rain fell in torrents, and to-day 
there is a violent storm of wind from the N.W. This may put an 
end, for a season, to campaigning on land, and the enemy's fleet 
at sea may he dispersed. Providence may thus intervene in our 
behalf. 

It is feared that we have met with a serious blow in Arkansas, 
but it is not generally believed that so many (5000 to 7000 men) 
surrendered, as is stated in the Northern papers. Gen. Holmes is 
responsible for the mishap. 

Conscription drags its slow length along. It is not yet adding 
many to the army. The Assistant Secretary of War, and several 
others, "by order of the Secretary of War," are granting a fearful 
number of exemptions daily. Congress, I hope, will modify the 
exemption bill immediately. It is believed enrolling officers, sur- 
geons, and others are permitting thousands to remain at home " for 
a price." Even clerks in the War Department, it is said, are 
driving a lucrative business in "getting men off," who should be 
on duty, in this war of independence. Young men in the depart- 
ments, except in particular cases, will not stand in good repute 
"when the hurly burly 's done, when the battle's lost and won." 

Congress is at work projecting the organization of a Supreme 
Court. 

JANUARY 22o. We have reliable intelligence of the sinking of 
the U. S. gun-boat Hatteras, in the Gulf, by the Alabama. She 
was iron-clad, and all the officers and crew, with the exception of 
five, went down. 

Gen. Whiting telegraphs to-day for the use of conscripts near 
Wilmington, in the event of an emergency. Several ships have 
just come in safely from abroad, and it is said a large number are 
on the way. 



244 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

Mr. Miles yesterday reported, from the Military Committee, a 
bill repealing the existing exemption law, and embracing all male 
residents between the ages of 18 and 45 years. The President, or 
Secretary of War, to have authority to grant exemptions in cer- 
tain cases, if deemed expedient. This ought to give us 200,000 
more men. And they will be required. 

A resolution was passed demanding of the Commissary and 
Quartermaster- General the number of their employees capable of 
performing military duty. It would be well to extend the inquiry 
to the War Deparment itself. 

A letter from Norfolk states that at a grand ball, in celebration 
of the emancipation of the negroes, Gen. Yieille opened the dance 
with a mulatto woman of bad character as his partner; and Mrs.Y. 
had for her partner a negro barber. 

JANUARY 23o. The Northern papers are filled with what pur- 
ports to be the intercepted correspondence of Mr. Benjamin with 
Messrs. Mason and Slidell. Lord John Russell is berated. The 
Emperor of France is charged with a design to seize Mexico as a 
colony, and to recognize Texas separately, making that State in 
effect a dependency, from which cotton may be procured as an 
offset to British India. He says the French Consuls in Texas are 
endeavoring to detach Texas from the Confederacy. If this be a 
genuine correspondence, it will injure the South ; if it be false 
(if the allegations be false), it will still injure us. I have no doubt 
of its genuineness ; and that Mr. Sanders, once the correspondent 
of the New York Tribune, was the bearer. If Texas leaves us, 
so may Louisiana and the gigantic Houmas speculation may turn 
out well at last. 

Mr. Curry has brought forward a copyright bill; Mr. Foster, of 
Alabama, has introduced a bill to abolish the passport system 
leaving the matter to railroad conductors. 

A dispatch from Gen. Bragg assures us that our cavalry are still 
capturing and destroying large amounts of Rosecrans's stores on 
the Cumberland River. 

Col. Wall has been elected Senator from New Jersey. They 
say he is still pale and ill from his imprisonment, for opinion sake. 
I hope he will speak as boldly in the Senate as out of it. 

I met Gen. Davis to-day (the President's nephew), just from 
Goldsborough, where his brigade is stationed. He is in fiueplumage 
and I hope he will prove a game-cock. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 245 

Major-Gen. French, in command at Petersburg, is a Northern 
man. Our native generals are brigadiers. It is amazing that 
all the superior officers in command near the capital should be 
Northern men. Can this be the influence of Gen. Cooper? It 
may prove disastrous ! 

JANUARY 24TH. Gen. Smith writes that he deems Wilmington 
in a condition to resist any attacks. 

The exposition of Mr. Benjamin's dispatches has created pro- 
found mortification in the community. 

Another transport has been taken from the enemy in the Cum- 
berland River. No further news from Arkansas. 

There is a white flag (small-pox) within seventy yards of our 
house. But it is probable we must give up the house soon, as the 
owner is desirous to return to it being unable to get board in 
the country. 

Gen. Rains, who has been making a certain sort of primer, met 
with an accident this morning; one of them exploded in his hand, 
injuring his thumb and finger. He was scarcely able to sign his 
name to official documents to-day. 

Mr. Hunter has brought forward a measure for the funding of 
Treasury notes, the redundant circulation having contributed to 
produce the present fabulous prices in the market. 

In the New Jersey Legislature petitions are flowing in denun- 
ciatory of Lincoln's Emancipation scheme, which would cast into 
the free States a large excess of profitless population. 

JANUARY 25TH Gen. Lee mentions, in his recent correspond- 
ence, an instance of the barbarity of some of the Yankee soldiers 
in the Abolition Army of the Potomac. They thrust into the 
Rappahannock River a poor old negro man, whom they had taken 
from his master, because he had the small-pox; and he would have 
been drowned had he not been rescued by our pickets. It is sur- 
mised that this dreadful disease prevails to an alarming extent in 
the Yankee army, and probably embarrasses their operations. 
Our men have all been vaccinated; and their recklessness of dis- 
ease and death is perhaps a guarantee of exemption from afflic- 
tion. Their health, generally, is better than it has ever been 
before. 

The government at Washington has interdicted the usual ex- 
change of newspapers, for the present. This gives 'rise to con- 

21* 



246 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

jecture that Lincoln experiences grave difficulties from the ad- 
verse sentiment of his people and his armies regarding his Eman- 
cipation Proclamation. And it is likely he has met with grave 
losses at sea, for the invading army in North Carolina has retired 
back on Newbern. But the season for naval enterprises is not 
over, and we are prepared to expect some heavy blows before 
April. 

The revelations in the intercepted dispatches captured with Mr. 
Sanders, whose father is a notorious political adventurer, may be 
most unfortunate. They not only show that we even were nego- 
tiating for six war steamers, but give the names of the firms in 
Europe that were to furnish them. The project must now be 
abandoned. And Louis Napoleon will be enraged at the sus- 
picions and imputations of our Secretary of State regarding his 
occult policy. 

Gen. Rains has invented a new primer for shell, which will ex- 
plode from the slightest pressure. The shell is buried just beneath 
the surface of the earth, and explodes when a horse or a man 
treads upon it. He says he would not use such a weapon in ordi- 
nary warfare; but has no scruples in resorting to any means of 
defense against an army of Abolitionists, invading our country for 
the purpose, avowed, of extermination. He tried a few shell on 
the Peninsula last spring, and the explosion of only four sufficed 
to arrest the army of invaders, and compelled them to change their 
line of march. 

JANUARY 26TH. The Northern papers say Hooker's grand 
division crossed the Rappahannock, ten miles above Falmouth, 
several days ago. 

Burnside has issued an address to his army, promising them 
another battle immediately. 

Gen. Lee advises the government to buy all the grain in the 
counties through which the canal runs. He says many farmers are 
hoarding their provisions, for extortionate prices. 

I have no house yet. Dr. Wortham had one ; and although I 
applied first, he let Mr. Reagan, the Postmaster- General, have it. 
He is a member of President Davis's cabinet and receives $6000 
salary. 

There is much indignation expressed by the street talkers 
against Mr. "Benjamin and Mr. Sanders, in the matter of the in- 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 247 

tercepted dispatches : against Mr. Benjamin for casting such 
imputations on Napoleon and his consular agents, and for sending 
his dispatches by such a messenger, in the absence of the Presi- 
dent ; against Sanders for not destroying the dispatches. Many 
think the information was sold to the United States Govern- 
ment. 

Col. Wall has made a speech in Philadelphia. He said he 
should take his seat in the United States Senate as an advocate 
of peace ; and he boldly denounced the Lincoln administration. 

Our official report shows that our military authorities, up to this 
time, have burnt 100,000 bales of cotton in Arkansas. I have not 
learned the amount destroyed in other States but it is large. 
Gen. Lee thinks the object of the expeditions of the enemy on the 
Southern coast is to procure cotton, etc. The slaves can do them 
no good, and the torch will disappoint the marauders. 

Strong and belligerent resolutions have been introduced in the 
United States Congress against France, for her alleged purpose 
to obtain dominion in Mexico. It is violative of the Monroe doc- 
trine. And Mr. Benjamin's accusation against the consuls (em- 
bracing a French design on Texas) might seem like a covert pur- 
pose to unite both the Confederate and the United States against 
France and that might resemble premeditated reconstruction. 
But diplomatists must be busy always at their webs. President 
Davis would be the last man to abandon the ship Independence. 

JANUARY 27TH. It is too true that several thousand of our 
men were captured at Arkansas Post, and that Little Rock is now 
in danger. 

There seems to be no probability, after all, of an immediate ad- 
vance of the enemy across the Rappahannock. 

But there are eight iron-clad gun-boats and ninety sail at 
Beaufort, North Carolina, and, it is reported, 52,000 men. Wil- 
mington will probably be assailed. 

Mr. Foote said, yesterday, if Indiana and Illinois would recede 
from the war, be should be in favor of aiding them with an army 
against Lincoln. And all the indications from the North seem to 
exhibit a strong sentiment among the people favoring peace. 
But the people are not the government, and they sink peace and 
reconstruction together. 

Yesterday Mr. Crockett, of Kentucky, said, in the House of 



248 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

Representatives, that there was a party in favor of forming; a Cen- 
tral Confederacy (of free and slave States) between the Northern 
and Southern extremes. Impracticable. 

To-day we have news of the bombardment of Fort McAlister, 
near Savannah. No result known. Now we shall have tidings 
every few days of naval operations. Can Savannah, and Charles- 
ton, and Wilmington be successfully defended ? They may, if 
they will emulate the example of Vicksburg. If they fall, it will 
stagger this government before the peace party in the North can 
operate on the Government of the United States. Bat it would 
not "crush the rebellion." 

JANUARY 28TH. The bombardment of Fort McAlister con- 
tinued five hours yesterday, when the enemy's boats drew off. The 
injury to the fort can be repaired in a day. Not a man was killed 
or a gun dismounted. The injury done the fleet is not known. 
But the opinion prevails here that if the bombardment was con- 
tinued to-day, the elongated shot of the enemy probably demol- 
ished the fort. 

Last night and all this day it snowed incessantly melting 
rapidly, however. This must retard operations by land in Vir- 
ginia and probably in North Carolina. 

JANUARY 29iH. It appears from the Northern press that the 
enemy did make three attempts last week to cross the Rappa- 
hannock ; but as they advanced toward the stream, the elements 
successfully opposed them. It rained, it snowed, and it froze. 
The gun carriages and wagons sank up to the hubs, the horses to 
their bodies, and the men to their knees; and so all stuck fast 
in the mud. 

I saw an officer to-day from the army in North Carolina. He 
says the prospect for a battle is good, as soon as the roads admit 
of marching. 

We have nothing further from the bombardment near Savan- 
nah. The wires may not be working or the fort may be taken. 

Gov. Vance has sent to the department a strong protest against 
the appointment of Col. August as commandant of conscripts in 
Northern Tennessee. Col. A. is a Virginian that is the only 
reason. Well, Gen. Rains, who commands all the conscripts in 
the Confederate States, is a North Carolinian. But the War 
Department has erred in putting so many strangers in command 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 249 

of localities, where natives might have been selected. Richmond, 
for instance, has never yet been in the command of a Southern 
general. 

There are indications of a speedy peace, although we are en- 
vironed by sea and by land as menacingly as ever. The Tribune 
(New York) has an article which betrays much desperation. It 
says the only way for the United States Government to raise 
$300,000,000, indispensably necessary for a further prosecution of 
the war, is to guarantee (to the capitalists) that it will be the last 
call for a loan, and that subjugation will be accomplished in ninety 
days, or never. It says the war must then be urged on furiously, 
and negro soldiers sent among the slaves to produce an insurrection 1 
If this will not suffice, then let peace be made on the best possible 
terms. The New York World denounces the article, and is for 
peace at once. It says if the project (diabolical) of the Tribune 
fails, it may not be possible to make peace on any terms. In this 
I see indications of a foregone conclusion. All over the North, 
and especially in the Northwest, the people are clamoring for peace, 
and denouncing the Lincoln Emancipation Proclamation. I have 
no doubt, if the war continues throughout the year, we shall have 
the spectacle of more Northern men fighting against the United 
States Government than slaves fighting against the South. 

Almost every day, now, ships from Europe arrive safely with 
merchandise: and this is a sore vexation to the Northern mer- 
chants. We are likewise getting, daily, many supplies from the 
North, from blockade-runners. No doubt this is winked at by the 
United States military authorities, and perhaps by some of the 
civil ones, too. 

If we are not utterly crushed before May (an impracticable 
thing), we shall win our independence. 

JANUARY 30TH. There is a rumor that Kentucky has voted to 
raise an army of 60,000 men to resist the execution of Lincoln's 
Emancipation Proclamation. 

Fort Caswell, below Wilmington, has been casemated with iron ; 
but can it withstand elongated balls weighing 480 pounds ? I fear 
not. There are, however, submarine batteries; yet these may be 
avoided, for Gen. Whiting writes that the best pilot (one sent 
thither some time ago by the enemy) escaped to the hostile fleet 
since Gen. Smith visited North Carolina, which is embraced within 



250

his command. This pilot, no doubt, knows the location of all our 
torpedoes. 

Nothing further from Savannah. 

Mr. Adams, the United States Minister at London, writes to 
Mr. Seward, Secretary of State, dated 17th of October, 1862, that 
if the Federal army shall not achieve decisive successes by the 
month of February ensuing, it is probable the British Parliament 
will recognize the Confederate States. To-morrow is the last day 
of January. 

I cut the following from yesterday's Dispatch: 

"The Results of Extortion and Speculation. The state of 
affairs brought about by the speculating and extortion practiced

" So much we owe the speculators, who have stayed at home to 
prey upon the necessities of their fellow-citizens." 

We have just learned that a British steamer, with cannon and 
other valuable cargo, was captured by the enemy, two days ago, 
while trying to get in the harbor. Another, similarly laden, 
got safely in yesterday. We can afford to lose one ship out of 
three that is, the owners can, and then make money. 

Cotton sells at seventy-Jive cents per pound in the United 
States. So the blockade must be felt by the enemy as well as 
ourselves. War is a two-edged sword. 

JANUARY 31si. We have dispatches from Charleston, to-day, 
which reconcile us to the loss of the cargo captured by the block- 
ading squadron early in the week. An artillery company captured 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 251 

a fine gun-boat in Stone River (near Charleston) yesterday even- 
ing. She had eleven guns and 200 men. 

But this morning we did better still. Our little fleet of two 
iron-clads steamed out of Charleston harbor, and boldly attacked 
the blockading fleet. We crippled two of their ships, and sunk 
one, completely raising the blockade, for the time being. This 
will frustrate some of their plans, and may relieve Wilmington. 

The attack on Fort McAlister was a failure. The monitor 
which assaulted the fort sustained so much injury, that it had to 
retire for repairs. 

Several blockade- runners between this and Williamsburg were ar- 
rested and sent to Gen. Winder to-day by Lieut. G. D. Wise. Gen. 
W. sent them to Gen. Rains. Mr. Petit and Mr. James Custis 
(from Williamsburg) came with them to endeavor to procure their 
liberation. Gen. Rains sent them back to Gen. W., with a note 
that he had no time to attend to such matters. Such business 
does not pertain to his bureau. I suppose they will be released. 

Major Lear, of Texas, who was at the capture of the Harriet 
Lane, met on the captured steamer his mortally-wounded son, the 
lieutenant. 

A few days ago, Lieut. Buchanan was killed on a United States 
gun-boat by our sharpshooters. He was the son of Admiral Bu- 
chanan, in the Confederate service, now at Mobile. Thus we are 
reminded of the wars of the roses father against son, and brother 
against brother. God speed the growth of the Peace Party, North 
and South ; but we must have independence. 

Mr. Hunter was in our office to-day,'getting the release of a son 
of the Hon. Jackson Morton, who escaped from Washington, where 
ha had resided, and was arrested here as a conscript. The Assist- 
ant Secretary of War ruled him entitled to exemption, although 
yesterday others, in the same predicament, were ruled into the 
service.

It is doubtful whether the bill will pass, as most of the members 
are agriculturists. 

It is said and believed that several citizens from Illinois and 
Indiana, now in this city, have been sent hither by influential par- 
ties, to consult our government on the best means of terminating 
the war; or, that failing, to propose some mode of adjustment 
between the Northwestern States and the Confederacy, and new 
combination against the Yankee States and the Federal adminis- 
tration. 

Burnside has at last been removed; and Franklin and Sumner 
have resigned. Gen. Hooker now commands the Federal Array 

of the Potomac if it may be still called an army. Gen. R, , 

who knows Hooker well, says he is deficient in talent and charac- 
ter; and many years ago gentlemen refused to associate with him. 
He resigned from the army, in California, and worked a potatoe 
patch, Yankee like, on speculation and failed. 

FEBRUARY 2D. After the feat at Charleston, Gen. Beaure- 
gard and Commodore Ingraham invited the consuls resident to 
inspect the harbor, and they pronounced the blockade raised, no 
United States ship being seen off the coast. Then the general and 
the commodore issued a proclamation to the world that the port 
was open. If this be recognized, then the "United States will 
have to give sixty days' notice before the port can be closed again 
to neutral powers; and by that time we can get supplies enough 
to suffice us for a year. Before night, however, some twenty 
blockaders were in sight of the bar. It is not a question of right, 
or of might, with France and England but of inclination. When- 
ever they, or either of them, shall be disposed to relieve us, it can 
be done. 

There was a fight near Suffolk yesterday, and it is reported that 
our troops repulsed the enemy. 

22 



254 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

The enemy's gun-boats returned to the bombardment of Fort 
McAlister, and met no success. They were driven off. But still, 
I fear the fort must succumb. 

Senator Saulsbury, of Delaware, has been arrested by the Ser- 
geant-at- Arms of the Senate, for his denunciation of Lincoln as an 
" imbecile." And a Philadelphia editor has been imprisoned for 
alleged "sympathy with secessionists." These arrests signify more 
battles more blood. 

FEBRUARY 3D. It appears that Gen. Pryor's force, 1500 strong, 
was attacked by the enemy, said to be 5000 in number, on the 
Blackwater. After some shelling and infantry firing, Gen. P. re- 
tired some eight miles, and was not pursued. Our loss was only 
fifty; it is said the enemy had 500 killed and wounded; but I 
know not how this was ascertained. 

Gold in the North now brings 58^ cents premium. Exchange 
sells at $1.75. Cotton at 96 cents per pound ! 

They are getting up a fine rumpus in the North over the im- 
prisonment of an editor. 

To-day, when conversing with Judge Perkins in relation to 
having a passport system established by law, he admitted the ne- 
cessity, but despaired of its accomplishment. " For," said he, 
" nothing can be done in Congress which has not the sanction of 
the Executive." He meant, I thought, from his manner and tone, 
that the Executive branch of the government was omnipotent, hav- 
ing swallowed up the functions of the other co-ordinate branches. 
I cannot understand this, for the Executive has but little appoint- 
ing patronage, the army being completely organized, having sup- 
plementary generals, and all officers, under the grade of brigadiers, 
being promoted as vacancies occur. 

FEBRUARY 4TH. One of the enemy's iron-clad gun -boats has 
got past our batteries at Ticksburg. Gen. Pemberton says it was 
struck " three times." But it is through. 

The enemy's presses reiterate the assertion that Gen. Longstreet 
is in Tennessee with his corps; and that the detachments from 
Gen. Lee's army amount to 75,000 men. This is evidently for the 
purpose to encourage Hooker's army to cross the Rappahannock. 
These presses must know that Gen. Lee's whole army was less 
than 75,000 men; that Longstreet is still with him, and that only 
one small brigade has been sent away to North Carolina. Well, 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 255 

let them come ! They will be annihilated. But is it not diaboli- 
cal in the New York Post, Times, etc. to urge their own people 
on to certain destruction? If Hooker had 300,000, he could not 
now come to Richmond ! 

We have extremely cold weather now; and, probably, the rivers 
in Virginia will be frozen over to-night. 

FEBRUARY 5TH. It snowed again last night. Tuesday night 
the mercury was 8 below zero. 

A dispatch from Gen. Beauregard says sixty sail of the enemy 
have left Beaufort, N. C., for Charleston. A British frigate (Cad- 
mus) has arrived at Charleston with intelligence that the Federal 
fleet of gun-boats will attack the city immediately; and that the 
British consul is ordered away by the Minister at Washington. 
The attack will be by sea and land. God help Beauregard in this 
fearful ordeal ! 

FEBRUARY GTH. Gen. Lee thinks Charleston will be assailed, 
and suggests that all the troops in North Carolina be concentrated 
near Wilmington, and he will undertake the defense of the rest of 
the State. Nevertheless, if the government deems it more im- 
portant to have his troops sent to North Carolina, than to retain 
them for the defense of Richmond, he must acquiesce. But he 
thinks Hooker will attempt the passage of the Rappahannock, 
at an early day, if the weather will admit of it. In regard to 
the last attempt of Burnside to cross his army (when he stuck 
in the mud), Gen. Lee says it was fortunate for the Federals 
that they failed to get over. No doubt he was prepared for their 
reception. 

Congress is doing nothing but voting money for themselves. 
The President (some of the members say) is their master, and 
they await his nod. These are his enemies. 

FEBRUARY TTH. We have a dispatch from Texas, of another 
success of Gen. Magruder at Sabine Pass, wherein he destroyed a 
large amount of the enemy's stores. 

But we are calmly awaiting the blow at Charleston, or a 
Savannah, or wherever it may fall. We have confidence in Beau- 
regard. 

We are more anxious regarding the fate of Vicksburg. North- 
ern man as he is, if Pemberton suffers disaster by any default, he 
will certainly incur the President's eternal displeasure. Missis- 



256 

sippi must be defended, else the President himself may feel the 
pangs of a refugee. 

" That mercy I to others show, 
That mercy show to me!" 

FEBRUARY STH. From intelligence received yesterday evening, 
it is probable the Alabama, Harriet Lane, and Florida have met 
off the West Indies, and turned upon the U. S. steamer Brooklyn. 
The account says a large steamer was seen on fire, and three 
others were delivering broadsides into her. The United States 
press thought the burning steamer was the Florida. 

From Charleston or Savannah we shall soon have stirring news. 
They may overpower our forces, but our power there will be com- 
pletely exhausted before resistance ceases. There will be no more 
"giving up," as with New Orleans, Norfolk, etc. Yet there is a 
feverish anxiety regarding Yicksburg. Pemberton permitted one 
iron-clad gun-boat to pass, and all our boats below are now at its 
mercy. 

The House of Representatives, at Washington, has passed the 
"negro soldier bill." This will prove a " Pandora's Box," and the 
Federals may rue the day that such a measure was adopted. 

FEBRUARY DTH. Gen. Lee requests that all dispatches passing 
between his headquarters and the War Department be in cipher. 
He says everything of importance communicated, he has observed, 
soon becomes the topic of public conversation; and thence is soon 
made known to the enemy. 

The iron-clad gun-boat, which got past Yicksburg, has been up 
the Red River spreading devastation. It has taken three of our 
steamers, forty officers on one, and captured large amounts of 
stores and cotton. 

Gen. Wise made a dash into Williamsburg last night, and cap- 
tured the place, taking some prisoners. 

Custis (my son) received a letter to-day from Miss G., Newbern, 
via underground railroad, inclosing another for her sweet-heart in 
the army. She says they are getting on tolerably well in the 
hands of the enemy, though the slaves have been emancipated. 
She says a Yankee preacher (whom she calls a white- washed 
negro) made a speculation. He read the Lincoln Proclamation 
to the negroes : and then announced that none of them had been 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 257 

legally married, and might be liable to prosecution. To obviate 
this, he proposed to marry them over, charging only a dollar for 
each couple. He realized several thousand dollars, and then re- 
turned to the North. This was a legitimate Yankee speculation; 
and no doubt the preacher will continue to be an enthusiastic 
advocate of a war of subjugation. As long as the Yankees can 
make money by it, and escape killing, the war will continue. 

FEBRUARY IOTH. No stirring news yet. The enemy's fleet is 
at Port Royal, S. C. Everywhere we are menaced with over- 
whelming odds. Upon God, and our own right arms, we must 
rely, and we do rely. 

To-day, in cabinet council, it is believed it was decided to call 
out all conscripts under forty-five years of age. The President 
might have done it without consulting the cabinet. 

Yesterday Mrs. Goddin, the owner or wife of the owner of the 
house I occupy, failing to get board in the country, and we having 
failed to get another house, took possession of one room of the 
little cottage. We have temporarily the rest: parlor, dining- 
room, and two chambers one of them 8 by 11 at the rate of 
$800 per annum. This is low, now; for ordinary dwellings, with- 
out furniture, rent for $1800. Mr. G. has an hereditary (I be- 
lieve) infirmity of the mind, and is confined by his father in an 
asylum. Mrs. G. has four little children, the youngest only a 
few weeks old. She has a white nurse, who lost her only child 
(died of scarlet fever) six days ago; her husband being in the 
army. It is a sad spectacle. 

To-day beef was selling in market at one dollar per pound. 
And yet one might walk for hours in vain, in quest of a beggar. 
Did such a people ever exist before ? 

FEBRUARY HTH. There is a rumor that Major-Gen. Gustavus 
W. Smith has tendered his resignation. 

Some idea may be formed of the scarcity of food in this city 
from the fact that, while my youngest daughter was in the kitchen 
to-day, a young rat came out of its hole and seemed to beg for 
something to eat; she held out some bread, which it ate from her 
hand, and seemed grateful. Several others soon appeared, and 
were as tame as kittens. Perhaps we shall have to eat them ! 

FEBRUARY 12TH. Congress has not yet restricted the class of 
exempts, and the work of conscription drags heavily along. All 

22* 



258 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

under forty-five most be called, else the maximum of the four hun- 
dred regiments cannot be kept up. It reminds me of Jack Falstaff's 
mode of exemption. The numerous employees of the Southern 
Express Co. have been let off, after transporting hither, for the 
use of certain functionaries, sugars, etc. from Alabama. And so 
in the various States, enrolling and other officers are letting thou- 
sands of conscripts slip through their hands. 

FEBRUARY 13-TH. There is a rumor in the papers that some- 
thing like a revolution is occurring, or has occurred, in the West; 
and it is stated that the Federal troops demand the recall of the 
Emancipation Proclamation. They also object to serving with 
negro troops. 

But we ought to look for news of terrific fighting at Savannah 
or Charleston. No doubt all the troops in the field (Federal) or 
on the water will be hurled against us before long, so as to effect 
as much injury as possible before defection can spread extensively, 
and before the expiration of the enlistments of some 200,000 men 
in May. 

And what are we doing ? But little. The acceptance of sub- 
stitutes who desert, and the exemption of thousands who should 
be fighting for the country, employ hundreds of pens daily in this 
city. Alas, that so many dishonest men have obtained easy places ! 
The President has been grossly imposed upon. 

FEBRUARY 14TH. A beautiful day. Yet Gen. Lee is giving 
furloughs, two to each company. If the weather should be dry, 
perhaps Hooker will advance: a thing desired by our people, 
being confident of his destruction. 

The papers issued extras to-day with news from the Northwest, 
based upon the account of a "reliable gentleman," who has just 
run the blockade. He says Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, and Illinois 
have resolved to meet in convention, at Frankfort, Ky., for the 
purpose of seceding from the United States, and setting up a 
confederacy for themselves, or joining the Southern Confed- 
eracy. I fear the " reliable gentleman " is not to be relied upon. 
Yet it would be well for the Western States, a just retribution to 
New England, and a very great relief to us. 

Gen. Lee is urging the department to have .the meat at Atlanta 
brought to his ,rmy without delay. It is here the army will be 
wanted. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 259 

I saw pigs to-day, not six weeks old, selling in market at $10 a 
piece.. 

I met Col. Bledsoe to-day, on a visit to the city, who told me 
Fenelon never tasted meat, and lived to be ninety years old. I 
am no Fenelon, but I shall probably have to adopt ,his regimen. 
I would barter, however, some of his years for a good supply of 
food. We must have peace soon, or a famine. 

FEBRUARY 15TH. Already, as if quite certain that the great 
Northwest would speedily withdraw from the Eastern United 
States, our people are discussing the eventualities of such a mo- 
mentous occurrence. The most vehement opposition to the admis- 
sion of any of the non-slaveholding States, whose people have 
invaded our country and shed the blood of our people, into this 
Confederacy, is quite manifest in this city. But Virginia, "the Old 
Mother," would, I think, after due hesitation, take back her erring 
children, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, and perhaps one or two more, if 
they earnestly desired to return to her parental protection. 

Some of the Cotton States might revolt at such a project, and 
even the cabinet might oppose the scheme of adding several pow- 
erful free States to the Confederacy ; but it would not all suffice 
to prevent it, if they desire to join us. It is true, the constitution 
would have to be modified, for it is not to be supposed that slaves 
would be held in any of the States referred to ; but then slavery 
would be recognized by its proper term, and ample guarantees 
would be agreed upon by the great free States which abandon the 
United States on the issue of emancipation. 

Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, added to the thirteen Confederate 
States, would speedily constitute us a people of sufficient military 
power to defy the menaces of the arms of the greatest powers of 
the earth ; and the commercial and agricultural prosperity of the 
country would amaze the world. 

I am of the opinion that Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, Ken- 
tucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Missouri would 
form a league of union with Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana, even if 
the rest of the Southern States were to reject the alliance. But 
who can foresee the future through the smoke of war, and amid 
the clash of bayonets? Nevertheless, division and subdivision 
would relieve all of the burden of debt, for they would repudi- 
ate the, greater part, if not the whole, of the indebtedness of both 



2GQ A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

the present governments, which has been incurred in ravaging 
the country and cutting each other's throats. The cry will be : 
" We will not pay the price of blood for the slaughter of our 
brothers !" 

FEBRUARY 16m. Another gun-boat has got past Yicksburg. 
But three British steamers have run into Charleston with valuable 
cargoes. 

Gen. Lee is now sending troops to Charleston, and this strength- 
ens the report that Hooker's army is leaving the Rappahannock. 
They are probably crumbling to pieces, under the influence of the 
peace party growing up in the North. Some of them, however, 
it is said, are sent to Fortress Monroe. 

Our Bureau of Conscription ought to be called the Bureau of 
Exemption. It is turning out a vast number of exempts. The 
Southern Express Company bring sugar, partridges, turkeys, etc. 
to the potential functionaries, and their employees are exempted 
during the time they may remain in the employment of the com- 
pany. It is too bad ! 

I have just been reperusing Frederick's great campaigns, and 
find much encouragement. Prussia was not so strong as the Con- 
federate States, and yet was environed and assailed by France, 
Austria, Russia, and several smaller powers simultaneously. And 
yet Frederick maintained the contest for seven years, and finally 
triumphed over his enemies. The preponderance of numbers 
against him in the field was greater than that of the United 
States against us; and Lee is as able a general as Frederick. 
Hence we should never despair. 

FEBRUARY 17TH. Gen. Lee is not sending troops to Charles- 
ton. He is sending them here for the defense of Richmond, which 
is now supposed to be the point of attack, by land and by water, and 
on both sides of the James River. Well, they have striven to 
capture this city from every point of the compass but one the 
south side. Perhaps they will make an attempt from that direc- 
tion; and I must confess that I have always apprehended the 
most danger from that quarter. But we shall beat them, come 
whence they may ! 

FEBRUARY 18iH. Mr. H s, another of Gen. Winder's de- 
tectives, has gone over to the enemy. He went on a privateering 
cruise from Wilmington ; the vessel he sailed in captured a brig, 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 261 

and H s was pat in command of the prize, to sail into a Con- 
federate port. Instead of this, however, H s sailed away for 

one of the West India islands, and gave up his prize to Com. 
Wilkes, of the United States Navy. 

One or two of the regiments of Gen. Lee's army were in the 
city last night. The men were pale and haggard. They have 
but a quarter of a pound of meat per day. But meat has been 
ordered from Atlanta. I hope it is abundant there. 

All the necessaries of life in the city are still going up higher in 
price. Butter, $3 per pound; beef, $1 ; bacon, $1.25; sausage- 
meat, $1 ; and even liver is selling at 50 cents per pound. 

By degrees, quite perceptible, we are approaching the condition 
of famine. What effect this will produce on the community is to 
be seen. The army must be fed or disbanded, or else the city 
must be abandoned. How we, "the people," are to live is a 
thought of serious concern. 

Gen. Lee has recommended that an appeal be made to the 
people to bring food to the army, to feed their sons and brothers; 
t>ut the Commissary-General opposes it; probably it will not be 
done. No doubt the army could be half fed in this way for 
months. But the "red tape" men are inflexible and inscrutable. 
Nevertheless, the commissaries and quartermasters are getting 
rich. 

FEBRUARY 19TH. The resignation of Gen. Gustavus W. Smith 
has been accepted by the President. It was well done the ac- 
ceptance, I mean. Who will Gen. Winder report to now? Gen. 
Winder has learned that I am keeping a diary, and that some 
space in it may be devoted to the history of martial law. He said 
to Capt. Warner, his commissary of prisons, that he would patron- 
ize it. The captain asked me if Gen. Winder's rule was not dwelt 
upon in it. I said doubtless it was; but that I had not yet re- 
vised it, and was never in the habit of perusing my own works 
until they were completed. Then I carefully corrected them for 
the press. 

Major- Gen. Pickett's division marched through the city to-day 
for Drewry's Bluff. Gen. Lee writes that this division can beat the 
army corps of Hooker, supposed to be sent to the Peninsula. It 
has 12,000 men an army corps 40,000. Brig. -Gen. Hood's di- 
vision is near the city, on the Chickahominy. Gen. Lee warns the 



202 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

government to see that Gens. French and Pryor be vigilant, and to 
have their scouts closely watching the enemy at Suffolk. He 
thinks, however, the main object of the enemy is to take Charles- 
ton ; and he suggests that every available man be sent thither. 
The rest of his army he will keep on the Rappahannock, to watch 
the enemy still remaining north of that river. 

I sent a communication to the President to-day, proposing to 
reopen my register of "patriotic contributions" to the army, for 
they are suffering for meat. I doubt whether he will agree to it. 
If the war be prolonged, the appeal must be to the people to feed 
the army, or else it will dissolve. 

FEBRUARY 20TH. We have exciting news from the West. The 
iron-shod gun-boat, Queen of the West, which run past Pember- 
tou's batteries some time since, captured, it appears, one of our 
steamers in Red River, and then compelled our pilot to steer the 
Queen of the West farther up the river. The heroic pilot ran the 
boat under our masked batteries, and then succeeded in escaping 
by swimming. The Queen of the West was forced to surrender. 
This adventure has an exhilarating effect upon our spirits. 

Hon. James Lyons sent to the President to-day a petition, 
signed by a majority of the members of Congress, to have me ap- 
pointed major in the conscription service. 

FEBRUARY 21 ST. Major- Gen. Hood's division passed through 
the city to 'day, and crossed over the river. I hope an attack will 
be made at Suffolk. It is too menacing a position to allow the 
invader to occupy it longer. 

No attack on Charleston yet, and there is a rumor that the 
command of the expedition is disputed by Foster and Hunter. If 
it hangs fire, it will be sure to miss the mark. 

FEBRUARY 22D. This is the anniversary of the birth of Wash- 
ington, and of the inauguration of President Davis, upon the 
installation of the permanent government of the Confederate 
States. It is the ugliest day I ever saw. Snow fell all night, 
and was falling fast all day, with a northwest wind howling furi- 
ously. The snow is now nearly a foot deep, and the weather 
very cold. 

My communication to the President, proposing an appeal to the 
people to furnish the army with meat and clothing (voluntary 
contributions), was transmitted to the Secretary of War yester- 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 263 

day, without remark, other than the simple reference. The plan 
will not be adopted, in all probability, for the Secretary will con- 
sult the Commissary and Quartermaster- General, and they will 
oppose any interference with the business of their departments. 
Red tape will win the day, even if our cause be lost. Our soldiers 
must be fed and clothed according to the "rules and regulations," 
or suffer and perish for the want of food and clothing ! 

I have some curiosity to learn what the President has indorsed, 
or may indorse, on the paper sent him by Mr. Lyons, signed by 
half the members of Congress. Will he simply refer it to the 
Secretary ? Then what will the Secretary do ? My friends in 
Congress will likewise be curious to learn the result. 

FEBRUARY 23D. I saw a letter from Gen. Lee to-day, suggest- 
ing to the government on appeal to the Governors of the States 
to aid more directly in recruiting the armies. He says the people 
habitually expect too much from the troops now in the field ; that 
because we have gained many victories, it does not follow that we 
shall always gain them ; that the legitimate fruits of victory have 
hitherto been lost, for the want of numbers on our side ; and, 
finally, that all those who fail to go to the field at such a moment- 
ous period as this, are guilty of the blood of the brave soldiers 
who perish in the effort to achieve independence. 

This would be contrary to the "rules and regulations" as un- 
derstood by the Adjutant and Inspector- General (a Northern man), 
and no doubt the Secretary of War and the President will reject 
the plan. 

The petition of forty members of Congress in my behalf came 
from Mr. Seddon, the Secretary, to our bureau to-day. He asks 
the superintendent if there is a necessity for such an officer, one 
whose rank is equal to that of a commandant of a camp of in- 
struction. He says important services only should require the 
appointment of such an officer. Well, Gen. Rains recommended 
it. I know not whether he can say more. I shall not get it, for 
Congress has but little influence, just now. 

FEBRUARY 24TH. Gen. Longstreet is now in command of Gen. 
Smith's late department, besides his own corps. Richmond is 
safe. 

Our papers contain a most astonishing speech purporting to 
have been delivered by Mr. Coriway, in the United States Congress. 



264 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

Mr. C. is from Kansas, that hot-bed of Abolitionism. He is an 
avowed Abolitionist ; and yet he advocates an immediate suspen- 
sion of hostilities, or at least that the Federal armies and fleets be 
ordered to act on the defensive ; that the independence of the 
Confederate States be recognized, upon the basis of a similar 
tariff; free-trade between the North and South; free navigation 
of the Mississippi, and co-operation in the maintenance of the 
Monroe doctrine. I like the indications apparent in this speech. 
Let us have a suspension of hostilities, and then we can have 
leisure to think of the rest. No doubt the peace party is growing 
rapidly in the United States ; and it may be possible that the Re- 
publicans mean to beat the Democrats in the race, by going be- 
yond them on the Southern question. The Democrats are for 
peace and Union ; the Republicans may resolve to advocate not 
only peace, but secession. 

FEBRUARY 25TH. On the 18th inst. the enemy's battery on the 
opposite side of the Mississippi River opened on Yicksburg. The 
damage was not great ; but the front of the town is considered 
untenable. 

The Conscription bill has passed the United States Senate, 
which will empower the President to call for 3,000,000 men. 
"Will they come, when he does call for them?" That is to be 
seen. It may be aimed at France ; and a war with the Emperor 
might rouse the Northern people again. Some of them, however, 
have had enough of war. 

To-day I heard of my paper addressed to the President on the 
subject of an appeal to the people to send food to the army. He 
referred it to the Commissary-General, Col. Northrop, who sent it to 
the War Department, with an indorsement that as he had no ac- 
quaintance with that means of maintaining an army (the patriotic 
contributions of the people), he could not recommend the adoption 
of the plan. Red tape is mightier than patriotism still. There 
may be a change, however, for Gen. Lee approves the plan. 

FEBRUARY 26TH. We have good news from Vicksburg to-day. 
The Queen of the West, lately captured by us, and another gun- 
boat, attacked the Indianola, the iron-clad Federal gun-boat which 
got past our batteries the other day, and, after an engagement, 
sunk her. We captured all the officers and men. 

FEBRUARY 27TH. No news from any quarter to-day. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 265 

Gen. Joseph B. Johnston is discontented with his command in 
the West. The armies are too far asunder for co-operative action ; 
and, when separated, too weak for decisive operations. There is 
no field there for him, and he desires to be relieved, and assigned 
to some other command. 

I was surprised to receive, to.-day, the following very official 
letter from the Secretary of War : 

"RICHMOND, VA., Feb. 27th, 1863. 

" J. B. JONES, ESQ. 

" SIR : The President has referred your letter of the 19th inst. 
to this department. 

"In reply, you are respectfully informed that it is not deemed 
judicious, unless in the last extremity, to resort to the means of 
supply suggested. The patriotic motives that dictated the sug- 
gestion are, however, appreciated and acknowledged. 
" Your obedient servant, 

" JAMES A. SEDDON, 

" Secretary of War." 



CHAPTER XXIV. 

Removed into Clay Street. Gen. Toombs resigned. Lincoln dictator. 
He can call 3,000,000 of men. President is siok. His office is not a bed 
of roses. Col. Gorgas sends in his oath of allegiance. Confederate gold 
$5 for $1. Explosion of a laboratory. Bad weather everywhere. 
Fighting on the Mississippi River. Conflict of views in the Conscription 
Bureau. Confederate States currency $10 for $1. Snow a foot deep, 
but melting. We have no negro regiments in our service. Only 6000 
conscripts from East Tennessee. How seven were paroled by one. This 
is to be the crisis campaign. Lee announces the campaign open. 

MARCH IST. To-morrow we remove to new quarters. The 
lady's husband, owning cottage, and who was confined for seveu 
months among lunatics, has returned, and there is not room for 
two families. Besides, Mrs. Gr. thinks she can do better taking 
boarders, than by letting the house. What a mistake ! Beef sold 
yesterday for $1.25 per pound ; turkeys, $15. Corn-meal $6 per 

23 



266 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

bushel, and all other articles at the same rates. No salaries can 
board families now ; and soon the expense of boarding will exceed 
the incomes of unmarried men. Owners and tenants, unless en- 
gaged in lucrative business, must soon vacate their houses and 
leave the city. 

But we have found a house occupied by three widows in Clay 
Street. They have no children. They mean to board soon among 
their relatives or friends, and then we get the house ; in the mean 
time, they have fitted up two rooms for us. We should have gone 
yesterday, but the weather was too bad. The terms will not exceed 
the rent we are now paying, and the house is larger. I espied 
several fruit trees in the back yard, and a space beyond, large 
enough for a smart vegetable garden. How delighted I shall be 
to cultivate it myself ! Always I have visions of peas, beans, 
radishes, potatoes, corn, and tomatoes of my own raising ! God 
bless the widows sent for our relief in this dire necessity ! 

Met Judge Reagan yesterday, just from the Council Board. I 
thought he seemed dejected. He said if the enemy succeeded in 
getting command of the Mississippi River, the Confederacy would 
be "cut in two;" and he intimated his preference of giving up 
Richmond, if it would save Texas, otc. for the Confederacy.. Texas 
is his adopted State. 

MARCH 2D. The enemy burnt the steamship Nashville on Sat- 
urday near Savannah. She was employed taking provisions to 
Fort McAlister. I think it was destroyed by an incendiary shell. 

There is a rumor to-day of the burning of railroad bridges be- 
tween this and Fredericksburg. 

I signed an agreement to-day with Mr. Malsby to publish my 
new "Wild Western Scenes." He is to print 10,000 copies, which 
are to retail at $2 ; on this he pays me 12 per cent, or 25 cents 
for every copy sold ; $2500 if the whole are sold. He will not be 
able to get it out before May. 

We moved into the west end of Clay Street to-day, and like the 
change. There are no children here except our own. The house 
is a brick one, and more comfortable than the frame shell we 
abandoned. 

MARCH 3D. We like our new quarters and the three Samari- 
tan widows, without children. They lend us many articles indis- 
pensable for our comfort. It is probable they will leave us soon 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 2 fit 

in the sole occupancy of the house. There is ground enough for 
a good many vegetables and meat is likely to be scarce enough. 
Bacon is now $1.37^ cts. per pound, and flour $30 per barrel. 
The shadow of the gaunt form of famine is upon us ! But the 
pestilence of small-pox is abating. 

We have now fine March weather; but the floods of late have 
damaged the railroad bridges between this and Fredericksburg. 
The Secretary of War requested the editors, yesterday, to say 
nothing of this. We have no news from the West or from the 
Southeast but we shall soon have enough. 

The United States Congress has passed the Conscription Act. 
We shall see the effect of it in the North ; I predict civil war 
there; and that will be our "aid and comfort." 

Gen. Toombs has resigned ; and it is said Pryor has been made 
a major-general. Thus we go up and down. The President has 
issued a proclamation for prayer, fasting, etc., on the twenty- 
seventh of this month. There will certainly be fasting and prayer 
also. And God has helped us, or we should have been destroyed 
ere this. 

MARCH 4TH. The enemy bombarded Fort McAlister again 
yesterday, several gun-boats opening fire on it. It lasted all 
day; during which one of the iron-clads retired, perhaps injured. 
We had only two men wounded and one gun (8 in. columbiad) 
dismounted. The fort was but little injured. 

Recent Northern papers assert that their gun-boats have all 
passed through the canal opposite Vicksburg. This is not true 
yet. 

Lincoln is now Dictator, his Congress having given him power 
to call out all the male population between the ages of twenty and 
thirty-five years, and authority to declare martial law whenever he 
pleases. The Herald shouts for Lincoln of course. We must 
fight and pray, and hope for revolution and civil war in the North, 
which may occur any day. 

Our cavalry, under Gen. Jones, has done some brilliant skirmish- 
ing recently in the vicinity of Winchester; and as soon as the 
March winds dry the earth a little, I suppose Hooker will recom- 
mence the "On to Richmond." We shall be weaker the next cam- 
paign, but our men are brave. 

MARCH STH. Yesterday the government seized the flour in the 



268 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

mills and warehouses; and now the price has risen from $30 to 
$40 per barrel. I wrote to the Commissary, in view of the dis- 
satisfaction of the people, and to prevent disturbances, advising 
him to seize the 5000 barrels in the hands of the small specula- 
tors, and to allow so many pounds per month to each inhabitant, 
at the rate paid by government. This would be beneficent and 
popular, confining the grumblers to the extortioners. But he will 
not do it, as the Constitution only provides for impressments for 
the public use. 

Our dinner to-day (for seven, for the servant has an equal share) 
consisted of twelve eggs, $1.25; a little corn bread, some rice and 
potatoes. How long shall we have even this variety and amount ? 
Bad beef in market, this morning, sold at $1.25 per pound. 

After bo'mbarding Fort McAlister on the 3d inst. and all night, 
the enemy's fire ceased. The fort was not much injured, says the 
dispatch. There is a rumor to-day that the fort has been re- 
duced but no one believes it. 

Gen. Van Doru has had a fight in Tennessee, killing and wound- 
ing 1000 and capturing 2600 prisoners. Our loss is said to have 
been heavy. 

Gen. Lee writes that now, since Lincoln may call out 3,000,000 
men, and has $900,000,000 voted him, we must put out all our 
strength, if we expect to keep the field. We shall certainly have 
an exciting time. But there may be use for some of the Federal 
troops in the North ! If not, I apprehend that Richmond must 
withstand another siege and assault. It is said they have dropped 
the "Constitution and the Union" in the United States, and raised 
the cry of the "NATION" and the "FLAG." This alarms me. If 
they get up a new sensation, they will raise new armies. 

Gold is selling at a premium of $4.25 in Confederate notes. 

We bought a barrel of flour to-day (that is, my wife paid for 
one not yet delivered), from a dealer who was not an extortioner, 
for the moderate sum of $28.00. This, with what we have on hand, 
ought to suffice until the growing wheat matures. 

For tea we had meal coffee, and corn cakes without butter. But 
we had a half -pint of molasses (for seven) which cost 75 cts. The 
gaunt specter is approaching nearer every day ! 

Every morning there is a large crowd of Irish and Germans be- 
sieging Gen. Winder's office for passports to go North. Is it 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 2G9 

famine they dread, or a desire to keep out of the war? Will they 
not be conscripted in the North ? They say they can get consular 
protection there. 

MARCH GTH. I have meditated on this day, as the anni- 
versary of my birth, and the shortening lapse of time between me 
and eternity. I am now fifty -three years of age. Hitherto I have 
dismissed from my mind, if not with actual indifference, yet with 
far more unconcern than at present, the recurring birthdays which 
plunged me farther in the vale of years. But oow I cannot con- 
ceal from myself, if so disposed, that I am getting to be an old 
man. My hair is gray but nevertheless my form is still erect, 
and my step is brisk enough. My fancies, tastes, and enjoyments 
have not changed perceptibly; and I can and often do write with- 
out glasses. I desire to live after this war is over, if it be the will 
of God if not, I hope to exist in a better world. 

We have no news of interest to-day. A letter says the non- 
combatants, even the women and children, heedless of danger, 
were voluntary spectators of the bombardment of Vicksburg the 
other day. The shells often exploded near them, and behind them, 
but the fascination was so great that they remained on the ground ; 
even one had an arm carried away by a ball ! Can such a people 
be subjugated? 

Houses (furnished) are beginning to be offered more plentifully 
than ever before ; their occupants and owners finding their ordi- 
nary incomes insufficient for subsistence. I suppose they mean to 
find in the country an escape from famine prices prevailing in the 
city. 

There is a rumor this evening of the fall of Vicksburg ; but that 
rumor has been whispered here several times during the last few 
months. No one believes it. When Vicksburg falls, many an in- 
vader will perish in its ruins. 

MARCH TTH. The President is sick, and has not been in the 
Executive Office for three days. Gen. Toombs, resigned, has pub- 
lished a farewell address to his brigade. He does not specify of 
what his grievance consists ; but he says he cannot longer hold his 
commission with honor. The President must be aware of his 
perilous condition. When in adversity, some of those he has 
trusted, discuss the bases of reconstruction ; and when we are 
.prosperous, others, in similar positions, agitate the question of re- 

23* 



270 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

organization the motive of both being his ruin. But I suppose 
he has calculated these contingencies, and never anticipated paving 
a bed of roses to recline upon during the terrible, and sometimes 
doubtful struggle for independence. 

The rumor that Yicksburg had fallen is not confirmed ; on the 
contrary, the story that the Indianola, captured from the enemy, 
and reported to have been blown up, was unfounded. We have 
Gen. Pemberton's official assurance of this. 

Col. Gorgas, Chief of Ordnance, a Pennsylvanian, sent into the 
department to-day, with a request that it be filed, his oath of alle- 
giance to this government, and renunciation of that of the United 
States, and of his native State. This would indicate that the 
location of his nativity has been the subject of remark. What 
significance is to be attributed to this step at this late day, I 
know not, and care not. An error was committed in placing 
Northern men in high positions to the exclusion of Southern men, 
quite as capable of filling them. 

MARCH STH. Judge Meredith's opinion, that foreigners, 
Marylanders, and others, who have served in the army, have be- 
come domiciled, and are liable to conscription, has produced a 
prodigious commotion. Gen. Winder's door is beset with, crowds 
of eager seekers of passports to leave the Confederacy ; and as 
these people are converting their Confederate money into gold, the 
premium on specie has advanced. 

Judge Campbell, Assistant Secretary of War, has decided that 
Judge Meredith's opinion is not authority ; and hence his son-in- 
law, Lieut. -Col. Lay, who at present wields the Conscription 
Bureau, acts accordingly. But Gen. Rains has a contrary 
opinion ; and he intended to see the President yesterday, who is 
understood to coincide with Judge Meredith. It is also alleged 
that Secretary Seddon concurs in this opinion ; and if this be the 
case, an explosion is imminent for Judge Campbell must have 
given instructions "by order of the Secretary," without the Secre- 
tary's knowledge or consent. 

I advised the general to see the President and Secretary once a 
week, and not rely upon verbal instructions received through a 
subordinate; he said the advice was good, and he should follow it. 
But he is much absorbed in his subterrene batteries. 

MARCH 9rn. We have no news to-day. But the next act of 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 271 

this terrible drama is near at hand. The Northern papers have 
reports of the fall of Vicksburg and Charleston. Unfounded. 
They also say 22,000 men have deserted from the Army of the 
Potomac. This is probably true. 

There is much denunciation of the recent seizure of flour ; but 
this is counteracted by an appalling intimation in one of the papers 
that unless the army be subsisted, it will be withdrawn from the 
State, and Yirginia must fall into the hands of the enemy. The 
loss of Virginia might be the loss of the Confederacy. 

MARCH 10iH. No war news of importance. 

Just at this time there is a large number of persons passing to 
and from the North. They are ostensibly blockade-runners, and 
they do succeed in bringing from the enemy's country a large 
amount of goods, on which an enormous profit is realized. The 
Assistant Secretary of War, his son-in-law, Lt.-Col. Lay, the 
controlling man in the Bureau of Conscription, and, indeed, many 
heads of bureaus, have received commodities from Maryland, 
from friends running the blockade. Gen. Winder himself, and his 
Provost Marshal Griswold (how much that looks like a Yankee 
name !), and their police detectives, have reaped benefit from the 
same source. But this intercourse with the enemy is fraught with 
other matters. Communications are made by the disloyal to the 
enemy, and our condition bad enough, heaven knows ! is made 
known, and hence the renewed efforts to subjugate us. This 
illicit intercourse, inaugurated under the auspices of Mr. Benja- 
min, and continued by subsequent Ministers of War, may be our 
ruin, if we are destined to destruction. Already it has unques- 
tionably cost us thousands of lives and millions of dollars. I feel 
it a duty to make this record. 

To-day we have a violent snow-storm a providential armis- 
tice. 

It has been ascertained that Hooker's army is still near the 
Rappahannock, only some 20,000 or 30,000 having been sent to the 
Peninsula and to Suffolk. No doubt he will advance as soon as 
the roads become practicable. If Hooker has 150,000 men, and 
advances soon, Gen. Lee cannot oppose his march ; and in all 
probability we shall again hear the din of war, from this city, in 
April and May. The fortifications are strong, however, and 25,000 
men may defend the city against 100,000 provided we have sub- 



272 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

sistence. The 'great fear is famine. But hungry men will fight 
desperately. Let the besiegers beware of them ! 

We hope to have nearly 400,000 men in the field in May, and I 
doubt whether the enemy will have over 500,000 veterans at the 
end of that month. Their new men will not be in fighting condi- 
tion before July. We may cross the Potomac again. 

MARCH HTH. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee has made a dash into Fair- 
fax (near Washington) a day or two ago, and captured the Federal 
Gen. Slaughter and other officers, in their beds. 

Last night one of the government warehouses in this city was 
burnt. It is supposed to have been the work of an incendiary 
traitor ; perhaps in retaliation for the recent impressment of flour. 
Yesterday the lower house of Congress passed a resolution re- 
stricting impressments. This has a bad aspect. 

The Bureau of Conscription, to-day, under the direction of 
Col. Lay, decided that all clerks in the departments, appointed 
subsequent to the eleventh of October last, are liable to be en- 
rolled for service. Yet the colonel himself has a clerk appointed 
in January last. 

Gold sells at $5 in Confederate States notes for one ; U. S. 
Treasury notes are at a premium here of $2.50. Even the notes 
of our State banks are at 60 per cent, premium over Confederate 
notes. This is bad for Mr. Memminger. An abler financier would 
have worked out a different result. 

All the patriotism is in the army; out of it the demon avarice 
rages supreme. Every one seems mad with speculation ; and the 
extortioners prey upon every victim that falls within their power. 
Nearly all who sell are extortioners. We have at the same time, 
and in the same community, spectacles of the most exalted virtue 
and of the most degrading vice. 

Col. Mattel, the former commandant of conscripts for North 
Carolina, who was wounded at Kinston, and yet was superseded 
by Col. Lay's friend, Col. August, is now to be restored, and Col. 
A. relieved. Upon this Col. L. has fallen sick. 

Mr. Duffield, whom Col. Lay and Mr. Jacques had appointed 
A. A. G. over me, has not yet, for Some cause, got his commis- 
sion. The Secretary or some one else may have "intervened." 

MARCH 12TH. To-day we have no army news. 

Mr. Richard Smith issued the first number of The Sentinel 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 273 

yesterday morning. Thus we have five daily morning papers, all 
on half sheets. The Sentinel has a biography of the President, 
and may aspire to be the "organ." 

John Mitchel, the Irishman, who was sentenced to a penal 
colony for disturbances in Ireland, some years ago, is now the 
leading editor of the Enquirer. He came hither from the North 
recently. His "compatriot," Meagher, once lived in the South 
and advocated our "institutions." He now commands a Federal 
brigade. What Mitchel will do finally, who knows ? My friend 
R. Tyler, probably, had something to do with bringing him here. 
As a politician, however, he must know there is no Irish element 
in the Confederate States. I am sorry this Irish editor has been 
imported? 

The resignation of Gen. Toombs is making some sensation iu 
certain circles. He was among the foremost leaders of the rebel- 
lion. He was Secretary of State, and voluntarily resigned to 
enter the army. I know not precisely what his grievance is, un- 
less it be the failure of the President to promote him to a higher 
position, which he may have deemed himself entitled to, from his 
genius, antecedents, wealth, etc. But it is probable he will cause 
some disturbance. Duff Green, who is everywhere in stormy 
times, told me to-day that Gen. Toombs would be elected Gover- 
nor of Georgia this fall, and said there were intimations that Geor- 
gia might make peace with the United States ! This would be 
death to the government and destruction to Toombs. It must 
be a mistake. He cannot have any such design. If he had, it 
would be defeated by the people of Georgia, though they sighed 
for peace. Peace is what all most desire but not without inde- 
pendence. Some there are, in all the States, who would go back 
into the Union, for the sake of repose and security. But a ma- 
jority would not have peace on such terms. 

Still, it behooves the President to be on his guard. He has 
enemies in the South, who hate him much. 

MARCH 13TH. To-day a great calamity occurred in this city. 
In a large room of one of the government laboratories an explo- 
sion took place, killing instantly five or six persons, and wound- 
ing, it is feared fatally, some thirty others. Most of them were 
little indigent girls I 

MARCH HTH. Gen. Pemberton writes that he has 3000 hogs- 



274 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

heads of sugar at Yicksburg, which he retains for his soldiers to 
subsist on when the meat fails. Meat is scarce there as well as 
here. Bacon now sells for $1.50 per pound in Richmond. But- 
ter $3. I design to cultivate a little garden 20 by 50 feet; but 
fear I cannot get seeds. I have sought in vain for peas, beans, 
corn, and tomatoes seeds. Potatoes are $12 per bushel. Ordi- 
nary chickens are worth $3 a piece. My youngest daughter put 
her earrings on sale to-day price $25 ; and I think they will 
bring it, for which she can purchase a pair of shoes. The area of 
subsistence is contracting around us; but my children are more 
enthusiastic for independence than ever. Daily I hear them say 
they would gladly embrace death rather than the rule of the Yan- 
kee. If all our people were of the same mind, our final success 
would be certain. 

This day the leading article in the Examiner had a striking, 
if not an ominous conclusion. Inveighing against the despotism 
of the North, the editor takes occasion likewise to denounce the 
measure of impressment here. He says if our Congress should 
follow the example of the Northern Congress, and invest our 
President with dictatorial powers, a reconstruction of the Union 
might be a practicable thing ; for our people would choose to be- 
long to a strong despotism rather than a weak one the strong 
one being of course the United States with 20,000,000, rather 
than the Confederate States with 8,000,000. There may be some- 
thing in this, but we shall be injured by it ; for the crowd going 
North will take it thither, where it will be reproduced, and stim- 
ulate the invader to renewed exertions. It is a dark hour. But 
God disposes. If we deserve it, we shall triumph; if not, why 
should we ? 

But we cannot fail without more great battles; and who knows 
what results may be evolved by them ? Gen. Lee is hopeful; and 
so long as we keep the field, and he commands, the foe must bleed 
for every acre of soil they gain. 

MARCH 15TH. Another cold, disagreeable day. March so far 
has been as cold and terrible as a winter month. 

MARCH 16xu. Gen. Hill is moving toward Newbern, N. C., 
and may attack the enemy there. 

The weather continues dreadful sleeting; and movements of 
armies must perforce be stayed. But the season of slaughter is 
approaching. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 275 

/ 

There was an ominous scantiness of supply in the market this 
morning, and the prices beyond most persons mine among the 
rest. 

Col. Lay got turkeys to-day from Raleigh ; on Saturday par- 
tridges, by the Express Company. Fortunate man ! 

MARCH HTH. On Saturday, the enemy's lower Mississippi 
fleet attacked our batteries at Port Hudson. The result reported 
is that only one of their gun-boats got past, and that in a damaged 
condition. The frigate Mississippi, one of the best war steamers 
of the United States, was burned, and the rest retired down the 
river, badly repulsed. We sustained no loss. 

To-day, the Secretary of War sent in a paper indorsing Judge 
Meredith's opinion in regard to foreigners who have accepted 
service in our country, viz., that they are liable to conscription. 
This is in the teeth of the decision of the Assistant Secretary, 
Judge Campbell, Col. Lay's father-in-law, and upon which the 
bureau has been acting, although Gen. Rains, the Superintendent, 
permitted it with reluctance, upon the assurance of Col. L. that 
such was the will of the department. This business may produce 
an explosion. 

I walked with Gen. Rains this afternoon in Capitol Square. 
He is annoyed at the action of Col. Lay in following the instruc- 
tions of the Assistant Secretary of War in regard to foreigners. 
The decision had not the sanction of the Secretary of War, Mr. 
Seddon. He thinks several thousand men may have been per- 
mitted to escape military service by it. He intended to lay Judge 
Campbell's decision before the President, but it disappeared very 
mysteriously from his desk. And to-day it reappeard just as 
mysteriously. And, simultaneously, and quite as mysteriously, a 
paper appeared, signed by Mr. Seddon, Secretary of War, sug- 
gesting that the bureau act in conformity with Judge Meredith's 
opinion, directly in the teeth of Mr. Assistant Secretary Camp- 
bell's decision 1 And it was dated March 13th, full four days 
before. What delayed it, and who brought it, no one seemed to 
know. Col. Lay suggested that it be sent back, with an indorse- 
ment that the bureau had been already acting under the decision 
of Judge Campbell (just the reverse of the opinion), Assistant 
Secretary of War, "by order of the Secretary of War." 

To this Gen. R. demurred, and said the bureau would conform 



276 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

its action to Mr. Seddon's suggestions ; and he charged a clerk 
to preserve that paper. Col. L. grumbled awfully at Mr. Sed- 
dou's off-hand decision, without mature reflection. 

Gen. Stewart (of Maryland) was at the office a short time before, 
and advocated Mr. Seddon's views ; for he knew how many Mary- 
landers would be embraced in the decision, as well as other 
foreigners. 

Lieut.-Col. A. C. Jones, Assistant Adjutant- General, had, in 
the name of the bureau, notified Gen. Winder, this morning, that 
Marylanders, etc. were not liable to bear arms for the South 
after being in the service two years 1 

The general says he will have all the commandants of conscripts 
written to immediately; and that he will have an interview with 
the Secretary of War in relation to the matter. 

Every man we can put in the field is demanded; and many fear 
we shall not have a sufficient number to oppose the overwhelming 
tide soon to be surging over the land. At such a crisis, and in 
consideration of all the circumstances attending this matter, in- 
volving the loss of so many men, one is naturally startled at Judge 
Campbell's conduct. 

MARCH ISiii. I sent an extract from my Diary of yesterday to 
the Hon. T. H. Watts, Minister of Justice. I know not whether 
he will appreciate its importance ; but he has professed friendship 
for me. 

The city is in some excitement to-day, for early this morning we 
had intelligence of the crossing of the Rappahannock by a portion 
of the Federal army. During the day the division of Hood de- 
filed through the streets, at a quick pace, marching back to Lee's 
army. But the march of troops and the rumbling of artillery 
have ceased to be novel spectacles to our community. Some 
aged ladies ran out as they passed, calling the bronzed Texans 
their " children," and distributed loaves of bread and other food 
among them. I never saw a merrier set than these brave soldiers, 
who have been through the "fire and the flood" numberless times. 
Some of them had three or four loaves on their bayonets. 

Gen. Lee himself left early this morning, on an extra train, 
having been "caught napping" here, the first time. The enemy 
crossed the river yesterday. 

But during the day a dispatch was received from Gen. J. E. B. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 277 

Stuart (cavalry), stating that he had attacked the enemy on this 
side of the river, and beaten him back, forcing him to recross 
with loss. The particulars of the fight were not stated ; but it is 
believed we lost a brigadier-general, killed. 

MARCH 19TH. Snowing. It is estimated that we lost 250 
men, killed, wounded, and taken, in the fight on the Rappahan- 
nock ; the enemy's loss is not known, but certainly was heavy, 
since they were defeated, and fled back,* hotly pursued. 

Confederate money still depreciates, in spite of the funding act. 
Some of the brokers are demanding ten dollars Confederate notes 
for one in gold ! That is bad, and it may be worse. 

The enemy are advancing from Corinth, and there are not suf- 
ficient troops to resist them. Gen. Johnston says if men are 
taken from Bragg, his army may be destroyed ; and none can be 
ordered from Mobile, where there are only 2500 for land defense. 

MARCH 20TH. The snow is eight inches deep this morning, 
and it is still falling fast. 

Not a beggar is yet to be seen in this city of 100,000 in- 
habitants ! 

Hood's division, mostly Texans, whose march to the Rappa- 
hannock was countermanded when it was ascertained that the 
enemy had been beaten back across the river, were all the morning 
defiling through Main Street, in high spirits, and merrily snow- 
balling each other. And these men slept last night out in the 
snow without tents ! Can such soldiers be vanquished ? 

Yesterday Floyd's division of State troops were turned over to 
the Confederacy only about 200! 

We have no further particulars of the fight on the Rappahan- 
nock ; we know, however, that the enemy were beaten, and that 
this snow-storm must prevent further operations for many days. 
Several Eastern Shore families, I learn, are about to return to 
their homes. This is no place for women and children, who have 
homes elsewhere. We are all on quarter-rations of meat, and but 
few can afford to buy clothing at the present prices. 

MARCH 21 ST. The snow is nearly a foot deep this morning, as 
it continued to fall all night, and is falling still. It grows warmer, 
however. 

But we now learn that the Indianola was destroyed in the Mis- 
sissippi by the officers, upon the appearance of a simulated gun- 

24 



278 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

boat sent down, without a crew ! This was disgraceful, and some 
one should answer for it. 

Col. Godwin writes from King and Queen County, that many 
of the people there are deserting to the enemy, leaving their 
stock, provisions, grain, etc., and he asks permission to seize their 
abandoned property for the use of the government. Mr. Secretary 
Seddon demands more specific information before that step be 
taken. He intimates that they may have withdrawn to avoid 
conscription. 

MARCH 22D. It was thawing all night, and there is a heavy fog 
this morning. The snow will disappear in a few days. 

A very large number of slaves, said to be nearly 40,000, have 
been collected by the enemy on the Peninsula and at adjacent 
points, for the purpose, it is supposed, of co-operating with 
Hooker's army in the next attempt to capture Richmond. 

The snow has laid an embargo on the usual slight supplies 
brought to market, and all who had made no provision for such a 
contingency are subsisting on very short-commons. Corn- meal is 
selling at from $6 to $8 per bushel. Chickens $5 each. Turkeys 
$20. Turnip greens $8 per bushel. Bad bacon $1.50 per pound. 
Bread 20 cts. per loaf. Flour $38 per barrel, and other things in 
proportion. There are some pale faces seen in the streets from de- 
ficiency of food ; but no beggars, no complaints. We are all in 
rags, especially our underclothes. This for liberty ! 

The Northern journals say we have negro regiments on the 
Rappahannock and in the West. This is utterly untrue. We 
have no armed slaves to fight for us, nor do we fear a servile in- 
surrection. We are at no loss, however, to interpret the meaning 
of such demoniac misrepresentations. It is to be seen of what 
value the negro regiments employed against us will be to the in- 
vader. 

MARCH 23D. The snow has nearly disappeared, and the roads 
are very bad. No food is brought to the market, and such as 
may be found in the city is held at famine prices. 

I saw a letter to-day from Bishop Lay, in Arkansas. He says 
affairs in that State wear a dark and gloomy aspect. He thinks 
the State is lost. 

Gen. Beauregard writes the Hon. Mr. Miles that he has not men 
enough, nor heavy guns enough, for the defense of Charleston. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 279 

If this were generally known, thousands would despair, being con- 
vinced that those charged with the reins of power are incompe- 
tent, unequal to the crisis, and destined to conduct them to destruc- 
tion rather than independence. 

MARCH 24TH. Judge Lyons has granted an injunction, arrest- 
ing the impressment of flour by the Secretary of War, and 
Congress is debating a bill which, if passed, will be a marked 
rebuke to the government. 

Notwithstanding the wishes of the Secretary of War, the Pres- 
ident, and Gen. Rains, Lt-Col. Lay is still exempting Maryland- 
ers, and even foreigners who have bought real estate, and resided 
for years in this country, if they have " not taken the oath of 
domicile." 

In Eastern Tennessee, 25,500 conscripts were enrolled, and yet 
only 6000 were added to the army. The rest were exempted, 
detailed, or deserted. Such is the working of the Conscription 
Act, fettered as it is by the Exemption Law, and still executed 
under Judge Campbell's decision. Gen. Rains has the title, but 
does not execute the functions of Superintendent of the Bureau 
of Conscription. The President has been informed of every- 
thing. 

MARCH 25TH. We have no news to-day, excepting the falling 
back of Rosecrans from Murfreesborough, and a raid of Morgan 
and capture of a train of cars. Rosecrans means, perhaps, to aid 
in the occupation of the Mississippi River. It will be expensive 
in human life. 

Although our conscription is odious, yet we are collecting a 
thousand per week. The enemy say they will crush the rebellion 
in ninety days. In sixty days half their men will return to their 
homes, and then we may take Washington. God knows, but man 
does not, what will happen. 

MARCH 26TH. We have dispatches (unofficial) from the West, 
stating that one of the enemy's gun-boats has been sunk in attempt- 
ing to pass Vicksburg, and another badly injured. Also that an 
engagement has occurred on the Yazoo, the enemy having several 
gun-boats sunk, the rest being driven back. 

It snowed a little this morning, and is now clear and cold. 

Mr. Seddon is vexed at the unpopularity of the recent impress- 
ments by his order. It was an odious measure, because it did not 



280 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

go far enough and take all, distributing enough among the people 
to crush the extortioners. 

MARCH 27TH. This is the day appointed by the President for 
fasting and prayers. Fasting in the midst of famine 1 May God 
save this people ! The day will be observed throughout the Con- 
federacy. 

The news from the West, destruction of more of the enemy's 
gun-boats, seems authentic. So far we have sustained no disasters 
this spring, the usual season of success of fhe enemy by water. 

Mr. G. W. Randolph was the counsel of the speculators whose 
flour was impressed, and yet this man, when Secretary of War, 
ordered similar impressments repeatedly. " Oh, man ! dressed in 
a little brief authority," etc. 

Mr. Foote has brought forward a bill to prevent trading with 
the enemy. Col. Lay even gets his pipes from the enemy's coun- 
try. Let Mr. Foote smoke that! 

A gentleman said, to-day, if the Yankees only knew it, they 
might derive all the benefits they seek by the impracticable scheme 
of subjugation, without the expenditure of human life, by simply 
redoubling the blockade of our ports, withdrawing their armies to 
the borders, and facilitating trade between the sections. We would 
not attack them in their own country, and in a month millions of 
their products would be pouring into the South, and cotton, to- 
bacco, etc. would go to the North in vast quantities. I wonder 
the smart Yankee never thinks of this ! Let both sides give pass- 
ports freely, and an unlimited intercourse would be immediately 
established. 

MARCH 2^TH. We have nothing additional or confirmatory 
from the West. A letter from Gen. Beauregard states that he has 
but 17,000 men in South Carolina, and 10,000 in Georgia, 27,000 
in all. He asks more, as he will be assailed, probably, by 100,000 
Federals. The President refers this important letter to the Secre- 
tary of War, simply with the indorsement, "this is an exact state- 
ment of affairs in South Carolina and Georgia." 

Col. Lay predicts that we shall be beaten in thirty days, or else 
we shall then be in the way of beating the enemy. A safe predic- 
tion but what is his belief? This deponent saith not. There 
will be fearful odds against us, and yet our men in the field fear 
nothing. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 281 

We are sending Napoleons up to Lee. But the weather, which 
has been fine for the last two days, is wet again. If Hooker 
makes a premature advance, he will be sure to "march back again." 

An amusing letter was received from an officer in Tennessee to- 
day. He was taken prisoner by seven Federals when straying 
some distance from camp, and subsequently hearing the men ex- 
press some anxiety to be at home again with their families, gave 
them some brandy which he happened to possess. He then sug- 
gested a plan by which they might return to their homes, viz., to 
become his prisoners, and being paroled by him. After consulta- 
tion, they agreed to it, and released him. He then pafoled them, 
giving them the usual certificates to exhibit to their officer, and 
so, taking another drink, they pursued their different ways. If 
this disposition prevails extensively among the Western Federals, 
we may look for speedy results in that quarter. Rosecrans may 
lose his laurels in a most unexpected manner. 

MARCH 29rn. No news. Yet a universal expectation. What 
is expected is not clearly defined. Those who are making money 
rapidly no doubt desire a prolongation of the war, irrespective of 
political consequences. But the people, the majority in the United 
States, seem to have lost their power. And their representatives 
in Congress are completely subordinated by the Executive, and 
rendered subservient to his will. President Lincoln can have any 
measure adopted or any measure defeated, at pleasure. Such is 
the irresistible power of enormous executive patronage. He may 
extend the sessions or terminate them, and so, all power, for the 
time being, reposes in the hands of the President. 

A day of reckoning will come, for the people of the United 
States will resume the powers of which the war has temporarily 
dispossessed them, or else there will be disruptions, and civil war will 
submerge the earth in blood. The time has not arrived, or else 
the right men have not arisen, for the establishment of despotisms. 

Everything depends upon the issues of the present campaign, 
and upon them it may be bootless to speculate. No one may fore- 
tell the fortunes of war I mean where victory will ultimately perch 
in this frightful struggle. We are environed and invaded by not 
less than 600,000 men in arms, and we have not in the field more 
than 250,000 to oppose them. But we have the advantage of 
occupying the interior position, always affording superior facilities 

24* 



282 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

for concentration. Besides, our men must prevail in combat, or 
lose their property, country, freedom, everything, at least this is 
their conviction. On the other hand, the enemy, in yielding the 
contest, may retire into their own country, and possess everything 
they enjoyed before the war began. Hence it may be confidently 
believed that in all the battles of this spring, when the numbers 
are nearly equal, the Confederates will be the victors, and even 
when the enemy have superior numbers, the armies of the South 
will fight with Roman desperation. The conflict will be appalling 
and sanguinary beyond example, provided the invader stand up to 
it. That puch is certain. And if our armies are overthrown, we 
may be no nearer peace than before. ' The paper money would be 
valueless, and the large fortunes accumulated by the speculators, 
turning to dust and ashes on their lips, might engender a new ex- 
asperation, resulting in a regenerated patriotism and a universal 
determination to achieve independence or die in the attempt. 

MARCH 30iH. Gen. Bragg dispatches the government that 
Gen. Forrest has captured 800 prisoners in Tennessee, and sev- 
eral thousand of our men are making a successful raid in Ken- 
tucky. 

Gen. Whiting makes urgent calls for reinforcements at Wilming- 
ton, and cannot be supplied with many. 

Gen. Lee announces to the War Department that the spring 
campaign is now open, and his army may be in motion any day. 

Col. Godwin (of King and Queen County) is here trying to 
prevail on the Secretary of War to put a stop to the blockade- 
runners, Jews, and spies, daily passing through his lines with 
passports from Gens. Elzey and Winder. He says the persons 
engaged in this illicit traffic are all extortioners and spies, and 
$50,000 worth of goods from the enemy's country pass daily. 

Col. Lay still repudiates Judge Meredith's decision in his in- 
structions to the Commandants of Camps of Instruction. Well, 
if we have a superabundance of fighting men in the field, the 
foreign-born denizens and Marylanders can remain at home and 
make money while the country that protects them is harried by 
the invader. 

The gaunt form of wretched famine still approaches with rapid 
strides. Meal is now selling at $12 per buShel, and potatoes at 
$16. Meats have almost disappeared from the market, and none 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 283 

but the opulent can afford to pay $3.50 per pound for butter. 
Greens, however, of various kinds, are coming in ; and as the 
season advances, we may expect a diminution of prices. It is 
strange that on the 30th of March, even in the "sunny South," 
the fruit-trees are as bare of blossoms and foliage as at mid-win- 
ter. We shall have fire until the middle of May, six months of 
winter ! 

I am spading up my little garden, and hope to raise a few vege- 
tables to eke out a miserable subsistence for my family. My 
daughter Ann reads Shakspeare to me o' nights, which saves my 
eyes. 

MARCH 31sT. Another stride of the grim specter, and corn- 
meal is selling for $11 per bushel. Coal at $20.50 per ton, and 
wood at $30 per cord. And at these prices one has to wait several 
days to get either. Common tallow candles are selling at $1 per 
pound. I see that some furnished houses are now advertised for 
rent ; and I hope that all the population that can get away, and 
subsist elsewhere, will leave the city. 

The lower house of Congress has passed a most enormous tax 
bill, which I apprehend cannot be enforced, if it becomes a law. 
It will close half the shops but that may be beneficial, as thou- 
sands have rushed into trade and become extortioners. 

I see some batteries of light artillery going toward Petersburg. 
This is to be used against the enemy when he advances in that 
direction from Suffolk. No doubt another attempt will be made 
to capture Richmond. But Lee knows the programme, I doubt 
not. 



284 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 



CHAPTER XXY. 

Symptoms of bread riots. Lee forming depots of provisions near the Rap- 
pahannock. Beauregard ready to defend Charleston. He has rebuffed 
the enemy severely. French and British advancing money on cotton. 
The Yankees can beat us in bargaining. Gen. Lee anxious for new sup- 
plies. The President appeals to the people to raise food for man and 
beast. Federal and Confederate troops serenading each other on the 
Rappahannock. Cobbler's wages $3000 per annum. Wrangling in the 
Indian country. Only 700 conscripts per month from Virginia. Long- 
street at Suffolk. The President's well eye said to be failing. A "recon- 
noissance!" We are planting much grain. Picking up pins. Beautiful 
season. Gen. Johnston in Tennessee. Longstreet's successes in that 
State. Lee complains that his army is not fed. We fear for Vicksburg 
now. Enemy giving up plunder in Mississippi. Beauregard is busy at 
Charleston. Gen. Marshall, of Kentucky, fails to get stock and hogs. 
Gen. Lee calls for Longstreet's corps. The enemy demonstrating on the 
Rappahannock. 

APRIL IST. It is said we have taken Washington, a village in 
North Carolina. And it is represented that large supplies of meat, 
etc. can be taken from thence and the adjacent counties. 

Every day we look for important intelligence from Charleston, 
and from the West. 

Mr. Seddon, the Secretary of War, has receded from his posi- 
tion in regard to resident aliens. 

APRIL 2o. This morning early a few hundred women and boys 
met as by concert in the Capitol Square, saying they were hungry, 
and must have food. The number continued to swell until there 
were more than a thousand. But few men were among them, and 
these were mostly foreign residents, with exemptions in their 
pockets. About nine A.M. the mob emerged from the western 
gates of the square, and proceeded down Ninth Street, passing 
the War Department, and crossing Main Street, increasing in mag- 
nitude at every step, but preserving silence and (so far) good 
order. Not knowing the meaning of such a procession, I asked 
a pale boy where they were going. A young woman, seemingly 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 285 

emaciated, bat yet with a smile, answered that they were going to 
find something to eat. I could not, for the life of me, refrain from 
expressing the hope that they might be successful ; and I remarked 
they were going in the right direction to find plenty in the hands 
of the extortioners. I did uot follow, to see what they did ; but 
I learned an hour after that they marched through Gary Street, 
and entered diverse stores of the speculators, which they proceeded 
to empty of their contents. They impressed all the carts and 
drays in the street, which were speedily laden with meal, flour, 
shoes, etc. I did not learn whither these were driven ; but prob- 
ably they were rescued from those in charge of them. Neverthe- 
less, an immense amount of provisions, and other articles, were 
borne by the mob, which continued to increase in numbers. An 
eye-witness says he saw a boy come out of a store with a hat full 
of money (notes); and I learned that when the mob turned up 
into Main Street, when all the shops were by this time closed, they 
broke in the plate-glass windows, demanding silks, jewelry, etc. 
Here they were incited to pillage valuables, not necessary for sub- 
sistence, by the class of residents (aliens) exempted from military 
duty by Judge Campbell, Assistant Secretary of War, in contra- 
vention of Judge Meredith's decision. Thus the work of spolia- 
tion went on, until the military appeared upon the scene, sum- 
moned by Gov. Letcher, whose term of service is near its close. 
He had the Riot Act read (by the mayor), and then threatened to 
fire on the mob. He gave them five minutes' time to disperse in, 
threatening to use military force (the city battalion being present) 
if they did not comply with the demand. The timid women fell 
back, and a pause was put to the devastation, though but few 
believed he would venture to put his threat in execution. If he 
had done so, he would have been bung, no doubt. 

About this time the President appeared, and ascending a dray, 
spoke to the people. He urged them to return to their homes, so 
that the bayonets there menacing them might be sent against the 
common enemy. He told them that such acts would bring famine 
upon them in the only form which could not be provided against, 
as it would deter people from bringing food to the city. He said 
he was willing to share his last loaf with the suffering people (his 
best horse had been stolen the night before), and he trusted we 
would all bear our privations with fortitude, and continue united 



286 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

against the Northern invaders, who were the authors of all our 
sufferings. He seemed deeply moved ; and indeed it was a fright- 
ful spectacle, and perhaps an ominous one, if the government does 
not remove some of the quartermasters who have contributed very 
much to bring about the evil of scarcity. I mean those who have 
allowed transportation to forestallers and extortioners. 

Gen. Elzey and Gen. Winder waited upon the Secretary of War 
in the morning, asking permission to call the troops from the 
camps near the city, to suppress the women and children by a 
summary process. But Mr. Seddon hesitated, and then declined 
authorizing any such absurdity. He said it was a municipal or 
State duty, and therefore he would not take the responsibility of 
interfering in the matter. Even in the moment of aspen conster- 
nation, he was still the politician. 

I have not heard of any injuries sustained by the women and 
children. Nor have I heard how many stores the mob visited ; and 
it must have been many. 

All is quiet now (three P.M.) ; and I understand the government 
is issuing rice to the people. 

APRIL 3D. Gen. D. H. Hill writes from North Carolina that 
the business of conscription is miserably mismanaged in that State. 
The whole business, it seems, has resolved itself into a machine for 
making money and putting pets in office. 

No account of yesterday's riot appeared in the papers to-dry, 
for obvious reasons. The mob visited most of the shops, and the 
pillage was pretty extensive. 

Crowds of women, Marylanders and foreigners, were standing at 
the street corners to-day, still demanding food ; which, it is said, 
the government issued to them. About midday the City Battalion 
was marched down Main Street to disperse the crowd. 

Congress has resolved to adjourn on the 20th April. The tax 
bill has not passed both Houses yet. 

Gen. Blanchard has been relieved of his command in Louisiana. 
He was another general from Massachusetts. 

APRIL 4iH. It is the belief of some that the riot was a pre- 
meditated affair, stimulated from the North, and executed through 
the instrumentality of emissaries. Some of the women, and others, 
have been arrested. 

We have news of the capture of another of the enemy's gun- 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 287 

boats, in Berwick Bay, Louisiana, with five guns. It is said to 
have been done by cavalry. 

A dispatch just received from Charleston states that the 
enemy's monitors were approaching the forts, seven in number, 
and that the attack was commencing. This is joyful news to our 
people, so confident are they that Gen. Beauregard will beat 
.them. 

APRIL STH. Snow fell all night, and a depth of several inches 
covers the earth this morning. It will soon melt, however, as it is 
now raining. The Northern invaders who anticipate a pleasant 
sojourn during the winter and spring in this climate, have been 
very disagreeably disappointed in these expectations. 

A surgeon was arrested yesterday for saying there was "a power 
behind the throne greater than the throne." Upon being asked 
by the mayor what power he alluded to, he answered "4he people." 
He was released. 

APRIL GTH. It seems that it was a mistake about the enemy's 
monitors approaching the forts in Charleston harbor; but the 
government has dispatches to the effect that important movements 
are going on, not very distant from Charleston, the precise nature 
of which is not yet permitted to transpire. 

Generals Johnston and Bragg write that Gen. Pillow has se- 
cured ten times as many conscripts, under their orders, as the 
bureau in Richmond would have done. Judge Campbell, as 
Assistant Secretary of War, having arrested Gen. P.'s operations, 
Generals J. and B. predict that our army in Tennessee will begin, 
immediately, to diminish in numbers. 

The rails of the York River Railroad are being removed to-day 
toward Danville, in view of securing a connection with the N. C. 
Central Road. It seems that the, government thinks the enemy 
will again possess the York River Railroad, but it cannot be pos- 
sible a retreat out of Virginia is meditated. 

APRIL TTH. Nothing definite has transpired at Charleston, or 
if so, we have not received information of it yet. 

From the West, we have accounts, from Northern papers, of 
the failure of the Yankee Yazoo expedition. That must have its 
effect. 

Judge Campbell, Assistant Secretary of War, has decided in 
one instance (page 125, E. B. Conscript Bureau), that a paroled 



288 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

political prisoner, returning to the South, is not subject to con- 
scription. This is in violation of an act of Congress, and general 
orders. It appears that grave judges are not all inflexibly just, 
and immaculately legal in their decisions. Col. Lay ordered the 
commandant of conscripts (Col. Shields) to give the man a pro- 
tection, without any reason therefor. 

It is now said large depots of provisions are being formed on 
the Rappahannock. This does not look like an indication of a 
retrograde movement on the part of Gen. Lee. Perhaps he will 
advance. 

This afternoon dispatches were received from Charleston. Not- 
withstanding all the rumors relative to the hostile fleet being else- 
where, it is now certain that all the monitors, iron-clads, and trans- 
ports have succeeded in passing the bar, and at the last accounts 
were in readiness to begin the attack. And Beauregard was pre- 
pared to receive it. To-morrow we shall have exciting intelligence. 
If we are to believe what we hear from South Carolinians, recently 
from Charleston (I do believe it), Charleston will not be taken. 
If the ground be taken, it will not be Charleston. If the forts 
fall, and our two rams be taken or destroyed, the defenders will 
still resist. Rifle-pits-have been dug in the streets; and if driven 
from these, there are batteries beyond to sweep the streets, thus 
involving the enemy and the city in one common ruin. 

APRIL STH. We learn to-day that the enemy bombarded our 
forts at Charleston, yesterday, two hours and a half. But few of 
our men were injured, and the forts sustained no damage of conse- 
quence. On the other hand, several of the iron-clads and monitors 
of the enemy were badly crippled; one of the latter, supposed to 
be the Keokuk, was sunk. Since then the bombardment has not 
been renewed. But no doubt the enemy will make other efforts to 
reduce a city which is the particular object of their vengeance. 
Every one is on the qui vive for further news from Charleston. 
Success there will make Beauregard the most popular man in the 
Confederacy, Lee excepted. 

Speculation is running wild in this city; and the highest civil 
and military officers are said to be engaged, directly or indirectly, 
in the disgraceful business of smuggling. Mr. Memminger can- 
not be ignorant of this ; and yet these men are allowed to retain 
their places. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 289 

APRIL 9TH. Nothing additional has occurred at Charleston, 
the enemy not having renewed the attack. At Vicksburg all was 
quiet, and the enemy abandoning their canal. Such news must 
have a depressing effect upon the North. They will see that their 
monitors and iron-clads have lost their terrors. They have lost 
some twenty war steamers within the last few months ; and how 
many of their merchantmen have been destroyed on the ocean, we 
have no means of knowing. 

British and French capitalists have taken a cotton loan of 
$15,000,000, which is now selling at a premium of four per cent. 
in those countries. Our government can, if it will, soon have a 
navy of Alabamas and Floridas. 

But we are in danger of being sold to the enemy by the block- 
ade-runners in this city. High officers, civil and military, are 
said, perhaps maliciously, to be engaged in the unlawful trade 
hitherto carried on by the Jews. It is said that the flag of truce 
boats serve as a medium of negotiations between official dignitaries 
here and those at Washington ; and I have no doubt many of the 
Federal officers at Washington, for the sake of lucre, make no 
scruple to participate in the profits of this treasonable traffic. 
They can beat us at this game : cheat us in bargaining, and excel 
us in obtaining information as to the number and position of 
troops, fortifications, etc. 

APRIL IOTH. We are not informed of a renewal of the attack 
on Charleston. It is said our shot penetrated the turret of the 
Keokuk, sunk. 

In New York they have been exulting over the capture of 
Charleston, and gold declined heavily. This report was circulated 
by some of the government officials, at Washington, for purposes 
of speculation. 

Col. Lay announced, to-day, that he had authority (oral) from 
Gen. Cooper, A. and I. G., to accept Marylanders as substitutes. 
Soon after he ordered in two, in place of Louisianian sutlers, whom 
he accompanied subsequently I know not whither. But this 
verbal authority is in the teeth of published orders. 

APRIL HTH. Gen. Beauregard telegraphs that Gen. Walker 
has destroyed another Federal gun-boat in Coosa River. They 
are looking for a renewal of the attack on Charleston, and are 
ready for it. 

25 



290 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

Gen. Lee writes that he is about sending a cavalry brigade into 
London County to bring off commissary's and quartermaster's 
stores. This will frighten the people in Washington City ! He 
also writes that, unless the railroads be repaired, so as to admit of 
speedier transportation of supplies, he cannot maintain his pres- 
ent position much longer. 

The President has published a proclamation, to-day, appealing 
to the patriotism of the people, and urging upon them to abstain 
from the growth of cotton and tobacco, and raise food for man 
and beast. Appended to this is a plan, "suggested by the Secre- 
tary of War," to obtain from the people an immediate supply of 
meat, etc. in the various counties and parishes. This is my plan, 
so politely declined by the Secretary ! Well, if it will benefit the 
government, the government is welcome to it; and Mr. Seddon 
to the credit of it. 

APRIL 12Tii. Gen. Van Dorn, it is reported, has captured or 
destroyed another gun-boat in the West. 

Night before last another riot was looked for in this city by the 
mayor, and two battalions of Gen. Elzey's troops were ordered into 
the city.- If the President could only see the necessity of placing 
this city under the command of a native Southern general, h.e might 
avoid much obloquy. The Smiths, Winders, and Elzeys, who are 
really foreigners, since the men from their States are not liable 
to conscription (vide Judge Campbell's decision), are very obnox- 
ious to the people. Virginians can never be reconciled to the 
presence of a mercenary Swiss guard, and will not submit to im- 
ported masters. 

Notwithstanding the Enquirer urges it, and Mr. Barksdale, of 
Mississippi, persistently advocates it, Congress still refuses to con- 
fer additional powers on the President. Twice, within the last 
week, Congress has voted down the proposition to clothe the 
President with power to suspend the writ of habeas corpus. 
Congress has likewise refused to reconsider the vote postponing 
the consideration of the bill to create a Court of Claims. Judge 
S was here, working for it; but was doomed to disappoint- 
ment. 

A few nights since a full Federal band came within a hundred 
yards of our men, the Bappahannock only separating them, and 
played "Dixie." Our men cheered them lustily. Then they played 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 291 

"Yankee Doodle," when the Yankees cheered. After this they 
played "Home, sweet Home!" and all parties cheered them. 
There may be something significant in this. The pickets have 
orders not to fire on each other, when no demonstratio'n is in 
progress. 

Our members of Congress get salaries of $2750. A cobbler (free 
negro), who mends shoes for my family, told me yesterday that he 
earned $10 per day, or $3000 per annum. 

A pair of pantaloons now costs $40; boots, $60 ; and so on. 

We have warm weather at last, and dry. Armies will soon be 
in motion. 

Our government and people seem now to despair of European 
intervention. But the President says our armies are more numer- 
ous, and better armed and disciplined than at any period during 
the war. Hence the contest will be maintained indefinitely for in- 
dependence. With these feelings the third year of the war opens. 
May God have mercy on the guilty men who determine more blood 
shall be shed. The South would willingly cease the sanguinary 
strife, if the invader would retire from our territory ; but just as 
willingly will she fight hereafter as heretofore, so long as a foeman 
sets foot upon her soil. It must soon be seen with what alacrity 
our people will rush to the battle-field ! 

APRIL 13TH. The Federal monitors, gun-boats, and transports 
no more menace the City of Charleston! The fleet has sailed 
away, several of the iron-clads towed out of the harbor being 
badly damaged. But before leaving that part of the coast, the 
Yankees succeeded in intercepting and sinking the merchant 
steamer Leopard, having 40,000 pairs of shoes, etc. on board for 
our soldiers. It is supposed they will reappear before Wilming- 
ton; our batteries there are ready for them. 

Gen. Wise assailed the enemy on aturday, at Williamsburg, 
captured the town, and drove the Federals into their fort Ma- 
gruder. 

The President was ill and nervous on Saturday. His wife, who 
lost her parent at Montgomery, Ala., a month ago, and who re- 
paired thither, is still absent. 

Congress still refuses- to clothe the President with dictatorial 
powers. 

Senator Oldham, of Texas, made a furious assault on the Score- 



292 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

tary of War, last Saturday. He says Senators, on the most urgent 
public business, are subjected to the necessity of writing their names 
on a slate, and then awaiting the pleasure of some lackey for per- 
mission to enter the Secretary's office. He was quite severe in 
his remarks, and moved a call on the President for certain infor- 
mation he desired. 

The Sentinel abuses Congress for differing with the President 
in regard to the retention of diplomatic agents in London, etc. 
And the Enquirer, edited by John Mitchel, the fugitive Irish- 
man, opens its batteries on the Sentinel. So we go. 

APRIL HTH. We have nothing additional from Gen. Wise's 
expedition against Williamsburg; but it was deprecated by our 
people here, whose families and negroes have been left in that 
vicinity. They argue that we cannot hold the town, or any por- 
tion of the Peninsula in the neighborhood; and when the troops 
retire, the enemy will subject the women and children to more 
rigorous treatment, and take all the slaves. 

We have news from Tennessee, which seems to indicate that 
Gen. Van Dorn has been beaten, losing a battery, after a sanguin- 
ary battle of several hours. Yan Dorn had only cavalry 7000. 
This has a depressing effect. It seems that we lose all the battles 
of any magnitude in the West. This news may have been received 
by the President in advance of the public, and hence his indis- 
position. We shall have news now every day or so. 

Albert Pike is out in a pamphlet against Gens. Holmes and 
Hindman. He says their operations in Arkansas have resulted in 
reducing our forces, in that State, from forty odd thousand to less 
than 17,000. It was imprudent to publish such a statement. 
Albert Pike is a native Yankee, but he has lived a long time 
in the South. 

Gov. Yance is furious at the idea of conscribing magistrates, 
constables, etc. in North Carolina. He says it would be an annihi- 
lation of State Rights nevertheless, being subject to militia duty 
by the laws of the State, they are liable under the Act of Con- 
scription. 

Well, we are getting only some 700 conscripts per month in 
Virginia the largest State ! At this rate, how are we to re- 
plenish the ranks as they become thinned in battle ? It is to be 
hoped the enemy will find the same difficulty in filling up their 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 293 

regiments, else we have rather a gloomy prospect before us. But 
God can and will save us if it be His pleasure. 

APRIL 15TH. There is a dispatch, unofficial, from the West, 
contradicting the news of the defeat of Van Dorn. On the Cum- 
berland River, another dispatch says, we have met with new suc- 
cesses, capturing or destroying several more gun-boats. And 
Wheeler has certainly captured a railroad train in the rear of the 
enemy, containing a large sum of Federal money, and a number 
of officers. 

We have nothing from the South, except a letter from Gen. 
Whiting, in regard to some demonstration at Bull Bay, S. C. 

Major Griswold, Provost Marshal, is now himself on trial 
before a court-martial, for allowing 200 barrels of spirits to come 
into the city. He says he had an order from the Surgeon- General; 
but what right had he to give such orders? It is understood he 
will resign, irrespective of the decision of the court. 

Congress, yesterday (the House of Representatives), passed a 
series of resolutions, denying the authority of the government to 
declare martial law, such as existed in this city under the adminis- 
tration of Gen. Winder. It was a great blunder, and alienated 
thousands. 

We have a seasonable rain to-day. 

APRIL 16TH. The Federal papers have heard of the failure to 
take Charleston, and the sinking of the Keokuk; and yet they 
strive to mollify the disaster, and represent that but little damage 
was sustained by the rest of the fleet. Those that escaped, they 
say, have proved themselves invulnerable. The Keokuk had ninety 
shots on the water line. No wonder it sunk ! 

Gen. Longstreet has invested Suffolk, this side of Norfolk, after 
destroying one gun-boat and crippling another in the Nansemond 
River. Unless the enemy get reinforcements, the garrison at Suf- 
folk may be forced to surrender. Perhaps our general may storm 
their works ! 

I learn, to-day, that the remaining eye of the President is fail- 
ing. Total blindness would incapacitate him for the executive 
office. A fearful thing to contemplate ! 

APRIL lira. From the Northern papers we learn that the 
defeat at Charleston is called by the enemy a RECO.NNOISSANCE. 

25* 



294 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

This causes us ranch merriment here; McClellan's defeat was 
called a "strategical movement," and "change of base." 

We have some rumors to-day, to the effect that Gen. Hill is 
likely to take Washington and Newbern, N. C.; Gen. Longstreet, 
Suffolk ; and Gen. Wise, Fort Magruder, and the Peninsula he 
has not troops enough. 

Gold advanced 7 per cent, in New York when the news^of the 
" reconnoissance " reached that city. 

We are planting almost every acre in grain, to the exclusion of 
cotton and tobacco resolved never to be starved, nor even feel a 
scarcity of provisions in future. We shall be cutting wheat in 
another month in Alabama and other States. 

Among the other rumors, it is said Hooker is falling back to- 
ward Washington, but these are merely rumors. 

The President is in a very feeble and nervous condition, and is 
really threatened with the loss of sight altogether. But he works 
on; and few or no visitors are admitted. He remains at his 
dwelling, and has not been in the executive office these ten days. 

Col. Lay was merry again to-day. He ordered in another 
foreign substitute (in North Carolina). 

Pins are so scarce and costly, that it is now a pretty .general 
practice to stoop down and pick up any found in the street. The 
boarding-houses are breaking up, and rooms, furnished and un- 
furnished, are rented out to messes. One dollar and fifty cents for 
beef, leaves no margin for profit, even at $100 per month, which is 
charged for board, and most of the boarders cannot afford to pay 
that price. Therefore they take rooms, and buy their own scanty 
food. I am inclined to think provisions would not be deficient, to 
an alarming extent, if they were equally distributed. Wood is no 
scarcer than before the war, and yet $30 per load (less than a 
cord) is demanded for it, and obtained. 

The other day Wilmington might have been taken, for the troops 
were sent to Beauregard. Their places have since been filled by a 
brigade from Longstreet. It is a monstrous undertaking to at- 
tempt to subjugate so vast a country as this, even with its dis- 
parity of population. We have superior facilities for concentra- 
tion, while the invader must occupy, or penetrate the outer lines 
of the circumference. Our danger is from within, not from with- 
out. We are distressed more by the extortioners than by the 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 295 

enemy. Eternal infamy on the heads of speculators in articles of 
prime necessity ! After the war, let them be known by the fortunes 
they have amassed from the sufferings of the patriots and heroes ! 
the widows and orphans ! 

This day is the anniversary of the secession of Virginia. The 
government at Washington did not believe the separation would 
last two years ! Nor do they believe now, perhaps, that it will 
continue two years longer. 

APRIL 18TH We have nothing more from the Peninsula, Suf- 
folk, N. C., or South Carolina; but it is rumored that the enemy's 
gun-boats (seven or eight) have passed down the Mississippi in 
spite of our batteries at Vicksburg, which sunk one of them. If 
this be true, it is bad news. 

We have lovely weather now, and vegetation shows signs of 
the return of the vernal season. We shall soon have blossoms 
and roses in abundance, and table vegetables too, to dispel the 
fears of famine. But we shall also have the horrid sounds of de- 
vastating war ; and many a cheerful dame and damsel to-day, 
must soon put on the weeds of mourning. 

Gen. Jos. E. Johnston has assumed the command of the army 
of Tennessee. Gen. Howell Cobb is preparing for the defense of 
Florida. We do not hear a word from Lee or Jackson but this 
is the ominous silence preceding their decisive action. 

Bacon fell to-day from $2 to $1 50 per pound, and butter from 
$3.50 to $3.25; potatoes are $16 per bushel. And yet they say 
there is no scarcity in the country. Such supplies are hoarded 
and hidden to extort high prices from the destitute. An intel- 
ligent gentleman from North Carolina told me, to-day, that food 
was never more abundant in his State; nevertheless, the extor- 
tioners are demanding there very high prices. 

This evening we have dispatches (unofficial) confirmatory of the 
passing of Vicksburg by the enemy's gun-boats. One of them was 
destroyed, and two disabled, while five got by uninjured. This is 
not cheering. No doubt an attack by land will be made, by su- 
perior numbers, and blood will gush in streams ! 

It is now said that Longstreet has captured two gun-boats in 
the Nansemond, and taken 600 prisoners ; and that the Yankees 
in Norfolk have been thrown into great commotion. The general 
in command there, Veille, has adopted very stringent measures to 



296 - A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

keep the people sympathizing with our cause in subjection. Per- 
haps he fears an outbreak. 

The weather continues fine, and we must soon have important 
operations in the field. 

APRIL 19TH, SUNDAY. It is now said Longstreet captured two 
transports, instead of gun-boats, and 600 prisoners. 

Mr. Benjamin reports that the enemy's gun-boats, which passed 
Vicksburg, have recaptured the Queen of the West ! It must be 
so, since he says so. 

Mr. Baldwin, the other day, in Congress, asserted a fact, on his 
own knowledge, that an innocent man had been confined in prison 
nearly two years, in consequence of a mistake of one of Gen. 
Winder's subordinates in writing his name, which was Simons ; 
he wrote it Simmons ! 

APRIL 20TH. We have nothing definite from Suffolk, or from 
Washington, N. C. 

But we have Northern accounts of their great disaster at 
Charleston. It appears that during the brief engagement on the 
7th inst., all their monitors were so badly damaged that they were 
unable to prolong or to renew the contest. They will have to be 
taken to New York for repairs ; and will not go into service again 
before autumn. Thus, after nearly a year's preparation, and the 
expenditure of $100,000,000, all their hopes, so far as Charleston 
is concerned, have been frustrated in a few brief hours, under the 
fire of Beauregard's batteries. They complain that England fur- 
nished us with the steel- pointed balls that penetrated their iron 
turrets. To this there can be no objection ; indeed it may be pro- 
ductive of good, by involving the Abolitionists in a new quarrel : 
but it is due to candor to state that the balls complained of were 
manufactured in this city. 

It was a Federal account of the retaking the Queen of the 
West, reported by Mr. Benjamin ; and hence, it is not generally 
believed. 

It is thought by many that Hooker will change his base from 
the Rappahannock to the Paraunky, embarking his army in trans- 
ports. If this be so, we shall again have the pleasure of hearing 
the thunders of battle, this summer, in Richmond. 

Gen. Lee has been quite ill, but is now recovering. 

APRIL 21sT. Gen. Longstreet lost, it is said, two 32-pouuder 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 297 

guns yesterday, with which he was firing on the enemy's gnn- 
boats. A force was landed and captured the battery. 

Gen. Lee writes that his men have each, daily, but a quarter 
pound of meat and 1C ounces of flour. They have, besides, 1 pound 
of rice to every tea men, two or three times a week. He says 
this may keep them alive; but that at this season they should 
have more generous food. The scurvy and the typhoid fever are 
appearing among them. Longstreet and Hill, however, it is 
hoped will succeed in bringing off supplies of provision, etc. 
such being the object of their demonstrations. 

Gen. Wise has fallen back, being ordered by Gen. Elzey not to 
attempt the capture of Fort Magruder a feat he could have ac- 
complished. 

APRIL 22o. The President is reported to be very ill to-day 
dangerously ill with inflammation of the throat, etc. While this 
is a source of grief to nearly all, it is the subject of secret joy to 
others. I am sure I have seen some officers of rank to-day, not 
fighting officers, who sincerely hope the President will not re- 
cover. He has his faults, but upon the whole is no doubt well 
qualified for the position he occupies. I trust he will recover. 

The destruction of the Queen of the West, and of another of 
our steamers, is confirmed. Is not Pemberton and Blanchard re- 
sponsible ? 

The loss of two guns and forty men the other day, on the Nan- 
semond, is laid at the door of Major-Gen. French, a Northern 
man ! Can it be Gen. Cooper (Northern) who procures the ap- 
pointment of so many Northern generals in our army ? 

I cut the following from the Dispatch of yesterday : 

Produce, etc. Bacon has further declined, and we now quote 
$1.25 to $1.30 for hog-round; butter, $2.25 to $3 per pound; 
beans in demand at $20 per bushel. Corn is lower we quote at 
$6 to $6.50 per bushel ; corn meal, $7 to $9 per bushel the latter 
figure for a limited quantity ; candles, $3.50 to $3.75 per pound ; 
fruit dried apples, $10 to $12; dried peaches, $15 to $18 per 
bushel; flour superfine, $31 to $32 ; extra, $34 ; family, $36 ; 
hay is in very small supply sales at $15 per cwt.; lard, $1.65 to 
$1.70 per pound; potatoes Irish, $3 to $10; sweet, $10 to $11 
per bushel ; rice, 25 to 33 cents per pound; wheat, $6.50 to $7 
per bushel. 



298 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

Groceries. Sugars have a declining tendency : we quote brown 
at $1.15 to $1.25 ; molasses, $9 to $10 per gallon ; coffee, $4 to 
$4.50; salt, 45 cents per pound; whisky, $28 to $35; apple 
brandy, $24 to $25 ; French brandy, $65 per gallon. 

APRIL 23n. The President's health is improving. His eye is 
better ; and he would have been in his office to-day (the first time 
for three weeks) if the weather (raining) had been fine. 

The expenses of the war amount now to $60,000,000 per month, 
or $720,000,000 per annum. This enormous expenditure is owing 
to the absurd prices charged for supplies by the farmers, to save 
whose slaves and farms the war is waged, in great part. They 
are charging the government $20 per hundred weight, or $400 per 
ton for hay ! Well, we shall soon see if they be reluctant to pay 
the taxes soon to be required of them one-tenth of all their 
crops, etc. If they refuse to pay, then what will they deserve ? 

APRIL 24TH. We lost five 6ne guns and over a hundred men 
on the Nansemond ; and we learn that more of the enemy's gun- 
boats and transports have passed Vicksburg ! These are untoward 
tidings. Gens. Pemberton and French are severely criticised. 

We had a tragedy in the street to-day, near the President's 
office. It appears that Mr. Dixon, Clerk of the House of Repre- 
sentatives, recently dismissed one of his under clerks, named Ford, 
for reasons which I have not heard ; whereupon the latter notified 
the former of an intention to assault him whenever they should 
meet. About two P.M. they met in Bank Street; Ford asked 
Dixon if he was ready ; and upon an affirmative response being 
given, they both drew their revolvers and commenced firing. 
Dixon missed Ford, and was wounded by his antagonist, but did 
not fall. He attempted to fire again, but the pistol missed 6re. 
Ford's next shot missed D. and wounded a man in Main Street, 
some seventy paces beyond ; but his next fire took effect iii 
Dixon's breast, who fell and expired in a few moments. 

Many of our people think that because the terms of enlistment 
of so many in the Federal army will expire next month, we shall 
not have an active spring campaign. It may be so ; but I doubt 
it. Blood must flow as freely as ever ! 

APRIL 25TH. We have bad news from the West. The enemy 
(cavalry, I suppose) have penetrated Mississippi some 200 miles, 
down to the railroad between Vicksburg and Meridian. This is 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 299 

in the rear and east of Vicksbnrg, and intercepts supplies They 
destroyed two trains. This dispatch was sent to the Secretary of 
War by the President without remark. The Enquirer this morn- 
ing contained a paragraph stating that Gen. Pemberton was ex- 
changing civilities with Gen. Sherman, and had sent him a beautiful 
bouquet ! Did he have any conception of the surprise the enemy 
was executing at the moment? Well, Mississippi is the Presi- 
dent's State, and if he is satisfied with Northern generals to 
defend it, he is as likely to be benefited as any one else. 

Gen. Beauregard is urging the government to send more heavy 
guns to Savannah. 

I saw an officer to-day just from Charleston. He says none of 
the enemy's vessels came nearer than 900 yards of our batteries, 
and that the Northern statements about the monitors becoming 
entangled with obstructions are utterly false, for there were no 
obstructions in the water to impede them. But he says one of 
the monitors was directly over a torpedo, containing 4000 pounds 
of powder, which we essayed in vain to ignite. 

APRIL 26TH. This being Sunday I shall hear no news, for I 
will not be in any of the departments. 

There is a vague understanding that notwithstanding the repulse 
of the enemy at Charleston, still the Federal Government collects 
the duties on merchandise brought into that port, and, indeed, into 
all other ports. These importations, although purporting to be 
conducted by British adventurers, it. is said are really contrived by 
Northern merchants, who send hither (with the sanction of the 
Federal Government, by paying the duty in advance) British and 
French goods, and in return ship our cotton to Liverpool, etc., 
whence it is sometimes reshipped to New York. The duties paid 
the United States are of course paid by the consumers in the Con- 
federate States, in the form of an additional per centum on the 
prices of merchandise. Some suppose this arrangement has the 
sanction of certain members of our government. The plausibility 
of this scheme (if it really exists) is the fact that steamers having 
munitions of war rarely get through the blockading fleet without 
trouble, while those having only merchandise arrive in safety almost 
daily. Gen. D. Green intimates that Mr. Memminger, and Frazer 
& Co., Charleston, are personally interested in the profits of heavy 
importations. 



300 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

APRIL 2?TH. A dispatch from Montgomery, Ala., states that 
the enemy have penetrated as far as Enterprise, Miss., where we 
had a small body of troops, conscripts. If this be merely a raid, 
it is an extraordinary one, and I feel some anxiety to learn the con- 
clusion of it. It is hard to suppose a small force of the enemy 
would evince such temerity. But if it be supported by an army, 
and the position maintained, Vicksburg is doomed. We shall get 
no more sugar from Louisiana. 

APRIL 28TH. The enemy's raid in Mississippi seems to have 
terminated at Enterprise, where we collected a force and offered 
battle, but the invaders retreated. It is said they had 1600 cav- 
alry and 5 guns, and the impression prevails that but few of them 
will ever return. It is said they sent back a detachment of 200 
men some days ago with their booty, watches, spoons, jewelry, etc. 
rifled from the habitations of the non combating people. 

I saw Brig.-Gen. Chilton to day, Chief of Gen. Lee's Staff. 
He says, when the time comes, Gen. Lee will do us all justice. I 
asked him if Richmond were safe, and he responded in the affirm- 
ative. 

I am glad the Secretary of War has stopped the blockade-run- 
ning operations of Gen. Winder and Judge Campbell, Assistant 
Secretary of War. Until to-day, Gen. W. issued many passports 
which were invariably approved by Judge Campbell, but for some 
cause, and Heaven knows there is cause enough, Mr. Secretary has 
ordered that no more passports be granted Marylanders or foreign- 
ers to depart from the Confederacy. I hope Mr. S. will not "back 
down" from this position. 

To-day I returned to the department from the Bureau of Con- 
scription, being required at my old post by Mr. Kean, Chief of the 
Bureau of War, my friend, Jacques, being out of town with a 
strangury. Thus it is; when Congress meets I am detailed on ser- 
vice out of the department, and when Congress adjourns they send 
for me back again. Do they object to my acquaintance with the 
members ? 

A few weeks ago I addressed the President a letter suggesting 
that an alphabetical analysis be made of letter and indorsement 
books, embracing principles of decisions, and not names. This I 
did for the Bureau of Conscription, which was found very useful. 
Precedents could thus be readily referred to when, as was often the 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 301 

case, the names of parties could not be recollected. It happened, 
singularly enough, that this paper came into my hands with forty- 
nine others to-day, at the department, where I shall wholly remain 
hereafter. The President seemed struck with the idea, and in- 
dorsed a reference on it to the " State, Treasury, War, and Navy 
Departments," and also to the Attorney General. I shall be curi- 
ous to know what the Secretary thinks of this plan. No matter 
what the Secretary of War thinks of it; he declined my plan of 
deriving supplies directly from the people, and then adopted it. 

APRIL 29xs. Gen. Beauregard is eager to have completed the 
"Torpedo Ram," building at Charleston, and wants a "great gun" 
for it. But the Secretary of the Navy wants all the iron for 
mailing his gun-boats. Mr. Miles, of South Carolina, says the 
ram will be worth two gun-boats. 

The President of the Manassas Gap Railroad says his company 
is bringing all its old iron to the city. Wherefore ? 

The merchants of Mobile are protesting against the impressment 
by government agents of the sugar and molasses in the city. They 
say this conduct will double the prices. So Congress did not and 
cannot restrain the military authorities. 

Gen. Humphrey Marshall met with no success in Kentucky. 
He writes that none joined him, when he was led to expect large 
accessions, and that he could get neither stock nor hogs. Alas, 
poor Kentucky ! The brave hunters of former days have disap- 
peared from the scene. 

The Secretary of War was not permitted to see my letter which 
the President referred to him, in relation to an alphabetical analy- 
sis of the decisions of the departments. The Assistant Secretary, 
Judge Campbell, and the young Chief of the Bureau of War, sent 
it to the Secretary of the Navy, who, of course, they knew had no 
decisions to be preserved. Mr. Kean, I learn, indorsed a hearty ap- 
proval of the plan, and said he would put it in operation in the War 
Office. But he said (with his concurrence, no doubt) that Judge 
Campbell had suggested it some time before. Well, that may be ; 
but I first suggested it a year ago, and before either Mr. K. or 
Judge Campbell were in office. Office makes curious changes iu 
men ! Still, I think Mr. Seddon badly used in not being permit- 
ted to see the communications the President sends him. 1 have 

26 



302 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

the privilege, and will use it, of sending papers directly to the 
Secretary. 

Gen. Lee telegraphs the President to-day to send troops to 
Gordonsville, and to hasten forward supplies. He says Lt.-Gen. 
Longstreet's corps might now be sent from Suffolk to him. Some- 
thing of magnitude is on the tapis, whether offensive or defensive, 
I could not judge from the dispatch. 

We had hail this evening as large as pullets' eggs. 

The Federal papers have accounts of brilliant successes in 
Louisiana and Missouri, having taken 1600 prisoners in the former 
State and defeated Price at Cape Girardeau in the latter. Whether 
these accounts are authentic or not we have no means of knowing 
yet. We have nothing further from Mississippi. 

It is said there is some despondency in Washington. 

Our people will die in the last ditch rather than be subjugated 
and see the confiscation of their property. 

APRIL 30iH. The enemy are advancing across the Rappahan- 
nock, and the heavy skirmishing which precedes a battle has begun. 
We are sending up troops and supplies with all possible expedi- 
tion. Decisive events are looked for in a few days. But if all of 
Longstreet's corps be sent up, we leave the southern approach to 
the city but weakly defended. Hooker must have overwhelming 
numbers, else he would not venture to advance in the face of Lee's 
army ! Can he believe the silly tale about our troops being sent 
from Virginia to the Carolinas? If so, he will repent his error. 

We hear of fighting in Northwestern Virginia and in Louisiana, 
but know not the result. The enemy have in possession all of 
Louisiana west of the Mississippi River. This is bad for us. 
sugar and salt will be scarcer still. At Grand Gulf our batteries 
have repulsed their gun-boats, but the battle is to be renewed. 

The railroad presidents have met in this city, and ascertained that 
to keep the tracks in order for military purposes, 49,500 tons of 
rails must be manufactured per annum, and that the Tredegar 
Works here, and the works at Atlanta, cannot produce more than 
20,000 tons per annum, even if engaged exclusively in that work I 
They say that neither individual nor incorporated companies will 
suffice. The government must manufacture iron or the roads must 
fail! 

A cheering letter was received from Gov. Vance to-day, stating 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 303 

that, upon examination, the State (North Carolina) contains a 
much larger supply of meat and grain than was supposed. The 
State Government will, in a week or so, turn over to the Confeder- 
ate Government 250,000 pounds of bacon, and a quantity of corn; 
and as speculators are driven out of the market, the Confederate 
States agents will be able to purchase large supplies from the peo- 
ple, who really have a considerable surplus of provisions. He 
attributes this auspicious state of things to the cessation of arbi- 
trary impressments. 



CHAPTER XXVI. 

Lee snuffs a battle in the breeze. Hooker's army supposed to be 100,000 
men. Lee's perhaps 55,000 efficient. I am planting potatoes. Part of 
Longs! reefs army gone up. Enemy makes a raid. Great victory at 
Chancellorville. Hot weather. Our poor wounded coming in streams, 
in ambulances and on foot. Hooker has lost the game. Message from 
the enemy. They ask of Lee permission to bury their dead. Granted, 
of course. Hooker fortifying. Food getting scarce again. Gen. Lee's 
thanks to the army. Crowds of prisoners coming in. Lieut.-Gen. Jackson 
dead. Hooker's raiders "hooked" a great many horses. Enemy demand 
500,000 more men. Beauregard complains that so many of his troops 
are taken to Mississippi. Enemy at Jackson, Miss. Strawberries. R. 
Tyler. My cherries are coming on finely. Ewell and Hill appointed 
lieutenant-generals. President seems to doubt Beauregard's veracity. 
Hon. D. M. Lewis cuts his wheat to morrow, May 28th. Johnston says 
our troops are in fine spirits around Vicksburg. Grant thunders on 
Plan of servile insurrection. 

MAY IST. Gov. Vance writes that Gen. Hill desires him to 
call out the militia, believing the enemy, balked in the attempt on 
Charleston, will concentrate their forces against North Carolina. 
But the Governor is reluctant to call the non-conscripts from the 
plow in the planting season. He thinks the defense of North 
Carolina has not been adequately provided for by the government, 
and that his State has been neglected for the benefit of others. 
He asks heavy guns; and says half the armament hurled against 
Charleston would suffice for the capture of Wilmington. 



304 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

A protest, signed by the thousands of men taken at Arkansas 
Post, now exchanged, against being kept on this side of the Mis- 
sissippi, has been received. The protest was also signed by the 
members of Congress from Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mis- 
souri. 

Capt. Causey, of the Signal Corps, writes that there are only a 
few battalions of the enemy on the Peninsula ; but that rations 
for 40,000 men are sent to Suffolk. 

Gen. Lee announces the crossing of the Rappahannock at Port 
Royal (which the Yankees pillaged) and at places above Frede- 
ricksburg. Gen. Stuart is hovering on their flank. A great battle 
may happen any moment. 

L. E. Harvey, president of Richmond and Danville Railroad, 
asks for details to repair locomotives, else daily trains (freight) 
must be reduced to tri-weekly trains and then the army cannot 
be sustained in Virginia. 

Hon. Mr. Garnett asked (and obtained) permission for a Mr. 
Hurst (Jew?) to pass our lines, and bring Northern merchandise 
to Richmond for sale. He vouches for his loyalty to Virginia. 
Congress has before it a bill rendering this traffic criminal. 

MAY 2o. The awful hour, when thousands of human lives are 
to be sacrificed in the attempt to wrest this city from the Confed- 
erate States, has come again. Now parents, wives, sisters, broth- 
ers, and little children, both in the North and in the South, hold 
their breath in painful expectation. At the last accounts the two 
armies, yesterday, were drawn up in battle array, facing each 
other. No water flowed between them, the Northern army being 
on this side of the Rappahannock. We have no means of know- 
ing their relative numbers ; but I suspect Gen. Hooker commands 
more than 100,000 men, while Gen. Lee's army, perhaps, does not 
exceed 55,000 efficients. 

Accounts by passengers, and reports from the telegraph operators 
at the northern end of the line, some ten or twelve miles this side 
of the armies, indicate that the battle was joined early this morn- 
ing. Certainly heavy cannonading was heard. Yet nothing im- 
portant transpired up to 3 P.M., when I left the department, else I 
should have known it. Still, the battle may be raging, without, 
as yet, decisive result, and the general may not have leisure to be 
dictating dispatches. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 305 

Yet the heavy artillery may be only the preliminary overture to 
the desperate engagement; and it seems to me that several days 
might be spent in manoeuvring into position before the shock of 
arms occurs, which will lay so many heads low in the dust. 

But a great battle seems inevitable. All the world knows the 
fighting qualifications of Gen. Lee, and the brave army he com- 
mands; and Gen. Hooker will, of course, make every effort to 
sustain his reputation as "fighting Joe." Besides, he commands, 
for the first time, an army : and knows well that failure to fight, or 
failure to win, will consign him to the same disgrace of all his 
predecessors who have hitherto commanded the "Army of the 
Potomac." 

It is certain that a column of Federal cavalry, yesterday, cut the 
Central Railroad at Trevillian's depot, which prevents communi- 
cation with Gordonsville, if we should desire to send heavy stores 
thither. And some suppose Lee is manoeuvring to get in the rear 
of Hooker, which would place the enemy between him and Rich- 
mond ! He could then cut off his supplies, now being drawn by 
wagons some twenty or thirty miles, and spread alarm even to 
Washington. But, then, how would it be with Richmond, if 
Hooker should accept the position, and if the force at Suffolk 
should advance on the south side of the river, and gun-boats and 
transports were to come, simultaneously, up the York and James ? 
Has Hooker the genius to conceive such a plan ? Suppose it 
were so, and that he has shipped his supplies from the Potomac 
the supplies which Stuart expects to capture with the desperate 
resolution, abandoning his base on the Rappahannock, to force a 
junction with the heavy detachments south and east of this city ? 
A Napoleon would get Richmond but then Lee might get Wash- 
ington! Longstreet's corps is somewhere in transitu between 
Petersburg and Gordonsville, and would no doubt be ordered 
here, and it might arrive in time. Our defenses are strong ; but 
at this moment we have only Gen. Wise's brigade, and a few bat- 
talions at the batteries, to defend the capital some 5000 in all. 

This is mere speculation, to be succeeded speedily by awful facts. 
The inhabitants here do not doubt the result, although there is a 
feverish anxiety to get intelligence. There is no such thing as 
fear, in this community, of personal danger, even among the wo- 

26* 



306 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

men and children ; but there is some alarm by the opulent inhab- 
itants, some of whom, for the sake of their property, would submit 
to the invader. One thing is pretty certain, Richmond will not 
fall by assault without costing the lives of 50,000 men, which is 
about equal to its population in ordinary times. 

Well, I am planting potatoes in my little garden, and hope to 
reap the benefit of them. I pay 50 cts. per quart for seed pota- 
toes, and should be chagrined to find my expenditure of money 
and labor had been for the benefit of the invader ! Yet it may be 
so; and if it should be, still there are other little gardens to 
cultivate where we might fly to. We have too broad and too 
long a territory in the revolted States to be overrun and possessed 
by the troops of the United States. 

MAY 3D We have no further news from the army, except the 
usual skirmishing. A number of our wounded arrived last evening. 
An officer reports that, from what he could see of the enemy's 
conduct, the soldiers do not come to the point with alacrity. He 
thinks they fight with reluctance, and are liable to be routed any 
hour by inferior numbers. 

Troops were sent up in special trains last night, and also this 
morning. These are some of the regiments which Gen. D. P. Hill 
had in North Carolina ; and hence the complaints of Gov. Vance, 
that his State did not have its just proportion of the protection of 
the government. Of Longstreet's movements, I am not advised. 
But there will be news enough in a few days. 

The President's health is still precarious, and he is still threat- 
ened with the loss of his remaining eye. 

The Vice-President was in my office yesterday, and told me his 
health is quite as good as usual. One would suppose him to be 
afflicted with all manner of diseases, and doomed to speedy disso- 
lution ; but, then, he has worn this appearance during the last 
twenty years. His eyes are magnificent, and his mind is in the 
meridian of intellectual vigor. 

There has been some commotion in the city this afternoon and 
evening, but no painful alarm, produced by intelligence that the 
enemy's cavalry, that cut the road at Trevilliau's depot, had reached 
Ashland and destroyed the depot. Subsequent rumors brought 
them within eight miles of the city ; and we have no force of any 
consequence here. The account was brought from Ashland by a 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 307 

Mr. Davis, who killed his horse in riding eighteen miles in one 
hoar and a half. 

Later jn the day a young man, sixteen years old (Shelton), reached 
the city from Hanover on a United States horse, the enemy having 
foraged on his father's farm and taken his blooded steed. He 
says, when he escaped from them (having been taken prisoner this 
morning) 1500 were at his father's place, and three times as many 
more, being 6000 in all, were resting a short distance apart on 
another farm ; but snch ideas of numbers are generally erroneous. 
They told him they had been in the saddle five days, and had 
burnt all the bridges behind them to prevent pursuit. It was after 
this that they cut the road at Ashland. They professed to have 
fresh horses taken from our peopje, leaving their own. I think 
they will disappear down the Pamunky, and of course will cut the 
Central and York River Roads, and the wires. Thus communi- 
cation with Lee's army is interrupted ! 

The Fredericksburg train, of course, failed to arrive to-day at 
6 P.M.; and it is rumored there were 700 of our wounded in it, 
and that a great battle was fought yesterday by Lee. These are 
rumors. 

MAY 4TH. This morning early the tocsin sounded, and the din, 
kept up for several hours, intensified the alarm. The presence of 
the enemy would not have produced a greater effect. But, in 
truth, the enemy were almost in sight of the city. Hon. James 
Lyons told me they were within a mile and a half of his house, 
which is about that distance from the city. Thousands of men, 
mostly old men and employees of the government, were instantly 
organized and marched to the batteries. 

But the alarm subsided about 10 A.M. upon information being 
received that the enemy were flying before Gen. Wise down the 
Peninsula. 

After this the following dispatch was received from Gen. Lee : 

"MiLFORD, May 3d, 1863. 
"PRESIDENT DAVIS. 

" Yesterday Gen. Jackson, with three of his divisions, penetrated 
to the rear of the enemy, and drove him from all his positions, from 
the Wilderness to within one mile of Chancellorville. He was en- 
gaged at the same time, in front, by two of Longstreet's divisions. 



308 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

This morning the battle was renewed. He was dislodged from all 
his positions around Chancellorville, and driven back toward the 
Rappahannock, over which he is now retreating. 

" Many prisoners were taken, and the enemy's loss, in killed and 
wounded, large. 

"We have again to thank Almighty God for a great victory. 

"I regret to state that Gen. Paxton was killed. Gen. Jackson 
severely, and Generals Heth and A. P. Hill slightly, wounded. 

(Signed) "R. E. LEE, General." 

Enough is known to raise the spirits of all. Gen. Lee gives 
thanks to God "for a great victory;" and he never misleads, 
never exaggerates. 

My son Custis got a musket and marched in one of the com- 
panies I have not learned which for the defense of the city. It 
is a sultry day, and he will suffer. 

The President was driven out in a light open carriage after the 
reception of Gen. Lee's dispatch, and exhibited the finest spirits. 
He was even diverted at the zeal of the old men and boys march- 
ing out with heavy muskets to the batteries. 

Brig. -Gen. Pryor, who has been under arrest (I know, not for 
what offense), volunteered in a company of horse, and galloped 
away with the rest in pursuit of the enemy. 

MAY STH. To-day the excitement was quite as great as ever, 
for bodies of the enemy are still in the vicinity. They are like 
frightened quails when the hawks are after them, skurrying about 
the country in battalions and regiments. Fitzhugh Lee defeated 
one of their parties, and reports that the entire calvary force of 
Hooker, in anticipation of certain victory, had been detached in 
the rear of Lee's army. This force comprises twenty-eight regi- 
ments, or 15,000 mounted men ! Now that Hooker is defeated 
our operator at Guiney's station dispatches to-day that it is report- 
ed there, and believed, that Hooker and his staff are prisoners 
it may be reasonably doubted whether one-half of this wild cavalry 
will escape. It was the mad pranks of a desperate commander. 
Hooker cast all upon the hazard of the die and lost. 

Among the mad pranks of the enemy, they sent a message over 
the wires to-day from Louisa County, I believe, to this purport : 
"For Heaven's sake, come and take us. We are broken down, 
and will surrender." 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 309 

They captured an engine sent out yesterday to repair the road. 
The white men escaped, leaving two free negroes. The Yankees 
made the negroes put on a full head of steam, and run the loco- 
motive into the river. 

One of the enemy was taken sleeping at one of our city bat- 
teries near the river. 

My friend, Dr. Powell, on the Brooke Turnpike, sent his little 
son, mounted on his finest horse, on an errand to a neighbor. The 
lad fell in with, as he called them, "some Yankee Dutchmen," 
who presented their pistols and made him dismount. They took 
his horse and allowed him to return. 

At the hour we were dining yesterday, the enemy were within 
two and a half miles of us on the Brooke road, and might have 
thrown shell into this part of the city. 

Col. D. J. Godwin writes a long letter to the Secretary of War, 
from King and Queen Counties, concerning the great number of 
suspicious persons continually passing our lines into those of the 
enemy, with passports from this city ; and the great injury done 
by the information they give. Unquestionably they have not only 
given information, but have furnished guides to the many regi- 
ments of cavalry now skurrying through the country. But the 
Baltimore Plug Uglies, under the protection of Gen. Winder, are 
the masters, now Mr. Secretary Seddon has yielded again. 

A letter was received from Gen. J. E. Johnston to-day. He 
is too unwell to take the field, and suggests, if it be desirable to 
be in regular communication with Gen. Bragg, that the President 
send out a confidential officer. He says the army is suffering for 
meat, and if it retires into East Tennessee, supplies must be ob- 
tained from its flanks instead of from its rear, which would be dan- 
gerous. The letter was dated a week ago, and gives no indications 
of a battle. The general says he is exchanging sugar for bacon ; 
but condemns the practice of allowing our people to sell cotton to 
the enemy for supplies. In my opinion none but government cot- 
ton should be exchanged for subsistence. He says the people are 
subjugated by trade. He suggests that our men when paroled, 
and not exchanged, may do duty otherwise than in arms as is 
practiced by the enemy. 

H. D. Bird, general superintendent of the railroad, writes from 
Petersburg that the movements of cars with ammunition, etc. are 



310 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

thrown into confusion by the neglect of telegraph agents in giving 
timely notice. This is an unfortunate time for confusion. I sent 
the letter to the Secretary, and know that it was not "filed" on 
the way to him. 

A communication came in to-day from the Committee of Safety 
at Mobile, Ala., charging that J. S. Clark, Wm. G. Ford, and 
Hurt, have been shipping cotton to New Orleans, after pre- 
tending to clear it for Nassau. It says Mr. Clarke was an inti- 
mate crony of Gen. Butler's speculating brother. It also intimates 
that the people believe the government here winks at these viola- 
tions of the act of Congress of April, 1862. 

Yery curiously, a letter came from the Assistant Secretary's 
room to-day for "file," which was written April 22d, 1861, by 
R. H. Smith to Judge Campbell a private letter warning him 
not to come to Mobile, as nothing was thought of but secession, 
and it was believed Judge C. had used his influence with Mr. 
Seward to prevent secession. The writer deprecates civil war. 
And quite as curiously, the Examiner to-day contains what pur- 
ports to be Admiral Buchanan's correspondence with the Lincoln 
government, two letters, the first in April, 18G1, tendering his res- 
ignation, and the last on May 4th, begging, if it had not been done 
already, that the government would not accept his resignation. 

MAY 6TH. The excitement has subsided, as troops come pour- 
ing in, and many improvised cavalry companies go out in quest of 
the fox who has vanished we know not exactly whither. 

It is believed we have taken 15,000 or 20,000 prisoners, and 
that the enemy's killed, wounded, and prisoners must reach the 
appalling number of 40,000. 

On Sunday, the enemy opposite Fredericksburg sent over a 
flag, asking permission to bury their dead. This was granted. 
But when they came two corps under Gen. Sedgwick came over 
and fell upon our few regiments in the vicinity. So goes the 
story. Then, it is said, when Gen. Lee ordered two of our divi- 
sions to drive Sedgwick back, the men, learning the enemy with 
the flag of truce had given no quarter to their comrades, refused 
to fight unless permitted to retaliate in kind. This was promised 
them ; and then their charge was irresistible, never pausing until 
the Yankees were hurled back across the river. No prisoners were 
taken. However this maybe, Gen. Lee sends the following to 
the President : 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 311 

" [Received by telegraph from Guiney's Depot.] 

" HEADQUARTERS, 10 o'clock A M., 

"May 5, 1863. 
" To HIS EXCELLENCY, PRESIDENT DAVIS. 

"At the close of the battle of Chancellorville, on Sunday, the 
enemy was reported advancing from Fredericksburg in our rear. 

" Gen. McLaws was sent back to arrest his progress, and repulsed 
him handsomely that afternoon. Learning that this force con- 
sisted of two corps, under Gen. Sedgwick, I determined to attack 
it, and marched back yesterday with Gen. Anderson, and uniting 
with Gens. McLaws and Early in the afternoon, succeeded by the 
blessing of Heaven in driving Gen. Sedgwick over the river. We 
have reoccnpied Fredericksburg, and no enemy remains south of 
the Rappahannock in its vicinity. 

" (Signed) R. E. LEE, General." 

Another dispatch from Gen. Lee says Hooker is still on this 
side of the river, at United States Ford, fortifying. 

Gen. Longstreet is now closeted with the Secretary of War. 
No doubt his entire corps will immediately rejoin Lee. 

Jackson was wounded (his arm has been amputated) before the 
great battle was fought, by our own men, in the gloom of the 
evening, snpposing him a Federal officer. He was reconnoitering 
in front of the line. 

S. S. H writes to the department, proposing to send an 

emissary to the North, to organize secret societies to destroy the 
enemy's stores, ships, railroad bridges, etc. by an unexplained 
process. 

Tillman, Griffin & Co. write to Judge Campbell to obtain them 
permission to trade with Mexico. Does this mean trading cotton 
with the enemy ? I know not whether the request was granted. 

Mr. Benjamin, Secretary of State, writes to the Secretary to-day 
for permission for some of his Louisiana friends to leave the 
country in a government steamer. 

It is said that the government at Washington is ordering their 
troops from North Carolina and other places on the Southern sea- 
board towards Washington, and to reinforce Hooker or Hooker's 
army. I think Hooker himself will go the way of all general flesh 
that fails. 



312 'A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

The President sent to the War Department fifty-five letters to- 
day, written to him on various subjects, but mostly asking ap- 
pointments. He had read them, and several had indorsed on them, 
in his own hand, what he wished done in the premises. So he has 
not lost his sight. He still attends to business at his dwelling, 
and has not been in his office for more than a month. 

Secretary Seddon is gaunt and emaciated, with long straggling 
hair, mingled gray and black. He looks like a dead man galva- 
nized into muscular animation. His eyes are sunken, and his feat- 
ures have the hue of a man who had been in his grave a full month. 
But he is an orator, and a man of fine education but in bad health, 
being much afflicted with neuralgia. His administrative capacity 
will be taxed by the results. 

MAY YTH. A scout came in to-day with the vexatious intelli- 
gence that a body of hostile cavalry is still in Louisa County. 
And later in the day we have information that the Mattapony 
bridge was burned last night ! Thus again is communication in- 
terrupted between Gen. Lee and the city 1 Our wounded cannot 
be brought to the hospitals here, nor supplies sent to them ! It 
really does seem as if an organization of Union men here were 
co-operating with the enemy, else they never could disappear and 
reappear so often with impunity. Every one is asking what 
Gens. Elzey and Winder are doing and echo answers, WHAT? 

There is a great pressure for passports to leave the country. 
Mr. Benjamin writes an indignant letter to the Secretary against 
Gen. Whiting, at Wilmington, for detaining a Mr. Planner's 
steamer, laden with cotton for some of the nationalities Mr. B. 
intimates a foreign or neutral power. But when once away from 
our shore, many of these vessels steer for New York, depositing 
large sums " for those whom it may concern." 

Mr. J. B. Campbell, attorney for J. E. Hertz (Jew), writes a 
long letter to "J. A. Campbell, Assistant Secretary of War," 
urging the payment of the slight sum of $25,200 for ninety kegs 
of bicarbonate of soda seized by the agent of the department 1 
The true value is about $250 ! 

At two o'clock this afternoon a note was received by the Secre- 
tary of War from Lieut.-Gen. Longstreet (still in the city), stating 
that the President last night desired him to go to Gen. Lee imme- 
diately ; but the general, during the day, has become convinced 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 313 

that he should not leave the city until communications are re- 
established with Gen. Lee, arid the city in a condition of defense 
against the sudden dash of one or two columns of the enemy an 
event, he thinks, meditated by the Yankees ! And the persistency 
of the Federal cavalry in hanging round the city in spite of all the 
generals here, and the many companies, battalions, and regiments 
vainly sent out in quest of them, would seem to indicate such pur- 
pose. 

But the raids in the West don't seem to flourish so well. We 
have an official dispatch from Gen. Bragg, stating that Gen. Forrest 
has captured 1600 of the enemy's cavalry in a body, near Rome, 
Georgia. 

There are amusing scenes among the horrors of war, as the fol- 
lowing, taken from a paper to-day, shows : 

"Taking the Oath under Protest. A few weeks ago a laugh- 
able incident occurred in the neighborhood of Nashville, which is 
worthy of record. A saucy, dashing young girl, of the Southern 
persuasion, was, with a number of other ladies, brought into the 
presence of Gen. Rosecrans, in order that their Southern ardor 
might be checked by the administration of the oath of loyalty. 
The bold, bright-eyed Juno in question, objected to take the oath, 
saying that her mother had taught her that it was unlady-like to 
swear; her sense of morality forbid her to swear, and swear she 
could and would not. The officer insisted that the lady must take 
an oath before she left his presence. 

" ' Well, general,' " said bright eyes, ' if I must swear, I will ; but 
all sins of the oath must rest on your shoulders, for I swear on your 
compulsion : " G d d m every Yankee to h 1 !' " 

"And the defiant beauty tossed her dark curls and swept out of 
the presence unmolested." Nashville Union. 

7 O'CLOCK P.M. The report that the bridge over the Mattapony 
had been burned by the enemy was false invented probably by a 
spy or emissary, who has enjoyed the freedom of the city under 
the Dogberrys and Vergises imported hither to preserve the gov- 
ernment. A number of trains containing our wounded men, 
guarded by a detachment of troops, have arrived at the Fredericks- 
burg depot. An officer just arrived from the army says we have 
taken 15,000 prisoners. If this be so, the loss of the enemy during 
the week in Virginia will not be less than 40,000. Our loss in 

27 



314 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

killed and wounded is estimated at from 8 to 10,000 we lost a 
few hundred prisoners. We have taken, it is said, 53 guns, and 
lost 14. 

I think the reports to-day of squadrons of the enemy's cavalry 
seen in the surrounding counties are not reliable they were 
probably our own men in quest of the enemy. 

MAY STH. To-day the city is in fine spirits. Hooker had 
merely thrown up defenses to protect his flight across the river. 
The following dispatch was received last night from Gen. Lee : 

" CIIANCELLORVILLE, May 7th, 1863. 
" To His EXCELLENCY, PRESIDENT DAVIS. 

"After driving Gen. Sedgwick across the Rappahannock, on 
the night of the 4th inst., I returned on the 5th to Chancellor- 
ville. The march was delayed by a storm, which continued all 
night and the following day. In placing the troops in position on 
the morning of the 6th, to attack Gen. Hooker, it was ascertained 
he had abandoned his fortified position. The line of skirmishers 
was pressed forward until they came within range of the enemy's 
batteries, planted north of the Rappahannock, which, from the 
configuration of the ground, completely commanded this side. 
His army, therefore, escaped with the loss of a few additional 
prisoners. 

"(Signed) R. E. LEE, General" 

Thus ends the career of Gen. Hooker, who, a week ago, was at 
the head of an army of 150,000 men, perfect in drill, discipline, 
and all the muniments of war. He came a confident invader 
against Gen. Lee at the head of 65,000 " butternuts," as our 
honest poor-clad defenders were called, and we see the result ! 
An active campaign of less than a week, and Hooker is hurled 
back in disgrace and irreparable disaster ! Tens of thousands of 
his men will never live to " fight another day" and although the 
survivors did "run away," it is doubtful whether they can be put 
in fighting trim again for many a month. 

And the raiding cavalry have not been heard from to-day. If 
they be not back on the north side of the Rappabaunock by this 
time, it is probable they will reach Richmond in a few days with- 
out arms, and on foot 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 315 

Gens. Hood's and Pickett's divisions (Longstreet's corps) are 
now passing through the city perhaps 15,000 of the best fighting 
men in the South. Oh, what wisdom and foresight were evinced 
by Gen. Lee, when, some ten days ago, he telegraphed the Presi- 
dent to send him Longstreet's corps, via Gordonsville ! It was 
referred to the Secretary of War, who consulted with Gen. Cooper 
and of course it was not done. This corps was not in the battle. 
If it had been on the field, Hooker's destruction would have been 
speedy and complete ; and his routed regiments would have been 
followed to the very gates of the Federal capital. As it was, 
Lee lost a day in driving Sedgwick back and then Hooker 
"escaped," as Lee expresses it. 

I do not understand the Assistant Secretary of War's official 
correspondence. He sent in the other day a letter addressed to 
him two years ago to be filed and to-day an envelope addressed 
to him as Assistant Secretary by Mr. Benjamin, Secretary of State, 
merely covering a letter (sealed) for R. S. Bunkee, Mobile, Ala- 
bama. Well, it is filed. * 

The pressure for permits to leave the Confederacy is not re- 
newed to-day. Judge Campbell will not have so many passports 
to " approve," and I trust confidence in the permanency of the 
Confederacy will be unshaken. How must they feel who, in an- 
ticipation of Lee's defeat, had received, in advance, a pardon from 
the powers at Washington ! 

Col. Lay was in to-day ; he thinks the North will be cheered a 
little by their capture of Grand Gulf, in the West. But that is not 
Vicksburg, or Charleston, or Richmond. 

We have had short allowance of food yesterday and to-day ; 
the country people being afraid to come to market, lest their 
horses should be seized to go in quest of the enemy's cavalry. 
My family dined to-day on eight fresh herrings, which cost two 
dollars. 

The trains from Fredericksburg brought down several hundred 
Federal officers; among them was a general, a large number of 
colonels, lieutenant-colonels, majors, captains, etc. These, when 
exchaaged, as I suppose they will be for victory makes our govern- 
ment magnanimous may, if they choose, deny the report that the 
raiding cavalry destroyed the railroad. 

Now what will the Tribune say ? It did say, a few months ago, 



316 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

that if the effort to crush the rebellion failed this spring, it wonld 
be useless to prolong the war and that peace should be made on 
the best practicable terras. Since the beginning of the war, I 
doubt not 500,000 men have been precipitated upon Virginia. 
Where are they now? In the third year of the war, we see "the 
finest army the world ever saw," overthrown by about half its 
numbers, and in full retreat toward its own frontier. Perhaps 
100,000 invaders have found bloody graves in Virginia and an 
equal number have died of their wounds, or from disease con- 
tracted in this State. The number of maimed and disabled must 
also be 100,000 and yet Richmond is not taken, or likely to be. 
To invade and subjugate a vast territory, inhabited by millions of 
warlike people, the assailants must always have four times as many 
men as the assailed ; therefore we stand on an equal footing with 
the United States in this war, and they may, if they be insane 
enough, protract it indefinitely, and in the end reap no substantial 
benefit. On the Contrary, the fortune of war may shift the scene 
'of devastation to their own homes, Perhaps Lee may follow up 
this blow until he enters Pennsylvania. 

MAY 9xH. The papers contain the following order from Gen. 
Lee : 

"HEADQUARTERS ARMY NORTHERN VIRGINIA, 

"May 7th, 1863. 
"GENERAL ORDERS No. 59. 

"With heartfelt gratification, the General Commanding ex- 
presses to the army his sense of the heroic conduct displayed by 
officers and men, during the arduous operations in which they have 
just been engaged. 

"Under trying vicissitudes of heat and storm, you attacked the 
enemy, strongly intrenched in the depths of a tangled wilderness, 
and again on the hills of Fredericksburg, fifteen miles distant, and 
by the valor that has triumphed on so many fields, forced him once 
more to seek safety beyond the Rappahannock. While this glori- 
ous victory entitles you to the praise and gratitude of the nation, 
we are especially called upon to return our grateful thanks to the 
only Giver of victory for the signal deliverance He has wrought. 

"It is, therefore, earnestly recommended that the troops unite 
on Sunday next in ascribing to the Lord of hosts the glory due 
unto His name. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 317 

"Let us not forget in our rejoicing the brave soldiers who have 
fallen in defense of their country; and while we mourn their loss, 
let us resolve to emulate their noble example. 

"The army and the country alike lament the absence for a time 
of one to whose bravery, energy, and skill they are so much in- 
debted for success. 

"The following letter from the President of the Confederate 
States is communicated to the army as an expression of his appre- 
ciation of its success : 

"'I have received your dispatch, and reverently unite with you 
in giving praise to God for the success with which He has crowned 
our arms. 

"'In the name of the people, I offer my cordial thanks to your- 
self and the troops under your command for this addition to the 
unprecedented series of great victories which your army has 
achieved. 

"'The universal rejoicing produced by this happy result will 
be mingled with a general regret for the good and the brave who 
are numbered among the killed and wounded.' 

"R. E. LEE, General." 

The losses on either side are not yet relatively ascertained. 
Ours, in killed, wounded, and prisoners, will probably reach 10,000. 
We have taken, about 10,000 prisoners; the enemy's killed and 
wounded is thought to be 15,000 to 20,000. We have taken about 
fifty guns and it is said 40,000 small arms, in good order. They 
did not have leisure to destroy them as on former occasions. It 
was a complete and stunning defeat. 

Gen. Jackson remains near Fredericksburg, and is doing well 
since the amputation of his (left) arm. The wound was received, 
during the battle by moonlight, from his own men, who did not rec- 
ognize their beloved general. 

A letter was received to-day from Gen. Whiting at Wilming- 
ton, who refuses to permit the "Lizzie" to leave the port, unless 
ordered to do so. He intimates that she trades with the enemy. 
And yet Mr. Benjamin urges the Secretary to allow her to depart! 
Commodore Lynch also writes that the detention of the "Lizzie" 
is a prudential measure, as it is the only steamer in port that could 

27* 



318 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

conduct our unfinished gun-boat to a place of safety, should the 
enemy's fleet make a sudden attack on the city. 

The President (who still absents himself from the Executive 
Office, his health being precarious) writes the Secretary to consult 
Gen. Lee before detaching Gen. Jenkins's cavalry brigade from the 
West. It would have been better if Gen. Lee's advice had been 
taken in regard to Gen. Longstreet. 

The men from the garrison at Drewry's Bluff, and the crew from 
the steamer Richmond, were taken away to man the batteries around 
the city. The President requests the Secretary to order them back 
at the earliest moment practicable. It would be an ugly picture if 
our defenses at Drewry's Bluff were surprised and taken by a sud- 
den dash of the enemy up James River. 

The raid of the enemy's cavalry, after all, did little or no per- 
manent injury to the roads or canal. They are all in operation 
again. 

It is said Lincoln has called for 500,000 more men. Numbers 
have now no terror for the Southern people. They are willing to 
wage the war against quadruple their number. 

MAY 10TH. Detachments of Federal troops are now marching 
into the city every few hours, guarded by (mostly) South Caro- 
linians, dressed in home-spun, died yellow with the bark- of the 
butternut-tree. Yesterday evening, at 7 o'clock, a body of 2000 
arrived, being marched in by way of the Brooke Pike, near to my 
residence. Only 200 Butternuts had them in charge, and a less 
number would have sufficed, for they were extremely weary. Some 
of them, however, attempted to be humorous. 

A young officer asked one of the spectators if the "Libby " (the 
prison) was the best house in the city to put up at. He was an- 
swered that it was the best he would find. 

Another passed some compliment on a mulatto wench, who re- 
plied : "Go long, you nasty Abolition Yankee." 

One of our soldiers taken at Arkansas Post, just exchanged, 
walked along with the column, and kept repeating these words : 
"Now you know how we felt when you marched us through your 
cities." 

But generally a deep silence was maintained, and neither insult 
nor indignity offered the fallen foe. Other columns are on the way 
and how they are to be subsisted is a vexatious question. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 319 

The Washington papers of the day preceding the first battle 
contain Hooker's address to his army how different from Lee's ! 
It is short, though : 

"HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, 

"Camp near Falmouth, April 30th. 

"GENERAL ORDERS No. 41. 

"It is with heartfelt satisfaction that the Commanding General 
announces to the army that the operations of the last three days 
have determined that our enemy must either ingloriously fly or 
come out from behind his defenses and give us battle on our own 
ground, where certain destruction awaits him. The operations of 
the 15th, llth, and 12th corps have been a succession of splendid 
achievements. 

"By command of MAJ.-GEN. HOOKER. 

"S. WILLIAMS, Asa't. Adft.-Gen." 

Another column of between twelve and fifteen hundred prisoners 
marched in this afternoon. It is said a copy of the New York Herald 
is in town, which acknowledges Hooker's loss to be fully 40,000. 
There are rumors, also, that our army in Tennessee has gained a 
great victory. Rumors from the West have hitherto been so very 
unreliable, that I shall wait patiently for the confirmation of any 
reports from that quarter. 

MAY HTH. Lieut.-Gen. J. T. Jackson died at 3 P.M. yester- 
day. His remains will arrive in the city at 5 P.M. this afternoon. 
The flags are at half-mast, and all the government offices and even 
places of business are closed. A multitude of people, mostly 
women and children, are standing silently in the streets, awaiting 
the arrival of the hero, destined never again to defend their homes 
and honor. 

A letter from Gen. Lee says, emphatically, that if cavalry be 
not brought from North Carolina and the South, the enemy's 
cavalry will be enabled to make raids almost anywhere without 
molestation. I recollect distinctly how he urged the Secretary of 
War (Randolph), months ago, to send to Texas for horses, but it 
was not attended to and now we see the consequences. 

The exchanged prisoners here, taken at Arkansas Post, are or- 
dered to the Mississippi. Gen. Longstreet urged the Secretary 
to send them off, if that were their destination, without a moment's 



320 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

delay, several days ago else they wonld be too late to participate 
in the campaign. 

Northern papers set down Hooker's loss at 20,000, a modest 
figure, subject to revision. 

The Federal Secretary of War has issued a statement to mollify 
the panic. He is bound to acknowledge that, whereas Hooker ad- 
vanced upon Lee across the river, he is now, after the battle, back 
again, where he started from. But he says not more than a third 
of the army was engaged ; and as 30,000 reinforcements have been 
sent from Washington, and as many from Suffolk, the army will 
soon be as strong as ever, and in condition for another advance 
and defeat. 

But what credit can we attach to such statements, since McClel- 
lan, under oath, said that he had ninety odd thousand men at the 
battle of Sharpsburg, 75,000 of whom only were actually engaged, 
while Lee had 100,000? We know that he did not have 40,000 
engaged ! 

Gen. Van Dorn is dead being killed by a man whose peace he 
had ruined. 

More applications for passports to leave the country are coming 
in and they are "allowed "by the Assistant Secretary of War. 
How could he refuse, since his own family (at least a portion of 
it) have enjoyed the benefits of sojourning in the North since the 
war began ? 

A letter was received to-day from Mr. Ranney, president of the 
N. C., Jackson, and Great Northern Railroad Co., asking the 
protection of government from harm for violations of the Act of 
Congress of April 19th, 1862, prohibiting the transportation of 
cotton within the enemy's lines. He incloses a number of per- 
emptory orders from Lieut. -Gen. Pemberton, dated January 19th, 
February 16th and 19th, to take large amounts of cotton into the 
enemy's lines for S. J. Josephs (Jew ?), and for Messrs. Clarke, 
Ford, and Hust, etc. etc. He says Gen. P. threatened to seize 
the road if he did not comply, and asserted that he had authority 
from the Secretary of War to issue the orders. One of these 
orders was from Gov. Pettus, for a small lot not more than fifty 
bales, to be exchanged for salt. This was authorized by the 
President, who most positively forbid the others. The letter from 
Gen. Johnston the other day said this traffic was subjugating the 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 321 

people. Was that "allowed" to reach the Secretary and the 
President? I know not; it has not yet passed through my hands 
from the President back to the department. 

MAY 12TH. The departments and all places of business are 
still closed in honor of Gen. Jackson, whose funeral will take place 
to-day. The remains will be placed in state at the Capitol, where 
the people will be permitted to see him. The grief is universal, 
and the victory involving such a loss is regarded as a calamity. 

The day is bright and excessively hot; and so was yesterday. 

Many letters are coming in from the counties in which the 
enemy's cavalry replenished their horses. It appears that the 
government has sent out agents to collect the worn-down horses 
left by the enemy; and this is bitterly objected to by the farmers. 
It is the corn-planting season, and without horses, they say, they 
can raise no crops. Some of these writers are almost menacing 
in their remarks, and intimate that they are about as harshly used, 
in this war, by one side as the other. 

To-day I observed the clerks coming out of the departments 
with chagrin and mortification. Seventy-five per cent, of them 
ought to be in the army, for they are young able-bodied men. 
This applies also to the chiefs of bureaus. 

The funeral was very solemn and imposing, because the mourn- 
ing was sincere and heartfelt. There was no vain ostentation. The 
pall bearers were generals. The President followed near the 
hearse in a carriage, looking thin and frail in health. The heads 
of departments, two and two, followed on foot Benjamin and 
Seddon first at the head of the column of young clerks (who 
ought to be in the field), the State authorities, municipal authori- 
ties, and thousands of soldiers and citizens. The war-horse was 
led by the general's servant, and flags and black feathers 
abounded. 

Arrived at the Capitol, the whole multitude passed the bier, and 
gazed upon the hero's face, seen through a glass in the coffin. 

Just previous to the melancholy ceremony, a very large body of 
prisoners (I think 3500) arrived, and were marched through Main 
Street, to the grated buildings allotted them. But these attracted 
slight attention, Jackson, the great hero, was the absorbing 
thought. Yet there are other Jacksons in the army, who will win 
victories, no one doubts it.

The following is Gen. Lee's order to the array after the intelli- 
gence of Gen. Jackson's death : 

" HEADQUARTERS ARMY NORTHERN VA., 

"May llth, 1863. 
" GENERAL ORDERS No. 61. 

"With deep grief the Commanding General announces to the 
army the death of Lieut.-Gen. T. J. Jackson, who expired on the 
10th inst., at 3^ P.M. The daring, skill, and energy of this great 
and good soldier, by the decree of an all-wise Providence, are 
now lost to us. But while we mourn his death, we feel that his 
spirit still lives, and will inspire the whole army with his indomit- 
able courage and unshaken confidence in God as our hope and 
our strength. Let his name be a watchword to his corps, who 
have followed him to victory on so many fields. Let officers and 
soldiers emulate his invincible determination to do everything in 
the defense of our beloved country. 

"R. E. LEE-, General." 

The Letter of Gen. Lee to Gen. Jackson. 

The letter written by Gen. Lee to Gen. Jackson before the death 
of the latter is as follows : 

"CHANCELLORVILLE, May 4th. 
" GENERAL : 

"I have just received your note informing me that you were 
wounded. I cannot express my regret at the occurrence. Could 
I have dictated events, I should have chosen for the good of the 
country to have been disabled in your stead. 

" I congratulate you upon the victory which is due to your skill 
and energy. 

" Most truly yours, 

" R. E. LEE. 
"To Gen. T. J. Jackson. 1 '' 

" The nation's agony," as it is termed in a Washington paper, 
in an appeal for 500,000 more men, now demands a prompt re- 
sponse from the people. And yet that paper, under the eye and 
in the interest of the Federal Government, would make it appear 
that "the Army of the Potomac" has sustained no considerable 
disaster. What, then, constitutes the " nation's agony" ? Is it 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 323 

the imrainency of war with England ? It may be, judging from 
the debates in Parliament, relating to the liberties the United 
States have been taking with British commerce. Bnt what do 
they mean by the "nation?" They have nothing resembling a 
homogeneous race in the North, and nearly a moiety of the people 
are Germans and Irish. How ridiculous it would have been even 
for a Galba to call his people the Roman nation! An idiot may 
produce a conflagration, but he can never rise to the dignity of a 
high-minded man. Yet that word " Nation" may raise a million 
Yankee troops. It is a "new thing." 

The Northern papers say Charleston is to be assailed again im- 
mediately ; that large reinforcements are going to Hooker, and 
that they captured six or eight thousand prisoners in their flight 
on the Rappahannock. All these fictions are understood and ap- 
preciated here; but they may answer a purpose in the North, by 
deceiving the people again into the belief that Richmond will cer- 
tainly fall the next time an advance is made. And really, where 
we see such extravagant statements in the Federal journals, after 
a great battle, we are much rejoiced, because we know them to be 
unfounded, and we are led to believe our victory was even greater 
than we supposed it to be. 

MAY 13TH. Col. Gorgas, Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance, 
sent in to-day a report of the arms captured in the recent battle. 
It appears from his statement that, so far, only eight guns have 
been found, taken from the enemy, while we lost ten. Thus, it 
would appear, our papers have been "lying," in regard to that 
item, as well as the Northern papers about the number of prisoners 
lost and taken. But, so far, we have collected 12,000 of the 
enemy's small arms. left upon the field, and 8000 of our own, in- 
dicating the number of our killed and wounded. But the New 
York journals say we captured only 1700 prisoners; whereas, up 
to this time, more 'than 6000 have arrived in Richmond ; 5000 of 
whom leave to-day, paroled until exchanged. I doubt whether 
we lost 2000 prisoners in the battle. 

The Philadelphia Press, just received, charges the government 
at Washington with circulating false reports, and is now convinced 
Hooker met with a most crushing defeat. 

It is rumored the enemy are disembarking troops at the White 
House, York River. If this be so, it is to prevent reinforcements 
being sent to Lee. 



324 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

The Governor of Alabama declares that Mobile is neglected, 
and says he will continue to protest against the failure of the gov- 
ernment to make adequate preparations for the defense of the city. 

I saw Gen. Wise to-day. He seems weather-beaten, but hardy. 

MAY 14in. We have been beaten in an engagement near 
Jackson, Miss., 4000 retiring before 10,000. This is a dark cloud 
over the hopes of patriots, for Vicksburg is seriously endangered. 
Its fall would be the worst blow we have yet received. 

Papers from New York and Philadelphia assert most positively, 
and with circumstantiality, that Hooker recrossed the Rappahan- 
nock since the battle, and is driving Lee toward Richmond, with 
which bis communications have been interrupted. But this is not 
all : they say Gen. Keyes marched a column up the Peninsula, 
and took Richmond itself, over the Capitol of which the Union 
flag "is now flying." These groundless statements will go out to 
Europe, and may possibly delay our recognition. If so, what may 
be the consequences when the falsehood is exposed ? I doubt the 
policy of any species of dishonesty. 

Gov. Shorter, of Alabama, demands the officers of Forrest's cap- 
tives for State trial, as they incited the slaves to insurrection. 

Mr. S. D. Allen writes from Alexandria, La., that the people 
despair of defending the Mississippi Valley with such men as Pem- 
berton and other hybrid Yankees in command. He denounces 
the action also of quartermasters and commissaries in the South- 
west. 

A letter from Hon. W. Porcher Miles to the Secretary of War 
gives an extract from a communication written him by Gen. Beau- 
regard, to the effect that Charleston must at last fall into the 
hands of the enemy, if an order which has been sent there, for 
nearly all his troops to proceed to Vicksburg, be not revoked. 
There are to be left for the defense of Charleston only 1500 ex- 
clusive of the garrisons I 

MAY 15TH. The Tredegar Iron Works and Crenshou's woolen 
factory were mostly destroyed by fire last night! This is a 
calamity. 

We have also intelligence of the occupation of Jackson, Miss., 
by the enemy. Thus they cut off communication with Vicksburg, 
and that city may be doomed to fall at last. The President is at 
work again at the Executive Office, but is not fully himself yet. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 325 

The Secretary of War dispatched Gen. Lee a day or two ago, de- 
siring that a portion of his army, Pickett's division, might be sent 
to Mississippi. Gen. Lee responds that it is a dangerous and 
doubtful expedient ; it is a question between Virginia and Mis- 
sissippi; he will send the division off without delay, if still 
deemed necessary. The President, in sending this response to 
the Secretary, says it is just such an answer as he expected from 
Lee, and he approves it. Virginia will not be abandoned. 

Gens. Lee, Stuart, and French were all at the War Department 
to-day. Lee looked thinner, and a little pale. Subsequently he 
and the Secretary of War were long closeted with the President. 

Gen. Schenck (Federal) has notified Gen. W. E. Jones, that 
our men taken dressed in Federal uniform will not be treated as 
prisoners of war, but will be tried and punished as spies, etc. The 
President directed the Secretary of War to-day to require Gen. 
Lee to send an order to the commander of the Federal army, that 
accouterments and clothing will be deemed subjects of capture, 
and if our men are treated differently than prisoners of war, when 
taken, we will retaliate on the prisoners in our possession. 

Gen. Longstreet censured Gen. French for his conduct before 
Suffolk, and the Secretary of War proposed that French be re- 
lieved, and sent before a court of Inquiry. The President vetoed 
this, saying such courts were nuisances, and would not have him 
molested at this critical moment. 

Gen. D. H. Hill writes that desertions in North Carolina are 
alarmingly frequent; that deserters wilt soon be in arms; that 
papers and factions exist there in favor of reconstruction, laboring 
to convince the people that the State has been neglected by the 
Confederate States Government, and he suggests summary pun- 
ishments. The President directs the Secretary to correspond with 
Gov. Vance on the subject. 

Mr. Benjamin has had some pretty passports printed. He 
sends one to Assistant Secretary Campbell for a Mr. Bloodgood 
and son to leave the Confederate States. I hope there is no bad 
blood in this incessant intercourse with persons in the enemy's 
country. Just at this crisis, if so disposed, any one going thither 
might inflict incalculable injury on the cause of Southern inde- 
pendence. 

MAY 16TH. It appears, after the consultation of the generals 

28 



826 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

and the President yesterday, it was resolved not to send Pickett's 
division to Mississippi, and this morning early the long column 
march through the city northward. Gen. Lee is now stronger 
than he was before the battle. Gen. Pickett himself, with his long, 
black ringlets, accompanied his division, his troops looking like 
fighting veterans, as they are. And two fine regiments of cavalry, 
the 2d and 59th North Carolina Regiments, passed through the 
city this morning likewise. 

A letter was received from Gen. Beauregard to-day, again pro- 
testing against the movement of so many of his troops to Missis- 
sippi ; 5000 on the 5th, and more than 5000 on the 10th instant. 
He makes an exhibit of the forces remaining in South Carolina 
and Georgia about 4000 infantry, 5000 cavalry, and 6000 artil- 
lery, some 15,000 in all. He says the enemy is still on the coast, in 
the rivers, and on the islands, and may easily cut his communica- 
tions with Savannah ; and they have sufficient numbers to take 
Charleston, in all probability, without passing the forts. He says 
information of his weakness is sure to be communicated to the 
enemy and I think so too, judging from the number of pass- 
ports "allowed" by Judge Campbell and Mr. Benjamin ! 

There is some purpose on the part of Gen'. Lee to have a raid 
in the enemy's country, surpassing all other raids. If -he can 
organize two columns of cavalry, 5000 each, to move in parallel 
lines, they may penetrate to the Hudson River; and then the 
North will discover that it has more to lose by such expeditions 
than the South. Philadelphia, even, may be taken. 

To-day, the regular train on the Fredericksburg road came 
back to the city, the conductor being in a terrible fright, and 
reporting that the enemy were again at Ashland. But it turned 
out that the troops there were our men ! It is not probable the 
enemy's cavalry will soon approach Richmond again. 

MAY 17TH. The last few days have been cool and dry ; fine 
weather for campaigning. And yet we hear of no demonstrations 
apparently, though I believe Lee's army is moving. 

Mr. Lamar, of Savannah (formerly president of the Bank of the 
Republic, New York), writes that he and others are organizing 
an Exporting and Importing Company, and desires the govern- 
ment to take an interest in it. So far the heads of bureaus de- 
cline, and of course the Secretary will do nothing. But the 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 32f 

Secretary has already engaged with Mr. Crenshaw in a similar 
enterprise, and so informed Mr. Mason, at London. 

About 10 A.M., some 2500 men of all arms arrived at "doable 
quick," having left Ashland, eighteen miles distant, at 5 o'clock 
this morning. That was brisk marching. The guns were sent 
down on the railroad. The government has information that Gen. 
Keyes, with a full division of infantry and a brigade of cavalry, had - 
marched up to West Point, to threaten Richmond. The troops, 
however, which arrived from Ashland, had been taken from the 
batteries here, and did not belong to Gen. Lee's army. 

Messrs. Davenport & Co., Mobile, charge Gen. Buckner ^eith 
permitting 1000 bales of cotton to be shipped to New Orleans. 

The president of the Fredericksburg Road states, in a letter to 
the Secretary, that, after the battle, by military authority, the cars 
were appropriated by the Federal officers (prisoners), while our 
wounded soldiers had to remain and await the return of the 
trains. 

Hon. Mr. Dargin. of Alabama, writes to the Secretary, to pro- 
cure from the President a disavowal of the "organship" of the 
Enquirer, as that paper, under the belief that it speaks for the 
government, is likely to inflict much mischief on the country. He 
alluded to the bitter articles against the Democrats and peace men 
of the North, who would soon have been able to embarrass, if not 
to check the operations of the Republican war party. He says 
now, that they will write against us, and deal destruction wherever 
they penetrate the land. 

MAY 19rn. A dispatch from Gen. Johnston says a battle has 
been fought between Peinberton and Grant, between Jackson and 
Yicksburg, Mississippi, which lasted nine hours. Pemberton was 
forced back. This is all we know yet. 

Another letter, from Hon. W. Porcher Miles, remonstrating 
against the withdrawal of Beauregard's troops, was received to- 
day. He apprehends the worst consequences. 

The government is buying 5000 bales of cotton for the Cren- 
shaw scheme. Jas. R. Crenshaw, of this city, is at Charleston on 
this business. Why not arrange with Lamar? 

Gov. Shorter forwards another strongly written memorial from 
Mobile, against the traffic of cotton with the enemy, and, indeed, " 
against all blockade-running. 



328 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

Gov. Jno. Milton, of Florida, also writes a powerful denuncia- 
tion of the illicit traffic, which it seems the policy of the govern- 
ment has been to encourage. They all say this traffic is doing 
the work of subjugation more effectually than the arms of the 
enemy. 

The President is too ill again to come to the Executive Office. 
His messenger, who brought ine some papers this morning, says 
he is in a " decline." I think he has been ill every day for several 
years, but this has been his most serious attack. No doubt he is 
also worried at the dark aspects in his own State Mississippi. 

If Yicksburg falls, and the Valley be held by the enemy, then 
the Confederacy will be curtailed of half its dimensions. Texas, 
Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Missouri, Arizona, New Mexico, 
all the Indian country, Kentucky, half of Tennessee, one-third of 
Virginia, Eastern North Carolina, and sundry islands, etc. of 
South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, will be wrested from us. 
What will remain of the Confederacy ? Two-thirds of Virginia, 
half of Tennessee, the greater part of North Carolina, South Car- 
olina, Georgia, and the whole of Alabama, less than six States ! 
But still the war will go on, as long as we have brave armies and 
great generals, whether the President lives or dies. 

MAY 20th. Reports from the West say we lost 3000 and the 
enemy GOOO men in the battle of the 15th inst., when Pemberton 
fell back over the Black River. Our forces numbered only 12,000, 
Grant's three times that number. Something decisive must occur 
before Vicksburg in a few days. 

Mr. J. W. Henry writes from New's Ferry, that parties of cav- 
alry, going about the country, professing to belong to our Gen. 
Stuart's corps, are probably Yankee spies making observations 
preparatory for another raid. The city councils are organizing 
the citizens for local defense, thinking it probable another dash may 
be made. 

Gen. Dix threatens to hang the citizens of Williamsburg if they 
co-operate with Gen. Wise in his frequent attacks on the Federals. 
Gen. Wise replies, threatening to hang Gen. Dix if he carries his 
threat into execution, and should fall into his hands, in a more 
summary manner than John Brown was hung for making his raid 
in Virginia. 

Butter is worth $4 per pound. A sheep is worth $50. A cow 
$500. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 329 

MAY 21sT. There was a rumor on the street last night that Gen. 
Johnston had telegraphed the President that it would be necessary 
to evacuate Vicksburg. This has not been confirmed to-day, and 
I do not believe it. It would be irremediably disastrous. 

Mr. ]S T . S. Walker writes from Bermuda, May llth, 1863, that 
seventeen additional British regiments have been ordered to Canada. 
A large amount of ordnance and ordnance stores, as well as sev- 
eral war steamers, have likewise been sent thither. He states, 
moreover, that United States vessels are having their registers 
changed. Does this really mean war? 

Strawberries were selling in market this morning at $4 for less 
than a pint. Coal $25 per load, and wood $30 per cord. 

MAY 22D. A letter from Gen. Howell Cobb, declining the 
offer of the Secretary of War, of the position of Quartermaster- 
General, was received to-day. His wife is ill, and he prefers to 
remain with her; besides, he doubts his qualifications he, who w^,s 
Secretary of the Treasury of the United States ! He says, more- 
over, referring to the imperfect ordnance stores of his brigade, 
that there can be no remedy for this so long as Col. G. is the Chief 
of the Bureau of Ordnance. So Col. Myers is to be disposed of 
at last, and Col. G. has but an uncertain tenure. 

We have sad rumors from Yicksburg. Pemberton, it is said, 
was flanked by Grant, and lost 30 guns, which he abandoned in his 
retreat. Where Johnston is, is not stated. But, it is said, Vicks- 
burg is closely invested, and that the invaders are closing in on all 
sides. There is much gloom and despondency in the city among 
those who credit these unofficial reports. It would be a terrible 
blow, but not necessarily a fatal one, for the war could be pro- 
longed indefinitely. 

I met with Robt. Tyler to-day, who offers to wager something 
that Gen. Stuart will be in Philadelphia in a fortnight, and he 
said there was a proposition to stop the publication of newspapers, 
if the President would agree to it, as they gave information to 
the enemy, and at such a time as this did no good whatever. He 
thinks they are on the eve of revolution in the North, and referred 
to Gov. Seymour's letter, read at a public meeting in New York. 

MAY 23D. The reports from Mississippi have not been con- 
firmed by official dispatches, and it is understood that the Presi- 
dent remarked yesterday, at dinner, that he was satisfied with the 

28* 



330 A REBEL WAK CLERK'S DIARY 

condition of affairs in that State. If this be so, Vicksburg must 
not only be still in our possession, but likely to be held by us at 
the end of this campaign. The President, I know, feels a peculiar 
interest in that State, and I learn by a letter from Tennessee, that 
on the 9th inst. troops left McMinnville for the rescue of Vicks- 
burg a Texas brigade. 

Cavalry continue to pass through this city from the south, while 
infantry are passing to the south. These movements will puzzle 
the spies, who are daily, and without difficulty, obtaining passports 
to leave the Confederate States. 

We have Northern papers to-day, containing Gen. Hooker's 
grandiloquent address to his army, a few days after his flight. I 
preserve it here for the inspection of the future generation, and to 
deter other generals from the bad policy of publishing false state- 
ments.

"HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THK POTOMAC, 

"May 6th, 1863. 
" GENERAL ORDERS No 49. 

"The Major-General commanding tenders to this army his con- 
gratulations on its achievements of the last seven days. If it has 
not accomplished all that was expected, the reasons are well known 
to the army. It is sufficient to say they were of a character not 
to be foreseen or prevented by human sagacity or resources. In 
withdrawing from the south bank of the Rappahannock, before 
delivering a general battle to our adversaries, the army has given 
renewed evidence of its confidence in itself, and its fidelity to the 
principles it represents. 

"In fighting at a disadvantage we would have been recreant to 
our trust, to ourselves, our cause, and our country. Profoundly 
loyal and conscious of its strength, the Army of the Potomac will 
give or decline battle whenever its interest or honor may demand. 
It will also be the guardian of its own history and its own honor. 
By our celerity and secrecy of movement our advance and passage 
of the rivers were undisputed, and on our withdrawal not a rebel 
returned to follow. The events of the last week may swell with 
pride the hearts of every officer and soldier of this army. We 
have added new laurels to its former renown. We have made long 
marches, crossed rivers, surprised the enemy in his intrenchments, 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 331 

and whenever we have fought we have inflicted heavier blows than 
we have received. 

" We have taken from the enemy five thousand prisoners and 
fifteen colors, captured and brought off seven pieces of artillery, 
and placed hors du combat eighteen thousand of his chosen troops. 
We have destroyed his depots filled with vast amounts of stores, 
damaged his communications, captured prisoners within the forti- 
fications of his capital, and filled his country with fear and conster- 
nation. We have no other regret than that caused by the death 
of our brave companions ; and in this we are consoled by the con- 
viction that they have fallen in the holiest cause ever submitted to 
the arbitrament of battle. 

"By command of 
" (Signed) MAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER. 

"S. WILLIAMS, A.A.G." 

To-day we have another official report from the Chief of Ord- 
nance of the fruits of our victory, as far as they have been gath- 
ered, though the whole field has not been carefully gleaned, which 
I append as a commentary on the statements of Hooker. 

Five twelve-pounder Napoleons; 7 three-inch rifled guns; 1 
Parrott gun, ten-pounder; 9 caissons; 4 rear parts of caissons; 
3 battery wagons; 2 forges; 1500 rounds artillery ammunition; 
large lot of artillery harness; large lot of wheels, axles, ammu- 
nition chests, etc.; 16,500 muskets and rifles; 4000 cap pouches ; 
1 1,500 haversacks, and 300,000 rounds infantry ammunition. The 
report says thousand of our soldiers helped themselves on the 
field to better arms, etc., which cannot be computed. 

Now for the prisoners. To-day the last lot taken by Hooker 
arrived by flag of truce boat, making in all just 2700. We have 
already sent off 7000 prisoners taken from him, and 1000 are yet 
to go. Our killed, wounded, and missing amount to but little 
over 8000. Hooker's killed and wounded are admitted by the 
Northern papers to be 20,000, and some say his entire loss was 
fully 40,000. So much for his march over the Rappahannock and 
his flight back again. If he is not satisfied, Lee will try him 
again. 

MAY 24TH, SUNDAY. We have had a fortnight of calm, dry, 
and warm weather. There is a hazy atmosphere, and the sun rises 



332 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

and sets wearing a blood-red aspect. At night the moon, dimly 
aud indistinctly seen (now a crescent), has a somber and baleful 
appearance. This is strange at this season of the year ; it is like 
Indian summer in May. The ground is dry and crusted, and ap- 
prehensions are felt for the crops, unless we have rain in a few 
days. My poor little garden has suffered for moisture, but the 
area is so small I am enabled to throw water over it in the even- 
ing. My beets, tomatoes, early potatoes, and lettuce look pretty 
well, though not so far advanced, in consequence of the late spring, 
as I have seen them in Burlington. But they are a great comfort 
to me. I work them, water them, and look at them, and this is 
what the French would call a distraction. I have abundance of 
roses, this is the city of roses. And my cherries are coming on 
finely, I know not yet what kind they are ; but it relieves the eye 
to gaze on them. And then my neighbor has a pigeon-house, and 
the birds come into my yard and are fed by my daughters, being 
pretty and tame. I sit for hours watching them. 

Alas i this cruel war ! But independence will be ample compen- 
sation. Our posterity will thank us for our sacrifices and suffer- 
ings. Yet all do not suffer. The Gil Biases, by their servility and 
cringing to their patrons, the great men in power, and only great 
because they have patronage to bestow, which is power, are getting 
rich. Even adroit clerks are becoming wealthy. They procure 
exemptions, discharges, and contracts for the speculators for heavy 
bribes, and invest the - money immediately in real estate, having 
some doubts as to its ultimate redemption, and possibly indifferent 
as to the fate of the country, so that their own prosperity be 
secure. After the war the rascals and traitors will be rich, and 
ought to be marked and exposed. 

MAY 25xH. Dispatches from the West inform us that three at- 
tempts to carry the city of Vicksburg by assault have been re- 
pulsed with heavy loss. Johnston is on the enemy's flank and 
rear, engendering a new army with rapidity, and if the garrison 
can hold out a little while, the city may be safe. 

Gens. Ewell and A. P. Hill have been made lieutenant-generals, 
and will command Jackson's corps. It appears that the Senate 
has not yet confirmed Hardee, Holmes, and Pembertou. 

The Washington correspondent of the New York Commercial 
Advertiser says Hooker's loss in killed and wounded amounted to 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 333 

" over 23,000 men, and he left 24 guns on the other side of the 
Rappahannock." We got 8000 prisoners, which will make the loss 
31,000 men, and it is said the stragglers, not yet collected, amount 
to 10,000 men ! Only 13 guns fell into our hands, the rest fell 
into the river ! 

MAY 26TH. Reliable information of hard fighting at Vicks- 
burg ; but still, so far as we know, the garrison of the invested 
city has repulsed every assault made upon it. The enemy's losses 
are said to be very heavy. Something decisive must occur there 
soon, and I hope something calamitous to the enemy. 

The President and the cabinet have been in council nearly all 
day. Can they have intelligence from the West, not yet commu- 
nicated to the public ? 

We learn from Newbern, N. C., that gray-haired old men, 
women, and children, who refused to take the oath of allegiance, 
have been driven from their homes, on foot, despoiled of their 
property. Among these I see the %ames of the Misses Custis, 
cousins of my wife. Gen. Daniels, commanding our forces at 
Kinston, sent out wagons and ambulances to convey them within 
our lines. They were on foot. 

MAY 27TH. Gen. Beauregard's statement of the number of his 
troops, after 10,000 had been ordered to Mississippi, with urgent 
appeals for the order to be countermanded, came back from the 
President to-day, to whom it had been referred by Mr. Secretary 
Seddon. The President indorsed, characteristically, that the 
statement did not agree in numbers with a previous one, and 
asked the Secretary to note the discrepancy ! This was all. 

The president of the Seaboard Railroad requests the Secretary 
to forbid the common use of the bridge over the Roanoke at 
Weldon, the tracks being planked, to be used in case of a hasty 
retreat; the loss might be great, if it were rendered useless. It 
is itGO feet long, and 60 feet high. 

Mr. John Minor Botts is here in difficulty, a negro being de- 
tected bearing a letter from him to the enemy's camp. The letter 
asked if no order had come from Washington, concerning the res- 
toration of his slaves taken away (he lives on the Rappahannock) 
by Hooker's men ; and stating that it was hard for him to be in- 
sulted and imprisoned by the Confederate States and deprived of 
his property by the United States he a neutral. Gen. F. Lee 



334 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

thotfght he ought not to be permitted to remain in proximity to 
the enemy, and so sent him on to Richmond. He was to see the 
Secretary to-day. 

Hon. D. M. Lewis, Sparta, Ga., writes that he will cut his 
wheat on the 28th (to-morrow), and both for quality and quantity 
he never saw it equaled. They have new flour in Alabama; and 
everywhere South the crops are unprecedented in amount. 

To-morrow is election day. For Congress, Col. Wickham, who 
voted against secession, opposes Mr. Lyons. But he has fought 
since ! 

We have a letter from Gen. Jos. E. Johnston, dated at Calhoun, 
Miss., 16th inst. He says the enemy on the railroad at Clinton 
numbered 25,000. We got our baggage out of Jackson before it 
was abandoned. Pemberton marched to Edward's Station with 
17,000 men. Gen. Johnston himself had 7500, and some 15,000 
more were on the way to him. We had 3000 at Port Hudson 
being over 40,000 which he*meant to concentrate immediately. I 
think Yicksburg ought to be safe. 

Our government has been notified that, if we execute the two 
officers (selected by lot) in retaliation for the execution of two of 
our officers in Kentucky, two men will be shot or hung by the 
enemy. Thus the war will be still more terrible ! 

Vallandigham has been sent to Shellbyville, within our lines. 
I think our people ought to give him a friendly greeting. 

MAY 28TH. There is some animation at the polls, this being 
election day. It is said Mr. Wickham, who for a long time, in the 
Convention, voted against the secession of Virginia, is leading Mr. 
Lyons, an original secessionist, and will probably beat him. And 
Flournoy, an old Whig politician, will probably be elected governor. 

A dispatch from Gen. Johnston, dated yesterday, says in every 
fight, so far, around Yicksburg, our forces have been successful, 
and that our soldiers are in fine spirits. 

Papers from the North have, in great headings, the word VIC- 
TORS, and announce that the Stars and Stripes are floating over 
the City of Vicksburg ! They likewise said their flag was floating 
over the Capitol in this city. If Vicksburg falls, it will be a sad 
day for us; if.it does not fall, it will be a sad day for the war 
party of the United States. It may be decisive, one way or the 
other. If we beat them, we may have peace. If they beat us 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 335 

although the war will not and cannot terminate it may degener- 
ate into a guerrilla warfare, relentless and terrible ! 

MAY 29TH. A dispatch from Gen. Johnston, dated 27th inst., 
says fighting at Yicksburg had been in progress ever since the 
] 9th instant, and that our troops have been invariably successful 
in repulsing the assults. Other dispatches say the unburied dead 
of the enemy, lying in heaps near our fortifications, have produced 
such an intolerable stench that our men are burning barrels of tar 
without their works. 

But still all is indefinite. Yet, from the persistent assaults of the 
enemy it may be inferred tha{ Grant is inspired with the conviction 
that it is necessary for him to capture Vicksburg immediately, and 
before Johnston collects an army in his rear. A few days may 
produce a decisive result. 

Hon. E. S. Dargan, Mobile, Ala., writes that it is indispensable 
for our government to stipulate for aid from Europe at the earliest 
moment practicable, even if we must agree to the gradual emanci- 
pation of the slaves. He says the enemy will soon overrun the 
Southwestern States and prevent communication with the East, 
and then these States (Eastern) cannot long resist the superior 
numbers of the invaders. Better (he thinks, I suppose) yield 
slavery, and even be under the protection of a foreign government, 
than succumb to the United States. 

The enemy, wherever they have possession in the South, have 
adopted the policy of sending away (into the Confederate States) 
all the inhabitants who refuse to take the oath of allegiance. This 
enables them to appropriate their property, and, being destitute, 
the wanderers will aid in the consumption of the stores of the 
Confederates. A Mr. W. E. Beuthuisen, merchant, sent from New 
Orleans, telegraphs the President for passports for himself and 
family to proceed to Richmond. The President intimates to the 
Secretary of War that many similar cases may be looked for, and 
he thinks it would be better for the families to be dispersed in the 
country than congregated in the city. 

The following are the wholesale prices to-day:

MAY 30TH. The newspapers have a dispatch, to-day, from 
Jackson, Miss., which says the enemy have fallen back from the 
position lately occupied by them in front of Yicksburg, -It adds, 
that they will be forced to retire to the Big Black River, for want of 
water. Gen. G. A. Smith, who is here, and who resigned because 
he was not made lieutenant-general instead of Pemberton, says he 
"don't know how to read this dispatch." Nevertheless, it is gen- 
erally believed, and affords much relief to those who appreciate the 
importance of Vicksburg. 

Mr. Botts was offered $500 in Confederate States notes, the other 
day, for a horse. He said he would sell him for $250 in gold, but 
would not receive Confederate notes, as the South would certainly 
be conquered, and it was merely a question of time. This inform- 
ation was communicated to the Secretary of War to-day, but he 
will attach no importance to it. 

Among the papers sent in by the President, to-day, was a com- 
munication from Gov. Vance, of North Carolina, inclosing a letter 
from Augustus S. Montgomery, of Washington City, to Major- 
Gen. Foster, Newbern, N. C., found in a steamer, captured the 
other day by our forces, in Albemarle and Chesapeake Canal. It 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 337 

informed Gen. F. that a plan of servile insurrection had been 
adopted, and urged his co-operation. All the Yankee generals in 
the South would co-operate : they were to send smart negroes from 
the camps among the slaves, with instructions to rise simultane- 
ously at night on the 1st August. They were to seize and destroy 
all railroad bridges, cut the telegraph wires, etc., and then retire 
into the swamps, concealing themselves until relieved by Federal 
troops. It is said they were to be ordered to shed no blood, ex- 
cept in self-defense, land they were not to destroy more private 
property than should be unavoidable. The writer said the corn 
would be in the roasting-ear, and the hogs would be running at 
large, so that the slaves could easily find subsistence. 

The President thanked Gov. Yance for this information, and said 
our generals would be made acquainted with this-scbeme ; and he 
commended the matter to the special attention of the Secretary of 
War, who sent it to Gen. Lee. 

MAY 31 ST. The commissioners, appointed for the purpose, 
have agreed upon the following schedule of prices for the State of 
Yirginia, under the recent impressment act of Congress ; and if a 
large amount of supplies be furnished at these prices which are 
fifty, sometimes one hundred per cent, lower than the rates private 
individuals are paying it will be good proof that all patriotism 
is not yet extinct : 

" Wheat, white, per bushel of 60 pounds, $4 50 ; flour, superfine, 
per barrel of 196 pounds, $22.50; corn, white, per bushel of 56 
pounds, $4; unshelled corn, white, per bushel of 56 pounds, $3.95 ; 
corn-meal, per bushel of 50 pounds, $4.20 ; rye, per bushel of 56 
pounds, $3.20 ; cleaned oats, per bushel of 32 pounds, $2 ; wheat- 
bran, per bushel of 17 pounds, 50 cents; shorts, per bushel of 22 
pounds, TO cents; brown stuff, per bushel of 28 pounds, 90 cents; 
ship stuff, per bushel of 37 pounds, $1.40; bacon, hoground, per 
pound, $1 ; salt pork, per pound, $1 ; lard, per pound, $1 ; horses, 
first class, artillery, etc., average price per head, $350; wool, per 
pound, $3 ; peas, per bushel of 60 pounds, $4 ; beans, per bushel of 
69 pounds, $4 ; potatoes, Irish, per bushel of 69 pounds, $4; pota- 
toes, sweet, per bushel of 69 pounds, $5 ; onions, per bushel of 
60 pounds, $5 ; dried peaches, peeled, per bushel of 38 pounds, 
$8; dried peaches, unpeeled, per bushel of 38 pounds, $4.50; 
dried apples, peeled, per bushel of 28 pounds, $3."

CHAPTER XXVII. 

> , : 

Vicksburg refuses to surrender to Grant. Spiritualism at the White House. 
Lee is pushing a little northward. It is said Grant has lost 40,000 
men. He is still pounding Vicksburg. Petty military organizations. 
Mr. Randolph busy. Foolish passport rules. Great battle imminent, 
but speculation may defeat both sides. Early's victory. We have only 
supplies of corn from day to day. Chambersburg struck. Col. Whiting 
complains of blockade running at Wilmington. False alarm. Grant still 
before Vicksburg. 

JUNE IST. Nothing decisive from Yicksburg. It is said North- 
ern papers have been received, of the 29th May, stating that their 
Gen. Grant had been killed, and Vicksburg (though at first pre- 
maturely announced) captured. We are not ready to believe the 
latter announcement. 

Mr. Lyons has been beaten for Congress by Mr. Wickhatn. 

It is said the brigade commanded by Gen. Barton, in the battle 
near Vicksburg, broke and ran twice. If that be so, and their 
conduct be imitated by other brigades, good-by to the Mississippi 
Valley ! 

Our people everywhere are alive to the expected raid of the 
enemy's cavalry, and are organizing the men of non-conscript age 
for defense. 

One of our pickets whistled a horse, drinking in the Rappahan- 
nock, and belonging to Hooker's army, over to our side of the 
river. It was a very fine horse, and the Federal Gen. Patrick 
sent a flag demanding him, as he was not captured in battle. Our 
officer sent back word he would do so with pleasure, if the Yan- 
kees would send back the slaves and other property of the South 
not taken in battle. There it ended but we shall probably soon 
have stirring news from that quarter. 

The Baltimore American contains the proceedings of the City 
Council, justifying the arrest of Vallandigham. 

JUNE 2D. We have a dispatch from Mississippi, stating that 
on Thursday last Grant demanded the surrender of Vicksburg in 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 339 

three days. He was answered that fifteen minntes were not asked ; 
that the men were ready to die but would never surrender. This 
was followed by another assault, in which the enemy lost great 
numbers, and were repulsed as they have been in every subse- 
quent attempt to take the town. 

A letter from our agent in London says H. 0. Brewer, of Mo- 
bile, advanced 10,000 in March last, to buy a steamer for the 
use of the Confederate States. 

Gen. Whiting writes from Wilmington, that a captured mail 
furnishes the intelligence that the enemy have thirty-one regiments 
at Newbern, and he apprehends they will cut the railroad at 
Goldsborough, as we have but two small brigades to resist them. 
Then they may march against Wilmington, where he has not now 
sufficient forces to man his batteries. The general says he is quite 
sure that individual blockade-runners inform the enemy of our 
defenseless points, and inflict incalculable injury. He desires the 
Secretary to lay his letter before the President. 

A circular from the Bureau of Conscription to the commandants 
of conscripts says, the Assistant Secretary of War (Judge Camp- 
bell) suggests that overseers and managers on farms be disturbed 
as little as possible just at this time, for the benefit of the crops. 
But what good will the crops do, if we be subjugated in the mean 
time? I thought every man was needed, just at this time, on the 
field of battle. 

The President rides out (on horse) every afternoon, and sits as 
straight as an English king could do four centuries ago. 

JUNE 3D. Gen. Lee communicates to the department to-day 
his views of the Montgomery letter to Gen. Forrest, a copy of 
which was sent him by Governor Vance. He terms it "diaboli- 
cal." It seems to have been an official letter, superscribed by 
" C. Marshall, Major and A. A. G." Gen. Lee suggests that it be 
not published, but that copies be sent to all our generals. 

Hon. R. M. T. Hunter urges the Secretary, in a lengthy letter, 
to send a cavalry brigade into Essex and the adjacent counties, to 
protect the inhabitants from the incursions of the " Yankees." He 
says a government agent has established a commissary depai;t- 
ment within six miles of his house, and it will be sure to be de- 
stroyed if no force be sent there adequate to its defense. He says, 
moreover, if our troops are to operate only in the great armies 



340 A REBEL 'WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

facing the enemy, a few hostile regiments of horse may easily 
devastate the country without molestation. 

Gov. Yance writes a most indignant reply to a letter which, it 
seems, had been addressed to him by the Assistant Secretary of 
"War, Judge Campbell, in which there was an intimation that the 
judicial department of the State government " lent itself" to the 
work of protecting deserters, etc. This the Governor repels as 
untrue, and says the judges shall have his protection. That North 
Carolina has been wronged by calumnious imputations, and many 
in the army and elsewhere made to believe she was not putting 
forth all her energies in the work of independence. He declares 
that North Carolina furnished more than half the killed and 
wounded in the two great battles on the Rappahanuock, in Decem- 
ber and May last. 

By the Northern papers we see the President of the United 
States, his wife, and his cabinet are amusing themselves at the 
White House with Spiritualism. 

JUNE 4TH. To-day we have characteristic unintelligible dis- 
patches from Mississippi. They say, up to third instant, yester- 
day, everything is encouraging; but the Memphis papers say 
Grant's losses have not been so large as was supposed. Then it 
is reported that Grant has retired to Grand Gulf. Yet it is ex- 
pected the town will be stormed in twenty-four hours ! 

When Grant leaves Vicksburg, our generals will pursue, and 
assume the aggressive in more directions than one. Lee has 
some occult object in view, which must soon be manifest. 

Major- Gen. D. H. Hill writes that if the enemy penetrates to the 
railroad, a great many men in North Carolina will welcome them, 
and return to their allegiance to the United States. The general 
wants Ranseur's brigade sent him. He says Mr. Warren, one of 
the governor's council, in a recent speech remarked, if the enemy 
got the railroad, it would be a question whether they should ad- 
here to the Confederate States or to the United States. Does 
the general mean to alarm the authorities here ? 

After a month of dry weather, we have just had a fine rain, 
most refreshing to the poor kitchen vegetables in my little garden, 
which I am cultivating with careful assiduity in hopes of saving 
some dollars in the items of potatoes, tomatoes, beets, etc. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 341 

The crops of wheat, etc. south of Virginia, mature and maturing, 
are perfect in quality and unprecedented in quantity. 

JUNE STH. More unofficial dispatches from the Mississippi. 
It is said Kirby Smith has defeated the enemy at Port Hudson ; 
but how could his army get over the river? It is also stated that 
Grant's losses have been 40, QUO, and ours 5000. Who could 
have computed them? But they go on to say nothing has been 
heard from Vicksburg since Sunday, four days previously; and 
that heavy firing was heard still on Thursday. 

Lee's army is in motion that means something; and it is 
generally believed that Stuart is out on a raid into the enemy's 
country. 

Mr. M. A. Malsby, a Georgian, disabled by a wound in the first 
battle of Manassas, has published one-half of my new " Wild 
Western Scenes;" the balance to appear when he can get paper. 
He publishes 5000 copies of about 130 pages. The paper costs 
nearly one dollar per pound, over $40 per ream. The printing 
costs $2 per 1000 ems. But then he retails the pamphlet at $1.25, 
and pays me 12 cents copyright on each number sold. 

JUNE 6rn. We have not even a rumor to-day from Mississippi. 
The Examiner has made a pretty severe attack on Judge Camp- 
bell, Assistant Secretary of War, for the great number of persons 
he has "allowed" to pass into the enemy's country. It does not 
attribute the best motives to the Judge, who was late coming over 
to the Confederacy. 

The British consul here, it seems, has been meddling with mat- 
ters in Mississippi, the President states, and has had his exequa- 
tur revoked. 

Gen. D. H. Hill recommends the abandonment of the line of 
the Blackwater, for Gen. Martin informs him that the enemy are 
preparing their expeditions to cut our railroads in North Caro- 
lina. Gen. Hill fears if the present line be held we are in danger 
of a great disaster, from the inability to transport troops from so 
remote a point, in the event of a sudden emergency. Gen. Lee 
refuses to let him have Ranseur's brigade. 

There are rumors of picket fighting near Fredericksburg, and 
Davis's (the President's nephew) brigade, just from North Caro- 
lina, proceeded through the city to-day in that direction. Shall 

29* 



342 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

we have another great battle on the Rappahannock ? I think it 
a ruse. 

JUNE 7TH. I saw yesterday a specimen of the President's 
elaborate attention to the matter of appointments. Lieut.-Gen. 
A. P. Hill having asked for a military court to his corps, and 
having recommended the officers, the President, with his own 
hand, laid down the rule of selection for the guidance of the Secre- 
tary, viz.: the State which had the greatest number of regiments 
would be entitled to the choice of positions, to be taken from the 
candidates of its citizens according to qualifications, recommenda- 
tions, etc. It appeared that North Carolina stood first on the list, 
Virginia next, Georgia next, and so on. 

Oh that we could get something decisive from Vicksburg I If 
Grant's and Banks's armies should be destroyed, I think there 
would be some prospect of peace at an early day. For, if Lincoln 
should persist in a prolongation of the war, the probabilities would 
be the expulsion of the enemy from the Mississippi Yalley and the 
recovery of New Orleans. After the fifteenth of this month, opera- 
tions must cease on the Carolina and Georgia coasts Charleston 
and Wilmington being still in our possession. But we should not 
be idle. Lee, in disdaining the sheltered army of the invaders, 
would be likely to invade in turn ; and the public demand of re- 
taliation for the cruelties and destruction of private property per- 
petrated by the enemy could not be resisted. His men would 
probably apply the torch to the towns and cities of the Yankees, 
destroying their crops, farming utensils, etc., as the invaders have 
done in Virginia and elsewhere. 

To avoid these calamities, it is possible Lincoln would make 
peace. Therefore we are so anxious to hear from Vicksburg, the 
turning-point of the war. 

Besides, we shall not please England by our treatment of her 
consuls ; and this may stimulate the United States to concentrate 
its wrath upon its ancient foe. 

JUNE STH. Well, the enemy have thrown another column over 
the Rappahannock, below Fredericksburg. This is probably a 
manoeuvre to arrest Lee's advance in Culpepper County. But it 
won't do Lee's plans cannot be changed and this demonstra- 
tion was in his calculations-. If they think Richmond can be takeu 
now, without Lee's army to defend it, they may find their mistake. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 343 



The clerks and employees in the departments are organizing to 
man the fortifications, should their aid be needed. 

Hon. M. R. H. Garnett writes from Essex County that the 
enemy have had Lawrence Washington, arrested in Westmoreland 
County, confined in a prison-ship in the Potomac, until his 
health gave way. He is now in Washington, on parole not to 
escape. 

About 140,000 bushels of corn have been sent to Lee's army in 
May, which, allowing ten pounds per day to each horse, shows 
that there are over 20,000 horses in this army. But the report 
says not more than 120,000 bushels can be forwarded this 
mouth. 

The press everywhere is opening its batteries on the blockade- 
runners, who bring in nothing essential to the people, and nothing 
necessary for the war. 

The arrivals and departures of steamers amount to one per day, 
and most of the goods imported are of Yankee manufacture. 
Many cargoes (unsold) are now held in Charleston and yet the 
prices do not give way. 

JUNE 9TH. There is rumor that the President has received 
bad news from the West. This may be without foundation ; but 
it is a little strange that we are not in receipt of authentic ac- 
counts of transactions there. Time, however, will reveal all 
things. 

Lee is " marching on," Northward, utterly regardless of the 
demonstrations of Hooker on the Lower Rappahannock. This is 
a good omen; for no doubt the demonstrations are designed 
merely to arrest his advance. Lee has, perhaps, 10,000 fighting 
men with him leaving some 15,000 behind to defend Rich- 
mond. 

The people in the " Northern Neck " have been much harassed 
by the incursions of the invaders. I clip the following account 
from the Whig of this date : 

" Nearly every house was visited, and by deceptive artifices, 
such as disguising themselves in Confederate gray clothes, stolen, 
or otherwise surreptitiously obtained, they imposed themselves 
upon our credulous and unsuspecting people ; excited their sym- 
pathies by pretending to be wounded Confederate soldiers won 
their confidence, and offered to hide their horses and take care of 



344 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

* 

them for them, to prevent the Yankees from taking them, who, 
they said, were coming on. They thus succeeded in making many 
of our people an easy prey to their rapacity and cunning. In this 
foray, they abducted about 1000 negroes, captured from 500 to 
700 horses aud mules, a large number of oxen, carriages, buggies 
and wagons stole meat, destroyed grain, and robbed gentlemen, 
in the public road, of gold watches and other property. There 
are some instances related of personal indignity and violence. 
They returned with their spoils to camp, after a week devoted by 
them in the Northern Neck, among our unhappy people, to the 
highly civilized, brave, and chivalrous exploits of theft, robbery, 
and almost every species of felony committed upon a defenseless, 
unarmed, and helpless population chiefly consisting of women 
and children ! It was an easy achievement a proud conquest 
the more glorious to the noble and heroic Yankee, because 
stained with crime and won without danger to his beastly car- 
cass." 

This is but a fair specimen of their conduct whenever they have 
been permitted to devastate the country with impunity. 

A few days ago I addressed a letter to the Secretary of War, 
suggesting that the department encourage voluntary organiza- 
tions of non-conscripts for local defense, and that they be armed 
with every superfluous musket that the government may possess. 
If this be done, the army will not be so much embarrassed by 
vehement calls to protect the people from raids everywhere ; and 
in the event of serious disaster, the people would still make resist- 
ance. But an unarmed people would have no alternative but 
submission. This plan would also effectually prevent servile in- 
surrections, etc. 

To-day I received the reply, saying it would be done. But will 
the arms be distributed among them ? 

.JUNE IOTH. We have news of a fight on the Rappahannock 
yesterday, above Fredericksburg, the enemy having crossed again. 
They were driven back. 

There are also reports from Yicksburg, which still holds out. 
Accounts say that Grant has lost 40,000 men so far. Where 
Johnston is, we have no knowledge ; but in one of his recent let- 
ters he intimated that the fall of Yicksburg was a matter of 
time. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 345 

JUNE HTH. It appears that the enemy design to attack us. 
The following is Lee's dispatch : 

"CuLPEPPEB, June 9th, 18G3. 
" To GENERAL S. COOPER. 

" The enemy crossed the Rappahannock this morning at five 
o'clock A.M., at the various fords from Beverly to Kelly's, with a 
large force of cavalry, accompanied by infantry and artillery. 
After a severe contest till five P.M., Gen. Stuart drove them across 
the river. R. E. LEE." 

We have not received the details of this combat, further than 
that it was a surprise, not creditable to our officers in command, by 
which a portion of ten regiments and 600 horses were taken by 
the enemy. We lost, killed, also a number of cavalry colonels. 
Wt, too, captured several hundred prisoners, which have arrived 
in the city. Of the killed and wounded, I have yet obtained no 
information but it is supposed several hundred fell on both 
sides. 

Still I do not think it probable this affair, coupled with the fact 
that the enemy have effected a lodgment on this side of the Rap- 
pahannock below Fredericksburg, and are still crossing, will frus- 
trate any plan conceived by Lee to invade their country. If, 
however, Lincoln concentrates all his forces in the East for an- 
other attempt to capture Richmond, and should bring 300,000 
men against us we shall have near 200,000 to oppose them. 

The Northern Democratic papers are filled with the proceed- 
ings of indignation meetings, denouncing the Republican Admin- 
istration and advocating peace. 

JUNE 12TH. A beautiful, bright warm summer day and yet 
a little somber. 

The surprise of Stuart, on the Rappahannock, has chilled every 
heart, notwithstanding it does not appear that we lost more than 
the enemy in the encounter. The question is on every tongue 
have our generals relaxed in vigilance ? If so, sad is the pros- 
pect ! 

But Yicksburg is the point of intensest interest and anxieties. 
Gen. Johnston writes from Canton, Mississippi, on the 5th inst., 
in reply to the Secretary, that he regrets such confidence is reposed 
in his ability to save Vicksburg, and fears that such expectations 



346 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

will be disappointed. Grant is receiving reinforcements daily- 
while he (Johnston) is not to have more troops. He does not 
state the number he has, but he says it seems to him that the 
relief of Vicksburg is impossible. Pemberton will hold out as long 
as he can ; but if Grant's line be not broken, the fall of Vicksburg 
is only a question of time. Grant's force (he continues) is more 
than treble his ; and Grant has constructed lines of circumvalla- 
tion, and blocked up all the roads leading to his position. To 
force his lines would be difficult with an army twice as numerous 
as the one he (Johnston) commands. He will try to do something 
in aid of the besieged but it seems a desperate case. He has not 
wagons and provisions enough to leave the railroads more than 
four days. The track to Yicksburg is destroyed. It was his in-- 
tention at first to unite all the troops in his command but it was 
impracticable. So much for these lugubrious tidings. Nothing 
but a miracle can save Vicksburg ! 

The Governors of Alabama and Mississippi unite in urging the 
government to suppress both the foreign and border traffic. I fear 
it is too late ! 

There is a street rumor that the enemy have appeared on the 
Chickahominy, and on the James River. If this be so, it may be 
to embarrass Lee ; or it may be a determined and desperate as- 
sault on this city. We shall know very soon. But never before 
were we in such doubt as to the designs of the enemy ; and never 
before have they evinced such apparent vigor and intrepidity. 
Yet, they know not what Lee is doing to call them home. 

JUNE 13iH. Col. Baylor, of Arizona, has been heard from 
again. He confesses that he issued the order to slaughter the 
Apaches in cold blood, and says it is the only mode of dealing 
with such savages. The President indorses on it that it is " a con- 
fession of an infamous crime." 

Yesterday the enemy appeared on the Peninsula, in what num- 
bers we know not yet; but just when Gen. Wise was about to 
attack, with every prospect of success, an order was received from 
Gen. Arnold Elzey to fall back toward the city, pickets and all. 

A letter from Gen. Holmes, containing an account from one of 
his scouts, shows that the enemy's militia in Arkansas and Mis- 
souri are putting to death all the men, young or old, having 
favored the Confederate cause, who fall into their hands. These 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 347 

acts are perpetrated by order of Gen. Prentiss. The President 
suggests that they be published, both at home and abroad. 

Mr. L. Heyliger, our agent at Nassau, sends an account of the 
firing into and disabling the British steamer Margaret and Jessee 
by the United States steamer Rhode Island, within a half mile of 
shore. Several British subjects were wounded. This may make 
trouble. 

Mr. J. S. Lemmon applied by letter to-day for permission to 
leave a Confederate port for Europe. Major-Gen. Arnold Elzey 
indorsed on it : " This young man, being a native of Maryland, is 
not liable to military service in the Confederate States." Well, 
Arnold Elzey is also a native of Maryland. 

JUNE 14TH. W 11, one of the Winder detectives that fled to 

Washington last year, is back again. But the Mayor has arrested 
him as a spy, and it is said a lady in the city can prove his guilt. 
Gen. Winder wanted to bail him ; but the Mayor was inexorable, 

and so W 11 is in the jail, awaiting his trial. Two others, of 

Winder's police, have likewise been arrested by the city authorities 
for some harsh treatment of a citizen supposed to have a barrel of 
whisky in his house. The justification offered is the jurisdiction 
of martial law, which Gen. Winder still thinks exists, although 
annulled by Congress. 

The company (of 104) organized in the War Department as in- 
dependent volunteers for local defense,, being objected to by Gen. 
Elzey, because they would not be subject to his command, was 
rejected by the President, who insisted that the officers of the de- 
partments (civil) should be mustered into the service under the 
act of August 21st, 1861, and are subject to his control, and liable 
to be attached to battalions, regiments, etc., he appointing the 
field and staff officers. This was communicated to the lieutenant 
of the company by the Secretary of War, who stated also that the 
President required the names of all refusing to reorganize on that 
basis to be reported to him. 

There is an indefinable dread of conspiracy, and the President 
is right, perhaps, to frown upon all military organizations not 
subject to his orders. Mr. Randolph, late Secretary of War, has 
been very busy organizing the second class militia of the city for 
"local defense," under the supposition that he would command 
them ; but the President has made a requisition for 8000 of this 



348 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

class of men, for the same purpose, which will put them under 
Confederate orders, perhaps. A jealousy, I fear, is growing up 
between Confederate and State authority. This when the com- 
mon enemy is thundering at all our gates ! 

JUNE 15TH. The enemy have abandoned the vicinity of Fred- 
ericksburg, falling back across the river, and probably retiring 
toward Alexandria, or else they have taken to their transports, 
and intend making another effort to capture Richmond. It is 
rumored that Gen. Ewell has taken Winchester ; but this, I think, 
is at least premature. 

Certainly the government is taking steps to guard against a 
blow at Richmond. All the civil officers (subordinates, only, of 
course) are being mustered into the service for "local defense or 
special duty;" but Gen. Elzey, -the Mary lander, it is reported, has 

said the "d d clerks have given me so much trouble, that I 

intend to keep them on duty in such a way that they cannot per- 
form their functions in the departments, and so others must be 
appointed ip their places." This would be in violation both of the 
Constitution and several acts of Congress. Yet they are to be 
mustered in this evening " for three years, or the war." And the 
Secretary of the Treasury has announced that all who refuse to 
volunteer are to be reported, by the President's command, and will 
be removed. The President has intimated no such thing. Of 
course they will volunteer. There is much censure of the Presi- 
dent for "bad faith" most of the clerks being refugees, with 
families to support. 

Mayor Mayo has refused to admit Gen. Winder's three police- 
men (all imported) to bail, and they remain in prison ; and Judge 
Meredith has refused to discharge them on a writ of habeas corpus 
resolving first to test the validity of the martial law set up for 
them in their defense. 

I believe the government is acting on my suggestion to Col. 
Johnston, A. D. C., in regard to searching blockade-runners, 
caught in the lines, bearing sealed letters to the North. To-day 
the Attorney- General sent to the department, for Mr. Seddon's 
approval, instructions to Confederate Attorneys and Marshals to 
aid and co-operate with M. Greenwood, a detective agent of the 
government. I think about the first men he detects in treason- 
able practices will be Gen. Elzey and Gen. Winder's detectives. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 349 

Mr. Vallandigham has been nominated for Governor of Ohio. 

The following are the conditions upon which women and chil- 
dren can come to the South, or go to the North, published in 
Washington and Baltimore : 

"First. All applications for passes to go South must be made 
in writing and verified by oath, addressed to Major L. C. Turner, 
Judge Advocate, Washington, D. C., as follows : 

"I, A B , applicant for a pass to go to City Point, 

Virginia, and now residing at , do solemnly swear that, if said 

pass be granted, I will not take a.ny property excepting my wear- 
ing apparel, and that all the articles to be taken with me are con- 
tained in the trunk or package delivered or to be delivered to the 
quartermaster on the transport steamer on which I am to go to 
City Point. That I have not been in any insurgent State, nor 
beyond the military lines of the United States, within thirty days 
last past. That I will not return within the military lines of the 
United States during the present war, and that I have not in my

350 A EEBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

JUNE 16TH. We have nothing from the West to-day. But it 
is believed that Hooker is retiring toward Manassas that fatal 
field where another (and the third) battle may be fought. Lee's 
army is certainly on the march, and a collision of arms cannot be 
averted many days. It is believed Gen. Ewell, successor of Jack- 
son, has beaten Milroy at Winchester. 

But, while terrible events are daily anticipated in the field, all 
the civilians seem to have gone wild with speculation, and official 
corruption runs riot throughout the land. J. M. Seixas, agent 
of the War Department, writes from Wilmington that while the 
government steamers can get no cotton to exchange abroad for 
ordnance stores, the steamers of individuals are laden, and depart 
almost daily. This is said to be partly the work of the " Southern 
Express Company," believed to be Yankees (a portion of them), 
which contracts to deliver freight, and bribes the railroads and 
monopolizes transportation. This is the company on whose ap- 
plication Judge Campbell, Assistant Secretary of War, granted 
so many exemptions and details ! It takes a great number of 
able-bodied men from the army, and then, by a peculiar process, 
absolutely embarrasses, as Gen. Whiting says, the conduct of the 
war. 

Judge Dargan, of Alabama, writes that private blockade-run- 
ners are ruining the country supplying the enemy with cotton, 
and bringing in liquors and useless gew-gaws. 

JUNE llTii. The city has been gladdened by the reception of 
this dispatch from Gen. Lee : 

"JcNE 15th, 1863. 
" His EXCELLENCY, JEFFERSON DAVIS. 

" God has again crowned the valor of our troops with success. 
Early's division stormed the enemy's intrenchments at Winchester, 
capturing their artillery, etc. 

"(Signed) R. E. LEE, General." 

Subsequent reports to the press state that we captured some 
6000 prisoners, Gen. Milroy among them, 50 guns, and a large 
amount of stores. If we caught Milroy, the impression prevails 
that he was hung immediately, in accordance with the President's 
order some time since, as a just punishment for the outrages in- 
flicted by him on our helpless old men, women, and children. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 351 

A sealed envelope came in to-day, addressed by the President 
to the Secretary of War, marked " Highly important and confi- 
dential," which, of course, I sent to the Secretary immediately 
without breaking the seal, as it is my duty to do to all letters not 
private or confidential. I can as yet only conjecture what it re- 
ferred to. It may be of good, and it may be of bad^mport. It 
may relate to affairs in the West ; or it may be a communication 
from abroad, several steamers having just arrived. Can it be from 
the Government at Washington ? I care not what it is, if we hold 
Vicksburg. 

The Commissary-General reports that he has some 8,000,000 
pounds of bacon, and quite as much salt and fresh beef at the various 
depots, besides some 11,000 head of cattle. This is not a large 
amount for such armies as we have in the field ; but in the fall we 
shall have 10 per cent, of all the products in the Confederate 
States as tax in kind. The Commissary-General, however, recom- 
mends the following reduction of rations : for men in garrison or 
batteries, a quarter pound of bacon per day ; in camp, one-third of 
a pound ; and marching, half a pound". 

Mr. -James Spence, our financial agent in England, gives a 
somewhat cheering account of money matters. He recommends 
the shipping of $1,000,000 worth of cotton per week, which ap- 
pears to be practicable. He also advises the shipment of the few 
millions of gold the government holds in this country to England ; 
and Mr. Memminger approves it in boxes weekly, containing 
$t5,000. If this were known, it could hardly be accomplished, for 
such is the distrust of several members of the .cabinet that the 
people would revolt. They would believe the cabinet meant soon 
to follow the gold. And some of our military commanders have 
no better opinion of them than the people. Beauregard once 
stopped some bullion ordered away by Mr. Memminger. 

There is a rumor that Gen. Wise had a combat yesterday on the 
Peninsula. But the operations beyond the Rappahannock, and 
approaching the capital of the United States, must relieve Rich- 
mond of all immediate danger. 

Mr. Lincoln says he is "making history;" forgetful of the ex- 
ecrable figure he is likely to be in it. Our papers to-day contain 
the following : 

" Yankee Cruelty; Forty-three Negroes Drowned. One of 



352 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

the most atrocious incidents of the whole war was yesterday re- 
lated to us by a gentleman of this city, who obtained the facts from 
Capt. Jas. G. White, of King William County, who vouches for 
the accuracy of the statement. Some days ago, when the Yankees 
made their raid to Aylett's, they visited the place of Dr. Gregg, 
living in % neighborhood, and took from their comfortable homes 
forty-three negroes, who were hurried off to York River and placed 
on board a vessel bound Northward. Along with these negroes, 
as a prisoner, was a gentleman named Lee, a resident and highly 
respectable citizen of King William, who has since been released 
and allowed to return to his home. He states that when the ves- 
sel arrived in Chesapeake Bay, the small-pox made its appearance 
among the negroes, that disease having existed to some extent 
among the same family before they were dragged from their homes 
in King William. The captain of the Yankee vessel and his crew 
were greatly alarmed at the appearance of the disease on board, 
and very soon determined to rid the vessel of the presence of the 
negroes. Without attempting to make the shore, and not con- 
sidering for an instant the inhumanity of the cruel deed, the whole 
negro cargo was thrown into the bay, and every one left to perish 
by drowning. Not one, perhaps, escaped the cruel fate visited 
upon them by those who profess to be their earnest friends and 
warmest sympathizers." 

JUNE 18TH. From Winchester we have many accounts, in the 
absence of official reports (Gen. Lee being too busy in the saddle 
to write), which have exalted our spirits most wonderfully. The 
number of prisoners taken, by the lowest estimate is 5000, the 
others say 9000, besides 50 guns, and an immense amount of 
stores. Our own loss in storming the fortifications was only 100 
killed and wounded ! Milroy, they say, escaped by flight but 
may not have gotten off very far, as it seems certain that our one- 
legged Lieut.-Gen. Ewell (fit successor of Jackson) pushed on to 
the Potomac and surrounded, if he has not taken, Harper's Ferry, 
where there is another large depot of supplies. The whole valley 
is doubtless in our possession the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad 
and the way is open into Maryland and Pennsylvania. It is be- 
lieved Hooker's army is utterly demoralized, and that Lee is going 
on. This time, perhaps, no Sharpsburg will embarrass his pro- 
gress, and the long longed-for day of retributive invasion may 
come at last. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 353 

Col. Gorgas, Chief of Ordnance (Northern born), recommends 
that the habit of issuing twenty cartridges extra to each of our 
men be discontinued, and suggests that they be given three cartridges 
per month, and all over that to be issued upon requisition of the 
commanding general, on the eve of battle. But might they not, 
if this were adopted, be liable to be caught sometimes without 
enough ammunition ? He says there is a deficiency of lead. 

There is a rumor that the Secretary of the Navy sent an iron- 
clad out yesterday, at Savannah, to fight two of the enemy's 
blockading squadron, and that after an engagement of thirty 
minutes, our ship struck her colors. If this be so, the people will 
wish that the Secretary had been on the boat that surrendered. 

A man by the name of Jackson a short time since obtained a 
passport through our lines from Judge Campbell, and when a 
negro was rowing him across the Potomac, drew a pistol and 
made him take him to a Federal gun-boat in sight. He was 
heartily received, and gave such information to the enemy as in- 
duced them to engage in a raid on the Northern Neck, resulting 
in the devastation of several counties. These facts I got from the 
President's special detective, Craddock. Craddock also informs 
me that my communication to Col. Johnston was laid before the 
President, who called in the Secretary of State and the Secretary 
of War, to consult on some means of regulating the passport busi- 
ness, etc. He says prompt measures will be adopted immediately. 

Craddock also informs me that a Jew named Cohen, in this city, 
has been co-operating with his brother living in the North, ob- 
taining passports both ways for bribes and bribing the officials 
that granted them, much to our detriment. This, perhaps, has 
alarmed the President; but if the business of selling passports be 
lucrative, I despair of his being able to put an end to it. 

I see the enemy have destroyed the President's house, furniture, 
etc., in Mississippi. 

I have good reason to suppose that the package marked " im- 
portant," etc., sent from the President's office yesterday to the 
Secretary of War, was the substance of a conversation which took 
place between Mr. Ould and Mr. Yallandigham. What Mr. V. 
revealed to Mr. O., perhaps supposing the latter, although em- 
ployed here, friendly to ultimate reconstruction, there is no means 
of conjecturing. But it was deemed " highly important." 

30* 



354 A REBEL WAU CLERK'S DIARY 

JUNE 19TH. Gen. Lee telegraphs from Culpepper Court House 
yesterday, that Gen. Rhodes captured Martinsburg, Sunday, 14th 
inst., taking several guns, over 200 prisoners, and a supply of am- 
munition and grain. Our loss was only one killed and two 
wounded. 

The Secretary of the Navy is in bad odor for ordering out the 
Atlanta at Savannah to fight two Federal steamers, to whom she 
surrendered. 

There is nothing more definite or authentic from Winchester, 
except that we certainly captured Milroy's army of not less than 
5000 men. 

To-day the government issued musket and ball-cartridges (forty 
to each) to the volunteer companies raised in the departments for 
home defense. If this does not signify apprehension of an imme- 
diate attack, it proves at all events that Lee's army is not to be 
around the city as it was a year ago and that signifies his pur- 
pose to advance. 

JUNE 20TH. It has got out that the President intends to dis- 
pense with the services of Mr. Myers, the Jew Quartermaster- Gen- 
eral, and Mr. Miles, member of Congress from South Carolina, who 
happens to be his friend, is characteristically doing the part of a 
friend for his retention. But he gives the President some severe 
raps for alleged contempt of the wishes of Congress, that body 
having passed a bill (vetoed by the President) conferring on Col. 
M. the rank and pay of brigadier-general. 

The operations of Gen. Lee have relieved the depot here, which 
was nearly empty. Since the capture of Winchester and Martins- 
burg, only about 1500 bushels of corn are sent to the army daily, 
whereas 5000 were sent before, and there were rarely more than a 
day's supply on hand. 

To-day, about one o'clock, the city was thrown into a state of joy- 
ful excitement, by the reception of news from the North. From this 
source it was ascertained, what had hitherto been only a matter of 
conjecture, that a portion of our forces, the same that captured 
Winchester and Martinsburg, were in Pennsylvania ! Gen. Jen- 
kins, with his cavalry, had taken Chambersburg on the 16th inst. 
and the North, from the line of Pennsylvania to the lakes, and 
from the seaboard to the western prairies, was stricken with con- 
sternation. These are some of the dispatches, as copied from 
Northern papers : 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 355 

"The Governor of Ohio calls for 30,000 troops. The Governor 
of Pennsylvania calls for 50,000, to prevent the invasion of each 
State. 

" WASHINGTON, June 15th. Lincoln has issued a proclamation 
for 100,000 men/ to repel the invasion of Maryland, Northern 
Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. 

" HARRISBURG, Jane 15th. Dispatches from Chambersburg and 
Hagerstown state that the rebel cavalry are at Berryville and 
Martinsburg. A dispatch dated 14th, says that hard fighting is 
going on. The rebels had driven Reynolds from Berryville, and 
were advancing on the capital. The towns and cities throughout 
Pennsylvania are in danger. 

"LATER. Private dispatches state that on the 16th the rebels 
were at Chambersburg in force. The Federals were removing 
the railroad machinery, stock, and stores. Great excitement and 
alarm pervaded the entire country." 

In the "hard fighting," Gen. Lee reports our loss as "one killed 
and two wounded." Here's the second dispatch : 

" SHELBYVILLE, TENN., June 18th. Nashville papers of the 
11th inst. have been received here. They contain Lincoln's proc- 
lamation, calling for 100,000 militia, for six months' service, and 
the following highly interesting telegrams : 

"LouDON, PA., June 16th. The rebels are in heavy force in the 
Cumberland Valley. 

"BEDFORD, PA., June 16th. Scouts report 6000 rebels at Cum- 
berland, Maryland. The inhabitants are flying for safety from 
Harper's Ferry. 

" HARRISBURQ, June 16th. Business is suspended here. All the 
important documents have been removed from the capital. 

" Milroy telegraphs officially his repulse from the fortifications at 
Winchester by 15,000 rebels, with the loss of 2900 men. 

" Governor Curtin calls upon the people of Pennsylvania to de- 
fend the State, saying that Philadelphia has not responded, while 
the enemy are in Chambersbnrg. He reproaches Pennsylvania 
for sniffling about the length of service when the exigency exists. 

"Dispatches state that everything looks gloomy, and there is no 
saving the country south of the Susquebanna. 

"BALTIMORE, June 16th. Governor Bradford calls on the people 
to rally to the defense of Maryland. 



350 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

" PROVIDENCE, R. I., June 16th. Governor Smith convenes the 
Legislature on Thursday for the purpose of raising troops. 

"PHILADELPHIA, June 16th. The Mayor has issued a procla- 
mation closing the stores in order that the occupants may join mili- 
tary organizations to defend the city. 

"NEW YORK, June 16th. All the regiments are getting ready 
under arms. The Brooklyn bells were rung at midnight, sum- 
moning the men to the regiments, which were to leave immediately 
for Philadelphia. 

"Governor Andrews, of Massachusetts, tenders Lincoln all the 
available force of militia from that State." 

Milroy's statement in relation to the number of prisoners taken 
by us is pretty fair, when compared with Hooker's official state- 
ments on similar occasions. Some of the prisoners will probably 
arrive in Richmond to-day and the Agent of Exchange has been 
notified that TOGO would be sent on. So Gen. Milroy told nearly 
halfihe truth. 

Again : 

THIRD DISPATCH. 

" SHELBYVILLE, June 19th. Other dispatches in the Nashville 
papers say that the rebels advanced six miles beyond Chambers- 
burg. On the 16th Gen. Taylor telegraphs officially his retreat, 
and the capture of the Federal forces at Winchester." 

Later in the day the New York Herald of the 17th inst. was 
received by the flag of truce boat. I now quote from it : 

"Fortifications are being rapidly erected all along the north 
bank of the Susquehanna, and Gen. McClellan or Gen. Franklin 
has been called for to head the State troops. 

REPORTS FROM HARRISBURG. 

"HARRISBURG, PA., June 16th. Midnight. Rebel cavalry to- 
day occupied Littletown, eleven miles from Gettysburg, but at last 
accounts had not advanced beyond that point. 

"The rebel officers at Chambersburg stated that they were only 
waiting for infantry to move forward. The authorities are inclined 
to believe, however, that they will not move farther North. 

" The farmers in the valley are sending their horses and cattle 
into the mountains. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 357 

"The rebels are gathering up all the negroes that can be 
found. 

" Private property has been respected. 

"They burned the railroad bridge across Scotland Creek, six 
miles this side of Chambersburg. 

HARPER'S FERRY INVESTED. 

"BALTIMORE, June 16th. Fugitives from Hagerstown report 
the rebels picketing all the roads and not permitting any one to 
pass. 

"The force that passed through were all cavalry, under Jenkins 
and Imboden, and did not exceed 2500. 

"All was quiet at Frederick up to five o'clock this evening, 
though the people were greatly excited and hundreds were 
leaving. 

"HARRISBURG, June 17th. The aspect of affairs, so far as can 
be judged by the reports from the border, seems to be this : 

"The rebel force occupy Hagerstown and such other points 
as leave them free to operate either against Harrisburg or Bal- 
timore. 

"Apprehensions are entertained by the people of Altoona and 
other points on the line of the Pennsylvania Railroad, that the 
rebels will strike for the West, and then go back to their own soil 
by way of Pittsburg and Wheeling. 

" The fortifications constructed on the hills opposite Harrisburg 
are considered sufficient protection for the city, and an offensive 
movement on our part is not unlikely." 

JUNE 21sT. To-day we have an account of the burning of 
Darien, Ga. The temptation is strong for our army to retaliate 
on the soil of Pennsylvania. 

JUNE 22o. To-day I saw the memorandum of Mr. Ould, of 
the conversation held with Mr. Vallandigham, for file in the ar- 
chives. He says if we can only hold out this year that the peace 
party of the North would sweep the Lincoln dynasty out of polit- 
ical existence. He seems to have thought that our cause was sink- 
ing, and feared we would submit, which would, of course, be ruin- 
ous to his party 1 But he advises strongly against any invasion 
of Pennsylvania, for that would unite all parties at the North, and 
so strengthen Lincoln's hands that he would be able to crush all 



358 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

opposition, and trample upon the constitutional rights of the 

people. 

Mr. V. said nothing to indicate that either he or the party had 
any other idea than that the Union would be reconstructed under 
Democratic rule. The President indorsed, with his own pen, on 
this document, that, in regard to invasion of the North, experience 
proved the contrary of what Mr. V. asserted. But Mr. V. is for 
restoring the Union, amicably, of course, and if it cannot be so 
done, then possibly he is in favor of recognizing our independence. 
He says any reconstruction which is not voluntary on our part, 
would soon be followed by another separation, and a worse war 
than the present one. 

The President received a dispatch to-day from Gen. Johnston, 
stating that Lt.-Gen. Kirby Smith had taken Milliken's Bend. 
This is important, for it interferes with Grant's communications. 

Gov. Shorter writes that a company near Montgomery, Ala., 
have invented a mode of manufacturing cotton and woolen hand- 
cards, themselves making the steel and wire, and in a few weeks 
will be turning out from 800 to 1000 pairs of cards per week. 
This will be a great convenience to the people. 

Gen. Whiting writes that the river at Wilmington is so filled 
with the ships of private blockade-runners that the defense of the 
harbor is interfered with. These steamers are mostly filled with 
Yankee goods, for which they take them cotton, in the teeth of the 
law. He pronounces this business most execrable, as well as in- 
jurious to the cause. He desires the President to see his letter, 
and hopes he may be instructed to seize the steamers and cargoes 
arriving belonging to Yankees and freighted with Yankee goods. 

It is a difficult matter to subsist in this city now. Beef is $1 
and bacon $1.65 per pound, and just at this time there are but few 
vegetables. Old potatoes are gone, and the new have not yet 
come. A single cabbage, merely the leaves, no head, sells for a 
dollar, and this suffices not for a dinner for my family. 

My little garden has produced nothing yet, in consequence of 
the protracted dry weather. But we have, at last, abundant 
rains. To-day I found several long pieces of rusty wire, and these 
I have affixed horizontally to the wood house and to the fence, in- 
tending to lead the lima beans up to them by strings, which I will 
fasten to switches stuck between the plants. My beets will soon 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 359 

be fit to eat, and so will the squashes. But the potatoes do not 
yet afford a cheering prospect. The tomatoes, however, are coming 
on finely, and the cherries are nearly ripe. A lady has sent me 
50 cabbage plants to set out, and two dozen red peppers. Every 
foot of my ground is occupied, and there is enough to afford me 
some exercise every afternoon. 

JUNE 23D. From the army on the Potomac we have a dispatch 
from Lee, saying there have been several cavalry engagements 
during the last week, wherein our arms were successful. Lee will 
soon electrify us with another movement of his grand army, such 
is the general belief. 

From the West we learn that on Saturday last, Grant, no doubt 
driven to desperation by our occupation of Milliken's Bend cut- 
ting off his supplies and reinforcements, made a more furious at- 
tempt than ever to take Vicksburg by assault, and was repulsed 
disastrously. His loss is estimated at between 1000 and 10,000 
men. Pemberton is now greatly praised by many people, while 
some of our officers shake their heads and say he is fighting with 
the halter around his neck, and that if he were not to fight and 
hold out to the last, his own men would hang him.' 

Notwithstanding the immense amount of goods brought in daily, 
the prices keep high. 

JUNE 24TH. We have nothing additional from Vicksburg or 
from the Potomac, but there is a rumor of fighting near Lees- 
burg. 

The first installment of Winchester prisoners reached the city 
yesterday, 1600 in number, and there are over 4000 more on the 
way. So much for Milroy's 2000 or 3000 ! 

To-day the President desired the Secretary of War to send him 
all the correspondence with Gen. Johnston, as he intends to write 
him a confidential letter touching reinforcements, and he wishes to 
inform him of the military situation of affairs everywhere. 

This afternoon some excitement prevails in the city, caused by a 
notification of the Governor placarded at the corner of the streets, 
calling on the citizens to assemble at the Capitol Square at t o'clock 
P.M., and announcing that reliable information has been received 
of the landing of the enemy (how many is not stated) at Bran- 
don, on the James River, and at the White House, on- the York, 
some thirty-five miles below. There was also a meeting of the 



360 A EEBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

clerks of the departments, and it was agreed that at the sounding 
of the tocsin they should assemble (day or night) with arms at 
their respective offices. 

This may be another Pawnee alarm of the government, and it 
may be the wolf. If some 30,000 of the enemy's troops make a 
dash at Richmond now, they may take it. But it will, of course, 
be defended with what means we have, to the last extremity. 

Still, I think it nothing more than a strategical movement to 
save Washington or to embarrass Lee's operations, and it will fail 
to retard his movement. We shall soon see what it is 

JUNE 25iH. The excitement has subsided. No doubt small 
detachments of the enemy were seen at the places indicated, and 
Gen. Elzey (who some say had been drinking) alarmed the Gov- 
ernor with a tale of horror. The reports came through Gen. Win- 
der's detectives, one-half of whom would rather see the enemy 
here than not, and will serve the side that pays most. Yet, we 
should be prepared. 

I saw an indorsement by the President to-day, that foreigners 
should give guarantees of neutrality or be sent out of the city. 

Nothing from Lee. 

JUNE 27iH. An officer of the Signal Corps reported, yesterday, 
the force of Gen. Keyes, on the Peninsula, at 6000. To-day we 
learn that the enemy is in possession of Hanover Junction, cutting 
off communication with both Fredericksburg and Gordonsville. 
A train was coming down the Central Road with another install- 
ment of the Winchester peisoners (some 4000 having already 
arrived, now confined on Belle Island, opposite the city), but was 
stopped in time, and sent back. 

Gen. Elzey had just ordered away a brigade from Hanover 
Junction to Gordonsville, upon which it was alleged another raid 
was projected. What admirable manoeuvring for the benefit of 
the enemy ! . 

Gen. D. H. Hill wrote, yesterday, that we had no troops on the 
Blackwater except cavalry. I hope he will come here and take 
command. 

Gen. Whiting has arrested the Yankee crew of the Arabian, at 
Wilmington. It appears that she is owned by New Yorkers, 
sailed from New York, and has a Yankee cargo ! 

Capt. Maury writes from London that R. J. Walker, once a 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 361 

fire-and-fury Mississippi Senator (but Yankee-born), is in Europe 
trying to borrow 50,000,000 for the United States. Capt. Maury 
says the British Government will not willingly let us have another 
"Alabama;" but that it is also offended at the United States for 
the atrocities of Wilkes, and this may lead to war. The war, 
however, would not be intended as a diversion in our behalf. 

Nothing is heard to-day from Lee, except what appears in 
Northern papers several days old, when our troops were occupy- 
ing Hagerstown, Cumberland, etc., in Maryland, and foraging 
pretty extensively in Pennsylvania. 

Nothing from Vicksburg. 

Just as I apprehended ! The brigade ordered away from Han- 
over to Gordousville, upon a wild-goose chase, had not been gone 
many hours before some 1200 of the enemy's cavalry appeared 
there, and burnt the bridges which the brigade had been guard- 
ing ! This is sottishness, rather than generalship, in our local 
commanders. 

A regiment was sent up when firing was heard (the annihila- 
tion of our weak guard left at the bridges) and arrived just two 
hours too late. The enemy rode back, with a hundred mules they 
had captured, getting under cover of their gun-boats. 

To-day, it is said, Gen. Elzey is relieved, and Gen. Ransom, of 
North Carolina, put in command; also, that Custis Lee (son of 
Gen. R. E. Lee) has superseded Gen. Winder. I hope this has 
been done. Young Lee has certainly been commissioned a briga- 
dier-general. His brother, Brig. -Gen. W. H. F. Lee, wounded in 
a late cavalry fight, was taken yesterday by the enemy at Hanover 
Court House. 

Gen. Whiting's letter about the "Arabian" came back from the 
President, to-day, indorsed that, as Congress did not prohibit 
private blockade-running, he wouldn't interfere. So, this is to be 
the settled policy of the government. 

This morning the President sent a letter to the Secretary of 
War, requesting him to direct all mounted officers some fifty A. 
A. G.'s and A. D.'s to report to him for duty around the city. 
Good ! These gentlemen ought to be in the saddle instead of be- 
ing sheltered from danger in the bureaus. 

3 O'CLOCK P.M. Three proclamations have just been issued 1 
One (a joint one) from the President and the Governor, calling 

31 



362 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

upon everybody to organize themselves into companies, battalions, 
and regiments, when they will be armed. They say "no time is to 
be lost, the danger is great." The Mayor, in his document, warns 
the people in time to avoid the fate of New Orleans. He says 
the enemy is advancing on the city, and may assail it before Mon- 
day morning. This is Saturday. The third proclamation is by 
E. B. Robinson, one of my printers, twenty years ago, at Wash- 
ington. He calls upon all natives of Maryland and the District 
of Columbia to report to him, and he will lead them against the 
enemy, and redeem them from the imputation of skulking or dis- 
loyalty cast upon poor refugees by the flint-hearted Shylocks of 
Richmond, who have extorted all their money from them. 

Besides these inflammatory documents, the militia colonels have 
out notices for all men under forty-five years of age to meet in 
Broad Street to-morrow, Sunday. 

I learn, however, that there are some 25,000 or 30,000 of the 
enemy at Yorktown; but if we can get together 12,000 fighting 
men, in the next twenty-four hours, to man the fortifications, there 
will not be much use for the militia and the clerks of the depart- 
ments, more than as an internal police force. But I am not quite 
sure we can get that number. 

JUNE 28TH. By order of Brig.-Gen. Gr. W. Custis Lee, the 
department companies were paraded to-day, armed and equipped. 
These, with the militia in the streets (armed by the government to- 
day), amounted to several thousand efficient men for the batteries 
and for guard duty. They are to rendezvous, with blankets, pro- 
visions, etc., upon the sounding of the tocsin. I learn that 8000 
men in the hospitals within convenient reach of the city, including 
those in the city, can be available for defense in an emergency. 
They cannot march, but they can fight. These, with Hill's divi- 
sion, will make over 20,000 men; an ample force to cope with the 
enemy on the Peninsula. It has been a cool, cloudy day (we have 
had copious rains recently), else the civilians could not have stood 
several hours exercise so well. A little practice will habituate 
them by degees to the harness of war. No one doubts that they 
will fight, when the time for blows arrives. Gen. Jenkins has just 
arrived, with his brigade, from the south side of the James River. 

I was in the arsenal to-day, and found an almost unlimited 
amount of arms. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 3G3 

We get not a word from Gen. Lee. This, I think, augurs well, 
for bad news flies fast. No doubt we shall soon hear something 
from the Northern papers. They are already beginning to magnify 
the ravages of our army on their soil : but our men are incapable 
of retaliating, to the full extent, such atrocities as the following, 
on the Blackwater, near Suffolk, which I find in the Petersburg 
Express: 

"Mr. Smith resided about one mile from the town, a well-to-do 
farmer, having around him an interesting family, the eldest one a 
gallant young man in the 16th Virginia Regiment. When Gen. 
Longstreet invested Suffolk a sharp artillery and infantry skirmish 
took place near Mr. Smith's residence, and many balls passed 
through his house. The Yankees finally advanced and fired the 
houses, forcing the family to leave. Mrs. Smith, with her seven 
children, the youngest only ten months old, attempted to escape 
to the woods and into the Confederate lines, when she was fired 
upon by the Yankee soldiers, and a Minie-ball entering her limb 
just below the hip, she died in thirty minutes from the loss of 
blood. The children, frightened, hid themselves in the bushes, 
while Mr. Smith sat down upon the ground by his wife, to see her 
breathe her last. After she had been dead for some time, the 
Yankee commander permitted him to take a cart, and, with no 
assistance except one of his children, he put the dead body in the 
cart and carried it into the town. On his arrival in town, he was 
not permitted to take the remains of his wife to her brother's resi- 
dence until he had first gone through the town to the Provost 
Marshal's office and obtained permission. On his arrival at the 
Provost Marshal's office, he was gruffly told to take his wife to the 
graveyard and bury her. He carried her to her brother's, John 
R. Kilby, Esq., and a few friends prepared her for burial; Mr. 
Kilby not being allowed to leave the house, or to attend the re- 
mains of his sister to the graveyard. 

"Nor did the cruelty of the fiends stop here. Mr. Smith was 
denied the privilege of going in search of his little children, and 
for four days and nights they wandered in the woods and among 
the soldiers without anything to eat or any place to sleep. The 
baby was taken up by a colored woman and nursed until some pri- 
vate in the Yankee army, with a little better heart than his associ- 
ates, took it on his horse and carried it to town. Mr. Smith is 



364 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

still in the lines of the enemy, his house and everything else he had 
destroyed, and his little children cared for by his friends. 

"Will not the Confederate soldiers now in Pennsylvania remem- 
ber such acts of cruelty and barbarism ? Will not the Nansemond 
companies remember it ? And will not that gallant boy in the 
16th Regiment remember his mother's fate, and take vengeance on 
the enemy ? Will not such a cruel race of people eventually reap 
the fruit of their doings ? God grant that they may." 

SUNDAY AFTERNOON. There are two reports of important 
events current in the streets: first, that Lee's army has taken 
and destroyed Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; and second, that Yicks- 
burg has fallen. I am not prepared to credit either, although the 
first is said to be true by no less a person than Gov. Letcher. And 
yet one or both may be confirmed to-morrow; and if so, that is, if 
Vicksburg has fallen, and Lee should retire, as he must sooner or 
later, there will be a dark and desponding season in the Confed- 
eracy. But the war will go on. 

JUNE 29TH. There is no confirmation of the report of the fall 
of Vicksburg, but it may be so ; nor is it certain that we have 
advanced to Harrisburg, but it is probable. 

Gen. D. H. Hill writes (on Saturday) from Petersburg that 
40,000 of the enemy could not take Richmond; but this may be 
fishing for the command. He says if Gen. Dix comes this way, 
he would make him a subject of the cartel of exchange which he 
(Dix) had a hand in negotiating. 

J. M. Botts writes, from his farm in Culpepper, that our men 
are quartered on his premises, and do as much injury as a hostile 
army could. He is neutral. They pay him ten cents per day for 
the grazing of each horse. 

The Commissary- General is again recommending the procuring 
of bacon from within the enemy's lines, in exchange for cotton. 
Why not get meat from the enemy's country for nothing? 

Hon. R. M. T. Hunter writes to the Secretary of War to let 
the Quartermaster-General alone, that he is popular with Con- 
gress, and that his friends are active. It might be dangerous to 
remove him ; the President had better commission him a brigadier- 
general. He says Judge Campbell wants the President to go to 
Mississippi ; this, Mr. H. is opposed to. Mr. H. is willing to 
trust Johnston, has not lost confidence in him, etc. And he tells 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 365 

the Secretary to inform the President how much he (H.) esteems 
him (the President). 

The New York Times publishes an account of one of their raids 
on the Peninsula, below this city, as follows: 

"Within the past three days a most daring raid has been made 
into one of the richest portions of the enemy's country, and the 
success was equal to the boldness of the undertaking. 

" The expedition, which was conducted by both land and water, 
was commanded by Col. Kilpatrick. It started from the head- 
quarters of Gen. Keyes on Wendesday, and returned yesterday. 
In the interim the Counties of Matthews and Gloucester were 
scoured. All the warehouses containing grain were sacked, the 
mills burned, and everything that could in any way aid the rebels 
were destroyed or captured. Three hundred horses, two hundred 
and fifty head of cattle, two hundred sheep, and one hundred 
mules, together with a large number of contrabands, were brought 
back by the raiders. . 

" The rebel farmers were all taken by surprise. They had not 
expected a demonstration of the kind. Not only were they made 
to surrender everything that could be of the least use to us, but 
they were compelled to be silent spectators to the destruction of 
their agricultural implements." 

No doubt we shall soon have some account in the Northern 
papers of our operations in this line, in their country. 

JUNE 30in. Dispatches from the West show that we still 
held Vicksburg at the last dates; and, moreover, Gen. Taylor 
(son of Zachary Taylor) had stormed and taken the enemy's fortifi- 
cations at Berwick's Bay, with the bayonet. We took 1000 pris- 
oners, 10 large cannon, and many stores. Also that we had taken 
Thibbodauxville, and have thus cut off Banks from New Orleans. 

5 O'CLOCK P.M. The city is now in good humor, but not wild 
with exultation. We have what seems pretty authentic intelli- 
gence of the taking of HARRISBURG, the capital of Pennsylvania, 
the City of YORK, etc. etc. This comes on the flag of truce boat, 
and is derived from the enemy themselves. Lee will not descend 
to the retaliation instigated by petty malice ; but proclaim to the 
inhabitants that all we desire is PEACE, not conquest. 

From Vicksburg we have further information that, in springing 
his mine, Grant destroyed hundreds of his own men, and did us 

31* 



3fifi A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

no injury. Also that a battery we have above Yicksburg had fired 
into some passing transports, doing great damage to life and boats. 
The troops landed, and failed to take the battery by assault, losing 
hundreds in addition. 



CHAPTER XXYIII. 

Enemy threatening Richmond. The city is safe. Battle of Gettysburg. 
Great excitement. - Yankees in great trouble. Alas! Vicksburg has 
fallen. President is sick. Grant marching against Johnston at Jack- 
son. Fighting at that place. Yankees repulsed at Charleston. Lee and 
Meade facing each other. Pemberton surrenders his whole army. Fall 
of Port Hudson. Second class conscripts called for. Lee has got back 
across the Potomac Lincoln getting fresh troops. Lee writes that he 
cannot be responsible if the soldiers fail for want of food. Rumors of 
Grant coming East. Pemberton in bad odor. Hon. W. L. Yancey is dead. 

JULY IST. The intelligence of the capture of Harrisbnrg and 
York, Pa., is so far confirmed as to be admitted by the < flficers of 
the Federal flag of truce boat that came up to City Point yes- 
terday. 

Of the movements of Hooker's army, we have the following in- 
formation : 

" HEADQUARTERS, CAVALRY DIVISION, 
"June 27th, 1863. 

"GENERAL: I took possession of Fairfax C. H. this morning 
at nine o'clock^ together with a large quantity of stores. The main 
body of Hooker's army has gone toward Leesburg, except the 
garrison of Alexandria and Washington, which has retreated 
within the fortifications. 

"Yery respectfully, 

" Your obedient servant, 

" J. E. B. STUART, Major- General." 

The Northern papers say that our cruiser Tacony, taken from 
them, has destroyed twenty-two of their vessels since the 12th inst; 
but that our men burnt her at last. Her crew then entered Port- 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 367 

land, Maine, and cnt out the steam cutter Caleb Gushing, which 
they subsequently blew up, and then were themselves taken pris- 
on er. 

The President has decided that the obstructions below the city 
shall not be opened for the steam iron-clad Richmond to go out, 
until another iron-clad be in readiness to accompany her. 

Capt. Maury, at Mobile, writes that the two iron-clads, Trent 
and Nashville, now ready for sea, might take New Orleans and 
keep it. The President directs the Secretary of War to consult 
the Secretary of the Navy, and if they agreed, the attempt should 
be made without loss of time. So, probably, we shall have news 
from that quarter soon. 

The militia and Department Guard (soon to be called the Na- 
tional Guard, probably) were notified to-day to be in readiness at 
a minute's warning. It is said positively that Dix is advancing 
toward the city. Well, let him come. 

JULY SD. The President is unwell again ; to what extent I 
have not learned. But the Vice-President is ready, no doubt, to 
take his place in the event of a fatal result ; and some would re- 
joice at it. Such is the mutability of political affairs ! 

The Attorney- General Watts, being referred to, sends in a writ- 
ten opinion that foreigners sojourning here, under the protection 
of the Confederate States, are liable to military duty, in defense 
of their homes, against any government but the one to which they 
claim to owe allegiance. This I sent in to the Secretary of War, 
and I hope he will act on it ; but the Assistant Secretary and Mr. 
Benjamin were busy to-day perhaps combating the Attorney- 
General's opinion. Will Mr. Seddon have the nerve to act? It 
is a trying time, and every man is needed for defense. 

The enemy were drawn up in line of battle this morning below 
the fortifications. The Department Guard (my son Custis among 
them) were ordered out, and marched away ; and so with the 
second class militia. A battle is looked for to-morrow ; and there 
has been skirmishing to-day. A dispatch from Hanover Court 
House says the enemy is approaching likewise from the north in 
large force and 15 guns. This is his great blunder. He cannot 
take Richmond, nor draw back Lee, and the detachment of so 
many of his men may endanger Baltimore and Washington, and 
perhaps Philadelphia. 



368 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

JULY 3o. My son Custis stayed out all night, sleeping on his 
arms in the farthest intrenchments. A little beyond, there was 
a skirmish with the enemy. We lost eight in killed and wounded. 
What the enemy suffered is not known, but he fell back, and ran 
toward the White House. 

This morning, Mr. Quid, agent for exchange of prisoners, re- 
ported that "not a Yankee could be found on the face of the 
earth." And this induced a general belief that the enemy had 
retired, finally, being perhaps ordered to Washington, where they 
may be much needed. 

The Secretary of War, believing the same thing, intimated to 
Gen. Elzey (who for some cause is unable to ride, and therefore 
remains in the city) a desire to send several regiments away to 
some menaced point at a distance. In response, Elzey writes that 
none can be spared with safety ; that the enemy had apparently 
divided his force into two bodies, one for Hanover, and the other 
for the Chickahominy, and both strong ; and he advised against 
weakening the forces here. He said he had not yet completed the 
manning of the batteries, the delay being in arming the men and 
he hoped " Hill could hold out." 

We have 3400 convalescents at Camp Lee, and as many more 
may be relied on for the defense of the city; so we shall have not 
less than 22,000 men for the defense of Richmond. The enemy 
have perhaps 35,000 ; but it would require 75,000 to storm our 
batteries. Let this be remembered hereafter, if the 35,000 sent here 
on a fool's errand might have saved Washington or Baltimore, or 
have served to protect Pennsylvania and then let the press of the 
North bag the administration at Washington ! Gen. Lee's course 
is "right onward," and cannot be affected by events here. 

My friend Jacques (clerk) marched out yesterday with the De- 
partment Guard ; but he had the diarrhoea, and was excused from 
marching as far as the company. He also got permission to come 
to town this morning, having slept pretty well, he said, apart 
from the company. No doubt he did good service in the city to- 
day, having his rifle fixed (the ball, I believe, had got down before 
the powder), and procuring a basket of edibles and a canteen of 
strong tea, which he promised to share with the mess. He said 
he saw Custis this morning, looking well, after sleeping on the 
ground the first time in his life, and without a blanket. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL.- 369 

We have nothing further from the North or the West. 
JULY 4TH. The Department Guard (my son with them) were 
marched last night back to the city, and out to Meadow Bridge, 
on the Chickahominy, some sixteen miles ! The clerks, I under- 
stand, complain of bad meat (two or three ounces each) and 
mouldy bread ; and some of them curse the authorities for fraudu- 
lent deception, as it was understood they would never be marched 
beyond the city defenses. But they had no alternative the Sec- 
retaries would report the names of all who did not volunteer. 
Most of the poor fellows have families dependent on their salaries 
for bread being refugees from their comfortable homes, for the 
cause of independence. If removed, their wives and little chil- 
dren, or brothers and sisters, must perish. They would be con- 
scribed, and receive only $1 2 per month. 

My friend Jacques did not return to the company yesterday, after 
all, although I saw him get into an ambulance with a basket of 
food. He got out again, sending the basket to Mr. K., the young 
chief of the bureau, and Judge Campbell allowed him to remain. 

Mr. Myers the lawyer is much with Judge Campbell, working 
for his Jew clients, who sometimes, I am told, pay $1000 each to 
be got out of the army, and as high as $500 for a two months' de- 
tail, when battles are to be fought. Mr. M. thinks he has law for 
all he does. 

A letter from Gen. D. H. Hill shows that it was his intention 
to bring on a battle on the 2d inst, but the enemy fled. It was 
only a feint below ; but we may soon hear news from Hanover 
County. 

Col. Gorgas (ordnance) writes that as his men are marched out 
to defend the city, he can't send much ammunition to Gen. Lee ! 

A letter from Lieut-Gen. E. Kirby Smith, dated June 15th, 
shows he was at Shreveport, La., at that date. 

The poor militia were allowed to return to their homes to-day ; 
but an hour after the tocsin sounded, and they were compelled to 
assemble and march again. This is the work of the Governor, 
and the Secretary of War says there was no necessity for it, as 
Confederate troops here now can defend the city, if attacked. 

JULY STH. This morning the wires refused to work, being cut, 
no doubt, in Hanover County. 

The presence of the enemy in this vicinity, I think, since they 



370 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

refuse to fight, is designed to prevent us from sending more troops 
into Pennsylvania. I trust the President will think of this mat- 
ter, if he is well enough ; some of his generals here are incapable 
of thinking at all. 

We have just received intelligence of a great battle at Gettys- 
burg, Pennsylvania. I have not heard the day ; but the news 
was brought by flag of truce boat to City Point last night. The 
Yankee papers, I am told, claim a victory, but acknowledge a loss 
of five or six generals, among them Meade, commander-in-chief 
(vice Hooker), mortally wounded. But we still held the town, 
and "actions speak louder than words." 

More troops are marching up into Hanover County. 

JULY GTH. Yesterday evening we received Baltimore and 
New York papers with accounts (and loose ones) of the battle of 
Gettysburg. The Governor of Pennsylvania says it was "inde- 
cisive," which means, as we read it, that Meade's army was de- 
feated. 

The forces (Federal) are withdrawing from the neighborhood 
of this city, another indication that Lee has gained a victory. 
Dix has done but little damage. In retreating from Hanover 
County, he burnt the bridges to retard pursuit. 

The "War Department Guard" have returned, my son among 
them, sun-burnt and covered with dust. They were out five days 
and four nights, sleeping on the ground, without tents or blankets, 
and with little or nothing to eat, although the Commissary-Gen- 
eral "had abundance. The President, however, is better to-day, 
and able to get out of bed ; but his health is apparently gone, and 
it may be doubtful whether he will ever be quite well again. 

The Yice-President went down to the flag of truce boat on 
Saturday, some say to Fortress Monroe, and others to Washing- 
ton. It is surmised that he is authorized by the President to have 
a definitive understanding with the Federal authorities, whether 
or not private property is to be respected hereafter in the future 
progress of the war. If not, Gen. Lee will have orders to desolate 
the Northern States, where he has the power. Some, however, 
think he goes to Washington, to propose terms of peace, etc. 

There is a rumor in the city, generally credited, that another 
battle was fought in Pennsylvania on Friday, and that the enemy 
was annihilated ; these rumors sometimes assume form and sub- 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 371 

stance, and this one, as if by some sort of magnetism, is credited 
by many. It is certain that Mr. Morris, superintendent of the 
telegraph office, has called upon his friends for the largest Con- 
federate flag in the city to hang out of his window. He says 
nothing more ; but he may have sent dispatches to the President, 
which he is not at liberty to divulge. There may be later news 
from Lee ; or Yicksburg may be relieved ; or New Orleans taken ; 
or an armistice ; or nothing. 

I am glad my son's company were ordered in to-day ; for, after 
a week of fine fair weather, it is now raining furiously. This would 
have prostrated the lender boys with illness. 

JULY TTH. It appears that the fighting near Gettysburg began 
on Wednesday, July 1st, continued until Sunday, the 5th, and 
perhaps longer. Up to Friday the Northern papers claim the 
advantage. 

This morning at 1 P.M. another dispatch was received from the 
same (unofficial) source, stating that on Sunday the enemy made 
a stand, and A. P. Hill's corps fell back, followed by the enemy, 
when Longstreet's and Ewell's corps closed in their rear and cap- 
tured 40,000 prisoners who are now guarded by Pickett's divi- 
sion. It states that the prisoners refused to be paroled. This 
might possibly be true. 

This account is credited. Col. Custis Lee, from the President's 
office, was in my office at half-past two P.M. to-day, and said nothing 
had been received from his father yet but he did not deny that 
such accounts might be substantially true. 

The President still keeps his eye on Gen. Beauregard. A paper 
from the general to Gen. Cooper, and, of course, referred to the 
President, in relation to the means of defense in his department, 
and a call for more guns, was sent back to-day, indorsed by the 
President, that by an examination of the report of Gen. Huger, 
he thought some discrepancies would appear in the statements of 
Gen. B. Thus, it would seem, from a repetition of similar impu- 
tations, the President has strong doubts of Gen. B.'s accuracy of 
statements. He is quick to detect discrepancies. 

Gen. D. H. Hill sends in a characteristic letter. He says the 
rivers are all swollen, and he can make no movement to-day in 
pursuit of Dix's army of the Pamunky or rather "the monkey 
army." He says that the Brook" e Pike outer defenses are so de- 



372 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

fective in design, that a force there could be driven off in five 
minutes by the enemy's sharpshooters. He wants them amended, 
and a certain grove cut down and recommends that engineers be 
put to work, with orders to leave their "kid gloves behind." He 
thinks more is to be apprehended from an attack on Petersburg 
than Richmond; and requests that Gen. Wise be ordered to march 
thither from Chaffin's Bluff, on the first alarm. He had not heard 
of the reported victory of Lee. 

JULY STH. I am glad to copy the following order of Gen. 
Lee: 

" HEADQUARTERS ARMY NORTHERN VIRGINIA, 
" CHAMBERSBURG, PA., June 27th, 1863. 

"GENERAL ORDERS No. 73. 

" The commanding general has observed with marked satisfac- 
tion the conduct of the troops on the march, and confidently an- 
ticipates results commensurate with the high spirit they have 
manifested. No troops could have displayed greater fortitude, or 
better performed the arduous marches of the past ten days. Their 
conduct in other respects has, with few exceptions, been in keeping 
with their character as soldiers, and entitles them to approbation 
and praise. 

" There have, however, been instances of forgetfulness on the 
part of some, that they have in keeping the yet unsullied reputa- 
tion of the army, and that the duties exacted of us by civilization 
and Christianity are not less obligatory in the country of the enemy 
than in our own. 

"The commanding general considers that no greater disgrace 
could befall the army, and through it, our whole people, than the 
perpetration of the barbarous outrages upon the innocent and de- 
fenseless, and the wanton destruction of private property, that have 
marked the course of the enemy in our own country. Such pro- 
ceedings not only disgrace the perpetrators and all connected with 
them, but are subversive of the discipline and efficiency of the 
army and destructive of the ends of our present movements. It 
must be remembered that we make war only upon armed men, and 
that we cannot take vengeance for the wrongs our people have 
suffered without lowering ourselves in the eyes of all whose abhor- 
rence has been excited by the atrocities of our enemy, and offend- 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 373 

ing against Him to whom vengeance belongeth, without whose 
favor and support our efforts must all prove in vain. 

"The commanding general, therefore, earnestly exhorts the 
troops to abstain with most scrupulous care from unnecessary or 
wanton injury to private property ; and he enjoins upon all officers 
to arrest and bring to summary punishment all who shall in any 
way offend against the orders on this subject. 

" R. E. LEE, General." 

We have no additional news from the battle-field, except the fol- 
lowing dispatch from Winchester : 

" Our loss is estimated at 10,000. Between 3000 and 4000 of our 
wounded are arriving here to-night. Every preparation is being 
made to receive them. 

"Gens. Scales and Fender have arrived here wounded, this 
evening. Gens. Armistead, Barksdale, Garnett, and Kemper are 
reported killed. Gens. Jones, Heth, Anderson, Pettigrew, Jen- 
kins, Hampton, and Hood are reported wounded. 

" The Yankees say they had only two corps in the fight on 
Wednesday, which was open field fighting. The whole of the 
Yankee force was engaged in the last three days' fighting. The 
number is estimated at 175,000. 

" The hills around Gettysburg are said to be covered with the 
dead and wounded of the Yankee Army of the Potomac. 

" The fighting of these four days is regarded as the severest of 
the war, and the slaughter unprecedented ; especially is this so of 
the enemy. 

" The New York and Pennsylvania papers are reported to have 
declared for peace." 

But the absence of dispatches from Gen. Lee himself is begin- 
ning to create distrust, and doubts of decisive success at Gettys- 
burg. His couriers may have been captured, or he may be delay- 
ing to announce something else he has in contemplation. 

The enemy's flag of truce boat of yesterday refused to let us 
have a single paper in exchange for ours. This signifies some- 
thing I know not what. One of our exchanged officers says he 
heard a Northern officer say, at Fortress Monroe, that Meade's loss 
was, altogether, 60,000 men; but this is not, of course, reliable. 

32 



374 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

Another officer said Lee was retiring, which is simply impossible, 
now, for the flood. 

But, alas ! we have sad tidings from the West. Gen. Johnston 
telegraphs from Jackson, Miss., that Vicksburg capitulated on the 
4th inst. This is a terrible blow, and has produced much de- 
spondency. 

The President, sick as he is, has directed the Secretary of War 
to send him copies of all the correspondence with Johnston and 
Bragg, etc., on the subject of the relief of Pemberton. 

The Secretary of War has caught the prevailing alarm at the 
silence of Lee, and posted off to the President for a solution but 
got none. If Lee falls back again, it will be the darkest day for 
the Confederacy we have yet seen. 

JULY 9Tii. The sad tidings from Vicksburg have been con- 
firmed by subsequent accounts. The number of men fit for duty 
on the day of capitulation was only a little upwards of 7000. 
Flour was selling at $400 per barrel ! This betrays the extremity 
to which they had been reduced. 

A dispatch to-day states that Grant, with 100,000 men (sup- 
posed), is marching on Jackson, to give Johnston battle. But John- 
ston will retire he has not men enough to withstand him, until he 
leads him farther into the interior. If beaten, Mobile might fall. 

We have no particulars yet no comments of the Southern 
generals under Pemberton. But the fall of the place has cast a 
gloom over everything. 

The fall of Vicksburg, alone, does not make this the darkest day 
of the war, as it is undoubtedly. The news from Lee's army is 
appalling. After the battle of Friday, the accounts from Martins- 
burg now state, he fell back toward Hagerstown, followed by the 
enemy, fighting but little on the way. Instead of 40,000 we have 
only 4000 prisoners. How many we have lost, we know not. 
The Potomac is, perhaps, too high for him to pass it and there 
are probably 15,000 of the enemy immediately in his rear ! Such 
are the gloomy accounts from Martinsburg. 

Our telegraph operators are great liars, or else they have been 
made the dupes of spies and traitors. That the cause has suffered 
much, and may be ruined by the toleration of disloyal persons 
within our lines, who have kept the enemy informed of all our 
movements, there can be no doubt. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 3f5 

The following is Gen. Johnston's dispatch announcing the fall 
of Vicksburg : 

"JACKSON, July 7th, 1863. 

" HON. J. A. SEDDON, SECRETARY OF WAR. 

"Vicksburg capitulated on the 4th inst. The garrison was 
paroled, and are to be returned to our lines, the officers retaining 
their side-arms and personal baggage. 

" This intelligence was brought by an officer who left the place 

on Sunday, the 5th. 

" J. E. JOHNSTON, General." 

We get nothing from Lee himself. Gen. Cooper, the Secretary 
of War, and Gen. Hill went to the President's office about one 
o'clock. They seemed in haste, and excited. The President, too, 
is sick, and ought not to attend to business. It will kill him, per- 
haps. 

There is serious anxiety now for the fate of Richmond. Will 
Meade be here in a few weeks ? Perhaps so but, then, Lee may 
not have quite completed his raid beyond the Potomac. 

The Baltimore American, no doubt in some trepidation for 
the quiescence of that city, gets up a most glowing account of 
"Meade's victory" if it should, indeed, in the sequel, prove to 
have been one. That Lee fell back, is true; but how many men 
were lost on each side in killed, wounded, and prisoners how 
many guns were taken, and what may be the result of the opera- 
tions in Pennsylvania and Maryland of which we have as yet 
such imperfect accounts will soon be known. 

JULY 10TH. This is the day of fate and, without a cloud 
in the sky, the red sun, dimly seen through the mist (at noonday), 
casts a baleful light on the earth. It has been so for several 
days. 

Early this morning a dispatch was received from Gen. Beaure- 
gard that the enemy attacked the forts in Charleston harbor, and, 
subsequently, that they were landing troops on Morris Island. 
Up to 3 o'clock we have no tidings of the result. But if Charleston 
falls, the government will be blamed for it since, notwithstanding 
the remonstrances of Gen. B., the government, members of Con- 
gress, and prominent citizens, some 10,000 of his troops were 
away to save Vicksburg. 



37 fi A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

About one o'clock to-day the President sent over to the Secre- 
tary of War a dispatch from an officer at Martinsburg, stating 
that Gen. Lee was still at Hagerstown awaiting his ammunition 
(has not Col. Gorgas, Chief of Ordnance, been sufficiently vigi- 
lant ?) which, however, had arrived at the Potomac. That all the 
prisoners (number not stated), except those paroled, were at the 
river. That nothing was known of ike enemy but that cavalry 
fighting occurred every day. He concluded by saying he did not 
know whether Lee would advance or recross the river. If he 
does the latter, in ray opinion there will be a great revulsion of 
feeling in the Confederate States and in the United States. 

Another dispatch, from Gen. J. E. Johnston, dated yesterday, 
at Jackson, Miss., stated that Grant's army was then within four 
miles of him, with numbers double his own. But that he would 
hold the city as long as possible, for its fall would be the loss of 
the State. I learn a subsequent dispatch announced that fighting 
had begun. I believe Johnston is intrenched. 

To-day Mr. Secretary Seddon requested Attorney-General 
Watts, if he could do so consistent with duty, to order a nolle 
prosequi in the District Court of Alabama in the case of Ford, 
Hurd & Co. for trading with the enemy. Gen. Pemberton had 
made a contract with them, allowing them to ship cotton to New 
Orleans, and to bring back certain supplies for the army. But 
Mr. Attorney- General Watts replied that it was not consistent 
with his duty to comply, and therefore he demurred to it, as the 
act they were charged with was in violation of the act of Congress 
of April 19th, 1862. 

We lost twelve general officers in the fall of Vicksburg one 
lieutenant-general, four major-generals, and seven brigadiers. 

Dispatches from Jackson, Miss., say the battle began yesterday, 
but up to the time of the latest accounts it had not become gen- 
eral. Johnston had destroyed the wells and cisterns, and as there 
are no running streams in the vicinity, no doubt Grant's army will 
suffer for water, if the defense be protracted. 

From Charleston we learn that we lost in yesterday's combat 
some 300 men, killed and wounded the enemy quite as many. 
This morning the Yankees assaulted the battery on Morris Island, 
and were repulsed in two minutes, with a loss of 95 killed and 130 
wounded, besides prisoners. Our loss was five, killed and wounded. 
Nothing further was heard up to 7 o'clock P.M. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 377 

From Lee we have no uews whatever. 

A letter from Governor Vance, of North Carolina, complains of 
an insult offered by Col. Thorburn (of Virginia), and asking that 
he be removed from the State, and if retained in service, not to be 
permitted to command North Carolinians. The Governor, by per- 
mission of Gen. Whiting, proceeded down the river to a steamer 
which had just got in (and was aground) from Europe, laden with 
supplies for the State ; but when attempting to return was stopped 
by Col. T., who said it was against the rules for any one to pass 
from the steamer to the city until the expiration of the time pre- 
scribed for quarantine. The Governor informed him of his special 
permission from Gen. Whiting and the Board of Navigation and 
yet the colonel said he should not pass for fifteen days, "if he was 
Governor Vance or Governor Jesus Christ." The President in- 
dorsed on this letter, as one requiring the Secretary's attention, 
"if the case be as stated." 

Again the blockade-runners are at their dirty work, and Judge 
Campbell is "allowing" them. < To-day Col. J. Gorgas, who is 
daily in receipt of immense amounts of ordnance stores from Eu- 
rope by government steamers, recommends that passports be given 
N. H. Rogers and L. S. White to proceed North for supplies. 
This is a small business. It is no time to apply for passports, and 
no time to grant them. 

We now know all about the mission of Vice-President Stephens 
under flag of truce. It was ill-timed for success. At Washington 
news had been received of the defeat of Gen. Lee which may yet 
prove not to have been "all a defeat." 

JULY 12TH. There is nothing additional this morning from 
Charleston, Mississippi, or Maryland. Telegraphic communica- 
tion is still open to Jackson, where all was quiet again at the last 
accounts ; but battle, then, must occur immediately. From Charles- 
ton we learn that Beauregard had repulsed every assault of the 
enemy. It is rumored that Lee's account of the battle of Gettys- 
burg will be published to-morrow, showing that it was the "most 
brilliant and successful battle of, the war." I hope he may say so 
for then it will be so. 

Our papers are publishing Milroy's papers captured at Win- 
chester. 

JULY 13TH. The Enquirer says the President has got a letter 

32* 



378 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

from Gen. Lee (why not give it to the people ?) stating that his 
operations in Pennsylvania and Maryland have been successful 
and satisfactory, and that we have now some 15,000 to 18,000 
prisoners, besides the 4000 or 5000 paroled. Nonsense ! 

Lee and Meade have been facing each other two or three days, 
drawn up in battle array, and a decisive battle may have occurred 
ere this. The wires have been cut between Martinsburg and 
Hagerstown. 

Not another word have we from either Charleston or Jackson ; 
but we learn that monitors, gun-boats, and transports are coming 
up the James River. 

Altogether, this is another dark day in our history. It has been 
officially ascertained that Pemberton surrendered, with Vicksburg, 
22,000 men ! He has lost, during the year, not less than 40,000 ! 
And Lovell (another Northern general) lost Fort Jackson and 
New Orleans. When will the government put "none but South- 
erners on guard ?" 

Letters to-day from the Governors of South Carolina, Alabama, 
and North Carolina show that all are offended at the Confederate 
government. Judge Campbell's judicial profundity (and he is the 
department's correspondent) is unfortunate at this crisis, when, not 
great principles, but quick and successful fighting, alone can serve. 

It appears that President Lincoln has made a speech in Wash- 
ington in exultation over the fall of Yicksburg, and the defeat of 
an army contending against the principle that all men were created 
equal. He means the negro we mean that white men were created 
equal that we are equal to Northern white people, and have a 
right, which we do not deny to them, of living under a government 
of our own choice. 

JULY HTH. To day we have tidings of the fall of Port Hudson, 
on the Mississippi River, our last stronghold there. I suppose 
some 10,000 or 12,000 of our men had to surrender, uncondi- 
tionally. Thus the army of Gen. Pemberton, first and last, some 
50,000 strong, has been completely destroyed. There is sadness 
and gloom throughout the land ! . 

The enemy are established on Morris Island, and the fate of 
Charleston is in doubt. 

We have nothing authentic from Gen. Lee ; but long trains of 
the slightly wounded arrived yesterday and to-day. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 379 

It has been raining, almost every day, for nearly two weeks. 

The President is quite amiable now. The newspaper editors 
can find easy access, and he welcomes them with smiles. 

A letter was received to-day from a Major Jones, saying he was 
authorized to state that the Messrs. , engine-makers in Phila- 
delphia, were willing to remove their machinery to the South, being 
Southern men. The President indorsed that authority might be 
given for them to come, etc. 

Gen. Beauregard writes for a certain person here skilled in the 
management of torpedoes but Secretary Mallory says the enemy's 
gun boats are in the James River, and he cannot be sent away. I 
hope both cities may not fall I 

A heavy thunder-storm, accompanied with a deluging rain, pre- 
vails this afternoon at 5^ o'clock P.M. 

JULY 15TH. There was a rumor of another battle beyond the 
Potomac, this morning, but it has not been confirmed. 

From Charleston we have no news ; but from Jackson there has 
been considerable fighting, without a general engagement. 

The Enquirer and Sentinel to-day squint at a military dictator- 
ship ; but President Davis would hardly attempt such a feat at 
such a time. 

Gen. Samuel Jones, Western Virginia, has delayed 2000 men 
ordered to Lee, assigning as an excuse the demonstrations of the 
enemy in the Kanawha Valley. " Off with his head so much for 
Buckingham 1" 

There is some gloom in the community ; but the spirits of the 
people will rebound. 

A large crowd of Irish, Dutch, and Jews are daily seen at Gen. 
Winder's door, asking permission to go North on the flag of truce 
boat. They fear being forced into the army ; they will be com- 
pelled to aid in the defense of the city, or be imprisoned. They 
intend to leave their families behind, to save the property they 
have accumulated under the protection of the government. 

Files of papers from Europe show that Mr. Roebuck and other 
members of Parliament, as well as the papers, are again agitating 
the question of recognition. We shall soon ascertain the real in- 
tentions of France and England. If they truly desire our success, 
and apprehend danger from the United States in the event of a 
reconstruction of the Union, they will manifest their purposes 



3^0 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

when the news of our recent calamities shall be transported across 
the ocean. And if such a thing as reconstruction were possible, 
and were accomplished (in such a manner and on such terms as 
would not appear degrading to the Southern people), then, indeed, 
well might both France and England tremble. The United States 
would have millions of soldiers, and the Southern people would 
not owe either of them a debt of gratitude. 

JULY 16TH. This is another blue day in the calendar. Nothing 
from Lee, or Johnston, or Bragg ; and no news is generally bad 
news. But from Charleston we learn that the enemy are estab- 
lished on Morris Island, having taken a dozen of our guns and 
howitzers in the sand hills at the lower end ; and that the monitors 
had passed the bar, and doubtless an engagement by land and by 
water is imminent, if indeed it has not already taken place. Many 
regard Charleston as lost. I do not. 

Again the Enquirer, edited by Mitchel, the Irishman, is urging 
the President to seize arbitrary power; but the Examiner combats 
the project defiantly. 

Mr. Secretary Seddon, who usually wears a sallow and cadaver- 
ous look, which, coupled with his emaciation, makes him resemble 
an exhumed corpse after a month's interment, looks to-day like a 
galvanized corpse which had been buried two months. The. circles 
round his eyes are absolutely black ! And yet he was pacing 
briskly backward and forward between the President's office and 
the War Department. He seems much affected by disasters. 

The United States agent of exchange has sent a notice to our 
agent that the negroes we capture from them in battle must be 
exchanged as other soldiers are, according to the cartel, which 
said nothing about color ; and if the act of Congress in relation to 
such soldiers be executed, the United States would retaliate to the 
utmost extremity. 

Captains H. W. Sawyer and John Flinn, having been designated 
by lot for execution in retaliation for two of our captains executed 
by Gen. Burnside for recruiting in Kentucky, write somewhat lugu- 
briously, in bad grammar and execrable chirography, that, as they 
never served under Burnside, they should not be made to suffer for 
his deed. They say we have two of Burnside's captains at Atlanta 
(and they give their names) who would be the proper victims. 

I saw a paper to-day, sent to the department, with a list of the 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 381 

United States officers at Memphis who are said to have taken 

bribes ; among them is Col. H r, of Illinois, Provost Marshal 

General (Grant's staff); Col. A , Illinois, ex-Provost Mar- 
shal; Capt. W , Illinois, Assistant Provost Marshal; Capt. 

C (Gen. Herbert's staff), and "Dan Ross," citizen of Illinois, 

procurer. 

On the 9th instant Gen. D. H. Hill (now lieutenant-general, and 
assigned to Mississippi) asks if troops are to be sent to cover Lee's 
retreat; and fears, if the enemy establish themselves at Winchester, 
they will starve Lee to death. Speaking of the raid of the enemy 
to the North Carolina Railroad, he said they would do the State 
infinite service by dashing into Raleigh and capturing all the mem- 
bers of the legislature. He also hits at the local newspapers here. 
Their mention of his name, and the names of other officers in the 
campaign round Richmond, informed the enemy that we had no 
troops at Goldsborough and Weldon, and hence the raid. And, 
after all, he says the enemy were not more numerous than our forces 
in the recent dash at Richmond. He says it was no feint, but a 
faint. 

To-day an order was issued for the local troops to deliver up 
their ammunition. What does that mean ? 

And to-day the President calls for the second class of conscripts, 
all between eighteen and forty- five years of age. So our reserves 
must lake the field! 

JULY 17TH. At last we have the authentic announcement that 
Gen. Lee has recrossed the Potomac ! Thus the armies of the 
Confederate States are recoiling at all points, and a settled gloom 
is apparent on many weak faces The fall of Charleston is antici- 
pated. Subjugation is not apprehended by the government; for, 
if driven to an interior line of defense, the war may be prolonged 
indeSnitely, or at least until the United States becomes embroiled 
with some European power. 

Meantime we are in a half starving condition. I have lost 
twenty pounds, and my wife and children are emaciated to some 
extent. Still, I hear no murmuring. 

To-day, for the second time, ten dollars in Confederate notes 
are given for one in gold ; and no doubt, under our recent disas- 
ters, the depreciation will increase. Had it not been for the stu- 
pidity of our Dutch Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Memminger, 



382 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

there would have been no financial difficulties. If he had recom- 
mended (as he was urged to do) the purchase by the government 
of all the cotton, it could have been bought at 7 cents per pound ; 
and the profits alone would have defrayed the greater portion of 
the expenses of the war, besides affording immense diplomatic 
facilities and advantages. But red-tape etiquette, never violated 
by the government, may prove our financial ruin beyond redemp- 
tion. It costs this government five times as much to support an 
army as it does the United States ; and the call for conscripts is a 
farce, since the speculators (and who is not one now ?) will buy 
exemptions from the party who, strangely, have the authority to 
grant them. 

The last accounts from Jackson state that Burnside is reinforc- 
ing Grant, and that heavy skirmishing is going on daily. But all 
suppose that Johnston must retreat. And Bragg is in no condition 
to face Rosecrans. 

Whether Lee will come hither or not, no one knows; but some 
tremble for the fate of Richmond. Lee possibly may cross the 
Potomac again, however, if Meacle detaches a heavy force to cap- 
ture Richmond. 

What our fate would be if we fall into the hands of the invader, 
may be surmised from the sufferings of the people in New Orleans. 

JULY 18TH. Lee has got over the Potomac with a loss, in 
crossing, of 1500 ; and Johnston has abandoned Jackson, Miss. 

But we have awful good news from New York: an INSURREC- 
TION, the loss of many lives, extensive pillage and burning, with a 
suspension of the conscription ! 

Gen. Morgan is in the enemy's country. 

JULY 19TH. We have no news this morning. But a rumor 
prevails, which cannot be traced to any authentic source, that 
Texas has put herself under the protection of France. It is sig- 
nificant, because public sentiment seems to acquiesce in such a 
measure; and I have not met with any who do not express a wish 
that it may be so. Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas are now 
isolated, and no protection or aid can be given them by the gov- 
ernment here; and it is natural, after the fall of New Orleans 
and Vicksburg, for the people to hope that the invaders may be 
deprived of their prey just at the moment when they anticipated a 
realization of its enjoyment. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 383 

Hon. Wm. Porcher Miles writes that, after consultation, the offi- 
cers have decided that it would be impracticable to hold Morris 
Island, even if the enemy were driven from it at the point of the 
bayonet. Therefore they call loudly for Brooke guns of long 
range, and guns of large calibre for Sumter, so that the fort may 
prevent the enemy from erecting batteries in breaching distance. 
They say, in their appeal, that since the fall of Vicksburg there is 
no other place (but one) to send them. They are now idle in 
Richmond. I understand the Secretary of War, etc. are in con- 
sultation on the subject, and I hope the President will, at last, 
yield to Gen. Beauregard's demands. 

Gen. Maury also writes for guns and ordnance stores for the 
defense of Mobile, which may be attacked next. He will get 
them. 

If the insurrection in New York lives, and resistance to con- 
scription should be general in the North, our people will take fresh 
hope, and make renewed efforts to beat back the mighty armies of 
the foe suffering, and more than decimated, as we are. 

But if not if Charleston and Richmond and Mobile should 
fall, a peace (submission) party will spring up. Nevertheless, the 
fighting population would still resist, retiring into the interior 
and darting out occasionally, from positions of concentration, at 
the exposed camps of the enemy. 

JULY 20TH. Nothing from Lee or from Johnston, except that 
the latter has abandoned Jackson. From Bragg's army, I learn 
that a certain number of regiments were moving from Chattanooga 
toward Kuoxville and I suspect their destination is Lee's army. 

But we have a dispatch from Beauregard, stating that he has 
again repulsed an attack of the enemy on the battery on Morris 
Island with heavy loss perhaps 1500 while his is trifling. 

A thousand of the enemy's forces were in Wytheville yesterday, 
and were severely handled by 130 of the home guards. They did 
but little injury to the railroad, and burned a few buildings. 

An indignant letter has been received from the Hon. W. Porcher 
Miles, who had applied for a sub-lieutenancy for Charles Porcher, 
who had served with merit in the 1st South Carolina Artillery, 
and was his relative. It seems that the President directed the 
Secretary to state that the appointment could not be given him 
because he was not 21 years of age. To this Mr. M. replies that 



384 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

several minors in the same regiment have been appointed. I 
think not. 

Governor Brown writes a long letter, protesting against the de- 
cision of the Confederate States Government, that the President 
shall appoint the colonel for the 51st Georgia Regiment, which the 
Governor says is contrary to the Confederate States Constitution. 
He will resist it 

A Mrs. Allen, a lady T)f wealth here, has been arrested for 
giving information to the enemy. Her letters were intercepted. 
She is confined at the asylum St. Francis de Sales. The surgeon 
who attends there reports to-day that her mental excitement will 
probably drive her to madness. Her great fear seems to be that 
she will be soon sent to a common prison. There is much indig- 
nation that she should be assigned to such comfortable quarters 
and I believe the Bishop (McGill) protests against having crimi- 
nals imprisoned in his religious edifices. It is said she has long 
been sending treasonable letters to Baltimore but the authorities 
do not have the names of her letter-carriers published. No doubt 
they had passports. 

A letter from Lee's army says we lost 10,000 in the recent bat- 
tle, killed, wounded, and prisoners. We took 11,000 prisoners 
and 11 guns. 

Thank Heaven ! we have fine weather after nearly a month's rain. 
It may be that we shall have better fortune in the field now. 

Some of the bankers had an interview with the government to- 
day. Unless we can achieve some brilliant success, they cannot 
longer keep our government notes from depreciating, down to five 
cents on the dollar. They are selling for only ten cents now, in 
gold. In vain will be the sale of a million of government gold in 
the effort to keep it up. 

Gen. Morgan, like a comet, has shot out of the beaten track of 
the army, and after dashing deeply into Indiana, the last heard of 
him he was in Ohio, near Cincinnati. He was playing havoc 
with steam-boats, and capturing fine horses. He has some 3000 
men we cannot afford to lose but I fear they will be lost. 

JULY 21sT. We have intelligence to-day, derived from a New 
York paper of the 18th inst., that the "insurrection" in New 
York had subsided, under the menacing attitude of the military 
authority, and that Lincoln had ordered the conscription law to 
be enforced. This gives promise of a long war. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 385 

Mr. Mallory sent a note to the Secretary of War to-day (which 
of course the Secretary did not see, and will never hear of) by a 
young man named Juan Boyle, asking permission for B. to pass 
into Maryland as an agent of the Navy Department. Judge 
Campbell indorsed on the back of it (to Brig. -Gen. Winder) that 
permission was "allowed" by "order." But what is this "agent" 
to procure in the United States which could not be had by our 
steamers plying regularly between Wilmington and Europe ? 

JULY 22D. Col. Northrop, Commissary-General, sends in a 
paper to-day saying that only a quarter of a pound of meat per day 
can be given the soldiers, except when marching, and then only 
half a pound. He says no more can be derived from the trans- 
Mississippi country, nor from the State of Mississippi, or Ten- 
nessee, and parts of Georgia and Alabama ; and if more than the 
amount he receives be given the soldiers, the negroes will have to 
go without any. He adds, however, that the peasants of Europe 
rarely have any meat, and in Hindostan, never. 

' Col. Bradley T. Johnson, who commanded a brigade at Gettys- 
burg, writes that on the first day we carried everything before us, 
capturing 8000 prisoners and losing but few men ; the error was 
in not following up the attack with all our forces immediately, and 
in not having sufficient ammunition on the field. 

The newspapers to-day contain pretty accurate accounts of the 
battle. 

JULY 23D. We have the following dispatch from Gen. Beaure- 
gard, which is really refreshing in this season of disasters : 

" CHARLESTON, July 22d, 1863. 

" The enemy recommenced shelling again yesterday, with but 
few casualties on our part. We had, in the battle of the 18th 
inst., about 150 killed and wounded. The enemy's loss, including 
prisoners, was about 2000. Nearly 800 were buried under a flag 
of truce. 

" Col. Putnam, acting brigadier-general, and Col. Shaw, com- 
manding the negro regiment, were killed. 

"(Signed) G. T. BEAUREQARD, General." 

It is said the raiders that dashed into Wytheville have been 

33 



386 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

taken ; but not so with the raiders that have been playing havoc 
with the railroad in North Carolina. 

Another letter from J. M. Botts, Culpepper County, com- 
plains of the pasturing of army horses in his fields bfefore the Get- 
tysburg campaign, and asks if his fields are to be again subject 
to the use of the commander of the army, now returning to his 
vicinity. If he knows that Gen. Lee is fallen back thither, it is 
more than any one here seems to know. We shall see how accu- 
rate Mr. B. is in his conjecture. 

A letter from Mr. Goodman, president of Mobile and Charleston 
Railroad, says military orders have been issued to destroy, by fire, 
railroad equipments to the value of $5,000,000; and one-third of 
this amount of destruction would defeat the purpose of the enemy 
for a long time. The President orders efforts to be made to bring 
away the equipments by sending them down the road. 

Col. Preston, commandant of conscripts for South Carolina, has 
been appointed Chief of the Bureau of Conscription ; hennas ac- 
cepted the appointment, and will be here August 1st. The law will 
now be honestly executed if he be not too indolent, sick, etc. 

Archbishop Hughes has made a speech in New York to keep 
down the Irish. 

JULY 24TH. Nothing from Lee, or Johnston, or Beauregard, 
or Bragg but ill luck is fated for them all. Our ladies, at least, 
would not despair. But a day may change the aspect; a brilliant 
success would have a marvelous effect upon a people who have so 
long suffered and bled for freedom. 

They are getting on more comfortably, I learn, on- the Eastern 
Shore of Virginia. Only about 25 of the enemy's troops are said 
to be there, merely to guard the wires. In the Revolutionary 
war, and in the war of 1812, that peninsula escaped the horrors 
of war, being deemed then, as now, too insignificant to attract the 
cupidity of the invaders. 

The Secretary of the Treasury sent an agent a few weeks ago 
with some $12,000,000 for disbursement in the trans-Mississippi 
country, but he has returned to this city, being unable to get 
through. He will now go to Havana, and thence to Texas ; and 
hereafter money (if money it can be called) will be manufactured 
at Houston, where a paper treasury will be established. 

Gen. Jos. E. Johnston has recently drawn for $20,000 in gold. 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 387 

A letter from the Commissary-General to Gen. Lee states that 
we have but 1,800,000 pounds of bacon at Atlanta, and 500,000 
pounds in this city, which is less than 30 days' rations for Bragg's 
and Lee's armies. He says all attempts to get bacon from Europe 
have failed, and he fears they will fail, and hence, if the ration be 
not reduced to \ pound we shall soon have no meat on hand. 
Gen. Lee says he cannot be responsible if the soldiers fail for want 
of food. 

JULY 25TH. Gen. Beauregard telegraphs that preparations 
should be made to withstand a bombardment at Savannah, and au- 
thority is asked, at the instance of Gov. Brown, to impress a suffi- 
cient number of slaves for the purpose. 

Gen. Jos. E. Johnston telegraphs the President that Grant has 
fallen back to Vicksburg, and, from information in his possession, 
will not stay there a day, but will proceed up the river. Gen. 
Johnston asks if this eccentric movement does not indicate a pur- 
pose to concentrate the enemy's forces for the reduction of Rich- 
mond.. 

Grant's men, no doubt, objected to longer service at this season 
in the Southwest ; perhaps Lincoln thinks Grant is the only gen- 
eral who can take Richmond, or it may be necessary for the pres- 
ence of the army in the North to enforce the draft, to overawe 
conspirators against the administration, etc. We shall soon know 
more about it. 

Misfortunes come in clusters. We have a report to-day that 
Gen. Morgan's command has been mostly captured in Ohio v The 
recent rains made the river nnfordable. 

It appears that Gen. Pemberton had but 15 days' rations to last 
48 days, that the people offered him a year's supply for nothing 
if he would have it, and this he would not take, red tape requiring 
it to be delivered and paid for, o it fell into the hands of the 
enemy. He had a six months' supply of ammunition when he 
surrendered, and often during the siege would not let his men reply 
to the enemy's guns. 

Advertisers in the papers offer $4000 for substitutes. One offers 
a farm in Hanover County, on the Central Railroad, of 230 acres, 
for a substitute. There is something significant in this. It was 
so in France when Napoleon had greatly exhausted the male pop- 
ulation. 



388 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

JULY 26TH. Letters were received to-day from Gens. Beaure- 
gard, Mercer, Whitney, and S. Jones. 

It appears that Beanregard has some 6000 men of all arms, and 
that the enemy's force is estimated to be, or to have been (before 
losing some 3000), about 10,000. It is true the enemy has the 
benefit of his floating batteries, but we have our stationary ones. 
I think Charleston safe. 

Gen. Mercer squeaks for the fate of Savannah, unless the gov- 
ernment impresses slaves to work on the fortifications. All our 
generals squeak when an attack is apprehended, for the purpose of 
alarming the government, and procuring more men and material, 
so as to make success doubly sure. 

And Gen. Whiting is squeaking loudly for the impressment of 
a thousand slaves, to complete his preparations for defense; and if 
he does not get them, he thinks the fall of Wilmington a pretty sure 
thing. 

And Gen. Jones squeaks from the West, asking that the 3000 
infantry he was at last compelled to send to Gen. Lee, near Win- 
chester, be returned to him to oppose the enemy's raids. But what 
were they sent to Lee for, unless he meant to give battle ? Such 
may be his intention, and a victory now is demanded of him to 
place him rectus in curio. 

Beauregard says Fort Wagner, which has made such a success- 
ful defense on Morris Island, was located by Gen. Pemberton, and 
this is evidence of some military skill. But all the waters of 
Lethe will not obliterate the conviction of the people that he gave 
his army in the West to the enemy. If be had not been Northern 
born, they would have deemed him merely incompetent. Hence 
the impolicy of the government elevating Northern over Southern 
generals. All generals are judged by the degree of success they 
achieve, for success alone is considered the proof of merit, and one 
disaster may obliterate the memory of a dozen victories. Even 
Lee's great name is dimmed somewhat in the estimation of fools. 
He must beat Meade before Grant comes up, or suffer in reputa- 
tion. 

Gov. Bonham has demanded the free negroes taken on Morris 
Island, to be punished (death) according to the State law. 

JULY 27TH. Nothing but disasters to chronicle now. Natchez 
and Yazoo City, all gone the way of Vicksburg, involving a heavy 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 389 

loss of boats, guns, and ordnance stores ; besides, the enemy have 
got some twenty locomotives in Mississippi. 

Lee has retreated as far as Culpepper Court House. 

The President publishes another proclamation, fixing a day for 
the people to unite in prayer. 

The weather is bad. With the exception of one or two bright 
days, it has been raining nearly a month. Superadded to the ca- 
lamities crowding upon us, we have a rumor to-day that Gen. Lee 
has tendered his resignation. This is false. But it is said he is 
opposed to the retaliatory executions ordered by the President, 
which, if persisted in, must involve the life of his son, now in the 
hands of the enemy. Our officers executed by Burnside were 
certainly recruiting in Kentucky within the lines of the enemy, and 
Gen. Lee may differ with the President in the equity of executing 
officers taken by us in battle in retaliation. 

JULY 28TH. The rumor that Gen. Lee had resigned was simply 
a fabrication. His headquarters, a few days ago, were 'at Cul- 
pepper C. H., and may be soon this side of the Rappahannock. A 
battle and a victory may take place thefe. 

Col. J. Gorgas, I presume, is no friend of Pemberton ; it is not 
often that Northern men in our service are exempt from jealousies 
and envyings. He sends to the Secretary of War to-day a remark- 
able statement of Eugene Hill, an ordnance messenger, for whom 
he vouches, in relation to the siege and surrender of Vicksburg. It 
appears that Hill had been sent here by Lieut. -Gen. Holmes for 
ammunition, and on his way back to the trans- Mississippi country, 
was caught at Yicksburg, where he was detained until after the 
capitulation. He declares that the enemy's mines did our works 
no more injury than our mines did theirs ; that when the surrender 
took place, there were an abundance of caps, and of all kinds of 
ordnance stores ; that there were 90,000 pounds of bacon or salt 
meat unconsumed, besides a number of cows, and 400 mules, 
grazing within the fortifications ; and that but few of the men even 
thought of such a contingency as a surrender, and did not know 
it had taken place until the next day (5th of July), when they were 
ordered to march out and lay down their arms. He adds that Gen. 
Pemberton kept himself very close, and was rarely seen by the 
troops, and was never known to go out to the works until he went 
out to surrender. 



390 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY 

Major-Gen. D. Maury writes from Mobile, to the President, that 
he apprehends an attack from Banks, and asks instructions relative 
to the removal of 15,000 non-combatants from the city. He says 
Forts Gaines and Morgan are provisioned for six months, and that 
the land fortifications are numerous and formidable. He asks for 
20,000 men to garrison them. The President instructs the Sec- 
retary, that when the purpose of the enemy is positively known, it 
will be time enough to remove the women, children, etc.; but that 
the defenses should be completed, and everything in readiness. 
But where the 20,000 men are to come from. is not stated perhaps 
from Johnston. 

JULY 2^TH. Still raining! The great fear is that the crops 
will be ruined, and famine, which we have long been verging upon, 
will be complete. Is Providence frowning upon us for our sins, or 
upon our cause ? 

Another battle between Lee and Meade is looked for on the 
Upper 'Rappahannock. 

Gov. Harris, in response to the President's call for 6000 men, 
says Western and Middle Tennessee are in the hands of the enemy, 
and that about half the people in East Tennessee sympathize with 
the North ! 

Some two or three hundred of Morgan's men have reached 
Lynchburg, and they believe Morgan himself will get off, with many 
more of his men. 

The New York Herald's correspondent, writing from Wash- 
ington on the 24th inst., says the United States ministers in Eng- 
land and France have informed the government of the intention 
of those powers to intervene immediately in our behalf; and that 
they will send iron-clad fleets to this country without delay. 
Whereupon the Herald says Mr. Seward is in favor of making 
peace with us, and reconstructing the Union pardoning us but 
keeping the slaves captured, etc. It is a cock-and-bull story, per- 
haps, without foundation. 

JULY 30TH. Raining still ! Lee's and Meade's armies are 
manoeuvring and facing each other still ; but probably there will 
be no battle until the weather becomes fair, and the gushing waters 
in the, vales of Culpepper subside. 

From Charleston we learn that a furious bombardment is going 
on, the enemy not having yet abandoned the purpose of reducing 



AT THE CONFEDERATE STATES CAPITAL. 391 

the forts and capturing the city. Mr. Miles calls londly for rein- 
forcements and heavy cannon, and says the enemy was reinforced 
a few days since. 

An indignant letter was received from Gov. Vance to-day, in 
response to the refusal of the government and Gen. Lee to permit 
him to send with the army a newspaper correspondent to see that 
justice was done the North Carolina troops. He withdraws the 
application, and appeals to history for the justice which (he says) 
will never be done North Carolina troops in Virginia by their as- 
sociates. He asserts also that Gen. Lee refused furloughs to the 
wounded North Carolinians at the battle of Chancellorville (one- 
half the dead and wounded being from North Carolina), for fear 
they would not return to their colors when fit for duty ! 

Hon. Wm. L. Yancey is dead of disease of the kidney. The 
Examiner, to-day, in praising him, made a bitter assault on the 
President, saying he was unfortunately and hastily inflicted on 
the Confederacy at Montgomery, and when fixed in position, ban- 
ished from his presence the heart and brain of the South denying 
all participation in the affairs of government to the great men who 
were the authors of secession, etc. 

JULY 31 ST. Hon. E. S. Dargan, member of Congress, writes 
from Mobile that Mississippi is nearly subdued, and Alabama is 
almost exhausted. He says our recent disasters, and Lee's failure 
in Pennsylvania, have nearly ruined us, and the destruction must 
be complete unless France and England can be induced to inter- 
fere in our behalf. He never believed they would intervene unless 
we agreed to abolish slavery ; and he would embrace even that 
alternative to obtain their aid. He says the people are fast losing 
all hope of achieving their independence ; and a slight change of 
policy on the part of Lincoln (pretermitting confiscation, I sup- 
pose) would put an end to the revolution and the Confederate 
States Government. Mr. D. has an unhappy disposition. 

Mr. L. Q. Washington recommends Gen. Winder to permit Mr. 
Wm. Matthews, just from California, to leave the country. Gen. 
W. sends the letter to the Assistant Secretary of War, Judge 
Campbell, who "allows" it; and the passport is given, without 
the knowledge of the President or the Secretary of War. 

The news from Mexico (by the Northern papers) is refreshing 
to our people. The " notables" of the new government, under the 



392 A REBEL WAR CLERK'S DIARY. 

auspices of the French General, Forey, have proclaimed the States 
an Empire, and offered the throne to Maximilian of Austria ; and 
if he will not accept, they "implore" the Emperor of France to 
designate the one who shall be their Emperor. Our people, very 
many of them, just at this time, would not object to being included 
in the same Empire. 

The President is still scrutinizing Beauregard. The paper read 
from the general a few days since giving a statement of his forces, 
and the number of the enemy, being sent to the President by the 
Secretary of War, was returned to-day with the indorsement, that 
he hoped "a clearer comprehension of the cause," in the promised 
further report of the general, would be given " why the enemy ap- 
proached Morris Island before being observed." So, omitting all 
notice of the defense (so far) of the batteries, etc., the attention 
of the President seems fixed on what the general omitted to do ; 
or what he might, could, or should have done.
